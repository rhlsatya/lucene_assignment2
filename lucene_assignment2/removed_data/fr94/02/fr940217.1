Interim Relief

ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is publishing a proposed change to regulations reflecting administrative
case law on taking personnel actions to provide interim relief under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. These
changes also reflect OPM's initiative to sunset the Federal Personnel Manual.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA), Public Law 101-12 codified at 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A), provided
that prevailing parties in an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) shall be granted the relief provided
in the decision, and remaining in effect pending the outcome of any petition for review. OPM published final regulations
on this subject in the 

Federal Register

 on January 31, 1992 (57 FR 3707-3715). The final regulations authorized agencies to take interim personnel
actions to provide a prevailing applicant or employee the interim relief ordered in an MSPB initial decision. Interim
personnel actions include, but are not limited to, interim appointments, interim repromotions after demotions,
and interim within-grade increases.



After these regulations were published, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) issued an administrative decision
in 

Leonard Ginocchi

 v. 

Department of Treasury

, DC315I8910527, February 19, 1992, which explained MSPB's interpretation of the WPA with regard to interim relief.
In 

Ginocchi,

 the Board ruled that it would not look behind the agency's determination under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A) that returning
an employee to the workplace would be unduly disruptive. It also held that an agency making a determination of undue
disruption did not have to keep the employee on excused absence (administrative leave), but could place the employee
in other duties. OPM believes this facet of 

Ginocchi

 is a reasonable and persuasive interpretation of the WPA. Since this interpretation is inconsistent with a portion
of OPM's regulations (which was based on a more restrictive interpretation), OPM is proposing to delete that portion
of the regulations_section 772.102(d). This change will help reduce any confusion by practitioners before the Board
about their respective rights and responsibilities regarding interim relief.

In addition, OPM notes that guidance on preparing official documentation to effect an interim personnel action is
currently located in Federal Personnel Manual Supplement 296-33. The current regulations provide that interim
relief actions need to be prepared in accordance with that guidance and other guidance contained in FPM Chapter 296.
Consistent with OPM's initiative to sunset the FPM, OPM proposes to delete references in the regulation to the FPM.



E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation



OPM has determined that this is not a major rule as defined under Section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because it applies only to Federal employees.

Management Official Interlocks


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION

: Notice of proposed rulemaking.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is proposing to amend its regulations that implement the Depository
Institution Management Interlocks Act (Interlocks Act or Act). The Interlocks Act generally prohibits certain
management official interlocks between depository institutions, depository holding companies, and their affiliates.
The proposed amendment would create limited exemptions to the prohibition on management official interlocks between
certain depository organizations located in the same community or relevant metropolitan statistical area (RMSA).
These exemptions would permit management official interlocks between depository organizations that together
control only a small percentage of the total deposits in the community or RMSA. These exemptions are based on the Board's
belief that these management interlocks would not threaten to inhibit or restrict competition among depository
organizations. In addition, the Board is soliciting comment generally on revisions to the existing Interlocks Act
regulations that the Board should consider, including the addition of other exemptions. The Board also is proposing
amendments to implement certain provisions of the Management Interlocks Revision Act of 1988.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




Background_Exemptions to the Interlocks Act


The general purpose of the Interlocks Act is to foster competition among depository organizations
 by prohibiting certain management interlocks that might contribute to anticompetitive practices. The primary
concern is that interlocking management may enable certain depository institutions to control the flow and availability
of credit in the markets in which they operate.



The Act prohibits a management official of a depository organization from serving at the same time as a management
official of an unaffiliated depository organization located in the same community
 or RMSA.
 12 U.S.C. 3202. Congress designated RMSAs as appropriate regions within which to restrict management interlocks
because RMSAs are ``economic trade areas and reflect the area in which financial institutions compete.'' S. Rep.
No. 323, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 14 (1977).







In the Interlocks Act, Congress authorized the Federal depository institutions regulatory agencies (the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of Thrift Supervision,
the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, hereinafter the ``Agencies'')
to implement rules and regulations to carry out the Act, including rules or regulations which permit service by a management
official that would otherwise be prohibited by the Act. 12 U.S.C. 3207. The legislative history of the Act indicates
that the Agencies may exercise this rulemaking authority to exempt management official interlocks that otherwise
might be prohibited by the statute if they establish that the exemption has a pro-competitive effect. H.R. Rep. No.
1383, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 15 (1978).
Pursuant to this rulemaking authority, the Board, along with the other Agencies, previously established exceptions
for institutions located in low- and moderate-income areas, minority- and/or women-owned organizations, newly-chartered
institutions, and institutions facing conditions endangering their safety and soundness. 

See

 12 CFR 212.4(b). These exceptions are all available on a temporary basis upon a demonstration that the exempted management
official interlock is necessary to provide management or operating expertise to the requesting institution.
The Agencies are publishing their proposed rule notices separately. The Board now seeks comment on a proposal to establish
additional exemptions from the prohibitions of the Act. These exemptions would be available to depository organizations
that between them control a small percentage of deposits in a community or RMSA. The Board also proposes an amendment
to exempt honorary and advisory directors that serve institutions with less than $100 million in assets from the definition
of a ``management official'' in the Interlocks Act. This change is consistent with a provision of the Management Interlocks
Revision Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-650, 102 Stat. 3819 (1988)).
In addition to the proposed new exemption to the Interlocks Act, the Board, together with the other Federal depository
institutions regulatory agencies, is considering a more comprehensive revision of the regulations implementing
the statute. Any such revision would seek to simplify the regulations, revise existing exemptions, and consider
new exemptions that would foster competition in relevant RMSAs and communities and thus minimize unnecessary regulatory
burden while still fulfilling the requirements of the Interlocks Act. The Board therefore is using this notice of
proposed rulemaking as an opportunity to solicit additional comment on the question of the improvement of its Interlocks
Act regulations.


The Small Market Share Exemption


The Interlocks Act prevents two competing institutions from conspiring through common management officials to
adversely impact competition in the products and services they offer. Where two depository institutions dominate
a large portion of the market, these risks are real. But when a particular market is served by many institutions, the
risks diminish that two depository institutions with interlocking management can adversely affect the credit products
and services available in their market.
The Board believes that analysis of the combined deposit holdings of two institutions provides a meaningful assessment
of the capacity of the two institutions to control credit and related services in their market. This proposal reflects
the view that two depository institutions that control a small portion of the market they serve are not capable of exerting
sufficient market influence to materially restrict the terms and availability of credit in their market. For institutions
located in a RMSA, the RMSA constitutes the relevant market.
Some depository institutions compete in smaller markets either within or outside of RMSAs. The Interlocks Act provides
that the relevant market for these organizations and organizations with total assets of $20 million or less that are
located within a RMSA, is the city, town, or village and contiguous and adjacent areas in which the organizations are
located. 12 U.S.C. 3202.


The Proposal


The Board is proposing to amend the management interlocks regulations to permit two depository organizations that
serve the same RMSA to share management officials in circumstances where organizations control a small portion of
the deposits in that market. Specifically, this proposal would permit two competing depository organizations,
each with assets in excess of $20 million, to share management officials if the organizations together control no
more than 20 percent of the deposits in the RMSA. Additionally, the depository organizations could control no more
than 20 percent of the deposits in any other RMSA whether they compete directly, through offices, or through affiliated
depository institutions.
Under the proposal, depository organizations located in RMSAs would look to appropriate deposit share data available
from the relevant Federal Reserve Bank in order to determine whether they are entitled to the exemption in reliance
upon this information. Depository institutions would not have to apply to the appropriate Federal depository institution
regulatory agency for permission to engage in the interlock.
The Board would treat management interlocks between institutions with assets of less than $20 million that are located
within an RMSA and all depository institutions located outside of an RMSA in a similar manner. Specifically, the amendment
would exempt any management interlock between two depository organizations located in a community, as defined by
 212.2 of the regulation, if the depository organization's combined share of the total deposits in the community is
no more than 20 percent. Similarly, to be exempt, the organizations may not together control more than 20 percent of
the deposits in any community in which they or their depository institution affiliates are located.
The proposal would provide an exemption only if management interlocks between the two organizations are not otherwise
prohibited by the Act. For example, 12 U.S.C. 3203 provides that a depository institution or a depository holding
company with assets in excess of $1 billion may not enter into a management interlock with a depository institution
or a depository holding company with assets in excess of $500 million. No exemption would be available for interlocks
that fall within this prohibition. The exemption is effective as long as the organizations meet the conditions. If
the level of deposit control exceeds 20 percent of deposits in the community or RMSA, as measured annually, the depository
organizations shall have up to 15 months to address the prohibited interlock by shrinking the deposit base, terminating
the interlock, or taking any other action to correct the violation.
No prior Board approval is required. The exemption is intended to be self-implementing. Management is responsible
for compliance with the terms of the exemption and maintaining sufficient supporting documentation.


Determining Deposit Share of the Relevant Market


Using the total deposit data reported by depository institutions to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
in the Summary of Deposits addendum to the Report of Condition and Income, the depository organizations will determine
for themselves whether the exemption is available. The FDIC compiles the collected deposit data into a summary and
makes the deposit summary available annually. The FDIC's annual deposit summary breaks-out the total deposits of
every insured depository institution by branch.
 This deposit data can be sorted by RMSA, and by community as that term is defined by the Act, to provide to depository
organizations the necessary information to determine deposit share by the relevant market.



The FDIC provides this deposit summary to each of the Agencies. Under the proposal, the Board will make the deposit
data available to all bank holding companies and state member banks.
 Each of the Agencies will make the same data available to the other depository organizations. The process would involve
neither an application nor an approval from any of the Agencies but, the burden of determining the applicability of
the exemption falls upon the depository organizations that seek it. Depository organizations located in an RMSA
would simply look to the deposit share data for the total deposits of the RMSA. Then, both interlocking depository
organizations would determine whether their combined share of the total deposits exceeds 20 percent. If the combined
share of deposits is no more than 20 percent of the market, the interlock is exempt.



The Board intends this exemption to be available to community-based depository organizations in the same manner
as for organizations whose relevant market is the RMSA. However, while the deposit share data can be pre-sorted and
made readily available by RMSA, the deposit share data cannot be pre-sorted by community. For example, two community-based
depository organizations seeking to rely on the small market share exemption must first determine the total deposits
in their community. To do this, the depository organizations must request deposit share data from the Board with sufficient
specificity to delineate the community defined by the Interlocks Act that both the interlocking institutions will
serve. Only then can they calculate the portion of the deposits in the market that they would be deemed to control if
they engage in the interlock.
Whether within or outside of an RMSA, the depository organizations will be required to retain records supporting
the applicability of the exemption, and to reconfirm, on an annual basis, that the interlock is eligible for the exemption.
The most recent deposit share data made available to the depository organizations by the Agencies will determine
whether organizations are entitled to the small market share exception. When new data demonstrates that the two interlocking
institutions' combined control of deposits exceeds 20 percent of deposits in the community or RMSA, the affected
depository organizations have up to 15 months to correct the prohibited interlock.


Pro-competitive Results


The Board believes this proposal will have a pro-competitive effect. Since the deposit base of the exempted interlocking
institutions is small, the risk of anticompetitive control over the market is remote. To provide to these particular
institutions this limited relief from the management interlock restrictions enlarges the pool of experienced management
talent upon which they may draw and enhances their operational effectiveness. The result will be better managed,
more competitive, and healthier depository institutions. 


Request for Comment


In addition to any relevant comments on this proposal, the Board specifically requests comment on the following:
1. Whether 20 percent or less of the deposits of a community or RMSA is an appropriate threshold for the exemption, or
whether a different level is more appropriate. 
2. Should the community and RMSA exemptions rely on the same or a different threshold level?
3. Should the exemption require depository organizations to demonstrate that they control no more than 20 percent
of the deposits of communities within an RMSA? For example, if two depository organizations with more than $20 million
in assets operate in a community within a RMSA, should the exemption require that the depository organizations control
no more than 20 percent of the deposits in the community and no more than 20 percent of the deposits in the RMSA? Consider
depository organizations that compete in several communities within a RMSA.
4. Whether and how the proposed procedure to employ the deposit data collected by the FDIC in connection with the Report
of Condition and Income will permit depository organizations to determine easily and effectively whether they qualify
for the small market share exception. 
5. Whether the exemption for community-based institutions will be easy to use, or whether these institutions might
be better served by another approach to the exemption.
6. Whether the exemption would enable depository organizations to subvert the purposes of the Interlocks Act by establishing
multiple interlocks involving several individuals. For example, the Board is concerned that each of several directors
of one depository organization could serve as a director of a different unaffiliated depository organization, facilitating
diminished competition among the several depository organizations. The Board seeks comment on whether this concern
is justified, and if so, whether it is exacerbated by the fact that the threshold limit for the exemption is set at 20
percent of the deposits in the RMSA or community, rather than a smaller percentage.
In addition to this proposal, the Board plans a comprehensive revision of the regulations implementing the Interlocks
Act. The Board intends to simplify the regulation, revise the interlocks prohibitions and exemptions, and consider
new exemptions that promote competition without fostering anticompetitive practices. The comprehensive revision
will eliminate unnecessary regulatory burden in a manner consistent with the Interlocks Act and the stated objectives
of the Board. 
Toward this end, the Board solicits comment on how to clarify and improve the entire rule in a manner consistent with
the Interlocks Act.


Paperwork Reduction Act


The collection of information contained in this proposed rule will be reviewed by the Board under Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) delegated authority pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). Comments regarding the accuracy of the burden estimate, and suggestions for reducing the burden, should be addressed
to Mr. William Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at the address noted above and should
refer to Docket No. R-0825.
The collection of information in this proposed rule is found in  212.4(d), and takes the form of records maintained
by depository organizations which are sufficient to support their determination that the interlocking relationships
which they have established are exempt under this section. Such depository organizations must also maintain records
which demonstrate that they have subsequently reconfirmed such determinations on an annual basis. The information
will be used to provide state and federal examiners of depository institutions with documentation which will allow
them to ascertain whether depository organizations are eligible for the exemption.
The estimated annual recordkeeping burden for the collection of information requirement in this proposed rule is
summarized as follows:



Number of Recordkeepers: 70
Annual Hours per Recordkeeper: 3
Total Recordkeeping Hours: 210


Regulatory Flexibility Act


Pursuant to Section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Board hereby certifies that this
proposed rule, if adopted as a final rule, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. The effect of the rule, if adopted as proposed, would be to reduce the compliance requirements imposed upon
small entities by creating a regulatory exemption to the prohibition on management interlocks between certain organizations.
Furthermore, the proposed exemption would affect only the management structure of only a few institutions.

ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to de Havilland DHC-6 series
airplanes. The proposed action would require repetitively inspecting the horizontal stabilizer center hinge bracket
for cracks, and replacing any cracked center hinge bracket. Several reports of cracks in the horizontal stabilizer
center hinge bracket flange on the affected airplanes prompted the proposed action. The actions specified by the
proposed AD are intended to prevent separation of the elevator control support from the airplane as a result of a cracked
horizontal stabilizer center hinge bracket, which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.

Discussion 


Transport Canada, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition
may exist on de Havilland DHC-6 series airplanes. Transport Canada reports that the horizontal stabilizer
center hinge bracket has cracked on several of the above referenced airplanes. 
De Havilland has issued Service Bulletin (SB) 6/512, dated October 25, 1991, which specifies procedures for (1) inspecting
the horizontal stabilizer center hinge bracket for cracks; and (2) replacing this center hinge bracket. Transport
Canada classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Transport Canada AD CF-92-05, dated
February 7, 1992, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada.

This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and 
is type certificated for operation in the United States 
under the provisions of  21.29 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral 
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral 
airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada has kept the 
FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA 
has examined the findings of Transport Canada, reviewed 
all available information, and determined that AD 
action is necessary for products of this type design 
that are certificated for operation in the United 
States. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
is likely to exist or develop in other de Havilland DHC-6 series airplanes of the same type design, the 
proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the 
horizontal stabilizer center hinge bracket for cracks, 
and replacing any cracked center hinge bracket. The 
proposed action would be accomplished in accordance 
with the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS section of de 
Havilland SB 6/512, dated October 25, 1991. 
The FAA estimates that 169 airplanes in the U.S. 
registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it 
would take approximately 1 workhour per airplane to 
accomplish the proposed inspection, and that the 
average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based 
on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed 
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $9,295. This 
figure only includes the cost for the initial 
inspection and does not include replacement costs if a 
center hinge bracket was found cracked nor does it 
include repetitive inspection costs. The FAA has no 
way to determine how many center hinge brackets may be 
cracked or how many repetitive inspections each 
owner/operator may incur. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
relationship between the national government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of 
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would 
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that 
this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory 
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if 
promulgated, will not have a significant economic 
impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number 
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory 
evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in 
the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by

The Proposed Amendment 


Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated 
to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation 
Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the 
Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: 


PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 


1. The authority citation for part 39 continues 
to read as follows: 





Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 
U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. 


 39.13

[Amended] 


2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the 
following new AD to read as follows: 






De Havilland:

 Docket No. 93-CE-52-AD. 





Applicability: 

Models DHC-6-1, DHC-6-100, DHC-6-200, 
and DHC-6-300 airplanes (all serial numbers), 
certificated in any category. 


Compliance: 

Required within the next 250 hours time-in-service 
(TIS), unless already accomplished, and 
thereafter at intervals not to exceed 1,200 hours TIS. 
To prevent separation of the elevator control 
support from the airplane as a result of a cracked 
horizontal stabilizer center hinge bracket, which could 
result in reduced controllability of the airplane, 
accomplish the following: 
(a) Inspect the horizontal stabilizer center hinge 
bracket for cracks in accordance with the 
ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS section of de Havilland 
Service Bulletin 6/512, dated October 25, 1991, except 
that where dye penetrant inspections are specified, 
accomplish visual inspections with a strong light 
source and 10X magnifying glass. If any cracks are 
found, prior to further flight, replace the center 
hinge bracket in accordance with the referenced service 
bulletin. 





Note 1:

 The repetitive inspection requirement of 
this AD still applies if the center hinge bracket is

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM). 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
recently became aware of an incident in England where 
the left main landing gear (MLG) collapsed on a Piper 
Aircraft Corporation (Piper) Model PA34-200T airplane 
because of swivel pin failure. At that time, the FAA 
found no service difficulty reports on airplanes of 
this type design that are certificated for operation in 
the United States. The FAA has since reviewed service 
difficulty reports of all Piper airplanes that have 
retractable MLG with the swivel pin configuration 
(certain PA24, PA28R, PA30, PA32R, PA32RT, PA34-200, 
PA34-200T, PA39, and PA44 series airplanes), and found 
two incidents of cracked swivel pins. The purpose of 
this advance notice is to seek comments from interested 
persons regarding the best action (if any) to take in 
order to correct any possible problems with retractable 
MLG swivel pins. All comments and ideas will be 
evaluated by the FAA and the FAA will research the 
situation to decide whether rulemaking is needed. 


</SUMMARY>

Discussion 


The FAA is currently investigating a possible 
unsafe condition on Piper PA24, PA28R, PA30, PA32R, 
PA32RT, PA34-200, PA34-200T, PA39, and PA44 series 
airplanes that have retractable main landing gear (MLG) 
with a swivel pin configuration. 
The MLG collapsed on a Piper Model PA34-200T 
airplane that is certificated for operation in England 
because of MLG swivel pin failure. At that time, the 
FAA found no service difficulty reports of this type on 
airplanes of this type design that are certificated for 
operation in the United States. The FAA has since 
reviewed service difficulty reports of all Piper 
airplanes that have retractable MLG with the swivel 
pin configuration (certain PA24, PA28R, PA30, PA32R, 
PA32RT, PA34-200, PA34-200T, PA39, and PA44 series 
airplanes), and found two incidents of swivel pin 
failure.

Discussions with operators that utilize these type 
airplanes under 14 CFR part 135 reveal that regular 
maintenance inspections require inspections in this 
area every 200 hours time-in-service (TIS), and that 
there have been no problems with the retractable MLG 
swivel pins. 
The inspection procedures in Piper's maintenance 
manual of the referenced airplanes calls for inspecting 
the MLG assembly every 100 hours TIS. The inspection 
procedures do not specifically address a teardown 
inspection of this assembly. At this time, the FAA has 
determined that there is no basis to establish a 
threshold or repetitive teardown inspection interval of 
this assembly based on the information obtained. 
In order to adequately make a determination as to 
what type of action to take (if any), the FAA is 
issuing this advance notice of proposed rulemaking 
(ANPRM) to provide an opportunity for the general 
public to participate in the decision whether to 
initiate rulemaking. Interested persons are encouraged 
to provide information that describes what they 
consider the best action (if any) to be taken to 
correct the possible problem. In this regard, the FAA 
is especially interested in comments and viewpoints on 
the following: 
1. How often do you have the retractable MLG 
swivel pins inspected and in what detail, i.e., visual, 
dye penetrant, etc.? 
2. Does the checklist in the procedures you 
utilize during the MLG swivel pin inspections include 
removal of the swivel pins? 
3. Have you ever replaced the swivel pin? 
a. If so, please list the hours TIS replaced 
and the reason why for each instance? 
b. If not, how many hours TIS have you 
accumulated on your airplane? 
4. Do you feel that the current inspection 
requirements are adequate, i.e., 14 CFR part 43, your 
checklist, Piper's maintenance manual, etc.? Please 
list any specific recommendations that you may have 
concerning current or future inspection requirements. 
5. Please include the model and serial number of 
your airplane, and the part number of the retractable 
MLG swivel pin with this correspondence. 
6. Please provide any other information that you 
feel is pertinent in helping the FAA determine what 
type of action (if any) needs to be taken. 
The following figure (Figure 1) depicts the 
retractable MLG assembly, including the swivel pin.

Large Trader Reporting System 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Securities and Exchange Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Reproposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission is reproposing Rule 13h-1 and Form 13H under Section 13(h) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(``Exchange Act''). Rule 13h-1 was initially proposed by the Commission in Exchange Act Release No. 29593 (August
22, 1991), 56 FR 42550 (August 28, 1991). Reproposed Rule 13h-1 would establish an activity-based identification,
recordkeeping, and reporting system for large trader accounts and transactions. Reproposed Rule 13h-1 also
would establish a definition for large traders and require such large traders to file Form 13H with the Commission.
Registered broker-dealers would be required to maintain transaction records for each large trader account and report
transactions upon the request of the Commission or a self-regulatory organization (``SRO'') designated by the Commission.
Reproposed Rule 13h-1 would fulfill the goals of the Market Reform Act of 1990 (``Market Reform Act'') by providing
the Commission with the information necessary to reconstruct trading activity in periods of market stress and for
enforcement or other regulatory purposes, without imposing undue burdens or costs on market participants. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Introduction 


The Commission is reproposing Rule 13h-1 to implement the large trader reporting provisions of the Market Reform
Act

1

 and section 13(h) of the Exchange Act.

2

 The Large Trader Reporting System that would be established by reproposed Rule 13h-1 was initially proposed
in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29593 (August 22, 1991), 56 FR 42550 (August 28, 1991) (``Proposing Release'').







The Proposing Release chronicled the fundamental changes in participants, information systems, and investment
techniques that have shaped the securities markets during the last decade.

3

 As a result of these changes, today's securities markets are global in nature and characterized by large foreign and
domestic investors that rapidly trade large quantities of securities, for themselves and others, throughout the
world. During this period of change, the securities markets have experienced an increase in activity and the potential
for volatility. 





The legislative history accompanying the Market Reform Act noted the Commission's limited ability to analyze the
causes of the significant market declines of October 1987 and 1989.

4

 The Commission's inability to analyze trading activity was attributed to its lack of specific statutory authority
to gather broad-based samples of investor trading information. To resolve this problem, Congress provided the Commission
with specific authority to establish a large trader reporting system. 





In the Proposing Release, the Commission proposed rules that defined the term large trader, required the disclosure
of a large trader's identity and accounts to the Commission or others, and provided for the assignment of unique identifying
numbers to large traders. The proposed rule also required broker-dealers that carry large trader accounts to maintain
records of identified large trader transactions as well as transactions of those persons who have not identified
themselves, but whom the broker-dealer knew or had reason to know were large traders. In addition, the proposed rule
required broker-dealers to report large trader transactions in machine-readable form through the industry's existing
electronic bluesheet system to the Commission upon request. 

The Commission solicited comments on various aspects of the proposed rule, including the definition of a large trader,
the identifying and reporting activity thresholds, exemptions, Form 13H filing requirements, execution time recordkeeping
and reporting, and the proposed rule's application to foreign entities. The Commission was particularly sensitive
to the burdens imposed by the proposed system and sought alternatives that would reduce such burdens and still accomplish
the objectives of the Market Reform Act. 

The Commission received 77 written comments on the proposed rule.

5

 In addition, members of the Division of Market Regulation met on numerous occasions with the Securities Industry
Association (``SIA''), the American Bankers Association, the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG''), the Securities
Industry Automation Corporation (``SIAC''), and two broker-dealers, to answer questions and discuss issues related
to the operation of the proposed system and its impact on market participants.

6

 






While generally supportive of the goals of the Market Reform Act,

7

 the commenters expressed concern that the proposed rule would be unduly burdensome and costly. The commenters generally
sought clarification of ``who'' would be a large trader, ``what'' information must be disclosed on Form 13H, and ``when''
Form 13H or trade report information must be submitted. These concerns were manifested in specific questions and
comments regarding the rules for aggregation, the definitions of ownership and control, the scope of Form 13H information,
and time frames for filing Form 13H. The commenters also addressed the identifying activity level, exemptions, and
the duty to supervise compliance with the proposed rule. Finally, the broker-dealer community raised several concerns
regarding the technical aspects of the reporting requirements for execution times, multiple large trader identification
numbers (``LTID''), and the time frame for submitting trade reports.

The reproposed rule has been revised to incorporate many of the suggestions made in the comment letters. These provisions
are intended to clarify the operation of the reproposed system and reduce the costs associated with all aspects of
the reproposed rule. The changes found in the reproposed rule would: (1) Clarify the definition of a large trader and
provide a flexible concept of aggregation; (2) increase the identifying and reporting activity levels; (3) reduce
the scope of information captured on Form 13H; (4) streamline Form 13H filing and updating requirements that include
an inactive filing status; (5) provide more informative and detailed instructions to Form 13H; (6) reduce the recordkeeping
and reporting requirements for LTIDs; (7) provide special reporting requirements for execution times; and (8) provide
a safe harbor for the duty to supervise. 
The reproposed rule also addresses today's complex global trading environment and attempts to maintain a level playing
field between broker-dealers and banks, both domestic and foreign. The Commission has endeavored to maintain an
equal competitive environment between these entities by imposing requirements on custodians or nominees of omnibus
accounts. These duties include: (1) Form 13H filings; (2) confidential and limited disclosures to the Commission
or others; and (3) limited duties to disaggregate and assure compliance with omnibus account identification requirements.

Essentially, the reproposed large trader reporting system would require that a person that falls within the definition
of a large trader would file Form 13H with the Commission. Upon receipt of Form 13H, the Commission would assign an LTID
to the large trader. After receiving a LTID, large traders would contact their broker-dealers and inform them of their
number and all accounts to which it applies. Thereafter, the large trader only would be required to file an updated
Form 13H annually. The broker-dealers carrying the large trader's accounts would maintain records of the trades
for the account. These broker-dealers would electronically report transactions upon receiving a request from the
Commission. Broker-dealers also would be required to supervise compliance with the reproposed rule by their customers.

Fundamentally, the burdens that would be imposed on large traders by the reproposed rule would include: (1) Filing
Form 13H (See Sections III.B.1. and 2.); (2) disclosing it's LTIDs to broker-dealers (See Section III.B.3.); (3)
updating Form 13H annually (See Section III.B.1.); and (4) providing additional information when the Commission
requests (See Section III.B.5.). The burdens imposed on broker-dealers would include: (1) Maintaining records
of transactions effected for large trader accounts (See Section III.C.); (2) electronically reporting large trader
transaction information when the Commission requests (See Section III.D.); and (3) supervising their customers'
compliance with the reproposed rule (See Section III.E.). 
The specific changes to the proposed rule and several examples of how they would affect the reproposed system are discussed
below. The Commission believes that the reproposed rule accomplishes the objectives of the Market Reform Act by creating
an effective market reconstruction tool, minimizing burdens and costs, and maintaining a fair competitive environment
among markets and market participants. 


II. Solicitation of Comments 


The Commission believes that the modifications and additions found in the reproposed rule would significantly reduce
the burdens and costs of the proposed system without impeding its effectiveness and, therefore, would accomplish
the objectives of the Market Reform Act. As discussed below, the Commission staff has engaged in extended discussions
with market participants and securities information processors, and many alternatives have been identified. The
Commission has incorporated in the reproposed rule those alternatives that it believes would accomplish the objectives
of the Market Reform Act.
Because the changes to the proposed rule are significant, the Commission seeks comments on any aspect of the reproposed
rule and, specifically, comments that relate to the: (1) The identifying activity level; (2) other means to assure
that natural persons who were not intended to be large traders are not affected by the reproposed rule; (3) the use of
the Depository Trust Company's (``DTC'') Institutional Delivery System (``ID System''); (4) the rules for aggregation
of accounts; (5) Form 13H and Schedules; (6) the supervisory safe harbor; and (7) the plan for implementing the transaction
reporting system. Finally, the Commission invites comments as to whether there are more cost-effective alternatives
to the reproposed rule or system that would provide similar benefits, including particular alternatives that adopt
a different structure. The Commission also continues to solicit specific comments that explore the relative costs
and benefits of the reproposed system generally, or any other alternatives. Furthermore, because of the time that
has elapsed, comments that identify any new information technologies that accomplish the objectives of the Market
Reform Act and minimize costs to a greater extent would be appreciated. 
With respect to the reproposed identifying activity level, the Commission solicits comments on the appropriateness
of the new thresholds. The new identifying activity level, combined with certain exemptions from the definition
of a transaction and the new inactive status, were designed to minimize the impact of the reproposed rule on natural
persons that infrequently trade in a magnitude that may warrant imposing the added regulatory burdens of the reproposed
system. The Commission would welcome comments regarding any other means for eliminating the impact of the reproposed
rule on these types of persons. In particular, the Commission solicits comments on whether a separate identifying
activity level for natural persons or an exemption for natural persons that effect less 1,000,000 shares or fair market
value of $25 million in a calendar day, would be a more appropriate means for minimizing the impact of the Rule. 
The ID System is an electronic communications and book-entry settlement system through which most large institutional
investors, their brokers or advisers, or their custodians or nominees confirm and settle trades.

8

 As discussed below, the ID System has been incorporated into the reproposed rule to reduce its burdens in three respects.
Under the reproposed rule, the use of numbers assigned by DTC to ID System participants would: (1) Be incorporated
into the Schedules to Form 13H by permitting their use in lieu of LTIDs; (2) minimize the amount of communication among
members of an investment complex that would be necessary to complete Form 13H and fulfill the LTID disclosure requirements;
and (3) establish a limit on the number of identification numbers that would be required to be maintained for each account,
and reported for each transaction, by broker-dealers.

The Commission specifically solicits comments on the appropriateness and feasibility of these proposed uses of
the ID System. The Commission would welcome comments that identify other ID System information or procedures that
would reduce the burden of the reproposed rule without diminishing its effectiveness for accomplishing the objectives
of the Market Reform Act. 

With respect to the reproposed rules for aggregation of accounts and Form 13H, the Commission solicits comments on
additional simplification or means for reducing the burden of determining who is a large trader and completing Form
13H. The Commission also solicits comments on the appropriateness of the supervisory safe harbor. Finally, the Commission
solicits comments on whether a proposed plan for implementing the transaction reporting requirements would be feasible.




III. Discussion of the Reproposed Rule 



A. Application and Scope 



The fundamental scope and application of the reproposed rule is established by the definition of a large trader. The
definition of a large trader and its separately defined terms were found in paragraph (f) of the proposed rule. These
definitions have been reorganized into paragraph (a) of the reproposed rule in order to clarify the fundamental application
and scope of the reproposed rule. As mentioned above, many of the comments raised concerns that generally may be described
as a question of ``who is a large trader.'' The terms of the reproposed rule essentially would provide that every person
who effects aggregate transactions reaching the identifying activity level, through accounts carried by a registered
broker-dealer, which are aggregated based on ownership or control, would be a large trader. 



1. Definition of a Large Trader 



The term large trader, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of the reproposed rule, would mean every person who, for an account
that he owns or controls, effects transactions for the purchase or sale of any publicly traded security or securities
by use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails, or of any facility of a national securities
exchange, directly or indirectly by or through a registered broker or dealer in an aggregate amount equal to or in excess
of the identifying activity level. The reproposed definition of a large trader closely tracks the definition provided
in Section 13(h)(8)(A) of the Exchange Act.

9

 





The reproposed rule varies from the proposed rule and statutory definition only to the extent that the phrase ``* * *
for an account that he owns or controls * * *'' has replaced the phrase ``* * * for his
own account or an account for which he exercises investment discretion * * *''

10

 The Commission believes that this modification does not change the proposed definition of a large trader, but merely
clarifies the interrelationship between the definition of a large trader and its separately defined terms. 





The definition of a large trader remains dependent upon the definitions of a person, account, ownership, control,
publicly traded security, transaction, the identifying activity level, and the rules for aggregation. The Commission
believes that the modifications to the proposed definitions of these terms address the questions raised by the commenters,
clarify the proposed rule, and narrow the proposed definition of a large trader.

<PARENT> FR940217-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

a. 

Definition of a person.

 
The definition of a person found in paragraph (a)(2) of the reproposed rule varies only slightly from the proposed
definition.

11

 The lone modification to this definition would be the deletion of the term ``trust'' and the addition of the phrase
``persons, entities, partnerships, or other groups acting as a trustee.'' The addition of this phrase addresses
a legal issue raised by a private pension trust, which asserted that a trust may not be deemed a person because it does
not have a present ability to act (

e.g.,

 effect transactions) separate from its trustee. The Market Reform Act intended that trusts of all types be included
in the definition of a large trader.

12

 The definition of a person contained in paragraph (a)(2) of the reproposed rule would assure that all trusts, through
their trustees, are included within the definition of a person and thus may be large traders. 






b. 

Definition of an account.

 
Paragraph (a)(3) of the reproposed rule would add a definition for the term ``account or accounts.'' This term was
not defined in the proposed rule and the comments received from banks, investment advisers, and other non-broker-dealer
market participants exhibited substantial confusion in this respect. The Commission believes that this confusion
led the commenters to incorrectly interpret ``who'' the Commission intended to be included within the definition
of a large trader. These commenters appear to have believed, incorrectly, that the accounts of ``small'' trust or
advisory customers would become large traders, with all of the duties attendant thereto, by virtue of the fact that
a large trader exercised control over such accounts. 

The Commission, therefore, is proposing new paragraph (a)(3) that would define the term account or accounts to mean
each proprietary and customer account maintained or carried by a registered broker or dealer, which is disclosed
or undisclosed to such broker or dealer as to ownership, and for which books and records are required to be kept in accordance
with the provisions of Rule 17a-3 under the Exchange Act. This definition would clarify that only accounts maintained
or carried by broker-dealers under the Exchange Act would be subject to the reproposed rule. 

c. 

Definition of ownership.

 
The definition of ownership would be narrowed and reorganized in paragraph (a)(4) of the reproposed rule. The apparent
breadth of this definition received extensive comments, especially with respect to its impact on the proposed rules
for aggregation and the information required to be provided on Form 13H.

13

 The Commission also received many comments on the proposed inclusion of custodians or nominees within the definition
of ownership. 





The Commission believes that the commenters failed to understand that the concept of ownership is focused on the ``accounts
of a person.'' The Commission, however, acknowledges that the proposed definition of ownership, combined with the
rules for aggregation, may support some of the sweeping interpretations of the proposed definition of a large trader
expressed in the comments. These commenters broadly interpreted the proposed definition of ownership and the rules
for aggregation to require: (1) The aggregation of individual accounts of all employees, officers, directors, controlling
shareholders, and partners with their large trader corporation, trust, or partnership, irrespective of such individual's
role in the trading decisions of the large trader entity; (2) the accounts of all parent, subsidiary, and affiliated
companies within a holding company structure to be aggregated by and with each parent, subsidiary, or affiliate;
and (3) the accounts of wholly unrelated large trader entities to be aggregated due to common directors, controlling
shareholders, partners, or trustees. In response to these comments, the Commission has revised the proposed definition
of ownership. 

i. 

General definition.

 
The definition of ownership, as reproposed in paragraph (a)(4), would provide that an account of a person shall be
deemed to be owned or under common ownership of the person in whose name an account is maintained, or custodian or nominee
that maintains an omnibus account, and any other person who has more than a 10 percent financial interest in the equity
in the account or accounts of such person. This reproposed definition of ownership would incorporate existing rules,
procedures, and practices that require broker-dealers to maintain the name and address of the beneficial owner of
an account and would be interpreted consistently with such rules, procedures, and practices.

14

 





The reproposed rule states that ``an account of a person'' would be deemed to be owned or under common ownership, thus
emphasizing that the primary focus of the concept of ownership would be the ``accounts of a person,'' and not ownership
of the person itself. Accordingly, under the reproposed rule, accounts maintained in the name of a parent, subsidiary,
or affiliate would be deemed to be owned by that parent, subsidiary, or affiliate. This focus would be made evident
in the reproposed Schedules 6a and 6b to Form 13H. 

The focus on accounts also would address those comments that deemed the accounts of employees, officers, directors,
controlling shareholders, and partners to be owned by their respective corporation or partnership, irrespective
of such individual's role or lack thereof, in the trading decisions of the large trader entity. The reproposed rule
would eliminate the sweeping nature of the proposed definition by providing that an account is owned or under common
ownership of the entity.

ii. Custodians or nominees. As discussed in the Proposing Release, institutional investors engage the services
of different investment advisers and executing broker-dealers, yet the trades effected by these persons may be settled
and the investment assets may be deposited centrally with one custodian bank, trust company, or broker-dealer that
is sometimes referred to as a prime broker.
 The Commission believes, based upon its experience with broad-based trade reconstructions, that the increased
size and specialization of market participants has led to the increased use of these multi-layered accounts. Typically,
these accounts fragment or obscure the information about large trader accounts and activity that the Commission
needs to analyze market trading. 




Substantial comments were received with respect to the inclusion of custodians or nominees within the definition
of ownership. The commenters all questioned the appropriateness of including passive custodians or nominees. These
commenters argued that passive custodians or nominees, which merely act as a conduit for delivery/receipt versus
payment (``DVP/RVP'') settlement of transactions, should not be included within the definition of a large trader.
However, the comments regarding custodians and nominees acknowledged that many custodians or nominees act as a discretionary
agent or fiduciary for the execution of trades and thus may be large traders that control accounts owned by other persons.

The inclusion of custodians and nominees also caused broker-dealers, banks, and trust companies to question the
capture of multiple LTIDs for a single account or transaction. These commenters asserted that the cost of keeping
and reporting multiple LTIDs, for a single account or trade, would be unduly burdensome.
 It also was suggested that the capture of multiple LTIDs may cause duplication or distortion of total reconstructed
trade activity. Many of these commenters also noted the possible applications of the ID System. Lastly, the commenters
confirmed that, in these multi-layered accounts, the participants usually do not have knowledge of each other's
activities and, individually, none of the participants may know or have access to all of the information that the Commission
needs to analyze market trading activity. 




The Commission believes that the inclusion of custodians and nominees in the definition of ownership would serve
three important purposes. First, it would assure that banks and broker-dealers, both foreign and domestic, are treated
consistently under the reproposed rule. Second, it would assure disclosure of the appropriate LTIDs for each account.
Finally, the inclusion of custodians and nominees would enable the Commission to efficiently characterize trading
activity. 
The problem that the Commission has sought to address with respect to custodians and nominees is its inability to obtain
information about the ultimate or actual beneficial owners and controllers of omnibus accounts or accounts otherwise
undisclosed as to ownership. Although the number of these accounts may be small in relation to fully disclosed accounts,
the Commission believes that the nature of large trader activity causes a significant percentage of this activity
to be effected through these accounts. Accordingly, the definition of ownership in the reproposed rule would include
only those custodians or nominees that maintain omnibus accounts or accounts otherwise undisclosed as to ownership.

These changes would work in conjunction with the other modifications to the definition of ownership to assure that
the fully disclosed owner of an account, or the custodian or nominee of an omnibus account, is deemed to be the owner
of that account, not the broker-dealer, bank, or trust company that acts only as an agent for settlement of transactions
effected through a fully disclosed account. Moreover, reproposed Schedule 8 to Form 13H has been designed to capture
information about a custodian or nominee large trader and the undisclosed large traders that effect trades in or through
his omnibus accounts, not small or otherwise infrequent traders whose trades may be effected through such accounts.
Reproposed Schedule 8 is designed in a manner that the Commission believes would approximate existing ID System practices
and procedures for maintaining such information.
 




The Commission believes that the revisions to the reproposed definition of ownership would significantly clarify
the obligations of persons that own and/or act as custodians or nominees for large trading accounts. The Commission
also believes that the reproposed definition of ownership would minimize the burden of the identification requirements
on such large traders. 
d. 

Definition of control. 

As with the definition of ownership, the commenters uniformly criticized the sweeping impact of the proposed definition
of control when combined with the proposed rules for aggregation. Some commenters questioned whether merely controlling
the accounts or trading of a large trader would, by itself, cause such controller to be a large trader. 
Many of the commenters also indicated that the persons or entities that control trading activities usually have the
most knowledge of large trader accounts, activity, or objectives and, therefore, should be the focus of the identification
requirements. Finally, one commenter questioned the appropriateness of the inclusion of limited discretionary
investment authority within the definition of control. This commenter asserted that the definition of limited discretion
would force broker-dealers to aggregate the activity of all customers for whom they executed not held orders.
 




The definition of control has been modified in paragraph (a)(5) of the reproposed rule.
 These revisions would emphasize that the focus of the reproposed concept of control is ``control of the accounts of
a person,'' not control of the person itself. The reproposed rule also would provide that the owner of an account, as
well as any person with full or limited discretion over an account, is deemed to control that account. 




The reproposed rule would clarify that a person's mere exercise of control over a large trader's accounts or transactions,
without effecting the requisite level of transactions, would not cause such person to be a large trader under the reproposed
rule. Additionally, new paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (ii) of the reproposed rule would add the definitions of full and
limited discretionary investment authority suggested in the Proposing Release.
 With respect to the execution of not held orders, the Commission would interpret their execution to not fall within
the reproposed definition of control.

<TEXT>
 

Finally, the reproposed rule would acknowledge that persons who control accounts usually are in possession of most
of the information required by Form 13H and required to be disclosed to broker-dealers. Accordingly, reproposed
Schedules 7a and 7b to Form 13H and the reproposed LTID disclosure requirements would be specifically designed to
capture and disclose information regarding fully disclosed or omnibus accounts controlled by a large trader. 
The Commission believes that these requirements take into account the existing industry practices and procedures
for the maintenance of such information. The Commission also believes that the changes to the proposed definition
of control would clarify the obligations of large traders who control accounts owned by others and would minimize
their burdens. 
e. 

Definition of a transaction. 

The definition of a transaction or transactions provided in paragraph (a)(7) of the reproposed rule, also would clarify
and narrow the scope of the definition of a large trader. The modifications to this definition address technical issues
raised in the comments regarding the inclusion of cancellations, corrections, and exercises or assignments of option
contracts, within the meaning of the term transaction or transactions. 
The reproposed rule states that the term transaction or transactions would mean all transactions in publicly traded
securities, including cancellations, corrections, exercises, and assignments.
 The definition of publicly traded securities found in reproposed paragraph (a)(6) would be unchanged, and would
mean any national market system security as defined in Rule 11Aa2-1 under the Exchange Act.
 





New paragraph (a)(7)(i) of the reproposed rule was added to exclude from the term ``transaction'' certain activity
commonly posted to customer accounts by clearing broker-dealers and passive custodians or nominees. This paragraph
would exclude from the definition of a transaction any journal or bookkeeping entry made to an account to record or
memorialize the receipt or delivery of funds or securities pursuant to the settlement of a transaction. 
Three new exclusions to the term transaction also have been added in paragraphs (a)(7)(v), (vi), and (vii) of the reproposed
rule. These exclusions track the trading objectives or characteristics, identified in the Proposing Release, of
small or otherwise infrequent traders that the Commission did not intend to be included in the definition of a large
trader.
 These new exclusions would include: (1) Transactions effected by a court appointed executor, administrator, or
fiduciary pursuant to the distribution of a decedent's estate; (2) transactions effected pursuant to a court order
or judgment for distribution of property in a marital proceeding; and (3) a qualified plan or trust rollover afforded
favorable tax treatment under section 402(a)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code.
 





It should be noted that the exclusion for transactions of a decedent or marital estate would include only those transactions
effected pursuant to the distribution or liquidation of such estates and would not include transactions effected
pursuant to the continuing administration or investment of such estate's assets. The distinction drawn between
the distribution and the administration of an estate pursuant to a court order acknowledges that court appointed
fiduciaries may be authorized to invest and reinvest in securities for many years. The Commission believes that the
exclusion of such estates from the identification requirements of the reproposed rule would be inappropriate. 
The Commission believes that these new exclusions from the definition of a transaction would indirectly exempt a
significant number of those small or otherwise infrequent traders that were not intended to be large traders under
the Market Reform Act. Moreover, the Commission believes that the definition of a transaction would reduce the impact
of the reproposed rule on registered broker-dealers. 
f. 

Identifying activity level.

 The Commission expressly solicited comment on the appropriateness of the volume, market value, exercise value,
and time period proposed for the identifying activity level. Generally, the commenters felt that the threshold was
too low and recommended higher levels that ranged from a low of 200,000 shares and $10 million, to a high of 5 million
shares and $50 million. A few commenters suggested that only market value should determine large trader status, while
others suggested that market price, rather than exercise price, would be more appropriate for valuing options. Finally,
many of the commenters expressed support for a calendar day measure because of the inherent difficulty of aggregating
transactions effected in different time zones.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940217-1-00014 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940217-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The definition of the identifying activity level contained in paragraph (a)(8) of the reproposed rule would increase
and change the thresholds contained in the proposed rule from 100,000 shares to 200,000 shares and fair market value
of $2 million, and from a fair market value of $4 million to $10 million. The Commission believes that the addition of
the $2 million fair market value requirement to the fundamental share volume threshold would act as a floor to minimize
the impact of the reproposed rule on those persons that effect transactions in lower priced securities. The Commission
solicits comments on whether this new element of the identifying activity level would be appropriate. The Commission
also solicits comments regarding the effectiveness of the new identifying activity level for minimizing the impact
of the reproposed rule on natural persons that infrequently trade large amounts of publicly traded securities. 

The time period for aggregating transactions also would be changed from a 24 hour period to ``a calendar day where the
account is located.'' The Commission would deem a calendar day to be a 24-hour period starting at 12 a.m. and ending
at 11:59 p.m. An account would be deemed to be located at the principal place of business of the broker-dealer, not where
the customer or registered representative servicing the account is located. Finally, the provisions regarding
program trading are reproposed without changes in paragraphs (a)(9) and (10).

25

 





The Commission continues to believe that the capture of significant trading activity concurrently with program
trading activity is essential for accomplishing the purposes of the Market Reform Act. The Commission has balanced
this need against the burden of capturing the information and believes that the reproposed identifying activity
level would strike an appropriate balance. The Commission also believes that the reproposed identifying activity
level would establish a relatively simple and bright-line threshold that would be squarely within the activity-based
mandate of the Market Reform Act. 



2. Aggregation of Accounts and Transactions 



Section 13(h)(3) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to prescribe rules governing the manner in which transactions
and accounts shall be aggregated, including the basis of ownership or control.

26

 The commenters uniformly criticized the proposed rules for aggregation as overly broad and inflexible. Generally,
these criticisms were levied by diversified financial service holding companies whose affiliates, subsidiaries,
and divisions engage in related and unrelated trading activities. As discussed above, much of this criticism emanated
from the definitions of ownership and control. 





These commenters argued that the mandatory nature of the proposed rules would cause overlapping and duplicative
aggregation among the various entities within a holding company structure. The commenters made a variety of recommendations,
including a flexible approach, approaches designed to meet the needs of the specific commenter, an ``acting in concert''
approach, and the elimination of the concept of aggregation. The comments regarding aggregation highlight the complexity
of designing a simple and efficient large trader system that accommodates the different corporate structures and
business practices of large traders. The proposed aggregation requirements, however, were intended to deter non-compliance
by prohibiting a person or group of persons from splitting activity among many broker-dealers, accounts, and transactions
for the purpose of avoiding the identification requirements of the proposed rule. 

a. 

General Description.

 The rules for aggregation have been reorganized into paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of the reproposed rule to distinguish
the requirements for the aggregation of accounts and the aggregation of transactions, respectively. The rules for
the aggregation of transactions found in reproposed paragraph (c)(2) contain only minor changes that reflect the
reorganization of the proposed rules.

27

 





The focus of the reproposed rule would be the ``aggregation of accounts owned or controlled by a person.'' Paragraph
(c)(1)(i) of the reproposed rule would implement a new flexible approach to the aggregation of accounts by permitting,
but not requiring, the aggregation of accounts that are owned or controlled or under common ownership or control of
a person, which independently would be a large trader. Conversely, paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of the reproposed rule would
require aggregation of accounts of a person who independently would not be a large trader. 

In order to assure compliance and deter the use of this flexible approach to circumvent the reproposed rule, new paragraph
(c)(1)(iii) would provide that, under no circumstances, shall a person or group of persons acting in concert toward
a common investment objective be permitted to disaggregate accounts in order to avoid the identification requirements
of the reproposed rule. Finally, reproposed Form 13H and Schedules have been redesigned to explain and facilitate
the various choices that large traders may make with respect to aggregation. 

b. 

Disaggregation.

 The concept of disaggregation would be reorganized into paragraph (c)(3)(i) of the reproposed rule. The reproposed
rule provides that the Commission may require a large trader to disaggregate accounts or transactions in any manner
and authorizes the Commission to require the submission of additional transaction or other information relating
to transactions reported under the reproposed rule. To assure that the Commission's requests for disaggregation
are reasonable, however, the reproposed rule would require the Commission to consider the operational capabilities
of the large trader when making a request for disaggregation. 

The Commission's efforts to assure the credibility of the reproposed system would require the imposition of certain
duties on omnibus large traders. These duties would include supplying information that would facilitate analysis
of market trading activity. The duties would arise from, and pertain to, the disaggregation and identification requirements.

28

 These duties are found in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of the reproposed rule and would only apply to those large traders that
maintain, or effect transactions through, omnibus accounts carried by a registered broker-dealer. The obligations
imposed on these large traders would be to establish systems and procedures designed to assure compliance with the
disaggregation and identification requirements and, in particular, assure that the information regarding omnibus
accounts, disclosed to the Commission on reproposed Schedules 7b and 8, is accurate and complete.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940217-1-00015 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940217-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Systems and procedures designed to assure compliance with the identification and disaggregation requirements
that are substantially comparable to those described in reproposed paragraph (f) would be deemed to be in compliance
with reproposed paragraph (c)(3)(ii). Systems and procedures designed to assure that Schedules 7b and 8 are accurate
and complete may include recordkeeping procedures triggered by the opening of new accounts and prescribing how,
or for whom, a given omnibus account may be used. These systems and procedures are not intended to affect the existing
disclosure practices and procedures between broker-dealers and banks or trust companies.

29

 







The need to impose these duties on omnibus large traders results from the undisclosed nature of omnibus accounts.
The Commission believes that the obligations found in reproposed paragraph (c)(3)(ii) would be necessary to assure
the effectiveness and credibility of the large trader system. The Commission also believes that these requirements
would establish consistent duties with respect to omnibus accounts maintained by banks or broker-dealers. 


c. 

Aggregation examples.

 A diversified financial services holding company, for example, may engage in all forms of banking, corporate finance,
and trust services in addition to the full range of broker-dealer activities, such as proprietary trading, market
making, brokerage execution, and clearing services for retail and institutional customer accounts. This holding
company also may provide discretionary and non-discretionary investment management services for retail and institutional
customers, as well as for affiliated and unaffiliated investment companies, pension funds, and insurance companies.



Under the reproposed rules for the aggregation of accounts, the holding company is permitted to formulate its own
methodology for filing of Form 13H.

30

 For example, it may file a single Form 13H that would include accounts of all its owned or controlled and commonly owned
or controlled persons, divisions, subsidiaries, and affiliates. In the alternative, the holding company may file
separate Form 13Hs for its divisions, subsidiaries, and affiliates that independently would be a large trader. Finally,
the holding company may file a separate Form 13H for individual traders or trading desks which also would independently
qualify as a large trader. 






In another example, a diversified broker-dealer that engages in investment banking, proprietary trading, discretionary
and non-discretionary investment management services, and clearing and custody services may also adopt its own
methodology for the filing of Form 13H. First, the broker-dealer could file a single Form 13H for all of its activities.
Second, the broker-dealer could file separate forms by dividing its activities along the three large trader capacities
and then further subdivide each capacity in a fashion that best suits its business needs. Accordingly, this broker-dealer
may wish to file one Form 13H for each proprietary trader due to operational considerations, two Form 13Hs for its investment
management subsidiary due to confidentiality considerations (

e.g.

, one for affiliated investment company accounts and one for other managed accounts), and for supervisory considerations,
one Form 13H for all of the omnibus accounts for which it acts as custodian/nominee only. 


The Commission believes that this flexible approach to aggregation would accommodate the needs of the greatest number
of large traders in the least burdensome manner possible. The Commission also believes that the reorganization and
revision of the reproposed rules for aggregation would clarify the reproposed definition of a large trader. Nevertheless,
the Commission solicits comments on whether there are other more effective means for aggregating accounts that would
accomplish the objectives of the Market Reform Act. 




B. Identification Requirements for Large Traders 




Section 13(h)(1) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to prescribe identification requirements for large
traders for the purpose of monitoring the impact of large transactions on securities markets and to assist the Commission
in the enforcement of the Exchange Act.

31

 The Commission is specifically authorized to require large traders to provide it with the information deemed necessary
or appropriate to identify large traders and all accounts in or through which large traders effect transactions.

32

 The Commission also is authorized to require large traders to disclose their large trader status to the registered
broker-dealers that carry the accounts through which they effect transactions.

33

 The Commission is reproposing Rule 13h-1(b) and Form 13H to implement these provisions of Section 13(h)(1)
of the Exchange Act. 








1. Form 13H Filing Requirements 




Paragraph (b)(1) of the reproposed rule provides that each large trader shall file Form 13H with the Commission in
accordance with the instructions contained therein. The filing requirement for Form 13H is the most significant
burden imposed on large traders by the reproposed rule. The time for filing Form 13H is contained in new paragraphs
(b)(1) (i) and (ii) of the reproposed rule. 


The Commission recognizes that, due to the nature of many large trader's business activities, much of the information
required by the proposed form may change daily. Accordingly, new paragraph (b)(1) of the reproposed rule would eliminate
the proposed requirement that a large trader file a Form 13H every time the ``information contained therein becomes
inaccurate for any reason.'' 


Paragraph (b)(1) of the reproposed rule would require a large trader to file Form 13H within 10 business days after
it first effects transactions that reach the identifying activity level and within 60 calendar days after the end
of each full calendar year thereafter. It should be noted, however, that a large trader would still be required to disclose
its LTID or ID System number when a new account is opened during a calendar year.

34

 The Commission believes that the reproposed Form 13H filing requirements would substantially reduce the frequency
of filings and accomplish the purposes of the Market Reform Act. 






2. Form 13H and Instructions 




The Commission received many negative comments about Form 13H. The majority of the commenters argued that the proposed
Form 13H and Schedules were duplicative or burdensome, and would be required to be filed too frequently. The commenters
made various suggestions to eliminate or reduce the burdens of the proposed form. These suggestions included: (1)
eliminating the listing of certain types of accounts;

35

 (2) incorporating information contained in other Commission filings by reference; (3) limiting the number of officers,
directors, and partners for whom information must be provided; and (4) redesigning the proposed Schedules to capture
the particular information possessed by each of the three basic types of large trader (

i.e.

, owner, controller, or custodian/nominee).

a. 

General description.

 The Commission is reproposing a substantially revised Form 13H, Schedules, and Instructions. The revisions to proposed
Form 13H reflect the modifications to the definition of a large trader and LTID disclosure requirements and incorporate
other recommendations made in the comments. As discussed in the Proposing Release, the information disclosed on
Form 13H would be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA'') pursuant to Section 13(h)(7)
of the Exchange Act.

36

 A few commenters questioned the apparent lack of a similar exemption for the transaction information reported under
the proposed rule. Section 13(h)(7) provides that ``any information required to be kept or reported'' is exempt from
disclosure under FOIA. Therefore, transaction information reported under the reproposed rule also would be exempt
from disclosure under FOIA. The Commission believes that the non-disclosure of such information also may be covered
by other existing Commission rules.

37

 







The cover page to reproposed Form 13H would remain substantially unchanged except for the exclusion of the amended
filing requirement, the addition of an inactive filing status, and the capture of applicable LTID or ID System numbers.
Item 1 to Form 13H also would be unchanged, except for minor changes that conform with the reproposed definition of
a person.

38

 The remaining Items and Schedules of the proposed form have been substantially revised in the reproposed Form 13H.







Reproposed Item 2 to Form 13H would implement a new exemption from the filing requirements of reproposed Item 4 for
persons and entities regulated by the Commission by allowing the incorporation by reference of information already
on file with the Commission. The Commission anticipates that some of the most common registrations or filings that
large traders may list in reproposed Item 2 would include: Form BD; Form ADV; Forms 3, 4, or 5; Form 10-K or 10-Q;
and Form U-4. 

The Instructions to reproposed Item 2 also would inform large traders that the listed registrations and filings should
reflect the registrations of all other large traders and persons whose accounts the large trader has decided to aggregate
into its Form 13H. Finally, the reproposed Instructions would inform large traders that Item 4 and the appropriate
Schedule must be filed for those persons who are not registered with the Commission and whose accounts have been aggregated
with a ``registered person.'' 


The Schedules to reproposed Item 4 also have been refined to capture only minimal descriptive information about the
persons who own or control a large trader corporation, partnership, limited partnership, or trust. For the most part,
the collection of addresses, telephone and facsimile numbers, and regulatory information has been eliminated.
The terms ``officer and partner'' also have been changed in the reproposed Schedules 4b and 4c to ``executive officer''
and ``limited partner that is the owner of more than a 10 percent financial interest in the accounts of the large trader.''
The term ``executive officer'' would be deemed to mean ``policy-making officer'' and otherwise would be interpreted
in accordance with Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act.

39

 As suggested in the comments, these changes should substantially reduce the number of persons for whom such Schedules
must be prepared and filed under the reproposed rule. 






Reproposed Item 5 to Form 13H would facilitate the new flexible rules for aggregation. Item 5(a) would require the
large trader to list all commonly owned or commonly controlled persons whose accounts are aggregated into the particular
Form 13H that independently would be a large trader (

i.e.

, aggregated accounts). Conversely, Item 5(b) would require the large trader to list all other commonly owned or controlled
large traders that independently filed Form 13H and that could have been, but were not, aggregated into the particular
large trader's Form 13H (

i.e.

, disaggregated accounts). Again, the reproposed Instructions would caution large traders that the information
supplied in Item 5 must accurately reflect their choice for aggregation or disaggregation of accounts. 

The reproposed Schedules to new Items 6 through 8, which gather account information, address the concerns expressed
in the comments and reorganize, substantially reduce, or eliminate much of the information regarding a large trader's
accounts that may have been captured by the proposed Schedules. These reproposed Schedules have been completely
redesigned to require the identification of only one contact person for each Schedule and establish a ``single-line-item''
type of account listing. The reproposed Instructions indicate that the proposed qualifications for designated
contact persons would be retained without meaningful changes. The reproposed Instructions also advise large traders
that they may submit internally produced lists of accounts, provided that such lists contain all required information
in a format substantially similar to the applicable Schedule. 


The new account Schedules also have been reorganized to track the three capacities in which a large trader may act with
respect to a given account (

i.e.

, owner, controller, or custodian/nominee). The reproposed Schedules would capture different combinations of
large trader capacities, based upon the large trader's knowledge of accounts and the extent of beneficial ownership
disclosure made to the carrying broker-dealer. Reproposed Schedules 6a and 6b would be used by those market participants
who own accounts. 


Reproposed Schedules 7a and 7b would be used by market participants who control accounts owned by others. These Schedules
have been redesigned to indicate that accounts controlled by the large trader that are owned by small or otherwise
infrequent traders would not be required to be specifically listed on these Schedules. Instead, reproposed Item
2 of Schedule 7a would capture general information about fully disclosed ``non-large trader'' accounts controlled
by the large trader (

i.e.

, the total number of such accounts and broker-dealers carrying them). If applicable, information regarding other
large traders whose activity may be controlled by the large trader through one of the listed accounts would be provided
in reproposed Item 3 of Schedule 7a and Item 2 of Schedule 7b.

<DOCNO> FR940217-1-00017 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940217-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Lastly, Schedule 8 would be used by those broker-dealers, banks, and trust companies that market their clearing or
depository services independently from their other brokerage or investment management services. It should be noted
that reproposed Schedules 7b and 8 incorporate the ID System to the extent that they permit a large trader to list the
applicable ID System numbers or LTIDs of the custodian or nominee for an omnibus account and other interested parties
(

i.e.,

 owners and controllers). The Commission believes that, due to the wide-spread use and automated nature of the ID System,
most of these numbers are routinely communicated among, and maintained in an automated fashion by, market participants.
The disclosure of other large traders required by these Schedules would provide an important and common basis for
disaggregation. 

Rarely would a large trader be required to complete all five of these reproposed Schedules. The Commission believes
that such a filing probably would occur only if a diversified financial services company decided to aggregate the
accounts of all of its divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates into a single Form 13H filing. 

The complexity of the Form 13H disclosures under the reproposed rules would be greatest for a single aggregated filing
and would become progressively less complex for multiple Form 13H filings. Generally, the large trader's organizational
structure and business practices, combined with the reproposed requirements of Item 2, Item 5, and the account Schedules,
would dictate the complexity of a Form 13H filing. 

The number of LTIDs that would be assigned varies directly with the number of Form 13H filings. The commenters indicate
that some broker-dealers and large traders may prefer to be assigned many LTIDs for supervisory purposes while others
may prefer a single LTID for confidentiality reasons. In this respect, the SIA suggested that a broker-dealer be permitted
to use its LTID for the confidential numbered accounts of its customers. Similarly, a few commenters, primarily foreign
financial services holding companies or universal banks, asserted that the LTID disclosure requirements may cause
them to breach ``Chinese Walls'' between investment banking, investment advisory, market making, or brokerage
units. The Commission believes that these entities would be able to avoid this result under the reproposed rules by
carefully aggregating or disaggregating accounts. 

The Commission acknowledges that excessive aggregation or disaggregation of commonly owned or controlled accounts
may increase the overall costs and burdens on large traders and the Commission. The probability of receiving a request
for disaggregation, and the cost thereof, also would vary directly with the extent of aggregation chosen by a large
trader. The Commission would remind all market participants to evaluate their business practices and weigh the costs
and benefits of aggregation or disaggregation in light of all the considerations outlined above. 

The Commission believes that perhaps the most important revisions to proposed Form 13H are the reproposed set of General
and Special Instructions.
 These new Instructions provide answers to many of the specific questions raised in the comments. The Instructions
provide all of the pertinent definitions, the rules for aggregation, and examples of who would be a large trader and
what information must be provided on Form 13H. The reproposed Instructions also provide guidance and cross-references
to the reproposed rule, other related instructions, and particular burden reducing features or alternatives of
reproposed Form 13H. Accordingly, the Commission would encourage all market participants to carefully review the
reproposed General and Special Instructions for Form 13H before completing and filing Form 13H. 




b. 

Form 13H Examples.

 Assume a trustee for a large pension fund is not registered with the Commission and personally manages 75% of the pension's
assets. Assume further that the pension trustee delegates full discretionary investment authority over the remaining
25% of the pension's total assets to several investment advisers (

e.g.,

 a growth stock adviser, an index arbitrager, and a portfolio hedging strategist). 

This pension trustee would be required to complete one of the reproposed Schedules to Item 4 depending on the organizational
type of the trustee (

i.e.,

 individual, corporation, or partnership). With respect to the 75% of the pension's total assets that the pension
fund trustee personally manages, he would be deemed to own and control the accounts and would know the carrying broker-dealers
and account numbers. The pension fund trustee, therefore, would list these accounts on reproposed Schedule 6a. 

Depending on the nature of the delegations of authority to each of the advisers, the pension trustee may not know the
broker-dealers the advisers use to execute trades or maintain accounts. Accordingly, reproposed Schedule 6b has
been designed to capture the information that the pension trustee knows (

i.e.,

 the advisers' names, addresses, numbers, and type of delegation), and reproposed Schedules 7a and 7b would capture
the information in the possession of the adviser (

i.e.,

 carrying broker-dealer, account number, disclosure of ownership, and other large traders). 

Assuming that the advisers are large traders and were registered with the Commission, they would list Form BD or ADV
in Item 2 of their Form 13Hs, and therefore, would be exempt from the requirements of Item 4. It should be noted that if
any of these advisers is not a large trader, then such adviser would not file Form 13H under the reproposed rules. In
such cases, the Commission would be able to identify and contact the non-large trader adviser, if necessary, through
the information provided by the pension trustee on its Schedule 6b to Form 13H. 

In addition, assume that the trustee of the pension fund also engages the services of a prime broker, bank, or trust
company to act only as the custodian or nominee for omnibus accounts that are owned and controlled by the pension trustee
or owned by such trustee and controlled by the different advisers. In this case, the pension fund trustee would list
on its Form 13H the omnibus accounts for which he or she is the owner and controller on Schedule 6a and the delegations
of investment discretion on Schedule 6b. The advisers that control the pension fund's trading through the omnibus
accounts would list such accounts on Schedule 7b of their Form 13Hs.

<TEXT>
 

The prime broker, bank, or trust company acting only as custodian or nominee for all of the omnibus accounts (

i.e.,

 the custodian or nominee large trader) would list such accounts, carrying broker-dealer, and the relevant controllers
on reproposed Schedule 8. It should be noted that if the omnibus account custodian or nominee also controlled these
accounts, in whole or in part, then it would complete Schedule 7b instead.
 The custodian or nominee large trader would be in possession of the information required by Schedule 7b or 8, for the
following reasons. First, it is the carrying broker-dealer's customer with respect to the omnibus accounts and,
therefore, would be required to complete a new account application and provide all other information requested by
the broker-dealer with respect to settlement instructions and the persons authorized to effect transactions through
the accounts. Second, the various advisers and the trustee of the pension fund, to the extent that he or she controls
transactions, would be required by the reproposed rule to disclose such information to the prime broker, bank, or
trust company acting as custodian or nominee.
 Finally, if the custodian bank or trust company was an issuer of publicly-traded securities, it may list Form 10-K
or 10-Q in Item 2 and would not be required to complete Item 4 on its Form 13H. 






Another example of how the reproposed Schedules to Form 13H may be applied would be where a registered investment adviser
for a mutual fund complex chooses to file one Form 13H, covering all of the accounts controlled for affiliated or unaffiliated
investment companies. Assuming that each mutual fund independently would be a large trader, they would be listed
in Item 5(a) of the adviser's Form 13H. The Form ADV of the adviser and each investment company's registration statement
or periodic reports also would be listed in Item 2 of the adviser's Form 13H. If the accounts through which the adviser
effects transactions are fully disclosed as to ownership by a particular investment company within the fund complex,
the adviser would complete Schedule 7a. Alternatively, if such accounts do not disclose the particular investment
company for whom the adviser is effecting transactions (

i.e.,

 are maintained on an omnibus basis), then the adviser would complete Schedule 7b. 


The Commission believes that the revisions to the reproposed Form 13H and Instructions would dispel many of the misconceptions
regarding the information that would be required to be disclosed on Form 13H. The revised Schedules to Form 13H also
minimize the burdens of the reproposed rule by utilizing existing ID System practices and procedures for disclosure
and maintenance of information among large traders and other parties to multi-layered accounts. The Commission
specifically solicits comments on the appropriateness of all the changes found in reproposed Form 13H and Schedules.




3. Disclosure of Large Trader Status 



Many of the commenters expressed concerns that the proposed disclosure requirements would cause overlapping, confusing,
or unnecessary disclosures by more than one large trader for a given account. The broker-dealer commenters also indicated
that the cost of modifying automated brokerage accounting systems to maintain and report multiple LTIDs for a single
account or trade would be substantial.

The reproposed rule would retain the proposed LTID assignment system

43

 and would modify the duty of large traders to disclose their LTIDs and accounts to broker-dealers. The reproposed
rule also would require similar disclosures of information to custodians or nominees and large traders that control
transactions. 




Reproposed paragraph (b)(2)(i) would require a large trader who controls a fully disclosed account or the custodian
or nominee for an omnibus account to disclose its LTID and accounts to the carrying broker-dealers. Hence, under the
reproposed rules, each large trader account should have only one LTID number associated with it, namely the LTID number
of the controlling large trader or of the custodian or nominee large trader. 

The Commission notes that the reproposed definition of control states that an account would be controlled by the owner
of the account. Consequently, if an account is controlled only by its owner, then the owner would be required to disclose
its LTID to the carrying broker-dealer. This duty also would apply to fully disclosed accounts of small or otherwise
infrequent traders whose accounts are controlled by large traders, even though these accounts would not be listed
on the reproposed Schedules to Item 7. 

Paragraph (b)(2)(i) of the reproposed rule would effectively eliminate the majority of situations where multiple
LTIDs would be disclosed to a broker-dealer for a single account. The Commission believes that the only situation
where more than one LTID would be disclosed to a broker-dealer for a single account would be where more than one large
trader controls transactions in an account that is fully disclosed as to ownership. These situations would include
fully disclosed accounts controlled by their owner and another adviser or such accounts controlled by two or more
advisers. 

Reproposed paragraph (b)(2)(ii) would require a large trader who controls omnibus accounts to disclose its LTID
or ID System number to the broker-dealer or large trader acting as the custodian or nominee for such account. Similarly,
reproposed paragraph (b)(2)(iii) would require a large trader that owns accounts but has delegated full or limited
discretionary investment authority to another person to disclose its LTID or ID System number to such person. These
duties are coordinated with the filing requirements for Schedules 7a, 7b, and 8 to reproposed Form 13H.

44

 





The Commission acknowledges that reproposed paragraphs (b)(2) (ii) and (iii) may cause multiple LTIDs or ID System
numbers to be disclosed to custodian or nominee and controlling large traders, respectively. The Commission believes
that these required disclosures of large trader status would not be overlapping or unnecessarily burdensome and
would utilize existing ID System practices and procedures. The Commission also believes that these disclosure requirements
would minimize the amount of communication among members of an investment complex that would be necessary to complete
Form 13H. Moreover, these changes to the proposed rule would conform with the various rules and regulations that require
financial institutions of all types to identify the beneficial owners of accounts, confirm trades, and maintain
possession and control of customer funds and securities. 

The Commission believes that the revisions to the reproposed rules for disclosure of large trader status incorporate
many of the recommendations made by the commenters and reduce the burdens imposed on market participants. The Commission
solicits comment on this use of the ID System and whether other ID System procedures or information would further the
purposes of the Market Reform Act. 



4. Inactive Filing Status 


In the Proposing Release, the Commission specifically solicited comments on various means of minimizing the impact
of the proposed rule on small or otherwise infrequent traders. The Commission received many comments in this respect
and all were supportive of minimizing the impact of the proposed system on small or otherwise infrequent traders.
Many of the commenters suggested that an annual activity threshold could be used to limit the impact of the proposed
system on infrequent large traders. The commenters did not identify any common trading objectives or characteristics
of small or infrequent traders that may inadvertently become large traders, other than those suggested in the Proposing
Release.

45

 




The reproposed rule would implement a new ``inactive filing status,'' pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of the reproposed
rule. This new paragraph provides that large traders whose aggregate transactions during the previous full calendar
year, which do not reach the identifying activity level and an aggregate calendar year total of 2,000,000 shares or
fair market value of $30,000,000, shall become inactive upon filing Form 13H. This threshold would incorporate the
identifying activity threshold and would add an ``aggregate calendar year activity threshold.'' Aggregate calendar
year activity would be computed in accordance with the rules for aggregation of transactions found in paragraph (c)(2)
of the reproposed rule. 

The reproposed Instructions explain that this new inactive status would be invoked by checking the appropriate box
on the cover page when filing an annual Form 13H for the calendar year in which the large trader was inactive. Once a large
trader has made an ``inactive filing,'' he would be exempt from the reproposed annual filing requirements contained
in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) and the LTID disclosure requirements of paragraph (b)(2). However, if an inactive large
trader subsequently effects transactions that reach the identifying activity level, then the large trader again
would be required to reactivate its large trader status by filing Form 13H within 10 business days. 
The reproposed Instructions indicate that such ``reactivated large traders'' would retain the LTID initially assigned
to them by the Commission. 

The Commission believes that this new inactive filing status would eliminate the burdens of the identification requirements
on small or otherwise infrequent traders and, therefore, would accomplish the objectives of the Market Reform Act.
Nevertheless, the Commission solicits comments on whether this new provision would adequately reduce or eliminate
the impact of the reproposed rule on natural persons that infrequently effect large trades. The Commission also solicits
suggestions for other means of eliminating the burden of the reproposed rule on natural persons.

5. Other Information 


Paragraph (b)(4) of the reproposed rule has been added to the identification requirements to assure that the Commission
has the authority to obtain, from time to time, other descriptive or clarifying information regarding accounts,
or transactions effected through accounts, identified on Form 13H. This new paragraph would provide the Commission
with the express authority to obtain other information from large traders that is not otherwise disclosed on Form
13H and may be crucial for understanding or analyzing information collected through the system. The Commission believes
that the reproposed rule would not be unduly burdensome and would assure that the Form 13H filing requirements accomplish
the objectives of the Market Reform Act. 


C. Recordkeeping Requirements for Brokers and Dealers 


Section 13(h)(2) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to prescribe recordkeeping requirements for large
trader activity that it deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act.
 The Commission also is authorized to conduct reasonable periodic, special, or other examinations of all records
required to be made and kept pursuant to the Rule.
 Paragraph (d) of the reproposed rule would implement the recordkeeping provisions of section 13(h)(2) of the Exchange
Act. 





1. General Requirements 


The general recordkeeping requirements, which contain minor changes from the proposed rule,
 would provide that every registered broker-dealer that carries accounts for itself or others shall make and keep
records of transactions effected directly or indirectly by or through such broker or dealer for all large traders.
In addition, as specifically authorized by the Market Reform Act, the reproposed rule also would require that broker-dealers
keep records of transactions for each person such broker or dealer knows or has reason to know is a large trader based
on transactions effected by or through such broker or dealer. Further, paragraph (d)(4) of the reproposed rule would
provide that such records shall be kept for a period of three years, the first two in an accessible place, in accordance
with Rule 17a-4(b) under the Exchange Act.
 





The reproposed rule would explicitly provide that only registered broker-dealers that carry accounts for themselves
or others would be affected. The term ``registered broker-dealer'' is defined in Section 3(a)(48) of the Exchange
Act as a broker or dealer registered or required to be registered pursuant to Section 15 or 15B of the Exchange Act.
 Executing broker-dealers and prime brokers that do not carry large trader accounts would not be subject to the recordkeeping
requirements of paragraph (d) of the reproposed rule, notwithstanding that these persons may perform other specific
tasks for large traders and may be large traders. The Commission believes that these modifications would clarify
the applicability of the general recordkeeping requirements of the reproposed rule.

2. Elements of Transaction Information 


Paragraph (d)(2) of the reproposed rule would provide the elements of information required to be maintained for all
transactions. The Commission believes that these elements incorporate, to the extent possible, existing recordkeeping
requirements under the Exchange Act and SRO rules for the electronic bluesheet system and, thereby, minimize the
burdens imposed on registered broker-dealers. 
Due to changes to the LTID disclosure requirements, the recordkeeping requirement for LTIDs found in paragraph (d)(2)(x)
of the reproposed rule would now require a broker-dealer to maintain only the LTID of the controllers of a fully disclosed
account, or the custodian or nominee of an omnibus account. In addition, paragraphs (d)(2)(v) and (d)(2)(vii) of
the reproposed rule have been modified to incorporate suggestions made by the commenters. Paragraph (d)(2)(v) has
been modified to include the designation of exercises or assignments of option contracts. Paragraph (d)(2)(vii)
has been modified to clarify that the personal accounts of officers, directors, or employees of a broker-dealer are
not required to be aggregated with accounts owned or controlled by such broker-dealer. 
In addition, the reproposed rule includes three new elements that the Commission believes are necessary to reduce
the burden of maintaining multiple LTIDs and execution times. First, paragraph (d)(2)(xi) of the reproposed rule
would provide that broker-dealers must maintain the ID System numbers of agents, broker-dealers, institutions,
and other interested parties otherwise maintained for the account for which a transaction is effected.
 The use of ID System numbers would have the effect of limiting the number of LTIDs that a broker-dealer must maintain
and report with respect to a given account. The Commission understands that broker-dealers currently maintain these
ID System numbers in their automated name and address records.
 The Commission specifically solicits comments on the appropriateness of the use of ID System numbers and whether
other information, systems, or procedures may further reduce the burden of multiple LTID recordkeeping. 





Second, paragraph (d)(2)(xii) of the reproposed rule would provide that broker-dealers must maintain the code,
identification, or sequence number assigned to a transaction that was routed or effected through an automated order
routing system maintained by an SRO, such as the NYSE SuperDOT system. These numbers are uniformly maintained and
used by broker-dealers and SROs to route reports of executed transactions to the appropriate broker-dealer branch
offices or to research the status of unexecuted orders. The Commission would use these numbers to ``link or match''
transaction reports to the applicable SRO audit trail, in order to determine or verify the reported execution time.

Finally, paragraph (d)(2)(xiii) of the reproposed rule would establish a miscellaneous or unspecified field that
would provide the Commission with flexibility to accommodate future changes or problems. This flexibility also
could be used to facilitate specific requests that would reduce the burdens of the reproposed system for a given broker-dealer.
The Commission believes that the reproposed recordkeeping requirements would assure that the information necessary
to accomplish the objectives of the Market Reform Act would be maintained. The Commission also believes that these
reproposed requirements would reduce burdens substantially. 


D. Trade Reporting Requirements of Brokers and Dealers 


Section 13(h)(2) of the Exchange Act specifically authorizes the Commission to require registered broker-dealers
to report transactions that equal or exceed the reporting activity level effected by or through such broker-dealer
for persons who they know are large traders, or any persons who they have reason to know are large traders on the basis
of transactions effected by or through such broker-dealers.
 The Commission also is authorized to require broker-dealers to report transactions to the Commission or an SRO designated
by the Commission on the morning following the day on which the transactions were effected or otherwise immediately
upon request of the Commission or designated SRO. Further, the Commission is authorized to require that such transaction
reports be transmitted in any format that it may prescribe, including machine-readable form. The Commission is reproposing
paragraph (e) to implement the transaction reporting provisions of Section 13(h)(2) of the Exchange Act. 




1. General Requirements 


The general reporting requirement would provide that every registered broker-dealer that carries accounts for
large traders, or other persons for whom records must be maintained, shall electronically report transactions in
machine-readable form and in accordance with instructions issued by the Commission. Transaction reports would
be required to contain all elements of information for transactions effected through accounts carried by such broker-dealer
for large traders and other persons for whom records must be maintained, which equal or exceed the reporting activity
level. The Commission continues to propose that transaction reports be transmitted through the existing electronic
bluesheet system.
 The special reporting requirement for trades of ``unidentified large traders,'' has been reorganized without changes
into paragraph (e)(5) of the reproposed rule.

2. Reporting Activity Level 



The Commission expressly solicited comment on the appropriateness of the proposed reporting activity level. Generally,
the commenters felt that the threshold was too low, and eight recommended higher levels that ranged from a low of 5,000
shares and $200,000 to a high of 100,000 shares and $5 million. In response to these comments, the proposed reporting
activity level has been modified. 

The reporting activity level contained in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of the reproposed rule would increase the thresholds
contained in the proposed rule from 1,000 to 2,000 shares, and from a fair market value of $40,000 to $100,000. The reproposed
rule also would add a ``calendar day where the account is located'' time frame, which would address today's global
trading environment.

55

 As noted in the Proposing Release, the reproposed rules for aggregation would not apply to the reporting activity
level.

56

 







In addition, the reproposed rule would recognize that broker-dealers may prefer to report or ``dump'' all transactions
in a given security.

57

 In this regard, new paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of the reproposed rule would be added to permit broker-dealers to report
transactions that are less than 2,000 shares or fair market value of $100,000. Finally, paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of
the reproposed rule clarifies the proposed reporting provision for program trades and states that each transaction
that is part of a program trade shall be reported regardless of share quantity or fair market value. The Commission
believes that the reproposed reporting activity level would reduce the burden of the transaction reporting requirements.









3. Multiple Large Trader Identification Numbers 



The broker-dealer and bank commenters indicated that significant costs would be incurred for enlarging systems
and manually loading multiple LTIDs into their automated name and address records.

58

 This concern was a direct result of the proposed definition of a large trader and broad requirements for disclosure,
recordkeeping, and reporting of LTIDs of persons who own and control a given account. This concern was compounded
with respect to the proposed treatment of omnibus accounts.

59

 The commenters generally suggested that tax identification numbers or ID System numbers be used to alleviate this
burden. 






The Commission has sought to reduce the burden of multiple LTIDs. The Commission has chosen to accomplish this objective
through a narrowed definition of a large trader, reduced Form 13H information, limited disclosure of LTIDs, the use
of ID System numbers, and trade reporting requirements that incorporate these changes. 

The SIA generally expressed its concurrence with this solution to the concerns with the multiple LTID reporting requirements.

60

 The Commission, however, specifically solicits comments on the transaction reporting aspects of the reproposed
use of ID System numbers and any other information, systems, or procedures that would more effectively accomplish
the objectives of the Market Reform Act. 





4. Execution Times 


Due to the anticipated burden of automating execution times, the Commission proposed and solicited comments on a
two year plan to phase-in the automation of execution time reporting requirements. The Commission received substantial
comments from broker-dealers regarding the proposed execution time reporting requirements. One commenter acknowledged
that automated execution times were essential for reliable time-sequenced trading reconstructions and expressed
support for the proposed two year phase-in plan. However, the majority of the commenters asserted that the development
and implementation of automated systems for maintaining and reporting execution times would be costly. 
The commenters generally explained that in order to comply with the proposed rule, broker-dealers would be required
to develop and implement so-called ``automated order match systems.'' These order match systems would automatically
link or match the execution time recorded on customer order tickets with the execution time recorded on the corresponding
trade tickets prepared on the floor of an exchange. Without these systems broker-dealers would be required to manually
research and identify the execution time for each customer trade. 

Five broker-dealers and the SIA, on behalf of its members, supplied cost estimates. These cost estimates ranged from
a high of $8.5 million to a low of $17,000.

61

 These cost estimates included many different items, some of which were not intended by the proposed rule. For example,
many of these estimates included the cost of developing sophisticated systems that would fulfill the obligation
of broker-dealers to supervise compliance with the proposed rule. These systems presumably would identify related
accounts that may be required to be aggregated, through computer systems that employ forms of ``artificial intelligence.''

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940217-1-00023 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940217-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

During the review of these cost estimates, it appeared to the Commission that the magnitude of the cost may be dependent
upon the type of business conducted by a broker-dealer. The SIA acknowledged that broker-dealers with large retail
client bases, branch networks, or widely marketed clearing services would be more likely to have implemented an order
match system as a necessary cost of doing such business. Conversely, broker-dealers that primarily have institutional
clients and few branches would be less likely to have automated order match systems and the ability to enhance their
automated systems in a cost-effective manner. 
The commenters also indicated that ``average price'' trades and accounts compound their execution time concerns
exponentially.

62

 In addition, the commenters noted that a Commission request for transaction reports would likely come at times of
severe market stress, which typically stretch broker-dealer trade processing capabilities to their limits. Finally,
as a result of the proposed next business day reporting time frame, the commenters indicated that automation would
be the only feasible means to assure compliance. 




A few commenters suggested alternatives for reducing this burden that included requesting execution times on a need-to-know
basis, lengthening the reporting time frame, and postponing the effectiveness of the requirements to see how frequently
the data would be required. From the outset, the Commission has sought alternative solutions that would minimize
this burden while achieving the fundamental purpose of the large trader reporting provisions of the Market Reform
Act. The Commission staff, SIA, and SIAC have not identified existing industry systems that would gather execution
times for investor trading activity in a simple and accurate manner. 


Three alternatives that would require the development of new systems, however, were proposed. First, it was suggested
that ``branch or DOT'' sequence numbers could be used in conjunction with SRO audit trail data. While this suggestion
appeared to be workable with respect to ``system orders,''

63

 the SIA and SIAC agreed that this proposal would still require some form of automated order match system and may be considered
by some broker-dealers to be equally as burdensome with respect to ``manual orders.''

64

 





Second, after acknowledging that system order execution times did not pose a significant problem, the SIA proposed
the development of computer algorithms that would match ``order entry times'' with SRO audit trail data to determine
the execution time of manual orders. Third, the Division of Market Regulation proposed a hybrid of these alternatives
that bifurcates the execution time reporting requirements along the lines of system and manual orders.

65

 




After carefully weighing costs and benefits, the Commission has decided to repropose the Division's alternative
for reducing the burdens of the execution time reporting requirements. The reproposed reporting requirements are
found in new paragraphs (e) (3) and (4). 
Paragraph (e)(3) of the reproposed rule would provide that with respect to system orders, all transaction information
required to be maintained under the reproposed rule, including execution time, would be required to be reported to
the Commission or an SRO designated by the Commission before the close of business on the day specified in a request
for such information. As indicated in the Proposing Release, the Commission would not require reports to be submitted
prior to trade comparison and would consider pertinent market conditions as well as the capabilities of the industry's
trade processing facilities.

66

 Moreover, under the reproposed rule, the Commission may require the transmission of transaction reports after final
settlement because of the inclusion of cancellations and corrections within the definition of a transaction.

67

 





Paragraph (e)(4)(i) of the reproposed rule would provide that with respect to manual orders, all transaction information
required to be maintained, except execution time, would be required to be reported before the close of business on
the day specified in a request for such information. Lastly, new paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of the reproposed rule would
provide that the execution times of manual order transactions, which were initially reported without execution
times, would be required to be reported within 15 calendar days after a subsequent request for such information. It
should be noted that the Commission may request that broker-dealers provide such information for entire transaction
report submissions, individual transactions, or a group of related transactions. Further, these manual order execution
times would be required to be transmitted electronically, in machine-readable form, with all of the previously reported
information regarding each of the manual order transactions for which execution times were requested.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940217-1-00024 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940217-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission would carefully use these new reporting requirements to minimize the extent of extraneous information
gathered through the system. The combination of the reporting requirements for execution times and sequence numbers
would enable the Commission to generate accurate reconstructions of all large trader activity. Although these new
provisions may slow down the completion of trading reconstructions, the Commission believes that the resulting
analyses of trading reconstructions will be superior to any previous efforts in terms of accuracy, completeness,
and timeliness. The SIA expressed its concurrence with this solution to the execution time reporting requirement
concerns.

68

 




The Commission believes that the reporting requirements contained in the reproposed rule incorporate all existing
information or systems and would minimize associated burdens. Further, the Commission believes that these requirements
would strike a fair and reasonable balance between the costs of such reporting and the Commission's need to obtain
execution times. Finally, the Commission believes that the reproposed reporting requirements would establish
an efficient means for analyzing multi-layered accounts. 


E. Supervisory Safe Harbor 


Section 13(h)(2) of the Exchange Act provides a mechanism for supervision of the large trader reporting system by
authorizing the Commission to establish rules for recordkeeping and reporting of transactions effected by persons
a broker-dealer ``knows or has reason to know'' is a large trader, based on transactions effected directly or indirectly
by or through such broker-dealer.

69

 As proposed, the duty to supervise would apply to compliance with the identification requirements and would be imposed
on all broker-dealers and other large traders that effect transactions through, or maintain omnibus accounts with,
broker-dealers.

70

 





A number of comments on this aspect of the proposed rule were received from broker-dealers and banks. These comments
revolved around the scope of this duty and sought clarification concerning the steps to be taken to avoid liability
for their customers' intentional or unintentional failure to comply with the identification requirements of the
proposed rule.

71

 Many of the commenters focused on the lack of automated systems for cross-referencing or aggregating accounts that
may be commonly owned or controlled. The commenters extrapolated from this premise that the development of automated
systems for this purpose would be extremely expensive and unduly burdensome. The commenters also suggested that
the principal compliance burden should be placed on large traders and that an objective standard or ``safe harbor''
should be created. 





The Commission emphasizes that the reproposed rule places the principal burden of compliance with the identification
requirements on large traders. The Commission, however, also believes that some form of supervisory requirements
and systems, which are consistent with the self-regulatory framework of the Exchange Act, are necessary to assure
that the objectives of the Market Reform Act are fulfilled. 
Paragraph (f) of the reproposed rule would clarify and minimize the burden of the duty to supervise imposed by the ``reason
to know'' provisions of Section 13(h)(2) of the Exchange Act. This duty to supervise would apply to registered introducing
or correspondent broker-dealers that clear their transactions on an omnibus basis through a self-clearing broker-dealer.
Absent other indications, self-clearing broker-dealers would not normally be expected to supervise compliance
by such broker-dealers or their customers for whom transactions are effected through omnibus accounts. 
The Commission acknowledges that this duty to supervise would impose additional burdens on broker-dealers. Accordingly,
paragraph (f) of the reproposed rule would establish a ``safe harbor'' for the supervisory duty. This new paragraph
would initially provide that registered broker-dealers would not be deemed to know or have reason to know that a person
is a large trader if it does not have actual knowledge that a person is a large trader and has established policies and
procedures reasonably designed to assure compliance with the identification requirements of the reproposed rule.
Paragraphs (f) (1) and (2) of the reproposed rule provide the specific elements that would be required for the supervisory
safe harbor. 
Paragraph (f)(1) of the reproposed rule requires the establishment of systems ``reasonably designed to detect and
identify'' persons who have not complied with the identification requirements. This paragraph incorporates the
``reason to know'' standard and clarifies that, with respect to groups of accounts that may be identified as large
traders (i.e., commonly owned or controlled accounts), policies and procedures would be within the safe harbor if
they are reasonably designed to detect and identify such groups of accounts based on account name, tax identification
number, or other readily available information. 
The Commission would deem ``other readily available information'' to include, for example, those instances where
a single customer effects the requisite transactions through a single registered representative, trading desk,
or branch office in his or her personal accounts, accounts of family members, or accounts of others, pursuant to written
trading authorizations. Similarly, customer authorization to transfer funds or securities among accounts in order
to receive approval for trading activities, meet margin requirements, or to settle transactions, may be deemed other
readily available information.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940217-1-00025 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940217-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Paragraph (f)(2) of the reproposed rule also would require that broker-dealer supervisory policies and procedures
contain systems reasonably designed to inform persons and large traders of their obligations to file Form 13H and
disclose their large trader status. In this respect, questions and informative disclosures on new account applications,
as well as annual notices to identified and unidentified large traders, among other things, would be deemed by the
Commission to fulfill this element of the safe harbor. 

The Commission notes that the elements of the safe harbor do not specifically require automated systems, employee
training programs, or any other systems or procedures. The adequacy of supervisory procedures would depend on the
nature and characteristics of a broker-dealer's business. The Commission believes that many different systems
or procedures may be effective for accomplishing the objectives of the supervisory duties and, therefore, would
satisfy the requirements of the safe harbor. 

Paragraph (f) of the reproposed rule incorporates many of the suggestions contained in the comments for reducing
the burdens attendant to supervision of the system. The Commission believes that these new paragraphs add detail
and objectivity to the reason to know requirements of the Market Reform Act and, therefore, reduce the burden of the
supervisory scheme of the reproposed rule. The Commission also believes that these provisions are consistent with
the general supervisory obligation imposed on broker-dealers by the Exchange Act.

72

 The Commission, however, specifically solicits comments on the reproposed supervisory scheme and whether other
more effective means exist, within the limitations provided by the Market Reform Act, for assuring the accuracy or
reliability of information collected through the reproposed system and maintaining a level playing field between
broker-dealers and banks. 





F. Exemptions 



Section 13(h)(6) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to exempt any person or class of persons or any transaction
or class of transactions, either conditionally, upon specific terms and conditions, or for stated periods. The Commission
may provide for such exemptions through rules or orders that are consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act.

73

 





The commenters did not express objections to the proposed exemptions, which were based upon the capture of similar
information by SROs or involve activity generally deemed not to affect markets for publicly traded securities. The
commenters, however, suggested additional classes of persons and transactions that should be exempt. These suggested
exemptions included: (1) Introducing broker-dealers; (2) foreign and domestic market makers; (3) certain custodian
banks; (4) small investment managers; (5) unit investment trusts; (6) issuer repurchases; and (7) after-hours foreign
trading activity. 

Paragraph (g)(1) of the reproposed rule would specifically provide that certain broker-dealers are exempt from
the identification, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of the Rule. The reproposed rule would retain the
exemptions proposed (

i.e., 

specialists, option market makers, and floor brokers) and add market makers registered by a national securities
association to the extent that they are acting in their market making capacity. 

Paragraph (g)(2) of the reproposed rule would exempt certain transactions and introducing broker-dealers from
the reporting requirements. The specific transactions that would be exempt from the reporting requirements only
include those transactions effected by specialists, option market makers, and other market makers in the publicly
traded securities for which they are registered. In addition, paragraph (g)(2)(iii) has been added to definitively
exempt introducing broker-dealers that do not carry accounts for themselves or others from the reporting requirements
of the reproposed rule. 

The Commission believes that the comprehensive exemptions for entities that are subject to similar SRO recordkeeping
and reporting requirements would establish an equal competitive environment between all forms of market professionals
that are registered with an SRO. The Commission also believes that these exemptions would assure that the reproposed
system collects the appropriate information from the appropriate registered broker-dealers. 

With respect to other suggested exemptions, the Commission believes that some have been incorporated in portions
of the reproposed rule. For instance, the reproposed definition of a large trader, reduced scope of Form 13H, and inactive
filing status, would implicitly exempt or significantly reduce the burden on custodian banks or trust companies,
foreign market makers, and unit investment trusts.

74

 On the other hand, the Commission believes that some of the other suggested exemptions would not be consistent with
the purposes of the large trader reporting provisions of the Exchange Act.

75

 






The exemptive provisions of the reproposed rule acknowledge the existing systems for collecting similar information.
The Commission believes that these exemptions accomplish the purposes of the Market Reform Act and minimize the number
of persons affected by the various aspects of the reproposed rule.

G. Application to Foreign Entities 



In the Proposing Release, the Commission discussed the application of the proposed rule to foreign entities.

76

 The Commission was, and continues to be, concerned that excluding foreign entities and persons would leave domestic
markets and exchanges at a competitive disadvantage relative to foreign markets and exchanges. Moreover, the Commission
is concerned that the exclusion of foreign intermediaries (

i.e., 

broker-dealers and banks) that maintain omnibus accounts with domestic broker-dealers would competitively disadvantage
domestic intermediaries that perform omnibus trade execution or custodial functions for large traders. The Commission
believes that the preservation of a fair competitive environment is fundamental to the accomplishment of the purposes
of the Market Reform Act. 





The Commission solicited comments from foreign and domestic market participants and foreign regulatory agencies
regarding the application of the proposed rule and, specifically, alternative means for filing Form 13H, maintaining
Form 13H information, and assigning LTIDs. The Commission received 15 comments from foreign entities.

77

 These commenters questioned the extent to which the proposed rule would apply and asserted that compliance with the
proposed rule may cause breaches of certain local confidentiality requirements. 





Many of these commenters generally asserted, without explanation, that the application of the proposed rule was
unacceptable. A few of the commenters acknowledged the existence of memoranda of understanding (``MOUs''), however,
none offered specific ideas or sought further discussions regarding alternatives or the development of ``MOU-type''
understandings. It should be noted that, in an enforcement context, the Commission would continue to obtain information
from foreign regulatory authorities pursuant to existing MOU protocols. 

As discussed above, the application and scope of the reproposed rule would be established by the definition of a large
trader, which closely tracks Section 13(h)(8)(A) of the Exchange Act.

78

 The Commission also notes that foreign broker-dealers would not be subject to recordkeeping or transaction reporting
requirements of the reproposed rule. Accordingly, only foreign entities that are large traders would be subject
to the reproposed rule. The duties and burdens imposed on all large traders include: (1) Filing Form 13H; (2) disclosing
large trader status; (3) providing other information about accounts and reported transactions; and (4) if the foreign
large trader maintains or controls transactions in an omnibus account carried by a registered broker-dealer, and
the duty to assure compliance with the identification and disaggregation requirements of the reproposed rule. 





A foreign entity or person would be a large trader, thus subject to the reproposed rule, only if the following four elements
are present: (1) A person owns or controls an account or aggregated accounts; (2) such person effects aggregate transactions
in publicly traded securities that reach the identifying activity level; (3) such transactions are effected directly
or indirectly by or through accounts maintained by a registered broker-dealer; and (4) such transactions are effected
by use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails or any facility of a national securities
exchange. 

The various combinations of these elements are too numerous to discuss at length. However, the bounds of the application
of the reproposed rule may be explored through the analysis of two typical examples of securities activity that may
be referred to as ``foreign activity.'' First, assume that a foreign bank maintains an omnibus account with a domestic
registered broker-dealer. Through this omnibus account, the foreign bank effects trades in publicly traded securities
on a national securities exchange for its foreign customers (

i.e., 

citizens of, or persons domiciled in, a foreign country) that reach the identifying activity level. In this case,
the foreign bank would be a custodian or nominee large trader and would be required to: (1) File Form 13H and Schedules
7b and/or 8; (2) disclose its LTID and all such accounts to the registered broker-dealers carrying such accounts;
(3) assure compliance with the disaggregation and identification requirements as well as the accuracy of Schedules
7b or 8; and (4) if requested, disaggregate accounts or transactions. 

As noted above, the foreign bank large trader would not be required to disclose on its Form 13H the non-large trader
foreign customers whose trades are effected through its omnibus accounts. However, the reproposed rules would require
the foreign bank large trader to assure that the information contained on Schedules 7b and 8 is accurate and complete.
Accordingly, the foreign bank large trader would be required to disclose to the Commission the LTID or IID System numbers
of its identified large trader customers. 

In addition, if the foreign bank large trader effects transactions through such omnibus accounts for one of its customers
and such transactions reach the identifying activity level, then in order to assure compliance with the disaggregation
and identification requirements of the reproposed rule, the foreign bank large trader would have a duty to advise
such foreign customer of its duty to file Form 13H and disclose its status in accordance with the reproposed rule. This
duty would apply to the foreign bank large trader whether the customer's transactions were effected on a discretionary
or non-discretionary basis. 

For a second example, assume that a registered broker-dealer carries the account of a domestic or foreign customer,
and it effects a program trade in publicly traded securities in a foreign over-the-counter market or exchange. In
order to effect the trade, the registered broker-dealer transmits the order information by facsimile to a foreign
broker-dealer affiliate. Further, assume that the affiliated foreign broker-dealer effects the transaction for
an omnibus account which it carries in the name of the domestic broker-dealer. 

This activity would cause the foreign or domestic customer to be a large trader because it owned accounts, had effected
the requisite trades indirectly through an account maintained by a registered broker-dealer, and through the means
or instrumentality of interstate commerce. 

Alternatively, if the foreign broker-dealer exercised control over the transaction then it also would be a large
trader because it would have controlled accounts and effected the requisite trades by or through an account carried
by a registered broker-dealer. Conversely, neither the customer or foreign broker-dealer would be large traders
if the trade was effected exclusively by or for an account owned or controlled by the foreign or domestic customer and
carried by the foreign broker-dealer, because the transaction would not be effected directly or indirectly by or
for an account carried by a registered broker-dealer. 

As discussed above, the identification requirements would significantly clarify and narrow the scope of the reproposed
rule and, thereby, reduce the associated burdens on all large traders. Accordingly, the Commission believes that
the burdens imposed on foreign large traders are necessary and appropriate, not unduly burdensome, and are imposed
uniformly on domestic and foreign markets, exchanges, intermediaries, and investors.

H. Proposed Implementation 


The Commission proposes that the transaction reporting requirements contained in paragraph (e) of the reproposed
rule become effective 18 months after adoption of the final rule. The Commission believes that this time frame would
provide sufficient time for the securities information processors and broker-dealers to plan, design, and implement
all of the various enhancements to existing transaction reporting systems required by the reproposed rule. During
this implementation period, the Commission would conduct periodic tests of the trade reporting system and work closely
with broker-dealers, SIAC, and the ISG to develop all of the technical data processing software required by the reproposed
rule. 
The Commission believes that this implementation objective would facilitate the cost-effective development of
the transaction reporting systems required by the reproposed rule. The Commission specifically solicits comments
on whether the proposed 18 month period would be feasible. 


I. Statutory Authority 


Section 13(h)(5) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission, when exercising its rulemaking authority for large
trader reporting, to consider: (1) Existing reporting systems; (2) the costs associated with keeping and reporting
large trader information; and (3) the relationship between United States and international securities markets.
The Commission considered these requirements when formulating the proposed rule and firmly believed that, notwithstanding
certain elements of the proposed rule that may cause market participants to incur additional costs, the proposed
system minimized costs in virtually every respect. The additional costs acknowledged by the Commission, included:
(1) Preparation, filing, and updating Form 13H; (2) maintenance and reporting of large trader transaction information;
(3) maintenance and reporting of LTIDs and execution times; and (4) development and implementation of supervisory
systems and procedures. 
The reproposed rule reflects the Commission's commitment to work with market participants to incorporate all existing
industry systems that would minimize the costs associated with the reproposed system. The reproposed rule also reflects
the Commission's conscious decision to shift substantial portions of the burdens imposed by the proposed rule from
market participants to the Commission. Further, the foreign application of the reproposed rule has been carefully
considered in light of its impact on the relationship between foreign and domestic securities markets, intermediaries,
and investors.
The Commission believes that the comments on the proposed rule highlight the complexity of designing a simple and
efficient large trader system that accommodates many different types of large traders as well as business practices
and procedures. Faced with these conflicting needs and practices, the Commission is reproposing rules that it believes
would minimize the costs and burdens imposed on the greatest number of affected market participants. 
The Commission believes that the reproposed rule narrows and clarifies the definition of a large trader, and thus
reduces the costs and burdens of the system. The revisions to the identification requirements, through the various
definitions and rules for aggregation, have significantly reduced the number of persons who would be subject to the
identification requirements of the reproposed rule. The inactive filing status, and the other filing or disclosure
requirements, have been revised to incorporate other existing information and eliminate unnecessary information.

The Commission believes that the information captured and disclosed under the reproposed identification requirements
would be the minimum necessary for creating an effective large trader reconstruction tool. Moreover, the Commission
believes that such information would be collected or disclosed in a fashion that approximates existing systems,
practices, and procedures commonly used by all forms of large traders.

79

 




The modifications and additions to the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the reproposed rule would significantly
clarify their application and reduce technical burdens. The Commission believes that the reproposed rule's additional
elements of transaction information, combined with the new reporting requirements for multiple LTIDs and system
or manual order execution times, incorporate existing recordkeeping and reporting practices, procedures, and
systems for customer trade information. As a result, the Commission believes that the reproposed recordkeeping
and reporting requirements would provide the least burdensome method of collecting large trader transaction information.

The supervisory provisions of the reproposed rule would clarify the duty to supervise. The supervisory obligations
also would assure the credibility of the reproposed system and a level playing field between broker-dealers and other
omnibus large traders to the greatest extent permitted by the Market Reform Act. The Commission believes that the
new safe harbor provision provides meaningful detail and objectivity that would considerably reduce the burden
of the supervisory duties. The Commission also believes that the reduced burdens of the identification requirements
may foster greater compliance with the reproposed rule and indirectly reduce the supervisory burden of broker-dealers
and omnibus large traders. 
The Commission believes that the reproposed rule's application to foreign entities and persons would accomplish
the objectives of the Market Reform Act by maintaining uniformity between domestic and foreign markets, exchanges,
intermediaries, and investors. Finally, the Commission believes that the proposed plan for implementing the transaction
reporting system would facilitate its cost-effective development. 


IV. Conclusion 


The Commission is reproposing Rule 13h-1 and Form 13H, which would establish an activity-based identification,
recordkeeping, and reporting system for large trader accounts and transactions. This system would enable the Commission
to gather large trader information in a timely manner and in the form necessary to reconstruct trading activity in
periods of market stress and for surveillance, enforcement, and other regulatory purposes. The Commission believes
that the reproposed rule achieves the objectives of the Market Reform Act and would establish an effective market
reconstruction tool that minimizes costs.

V. Effects on Competition and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 




Section 23(a) of the Exchange Act

80

 requires that the Commission, when proposing rules under the Exchange Act, consider the effects on competition of
such rules, if any, and balance any anti-competitive impact against the regulatory benefits gained in terms of furthering
the purposes of the Exchange Act. The Commission is of the view that the Rule will not result in any burden on competition
that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. 






Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act,

81

 the Commission previously prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (``IRFA''), concerning the proposed
rule. The IRFA indicated that the proposed rule may impose some additional costs on small broker-dealers, small investment
advisers, and small investors. The Commission has prepared a revised IRFA that details the changes to the proposed
rule found in the reproposed rule. The Commission believes that the reproposed rule has been structured in a manner
that further minimizes the costs of the reproposed system and fulfills the requirements of the Market Reform Act and
section 13(h) of the Exchange Act. A copy of the revised IRFA may be obtained from Cameron D. Smith, Staff Attorney,
Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549,
(202) 272-5418.

by, or under common ownership or control with such person, which independently would not be a large trader, shall be
aggregated; and 


(iii) Under no circumstances shall a person or group of persons acting in concert toward a common investment objective,
be permitted to disaggregate accounts owned or controlled by or under the common ownership or control of such person

Generally.

 The Commission may require a large trader to disaggregate accounts or transactions in any manner, and provide additional
transaction or other information relating to transactions previously reported by a registered broker or dealer,
in such cases and upon reasonable terms and conditions considering the operational capabilities of such large trader,
when it determines such to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or
otherwise in the furtherance of the purposes of this section. 

(ii) 

Omnibus accounts.

 Large traders that effect transactions through or maintain omnibus accounts with a registered broker or dealer shall
establish and maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to assure compliance with the disaggregation
and identification requirements of this section and, in particular, assure the accuracy and completeness of Schedules
7b or 8 to Form 13H. Policies and procedures that are substantially comparable to those described in paragraph (f)
of this section shall be deemed to be in compliance with this section.

Generally.

 Every registered broker or dealer that carries accounts for large traders and persons such broker or dealer knows
or has reason to know are large traders, based on transactions effected by or through such broker or dealer, shall maintain
records of all elements of information for all transactions effected directly or indirectly by or through an account
carried by such broker or dealer for all large traders and persons that such broker or dealer knows or has reason to know
are large traders.

is effected; 

(xii) The code, identification, or sequence number assigned to a transaction that was routed or effected through
an automated order routing system maintained by a self-regulatory organization; and 

(xiii) Any other codes, designations, or identifiers that the Commission may deem necessary or appropriate for compliance
with the recordkeeping or reporting requirements of this section. 

(3) 

Retention.

 The records and information required to be made and kept pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be kept for
such periods of time as provided in  240.17a-4(b). 

(e) 

Reporting requirements for brokers and dealers.

_(1) 

Generally.

 Upon the request of the Commission, or a self-regulatory organization designated by the Commission, every registered
broker or dealer that carries accounts for large traders and other persons for whom records must be maintained, shall
electronically report in machine-readable form and in accordance with instructions issued by the Commission, all
elements of information for all transactions effected directly or indirectly by or through accounts carried by such
broker or dealer for large traders and other persons for whom records must be maintained, which equal or exceed the
reporting activity level. 

(2) The term 

reporting activity level

 means: 

(i) Each transaction in publicly traded securities, effected during a calendar day where the account is located,
that is equal to or greater than the lesser of 2,000 shares or fair market value of $100,000; 

(ii) Any other transaction in publicly traded securities of lesser amount, that a registered broker or dealer may
deem appropriate; 

(iii) Each transaction, regardless of share quantity or fair market value, that is part of a group of transactions
that constitute program trading; or

<PARENT> FR940217-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(i) All elements of information for all transactions required to be maintained, except the time that the transaction
was executed, before the close of business on the day specified in a request for such transaction information; and

(ii) The time that each of such transactions were executed, within 15 calendar days after receipt of a specific request
for such information. 
(5)

broker or dealer knows or has reason to know is a large trader, all elements of information for all transactions required
to be maintained and such person's name, address, date that the account was opened, and tax identification number(s)
shall be reported. 
(f) 

Supervisory safe harbor. 

For the purposes of this section, a registered broker or dealer shall not be deemed to know or have reason to know that
a person is a large trader if it establishes policies and procedures reasonably designed to assure compliance with
the identification requirements of this section and does not have actual knowledge that a person is a large trader.
Policies and procedures shall be deemed to satisfy this section, if they include: 
(1) Systems reasonably designed to detect and identify persons that have not complied with the identification requirements
of this section, which such broker-dealer knows or has reason to know is a large trader, based upon transactions effected
through an account or a group of accounts, that may be identified as a large trader, based on account name, tax identification
number, or other information readily available to such broker-dealer; and 
(2) Systems reasonably designed to inform large traders of their obligations to file Form 13H and disclose large trader
status under this section. 
(g) 

Exemptions.

_(1) 

Comprehensive. 

The identification, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this section shall not apply to any registered
broker or dealer that does not carry accounts for itself or others, and: 
(i) Is registered as a specialist or option market maker by a national securities exchange; 
(ii) Is a member or allied member of a national securities exchange that exclusively executes transactions on the
floor of such national securities exchange; or 
(iii) Is registered as a market maker by a national securities association to the extent that it effects transactions
in its capacity as a registered market maker. 
(2) 

Reporting requirements.

General Instructions for Form 13h 



The following instructions are intended for guidance in completing form 13H and do not provide the full text of the
applicable federal laws and regulations. See section 13(h) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C.  78m(h)],
rule 13h-1 [17 CFR 240.13h-1], and form 13H [17 CFR 249.327] for the full text of the applicable statutes
and rules.



A. Persons Required to File Form 13H. 



Every person that is a Large Trader must file Form 13H with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission).
Upon filing Form 13H, a Large Trader will be assigned a large trader identification number (LTID) by the Commission.


Definition of a Large Trader. The term ``Large Trader'' means every person who owns or controls an account, that effects
transactions for the purchase or sale of a publicly traded securities, by use of any means or instrumentality of interstate
commerce or the mails, or any facility of a national securities exchange, directly or indirectly by or through a registered
broker or dealer, in an aggregate amount equal to or in excess of the identifying activity level. The term ``Person''
includes any natural person, trustee, company, government, political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality
of a government, except foreign central banks, and also includes two or more persons acting as a partnership, limited
partnership, syndicate, or other group. Persons that may be Large Traders include individuals, broker-dealers,
mutual funds, private and public pension funds, hedge funds, investment advisers, insurance companies, banks,
and trust companies. 

Large Trader Accounts. The purpose of Form 13H is to provide a system through which the Commission may efficiently
identify large trading accounts and the person or group of persons that own and control large trading accounts. The
term ``Account'' means each proprietary and customer account maintained or carried on the books and records of a registered
broker-dealer. 

Ownership of Accounts. An account of a person is deemed to be owned or under common ownership of the natural person,
company, limited partnership, partnership, and trustee in whose name an account is maintained, or custodian or nominee
that maintains an omnibus account or account otherwise undisclosed as to ownership, and any other person who has more
than a 10 percent financial interest in the equity in the accounts of the person. 

Control of Accounts. An account of a person is deemed to be controlled or under the common control of the owner of the
account, and any other person that has received from or been assigned by the owner of an account, full or limited investment
discretion or authority to direct transactions for the account. The term ``Full Discretionary Investment Authority''
means the discretion to enter an order or orders for the account of another of any size, at any time or price, without
the prior instruction or approval of the owner of the account.

<TEXT>
 

The term ``Limited Discretionary Investment Authority'' means the discretion to enter an order or orders for the
account of another, limited to time or price only, upon the express prior instruction or approval of the owner of the
account. 
Large Trader Transactions. The term ``Transaction'' means all transactions in publicly traded securities, including
cancellations, corrections, and exercises or assignments of option contracts, except for certain specific transactions.
The excluded transactions, include: journal or bookkeeping entries; offerings of securities under the Securities
Act of 1933; gifts; transactions effected under a court order of appointment or distribution of property in a decedents
estate or divorce proceeding; a qualified rollover of retirement plan assets; or transactions between employees
and employers that are part of an employer benefit or compensatory arrangement. The term ``Publicly Traded Securities''
includes all exchange listed and other national market system securities that are subject to an effective real-time
transaction reporting plan. 
Identifying Activity Level. The term ``Identifying Activity Level'' means aggregate transactions of 150,000 shares
or fair market value of $7.5 million, effected during any calendar day where the large trader's account is located,
or any transactions that constitute program trading. The term ``program trading'' means index arbitrage or any strategy
involving the related purchase or sale 15 or more securities with a total value of $1 million or more. 
Aggregation of Accounts. A person or group of persons may aggregate those accounts that are directly or indirectly
owned or controlled, or under common ownership or control of a person or group of persons that independently would
be large traders. A person or group of persons, however, must aggregate those accounts that are directly or indirectly
owned or controlled, or under common ownership or control of a person or group of persons that independently would
not be large traders. An aggregated Form 13H for a group of persons may be filed by any of the commonly owned or controlled
persons within the group that independently would be a large trader. 
For example, diverse financial service holding companies or partnerships may have divisions, subsidiaries, or
affiliated companies or partnerships, which independently are large traders, based on transactions effected by
or for the accounts of the division, subsidiary, affiliate, or partner. These companies and partnerships would be
permitted, but are not required, to aggregate into a single Form 13H all accounts owned or controlled by each division,
subsidiary, affiliate, or partner. Conversely, the accounts of any division, subsidiary, affiliate, or partner
that independently would not be a large trader would be required to be aggregated into the Form 13H filing of a parent,
subsidiary, affiliate, or partner. 
Large Traders and authorized persons preparing and filing Form 13H should note that a person, or group of persons acting
in concert toward a common investment objective, are prohibited from using the flexibility afforded by these rules
to avoid filing Form 13H or to otherwise avoid the identification requirements of Rule 13h-1. Additionally, a person
or group of persons that choose to aggregate accounts of persons that independently would be large traders should
note that requests for disaggregation may be received from the Commission. 
Aggregation of Transactions. All transactions in publicly traded equity and option securities must be aggregated
among or within aggregated accounts, without offsetting or netting purchase and sale transactions, and based upon
the gross, un-hedged, or absolute value of all purchase and sale transactions. The ``gross value of an individual
equity option'' is either: (i) the number of shares underlying the contract multiplied by the number of contracts
purchased and sold; or (ii) the strike price of the contract multiplied by the applicable multiplier and the number
of contracts purchased and sold. The ``gross value of options on a group or index of equity securities'' is the strike
price of the contract multiplied by the applicable multiplier and the number of contracts purchased and sold. Transactions
in index options are not required to be ``burst'' into share equivalents for each of the underlying component equities.

The determination of ``who'' is a large trader and ``what'' information is to be included on form 13H are dependent
upon the accounts or group of accounts that a large trader chooses to aggregate into a particular form 13H. Persons
authorized to file form 13H should carefully review all general and special instructions regarding aggregation
or disaggregation of accounts before filing form 13H. See special instructions to form 13H_item-5_for further instructions
regarding aggregation or disaggregation of accounts by a large trader. 


B. Form and Schedules Required to be Filed. 


Form 13H and Schedules may be filed manually or electronically in accordance with the rules and regulations the Commission
may prescribe. If the filing is submitted manually, the filing shall include three (3) copies of Form 13H and Schedules.

All Large Traders must complete and submit Form 13H and one or more of the Schedules to Items 6, 7, or 8. In addition, all
Large Traders that check ``NO'' in Item 2, because they are not registered by or otherwise required to file information
with the Commission, must complete Item 4 and submit one of the following three Schedules: 
(1) Individuals: Schedule 4a. 
(2) Joint Tenants or Partnerships: Schedule 4b. 
(3) Corporations or Trustees: Schedule 4c. 
All Large Traders that check ``YES'' in Item 2, and provide the applicable information regarding other registrations
or filings with the Commission, are not required to complete Item 4 or any of the corresponding Schedules. 
See special instructions to form 13H_items 2 and 4_for further instructions regarding commission registrations
or filings and the applicability of schedules 4a through 4c. 


C. Time Required for Filing Form 13H. 


Initial Filing. Form 13H and Schedules must be filed with the Commission within 10 business days after a person first
effects transactions that reach the identifying activity level. 
Annual Filing. Form 13H and Schedules must be filed with the Commission within 60 calendar days after the end of each
full calendar-year.

<TEXT>
 

Inactive Filing. A Large Trader may become inactive, thus exempt from the annual filing and disclosure requirements,
upon filing its annual Form 13H for the previous full calendar year in which it has 

not

 effected: (1) aggregate transactions that equal or exceed the Identifying Activity Level; 

and

 (2) an aggregate calendar year total of 2,000,000 shares or fair market value of $30,000,000. Any inactive large trader
that subsequently effects transactions that again reach the identifying activity level must make an initial filing
within 10 business days after it effects the ``re-identifying transactions.'' 



D. Confidentiality. 



All information disclosed on Form 13H may not be compelled to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA'')
because the information is specifically exempted from disclosure by Section 13(h)(7) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, and the statute establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of information
to be withheld. The Commission, however, is not authorized to withhold information from Congress, or any other federal
department or agency requesting information for purposes within the scope of its jurisdiction, or complying with
an order of a court of the United States in an action brought by the United States or the Commission. 



Special Instructions for Form 13H and schedules



A. Instructions for Form 13H_Cover Page. 



Type of Filing. Indicate the type of Form 13H filing by checking the appropriate box at the top of the cover page to Form
13H. 

If the filing is an ``Initial Filing'' indicate the first date on which transactions were effected that reached the
identifying activity level. An initial filing must include a manually signed Form 13H and all applicable Schedules.


If the filing is an ``Annual Filing'' indicate the ending date of the appropriate calendar year and list the specific
Items or Schedules that are amended or changed. An annual filing must only include a manually signed cover page and
those pages of Form 13H or Schedules that have been amended or changed. If no Items or Schedules to Form 13H have been
amended or changed, indicate ``NONE'' in the space provided and only file a manually signed cover page to Form 13H.


If the filing is an ``Inactive Filing'' indicate the date that the Large Trader last effected aggregate transactions
that reached the identifying activity level. A Large Trader shall become inactive, and exempt from the annual filing
and LTID disclosure requirements, upon filing. 

If the filing is a ``Corrected Filing'' indicate the type and date of the filing that is being corrected. This type of
filing is not required but may be made to correct a previous filing. 

All filings should indicate the applicable LTID assigned by the Commission and the Taxpayer Identification Number(s)
of the Large Trader. Initial filings will not be required to include a LTID. In addition, all filings should disclose
the Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') Institutional Delivery System (``ID System'') number(s) of the Large Trader
that are applicable to the accounts identified in the specific Form 13H. An inactive large trader that effects re-identifying
transactions will retain the LTID initially assigned to it by the Commission. 

The unchanged or unamended portions of a large trader's form 13H and schedules need not be filed annually.



B. Instructions for Form 13H_Items 1 Through 5. 



Item 1. Business of the Large Trader. Specify the type of business of the Large Trader by checking one or more of the listed
business types. If the Large Trader is an individual, check ``Other'' and specify the occupation of such individual.
Large Trader banks, trust companies and thrift institutions should check ``Other Financial Institution.'' If the
Large Trader is engaged in more than one type of business, check each type that applies to the Large Trader. 

The types of businesses checked should reflect the businesses of other large traders whose accounts are aggregated
into the Form 13H by the Large Trader. For example, if the aggregated accounts of the Large Trader are accounts owned
by other persons but controlled by the Large Trader only as an investment adviser, check only ``Investment Adviser,''
even though the Large Trader may be a division, subsidiary, or affiliate of a broker-dealer that has independently
filed Form 13H. 

Item 2. SEC Registrations. Indicate whether the Large Trader is an issuer of securities under the Securities Act of
1933, or registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, or otherwise is required to file or report information to the Commission that is substantially
similar to the information required in the Schedules to Item 4 (e.g., name, location and nature of the business of individual
owners, partners, executive officers, directors, and trustees of the Large Trader). If ``Yes'' is checked, provide
the applicable types of registrations and SEC or Central Registration Depository (``CRD'') file numbers. 

The types of registrations or filings listed should reflect the registrations of other large traders and persons
whose accounts are aggregated into the Form 13H of the Large Trader. Therefore, if all of the persons whose accounts
are aggregated into the Form 13H are covered by one of the listed registrations or filings, then the Large Trader is
not required to complete Item 4 or any of the corresponding Schedules. However, if any person whose accounts are aggregated
into the Form 13H of the Large Trader is not covered by one of the listed registrations or filings, then the Large Trader
is required to complete Item 4 and the corresponding Schedule for the ``un-registered'' person. 

SEC file numbers may be obtained by calling the commission's public reference room and CRD number may be obtained by
calling the member services office of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), during normal business
hours.

Item 3. CFTC Registrations. Indicate whether the Large Trader is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC) as a ``Reporting Trader'' pursuant to Sections 4i and 9 of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1974, or otherwise is
registered under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1974. If ``Yes'' is checked, specify the number and type of registration.

Item 4. Type of Large Trader. If the Large Trader checked ``NO'' in Item 2, then check one of the listed organization
types and complete the applicable Schedule. If any other large traders whose accounts are aggregated into the Form
13H of the Large Trader are not covered by one of the registrations or filings listed in Item 2, then check one of the listed
organization types and complete the applicable Schedules for these un-registered persons. The Schedules to Item
4 capture information about the following types of un-registered Large Traders whose accounts are aggregated into
Form 13H: 

Schedule 4a. Individuals. 

Schedule 4b. Joint Tenants or general partners, and in the case of limited partners, each limited partner that is the
owner of more than a 10 percent financial interest in the accounts of the Large Trader. 

Schedule 4c. Executive officers or directors of a corporation, and all trustees for a private or public trust. 

The Large Trader must provide full names, addresses, and all other information required on these Schedules. 

Item 5. Aggregation of accounts by the Large Trader. 

Aggregated Accounts. Indicate in Item 5(a) whether the Large Trader has aggregated accounts of other persons in its
Form 13H, which independently would be large traders. If the Large Trader has aggregated the accounts of other persons,
list the name of the other person and its relationship to the Large Trader (e.g., division, subsidiary, affiliate,
or partner). 

Disaggregated Accounts. Indicate in Item 5(b) whether other Large Traders that are owned or controlled by or under
common ownership or control with the Large Trader have independently filed a Form 13H and been assigned LTIDs. If the
Large Trader has not aggregated the accounts of other Large Traders, list the name of each other large trader, its LTID,
and its relationship to the Large Trader (e.g., division, subsidiary, affiliate, or partner). If the Large Trader
does not know the LTIDs of the other large traders at the time of filing, it must provide all of these numbers in its next
Annual Filing. 

Form 13h_Items 1 Through 5_Must Reflect the Large Trader's Choice for Aggregation or Disaggregation of Accounts
of Other Persons and Large Traders. See Special Instructions to Form 13h_Items 6 Through 8_For Further Instructions
Regarding Disaggregation By a Large Trader. 



C. Instructions for Form 13H_Items 6 Through 8



Lists of Large Trader Accounts. Items 6 through 8 are organized along the three capacities in which a Large Trader may
act with respect to a single account (i.e., owner, controller, or custodian). The Schedules correspond to Items 6
through 8 and are organized to capture different combinations of these capacities, based upon the Large Trader's
knowledge of information about accounts and the disclosure of ownership to the broker-dealer carrying the account.
The Schedules to Items 6 through 8 require a Large Trader to list information about the following types of accounts:


Schedule 6a. Accounts that are owned and controlled by the Large Trader, in whole or in part. 

Schedule 6b. Accounts that are owned but not controlled by the Large Trader, in whole or in part, which are controlled
by others. 

Schedule 7a. Accounts that are not owned but are controlled by the Large Trader, in whole or in part, which are fully
disclosed as to ownership. 

Schedule 7b. Accounts that are not owned but are controlled by the Large Trader, in whole or in part, which are undisclosed
as to ownership. 

Schedule 8. Accounts maintained by the Large Trader as custodian or nominee only, which are undisclosed as to ownership.


Depending on a Large Trader's choice for aggregation of accounts, one or more of these schedules must be filed with
Form 13H. The schedules attached to Form 13H must reflect the types of accounts that the Large Trader has chosen to aggregate
into its Form 13H. 

Information Required in the Schedules. The Large Trader must provide full names, addresses, and all other information
required on Schedules 6a through 8. Large Traders may attach internally produced lists of accounts to the Schedules
provided that such lists capture all required information in a format substantially similar to each of the Schedules.
If the Large Trader does not know the LTID or DTC ID System number of other Large Traders at the time of filing, it must
provide all of such numbers in its next Annual Filing. 

Qualifications of the Designated Contact Person. The Large Trader is required to designate a contact person for information
regarding the accounts listed on each Schedule. The designated contact person must: (i) be a natural person; (ii)
be employed by or otherwise affiliated with the Large Trader; (iii) be authorized by the Large Trader to respond to
any inquiries or requests from the Commission; (iv) have personal knowledge of all orders and transactions in the
accounts listed on the Schedule or be in a position to obtain this information promptly from other persons who have
such personal knowledge; and (v) have the authority to provide prompt assistance with the disaggregation of the listed
accounts. 

Disaggregation of Aggregated and Undisclosed Accounts. In the event that the Commission requests, all broker-dealers
or large traders that carry or maintain aggregated or undisclosed accounts may be required to assist in the disaggregation
of transactions or accounts. The Commission may request disaggregation in any reasonable manner considering the
operational capabilities of each broker-dealer or large trader. For example, the Commission may require the Large
Trader to disaggregate accounts or transactions of the other persons and Large Traders listed in Form 13H_Item 5(a).
The Commission also may require the Large Trader to disaggregate accounts or transactions of the other Large Traders
listed in Schedules 7b and 8. 

All Large Traders That Control or Maintain Omnibus or Otherwise Undisclosed Accounts Have a Duty to Supervise These
Accounts to Assure that Persons Effecting Transactions Through These accounts Comply with the Identification Requirements
of Rule 13h-1 and to Assure That the Information Contained in Schedules 7b AND 8 is Accurate and Complete.

Ocean Dumping; Proposed Designation of Site


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA proposes to designate a deep ocean disposal site (proposed SF-DODS) located off San Francisco, California, for
the disposal of suitable dredged material removed from the San Francisco Bay and other nearby harbors or dredging
sites. EPA has tentatively determined that the site designated in the Final EIS as the preferred site will be the site
designated as SF-DODS in this proposed rule. The center of the proposed SF-DODS is located approximately 49 nautical
miles (91 kilometers) west of the Golden Gate and occupies an area of approximately 6.5 square nautical miles (22 square
kilometers). Water depths within the area range between 8,200 to 9,840 feet (2,500 to 3,000 meters). The center coordinates
of the oval-shaped site are: 37
  39.0' North latitude by 123
  29.0' West longitude (North American Datum from 1983), with length (north-south axis) and width (west-east
axis) dimensions of approximately 4 nautical miles (7.5 kilometers) and 2.5 nautical miles (4.5 kilometers), respectively.
This action is necessary to provide an acceptable ocean dumping site for disposal of suitable dredged material, as
determined by appropriate sediment testing protocols. The proposed designation of SF-DODS is for a period of 50 years,
and a maximum of 6 million cubic yards of dredged material per year. Disposal operations will be prohibited if resources
for implementing the site management and monitoring program are not available.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


The supporting document for this proposed designation is the 

Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Designation of a Deep Water Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Site
off San Francisco, California, August 1993

, which is available for public inspection at the following locations:

A. Background 


Section 102(c) of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) of 1972, as amended, 33 U.S.C. 1401


et seq.

, gives the Administrator of EPA authority to designate sites where ocean dumping may be permitted. On October 1, 1986
the Administrator delegated authority to designate ocean dredged material disposal sites (ODMDS) to the Regional
Administrator of the EPA Region in which the sites are located. The proposed SF-DODS designation action is being made
pursuant to that authority.
The EPA Ocean Dumping Regulations (40 CFR 228.4) state that ocean dumping sites will be designated by publication
pursuant to 40 CFR part 228. This
proposed site designation is being published as a proposed rulemaking in accordance with  228.4(e) of the Ocean
Dumping Regulations, which permits the designation of ocean disposal sites for dredged material. Interested persons
may participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting written comments within 30 days of the date of this publication
to the address given above. 
The center of the proposed SF-DODS is located approximately 49 nautical miles (91 kilometers) west of the Golden Gate
and occupies an area of approximately 6.5 square nautical miles (22 square kilometers). Water depths within the area
range between approximately 8,200 to 9,840 feet (2,500 to 3,000 meters). The center coordinates of the oval-shaped
site are: 37
  39.0' North latitude by 123
  29.0' West longitude (North American Datum from 1983), with length (north-south axis) and width (west-east
axis) dimensions of approximately 4 nautical miles (7.5 kilometers) and 2.5 nautical miles (4.5 kilometers), respectively.
EPA Region IX now proposes to designate SF-DODS as an ocean dredged material disposal site for continued use for a period
of 50 years and not to exceed 6 million cubic yards of dredged material in any one year period. Site use is subject to a
Site Management and Monitoring Plan (SMMP), of which the goals and objectives are described in the Final EIS and summarized
in Section G below. A draft SMMP will be made available for public review through a separate Public Notice process.
The draft SMMP, currently under development, incorporates a tiered site monitoring structure and MPRSA section
103 permit review. The SMMP will available from the EPA Region IX office address given above.


B. EIS Development


Section 102(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

, requires that Federal agencies prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on proposals for major Federal
actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The object of NEPA is to build into the Agency
decision-making process careful consideration of all environmental aspects of proposed actions.
A notice of availability of the Draft EIS was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 11, 1992 discussing EPA Region IX's intent to designate a deep water ocean dredged material disposal site
off San Francisco (57 FR 58805). EPA Region IX prepared a Draft EIS titled: Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
for San Francisco Bay Deep Water Dredged Material Disposal Site Designation. The comment period ended on January
25, 1993. EPA Region IX received 35 comment letters on the Draft EIS and incorporated changes where appropriate. On
September 10, 1993, notice of availability for public review and comment on the Final EIS was published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 47741). The comment period for the Final EIS ended on October 29, 1993. Anyone desiring a copy of the proposed
rule or the Final EIS may obtain them from the EPA Region IX office address given above.


C. Responses to Final EIS Comments 


During the public comment period on the Final EIS, which closed on October 29, 1993, EPA Region IX received 9 comment
letters. The following substantive comments were discussed in these letters.



1. Fisheries Valuation


The National marine sanctuaries (Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, Cordell Bank National Marine
Sanctuary, and Monterey National Marine Sanctuary/North) commented that the values presented in the Final EIS for
fisheries valuation were inaccurate. 

Response:

 These fisheries values, extracted from published documents, represented total estimated values for the different
fisheries. EPA Region IX recognizes that calculated values for these fisheries will vary according to the methods
used. However, the comparison of the alternative sites and selection of the preferred alternative site with respect
to fisheries was based on landings (abundance) of all important commercial and recreational fish and did not require
the use of assigned fisheries values. EPA Region IX, with concurrence by the California Department of Fish and Game
(CDFG), determined that the existing and potential fisheries resources within Alternative Site 5 are minimal and
the site is removed from more important fishing grounds located near Alternative Sites 3 and 4.


2. Beneficial Use of Dredged Material


The Department of Water Resources (DWR) commented on the importance of beneficial use of dredged material as an option
acknowledged in the Final EIS. DWR elaborated on the successes of demonstration projects for levee maintenance which
showed no adverse impacts on soil and water quality resulting from the placement of marine sediments. 


Response:

 EPA Region IX acknowledges these and other successes and expects that all beneficial use options will be evaluated
further by the Long Term Management Strategy (LTMS) through the development of the Policy and Programmatic EIS/EIR.
The availability of specific opportunities for beneficial use of dredged material will be evaluated on a case-by-case
(permit-by-permit) basis before an ocean disposal permit is issued.


3. Incorporation of the Site Management and Monitoring Plan (SMMP) into the Final EIS


The CDFG commented that the SMMP ``be joined to the Final EIS through either the Federal rule-making process or supplemental
(NEPA) process.'' 


Response:

 The purpose of the Final EIS is to analyze alternative disposal sites. EPA Region IX shares the concerns that CDFG,
the National Marine Sanctuaries, and other public interest/environmental groups have about adequate management
and monitoring of the proposed SF-DODS during disposal activities. It is Region IX's intent to implement a site management
and monitoring plan for the life of proposed SF-DODS. EPA Region IX will commit to implementing an adequate SMMP in
the rule-making and the Record of Decision.


4. Piecemealing of Project


Coastal Advocates commented that by designating an ocean disposal option in advance of the LTMS completing work on
the other disposal alternatives, EPA and the LTMS program have effectively eliminated upland disposal and other
options in the near-term. Response: EPA Region IX recognizes that the LTMS continues to evaluate other disposal options,
including upland disposal. Nothing in the proposed ocean disposal site designation affects those efforts, or existing
disposal sites within San Francisco Bay managed under provisions of the Clean Water Act. In addition, it should be
noted that designation of an ocean site does not constitute a permit to dispose any dredged material at that site. Each
project will be evaluated for compliance with the Ocean Dumping criteria (40 CFR part 227) before any disposal can
occur at the proposed SF-DODS. Furthermore, it is EPA's intent to encourage beneficial use of material wherever possible
and approve ocean disposal of suitable material only when necessary.


5. Need for Ocean Dumping


Coastal Advocates commented that the analysis in the Final EIS for the need for ocean dumping was faulty ``because
it does not take into account the recent military base closures in the Bay Area.''


Response:

 EPA Region IX recognizes that base closures could have a long-term effect on the need for dredging and ocean disposal.
However, even if the long-term need for ocean dumping is substantially reduced by base closures, which is speculative,
presently available information appears to indicate that the proposed SF-DODS will still be needed. It appears reasonably
certain that there will be substantial dredging projects at the various Bay area commercial ports, among other facilities,
in the next fifty years which will generate large amounts of dredged material. Present information indicates that
a substantial portion of these dredged sediments would be expected to be suitable for ocean disposal. The end result
is the overall need for ocean dumping presented in the Final EIS may or may not be significantly affected in the short-term
or long-term. In any event, the actual need for ocean dumping is determined on a project-by-project basis at the time
of permitting.


6. Current Navy Project Classified as Historical Dumping


Coastal Advocates commented that the Navy's use of the disposal site concurrent with EPA's site designation prejudices
the decision process and is a violation of NEPA. 

Response:

 It should be noted that the Navy's use of their disposal site is permitted under section 103 of MPRSA following a NEPA
process which included an EIS and Supplemental EIS for their project-specific use only, separate from EPA's site
designation activities. Following extensive field studies of the region, the preferred site for long-term use (section
102 of MPRSA) was selected by EPA for several reasons, including the determinations of: a depositional environment
and local topographic containment features; no expected significant impacts to other resources or amenity areas,
such as national marine sanctuaries; minimal existing and potential fisheries relative to more important fishing
grounds located in or near the other alternative sites; lower abundances and biomass of demersal fishes, megafaunal
invertebrates, and infaunal invertebrates; no expected significant impacts to surface and midwater dwelling organisms,
including seabirds, mammals, and midwater fishes; and previous degradation of the environment within the preferred
alternative site as a result of historical disposal of low-level radioactive wastes and chemical and conventional
munitions in the vicinity of the preferred alternative site. In accordance with EPA's ocean site selection criteria
(40 CFR 228.5(e)), EPA Region IX classified the preferred dredged material disposal site as a historically-used
site based in part on the aforementioned historical dumping activities in the vicinity of the preferred site. The
proposed selection of the preferred alternative site coincides with the Navy's decision to identify this site as
its Preferred Alternative for dredged material disposal. Finally, it is important to note that EPA's proposed Preferred
Alternative was presented to the LTMS Ocean Studies Work Group (OSWG) and received the consensus approval of this
work group. The OSWG, which has been an integral part of the site designation process, is comprised of Federal and State
agencies, and numerous public interest groups, including local recreational and commercial fishing associations
and environmental groups. All of these groups have an active interest in the potential impacts of dredged material
management within the San Francisco Bay area.


7. Specific Ocean Dumping Criteria


Coastal Advocates commented that EPA did not satisfy specific criteria of the Ocean Dumping Regulations (40 CFR 228.6),
including: an inadequate assessment of impacts to recreational tuna fishing ( 228.6(a)(2)]; an inadequate
assessment of radioactivity in San Francisco Bay sediments ( 228.6(a)(4)); inadequate modeling of dredged
material disposal plumes   228.6(a)(2) and 228.6(a)(8); a flawed assessment of biological effects
of dumping of contaminated dredged material ( 228.6(a)(9); and a lack of consideration of adverse impacts
to the microlayer ( 228.6(a)(9)). 


Response:

 Region IX has carefully considered in the Final EIS the important factors required to satisfy the specific site selection
criteria. Site designation does not constitute a permit to dispose of any dredged material. The Corps is the permitting
agency for dredged material disposal applications and EPA has a joint approval role in determining the suitability
of dredged material proposed for ocean disposal. Proposed dredged sediments are evaluated on a project-by-project
basis with a rigorous suite of physical, chemical, and bioassay tests, involving statistical comparisons to an appropriate
uncontaminated reference site. Sediments that fail the testing criteria are deemed unsuitable and are prohibited
from ocean disposal. With respect to impacts to recreational tuna fishing, EPA Region IX determined that the impacts
of disposal plumes would be transient and insignificant to these highly mobile pelagic fish which usually are abundant
in the area only in the fall. The U.S. Navy performed project-midpoint monitoring activities in the vicinity of the
Preferred Alternative as required by their MPRSA section 103 permit which confirmed the transient nature of the disposal
plumes. Although radioactivity has not routinely been assessed, if historical information or other evidence suggests
such contamination, certain radioactive isotope measurements can be required by EPA in addition to the other aforementioned
tests to determine suitability of the proposed dredged material. With respect to modelling of the disposal plume
and sediment footprint on the seafloor, EPA Region IX used conservative values for model parameters to obtain results
under worst case (highly dispersive) conditions. Water column modelling showed that concentrations of sediments
in the water column would be within background levels at the boundaries of the marine sanctuaries, while the footprint
modelling showed that any deposits of sediment in the marine sanctuaries would be at the limits of detection at best
under optimal conditions. Furthermore, the footprint model does not account for biological activity which would
mix the deposited sediment into the native seafloor sediments. The Navy's project-midpoint monitoring studies
have largely confirmed the predictions of the fate of the plume and footprint. EPA has performed an extensive evaluation
of available information on potential impacts to sea surface microlayer (including an experts' workshop), and concluded
that the environmental significance of microlayer contamination has not been clearly established even for enclosed
waters. The concern for microlayer effects is largely based on theoretical arguments, laboratory bioassays, and
limited field studies. The potential for microlayer effects depends largely on: contaminant concentrations, lack
of surface turbulence, degree to which the water body is enclosed or restricted, and proximity to important areas
containing neustonic populations that may be exposed. Because the potential significance of microlayer contamination
has not been clearly established in relatively enclosed water bodies such as Puget Sound, the potential effects are
expected to be much less for disposal activities in the more turbulent and unrestricted offshore oceanic environment.
In addition, highly contaminated material will not be approved for disposal in ocean waters.


8. Requirements of the Endangered Species Act (ESA)


Coastal Advocates commented that the documents prepared for the ESA coordination in the Final EIS did not comply with
section 7(a)(2) of the ESA, 16 U.S.C. 1536(a)(2). 

Response:

 In accordance with the aforementioned ESA, EPA Region IX formally consulted with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
the National Marine Fisheries Service, and California Department of Fish and Game to identify any threatened, endangered,
or special status species that may be affected by the proposed designation of the SF-DODS. Reviewing all available
data, including information from the Final EIS requested by these agencies, concurrence was received from the three
agencies that there would be no adverse impacts to local endangered species from the designation of the proposed SF-DODS.


9. Proposed Selection of Preferred Site


Ocean Advocates commented that the preferred alternative is not acceptable for ocean dumping of contaminated material
because of: the highly dispersive nature of the waters at the site; its use as a spawning, nursery, feeding and passage
area for living resources; its close proximity to three marine sanctuaries; the infeasibility of monitoring; and
lack of adequate baseline data.


Response:

 Site designation does not constitute a permit to dispose of any dredged material. Each project will be evaluated on
a case-by-case basis. Rigorous testing of the proposed dredged sediments as described in the response to comment
#7 above, will ensure that toxic or highly contaminated dredged materials will not be disposed at the designated disposal
site. Although oceanic environments tend to be more dispersive than enclosed water bodies, conservative modeling
indicates that there would be insignificant impacts from dredged material disposal, as described in the response
to comment #7. EPA's water column modeling predicted that concentrations of dredged materials following disposal
would decrease rapidly to background levels and that overall impacts to the local environment would be insignificant.
More recent Navy mid-project monitoring has confirmed these expectations of intermittent and short-term impacts.
Therefore, impacts to spawning, nursery, feeding and passage areas for living resources are expected to be minor
and temporary. The preferred alternative site is located north of the other alternative sites and is the closest to
GFNMS and CBNMS. Despite the proximity to the marine sanctuaries, physical oceanographic studies indicate that
the predominant currents are north-northwest and are weaker than the currents in the vicinity of the other alternative
sites. These oceanographic conditions would be expected to prevent any movement of suspended sediments into the
National marine sanctuaries. As described in the response to comment #7, modelling results indicate that suspended
sediment transport is insignificant. The recent Navy mid-project monitoring efforts clearly shows that monitoring
of the site is feasible, particularly with respect to the most difficult technical tasks related to the deep water
depths such as identification of the sediment footprint on the seafloor. With regard to baseline data, EPA Region
IX carefully evaluated all of the important relevant data for the region and identified data gaps. An Ocean Studies
Plan (OSP) was developed jointly with the regional scientists of the OSWG, and approved by the LTMS Policy Review Committee.
The OSP described appropriate field studies necessary to fill those data gaps. The results of these field studies
and previous studies in the region provide the most comprehensive collection of data characterizing the Gulf of the
Farallones region to date.


D. Alternatives Analysis


The action discussed in this Proposed Rule is the proposed designation of the Preferred Alterative selected in the
Final EIS (proposed SF-DODS) for disposal of suitable dredged material from the San Francisco Bay region over 50 years.
The LTMS planning estimate is that up to 400 million cubic yards will be dredged in this period; however, the proposed
SF-DODS will be limited to a maximum disposal volume of 6 million cubic yards of dredged material in any one year period.
The purpose of the designation is to provide an environmentally acceptable location for ocean disposal, as part of
the Long Term Management Strategy (LTMS) for dredged material from this region. Approval of specific ocean dredged
material disposal permit applications is a completely separate process from site designation. MPRSA section 103
permit applications are reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the proposed dredged materials are
suitable for disposal at proposed SF-DODS.
The Final EIS discussed the need for the site designation and examined a range of alternatives to the proposed action,
including 3 alternative deepwater ocean disposal sites. All disposal options, including upland, in-bay, and ocean
disposal alternatives, and LTMS management policies are being evaluated in a separate LTMS Policy EIS/EIR. The upland
and in-bay sites are limited in capacity relative to the ocean site for disposal of large volumes of suitable dredged
material. Disposal alternatives for individual projects will be evaluated by EPA Region IX and the Corps' San Francisco
District on a case-by-case basis during the permitting process. The following ocean disposal alternatives were
evaluated in the Final EIS:

 

1. No Action-Selection of this alternative would prevent final designation of the proposed SF-DODS site. Failure
to designate a permanent ocean disposal site pursuant to section 102 of the MPRSA would have significant negative
consequences. First, the continued foreseeable need to have some place to dispose of sediments from various San Francisco
Bay dredging projects would place pressure on the Corps and EPA to approve on a project-by-project basis the use of
temporary in-Bay or ocean dumping location pursuant to either Clean Water Act section 404 or MPRSA section 103. Approval
of dredged material disposal via these mechanisms would be less desirable in that dump site selection would not be
made in the context of long-term comprehensive planning. The advantages of the latter, the limiting of dumping to
a single location and the consideration of cumulative impacts and cumulative needs for dumping could be lost if dump
site are selected piecemeal on a project-by-project basis. The LTMS mission is to provide long-term options, including
ocean disposal, to accommodate the dredged material volumes and compositions anticipated for the 50-year planning
period. Second, the Water Resources Act of 1992 prohibits the continued use of ocean dump sites which have not been
designated by EPA as section 102 dump sites by the end of 1997. If EPA fails to designate the proposed SF-DODS by that
date, then ocean disposal of dredged materials taken from San Francisco Bay projects will be effectively precluded.
It appears from current information that there is a substantial probability that there will not be sufficient capacity
available in alternative disposal options to accommodate sediments from currently contemplated dredging projects.
Accordingly, the lack of an ocean disposal site could delay or preclude several economically important dredging
projects.
2. Alternatives Not Considered for Further Analysis (Study Area 1 and Study Area 2)-Study Area 1, corresponding
to the Channel Bar ODMDS is only designated for disposal of sandy material from the San Francisco Bay entrance channel.
The LTMS considered changing the designation of this ODMDS to accept sand from other dredging projects in the Bay,
but decided that the amount of potentially suitable material would be too small to warrant redesignating the site.
Based on this decision, EPA proposes to eliminate Study Area 1 from further consideration. Study Area 2 originally
was included as a candidate location on the continental shelf, and was subjected to considerable study effort. Nevertheless,
based on its location within the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS) and because dredged material disposal
at a new ODMDS within the MBNMS is prohibited, EPA proposes to eliminate Study Area 2 from further consideration as
an alternative.
3. Deepwater Alternative Site 3-This site is located approximately 47 nautical miles (87 kilometers) from
the Golden Gate in an area where depths range approximately 4,590 to 6,230 feet (1,400 to 1,900 meters). EPA proposes
to eliminate this site from further consideration, primarily because of its proximity to Pioneer Canyon and associated
hardbottom areas.
4. Deepwater Alternative Site 4-This site is located approximately 50 nautical miles (93 kilometers) from
the Golden Gate in an area where depths range approximately from 6,230 to 6,900 feet (1,900 to 2,100 meters). EPA proposes
to eliminate this site from further consideration, primarily because of its proximity to Half Moon Bay and its high
usage as commercial fishing grounds as compared to Alternative Site 5.
5. Deepwater Alternative Site 5 (Preferred Alternative)-EPA proposes to select this site (proposed SF-DODS)
as the preferred alternative based on comparisons of the alternative sites to the specific selection criteria. Alternative
Site 5 is located furthest from the coast (approximately 49 nautical miles west of the Golden Gate) and in the deepest
depth range (approximately 8,200 to 9840 feet, or 2,500 to 3,000 meters). Bathymetric and sediment surveys indicate
Alternative Site 5 is located in a depositional area which, because of existing topographic containment features,
is likely to retain dredged material which reaches the sea floor. No significant impacts to other resources or amenity
areas, such as marine sanctuaries, are expected to result from designation of Alternative Site 5. Existing and potential
fisheries resources within Alternative Site 5 are minimal and the site is removed from more important fishing grounds
located closer to the other alternative sites. Abundances and biomass of demersal fishes and megafaunal invertebrates,
as well as abundances and diversity of infaunal invertebrates, at Alternative Site 5 are lower than those at the other
alternative sites. Potential impacts to surface and mid-water dwelling organisms, such as seabirds, mammals, and
midwater fishes, are expected to be insignificant. Finally, disposal of low-level radioactive wastes and chemical
and conventional munitions occurred historically in the vicinity of Alternative Site 5. Disposal within the site
has also occurred as part of a Navy MPRSA section 103 permit approved for up to 1.2 million cubic yards of suitable dredged
material.
The Final EIS presents the information needed to evaluate the suitability of ocean disposal areas for final designation
of proposed SF-DODS and is based on a disposal site environmental study. The proposed rule is being promulgated in
accordance with MPRSA, the EPA Ocean Dumping Regulations, and other applicable Federal environmental legislation.
A separate Record of Decision (ROD) will be prepared prior to or as part of the issuance of the Final Rule for this site
designation.


E. Site Designation


Today EPA Region IX proposes to designate SF-DODS as a deepwater ocean dredged material disposal site. The center
of the proposed SF-DODS is located approximately 49 nautical miles (91 kilometers) west of the Golden Gate and occupies
an area of approximately 6.5 square nautical miles (22 square kilometers). Water depths within the area range between
8,200 to 9,840 feet (2,500 to 3,000 meters). The center coordinates of the oval-shaped site are: 37
  39.0' North latitude by 123
  29.0' West longitude (North American Datum from 1983), with length (north-south axis) and width (west-east
axis) dimensions of approximately 4 nautical miles (7.5 kilometers) and 2.5 nautical miles (4.5 kilometers), respectively.
Designation of the proposed SF-DODS is for use over a 50-year period and not to exceed 6 million cubic yards of dredged
material in any one year period, subject to a Site Management and Monitoring Plan, which will be issued through a separate
Public Notice. Annual reports will be prepared on the results of site monitoring. If disposal operations at the site
are shown to cause unacceptable adverse environmental impacts, further use of the site will be restricted or terminated.
A suitable alternative disposal site may be designated by EPA in this event. Disposal operations will be prohibited
if funds and equipment for implementing the site management and monitoring program are not available.


F. Regulatory Requirements


Five general criteria are used in the selection and approval of ocean disposal sites for continuing use (40 CFR 228.5).
Sites are selected to minimize interference with other marine activities, to keep any temporary perturbations from
causing impacts outside the disposal site, and to permit effective monitoring which is designed to evaluate specific
areas of concern, such as water quality impacts, significant movement of sediment outside the site and unacceptable
impacts to the marine environment or human health. Where feasible, locations off the continental shelf and historical
sites are chosen. The 11 specific site selection criteria are listed in 40 CFR 228.6(a) of the EPA Ocean Dumping Regulations.
These specific factors are used to evaluate all candidate disposal sites.
The proposed SF-DODS site, as discussed below under the 11 specific factors, is acceptable under the 5 general criteria
(40 CFR 228.5). The 5 general criteria and the 11 specific criteria overlap such that if a site meets the latter it necessarily
meets the former. Historical disposal in the vicinity of the preferred site has not resulted in significantly adverse
effects on fisheries, living resources of the ocean, or other uses of the marine environment.


1. Geographical Position, Depth of Water, Bottom Topography and Distance from Coast (40 CFR 228.6(a)(1))


The center of the proposed SF-DODS is located approximately 49 nautical miles (91 kilometers) west of the Golden Gate
and occupies an area of 6.5 square nautical miles (22 square kilometers). Water depths within the area range between
8,200 to 9,840 feet (2,500 to 3,000 meters). The center coordinates of the oval-shaped site are: 37
  39.0' North latitude by 123
  29.0' West longitude (North American Datum from 1983), with length (north-south axis) and width (west-east
axis) dimensions of approximately 4 nautical miles (7.5 kilometers) and 2.5 nautical miles (4.5 kilometers), respectively.


2. Location in Relation to Breeding, Spawning, Nursery, Feeding, or Passage Areas of Living Resources in Adult or
Juvenile Phases (40 CFR 228.6(a)(2))


The proposed SF-DODS site provides feeding and breeding areas for common resident benthic species. Floating larvae
and eggs of various species are expected to be found at and near the water surface at the site as well as the other sites.
Designation of the site will not affect any geographically limited habitats, breeding sites or critical areas that
are essential to commercially important species or rare or endangered species.


3. Location in Relation to Beaches and Other Amenity Areas (40 CFR 228.6(a)(3) 


The proposed SF-DODS site is approximately 49 nautical miles (91 kilometers) west of the Golden Gate, 30 nautical
miles (56 kilometers) from Pioneer Canyon, 10 nautical miles (19 kilometers) from the Gulf of the Farallones National
Marine Sanctuary boundary, and 30 (56 kilometers) nautical miles from the Farallon Islands. EPA Region IX and the
Corps' San Francisco District have determined that aesthetic impacts of plumes, transport of dredged material to
any shoreline and alteration of any habitat of special biological significance or marine sanctuary will not occur
if this site is designated. 
Ocean currents flow primarily to the northwest in the upper 2,600 to 3,000 feet (800 to 900 meters) of the water column,
although periodic reversals in flow occur. Currents below 3,000 feet (900 meters) are generally weaker than near-surface
currents. Therefore, any residual suspended solids from the proposed SF-DODS site will move primarily in the north-northwest
direction. Initial water column modeling results using a conservative approach and assuming disposal of 6 million
cubic yards of dredged sediments per year indicate that suspended solid levels would decrease to background levels
by the time the plume reaches the nearest amenity area (GFNMS boundary). Initial footprint modeling using a conservative
approach and assuming disposal of 6 million cubic yards of dredged sediments per year indicates that the majority
of the disposed material would be deposited within the disposal site. 


4. Types and Quantities of Wastes Proposed to be Disposed of, and Proposed Methods of Release, Including Methods of
Packing the Waste if Any (40 CFR 228.6(a)(4))


Site use over a 50-year period is not to exceed 6 million cubic yards of suitable dredged material per year. The projected
volumes are based on historical annual maintenance dredging volumes and projected new work projects in the San Francisco
Bay region which could be considered for disposal at the ocean site if the material is determined to suitable for ocean
disposal. The anticipated military base closures may reduce the LTMS planning estimates for the total volume of material
expected to be dredged over a 50-year period. However, the overall impact of base closures may be offset by other new
projects, such as expansion of commercial port facilities in areas vacated by the military. Composition of dredged
material is expected to range between two types: predominantly ``clay-silt'' (e.g., 74% clay, 5% silt, 21% sand)
versus ``mostly sand'' (e.g., 3% silt, 21% clay, 76% sand). These material types are based on data from historical
projects from the San Francisco Bay region. The expected disposal method would involve split-hull barges, with capacities
ranging between 1,000 to 6,000 cubic yards, which would be towed by ocean-going tugboats. The actual amount of disposal
may vary from the annual average for any given year. EPA Region IX and the Corps' San Francisco District will evaluate
and manage the amount of dredged material proposed for disposal at proposed SF-DODS through the MPRSA section 103
permit process.
All dredged material proposed for disposal at the site must be suitable for ocean disposal. This determination will
be made by EPA Region IX and the Corps' San Francisco District based upon the results of physical, chemical and biological
tests before a MPRSA section 103 permit can be issued. Certain dredged material may be exempted from chemical and biological
testing based upon the physical characteristics of the sediments and their location in relation to sources of contamination
(40 CFR 227.13(b)(1)). Dumping of prohibited materials or other industrial or municipal wastes will not be permitted
at the site (40 CFR 227.5 and 227.6(a)).


5. Feasibility of Surveillance and Monitoring (40 CFR 228.6(a)(5))


Surveillance and monitoring of the dredged material disposal site involves several agencies. The U.S. Coast Guard
(U.S.C.G) is the Federal agency with authority to conduct onsite surveillance and monitoring of vessels involved
in disposal activities at sea. For dredged material disposal, this monitoring would be to determine that the vessels
dump the material at the designated disposal site. EPA Region IX and the Corps' San Francisco District share the responsibilities
of managing and monitoring the disposal site, and, with the onsite assistance of the U.S.C.G, to enforce permit conditions
within the limits of their jurisdiction. Recent Navy mid-project monitoring activities have clearly confirmed
the feasibility of surveillance and monitoring at the proposed SF-DODS. A Site Management and Monitoring Plan (SMMP)
is under development by EPA Region IX and the Corps' South Pacific Division and San Francisco District. The goals and
objectives of the SMMP are summarized in Section G. below. The SMMP will be issued through a separate Public Notice.


6. Dispersal, Horizontal Transport and Vertical Mixing Characteristics of the Area, Including Prevailing Current
Direction and Velocity, if Any (40 CFR 228.6(a)(6))


Ocean currents flow primarily to the northwest in the upper 2,600 to 3,000 feet (800 to 900 meters) of the water column,
although periodic reversals in flow occur. Currents below 3,000 feet (900 meters) are generally weaker than near-surface
currents. Therefore, any residual suspended solids from the proposed SF-DODS will move primarily in the north-northwest
direction. Near-bottom flows may be enhanced by tidal influences and bottom topography. However, sediment resuspension
from the seafloor within the preferred site is expected to be minimal. Initial water column modeling results, as indicated
in the Final EIS, using a conservative approach (e.g., modeling parameters adjusted for worst case conditions) and
assuming disposal of 6 million cubic yards of dredged sediments per year, indicate that suspended solid levels would
decrease to background levels when the plume reached the nearest amenity area (GFNMS boundary). Initial footprint
modeling using a conservative approach and assuming disposal of 6 million cubic yards of dredged sediments per year
indicate that the majority of the disposed material would be deposited within the disposal site. 


7. Existence and Effects of Current and Previous Discharges and Dumping in the Area (Including Cumulative Effects)
(40 CFR 228.6(a)(7)


Under an MPRSA section 103 permit, the Navy is discharging up to 1.2 million cubic yards of dredged material at their
Navy disposal site which is contained within the EPA-preferred Alternative Site 5. No other documented disposal
of dredged material has occurred within the site. However, disposal of radioactive waste containers was conducted
in the vicinity of Alternative Site 5 from 1951-1954. Likewise, chemical and conventional munitions were disposed
from approximately 1958 to the late 1960's at the Chemical Munitions Disposal Area. There was no evidence during the
site designation field studies of residual contamination. Therefore, potentials for cumulative impacts are considered
unlikely.
The associated municipal discharge effects from the San Francisco Southwest Ocean Outfall (5.4 nautical miles or
10.2 kilometers from shore), City of Pacifica Outfall (0.4 nautical miles or 0.8 kilometers from shore), and Northern
San Mateo County Outfall (0.4 nautical miles or 0.8 kilometers from shore) are limited to local areas near the outfalls
and do not extend to the vicinity of the dredged material disposal site. Discharges of dredged material at the Channel
Bar ODMDS (3.0 nautical miles or 5.6 kilometers from shore) are also limited to local areas and not expected to result
in farfield impacts. Ocean disposal of acid waste, cannery waste, and refinery waste was discontinued approximately
20 years ago (in 1971-1972), and presence of residual waste which could interact with discharged dredged material
to produce cumulative, adverse, environmental effects has not been detected.


8. Interference with Shipping, Fishing, Recreation, Mineral Extraction, Desalination, Fish and Shellfish Culture,
Areas of Special Scientific Importance and Other Legitimate Uses of the Ocean (40 CFR 288.6(a)(8))


Interference with shipping, fishing, recreation, mineral extraction, desalination, fish and shellfish culture,
areas of special scientific importance and other uses of the ocean as a result of disposal operations is expected to
be minimal because of the already high volume of ship traffic through the region. From 1980-1991, the total vessel
transits in the San Francisco Bay region ranged from approximately 61,000 to 91,000. As an example of a worst case scenario,
assuming around-the-clock disposal operations (assuming 3 trips in a 24-hour period), disposal operations would
augment the vessel traffic by less than 2 percent. Compared to Alternative Sites 3 and 4, Site 5 is less utilized as a
fisheries resource area. In addition, the potential interferences with recreational and scientific boat traffic
and marine resources (e.g., birds and mammals) near the Farallon Islands will be minimized by requirements that barges
remain at least 3 nautical miles from the Islands. Under normal conditions, no interference with areas of special
importance is expected. However, accidents resulting in releases of material near the Farallones may be a concern.
This will also be mitigated by requiring barges to remain 3 nautical miles from the Islands and by requiring appropriate
load limits based on sea conditions.


9. The Existing Water Quality and Ecology of the Site as Determined by Available Data or by Trend Assessment or Baseline
Surveys (40 CFR 228.6(a)(9))


Regional studies described in the Final EIS provide the following determinations. Water quality at the proposed
SF-DODS is indistinguishable from the water quality of nearby areas. Sediments contain background levels or low
concentrations of trace metal and organic contaminants. The demersal fish community within Alternative Site 5 have
lower numbers of species and abundances (rattails, eelpouts, finescale codling) than the other alternative sites.
Alternative Site 5 contain moderate numbers of megafaunal invertebrate species but lower overall abundances (sea
cucumbers, brittlestars, sea pens) compared to the other alternative sites. Infaunal invertebrates within Alternative
Site 5 show lower diversity and abundance (polychaetes, amphipods, isopods, tanaids) compared to Alternative Sites
3 and 4. There have been higher numbers of sightings of marine birds and mammals within Alternative Site 5 relative
to the other alternative sites. Mid-water organisms, including juvenile rockfishes, are abundant seasonally within
Alternative Site 5 relative to Alternative Sites 3 and 4.


10. Potentiality for the Development or Recruitment of Nuisance Species in the Disposal Site (40 CFR 228.6(a)(10))


It is unlikely to see recruitment of nuisance species from the disposal of dredged material due to significant differences
in water depth and environment at the disposal site as compared to the relatively shallow dredging sites in the San
Francisco Bay region. Local opportunistic benthic species characteristic of disturbed conditions are expected
to be present and abundant at any ODMDS in response to physical deposition of sediments. Opportunistic polychaetes,
such as 

Capitella

, may colonize the disposal site. These worms can become food items for bottom-feeding fish and are not directly harmful
to other species. No recruitment of species capable of harming human health or the marine ecosystem is expected.


11. Existence at or in Close Proximity to the Site of Any Significant Natural or Cultural Feature of Historical Importance
(40 CFR 228.6(a)(11))


The California State Historic Preservation Officer has determined there are no known historic shipwrecks nor any
known aboriginal artifacts at the proposed SF-DODS or in the vicinity.


G. Site Management and Monitoring Plan


A Site Management and Monitoring Plan for the proposed SF-DODS is under development by EPA Region IX and the Corps'
South Pacific Division and San Francisco District with input from the OSWG. The practicability of implementing a
SMMP at the proposed SF-DODS has been confirmed by the recent mid-project MPRSA section 103 permit monitoring activities
performed by the Navy at the Navy disposal site which is contained within the proposed SF-DODS. The completed document
will be made available for public review through a separate Public Notice process and will available upon request
from EPA Region IX. For this Proposed Rule, the major components of the SMMP (including goals, objectives, and criteria)
are summarized below.
a. Data for site management will be provided by a tiered site monitoring program which consists of three interdependent
modules: a Physical Monitoring Module, a Biological Monitoring Module, and a Chemical Monitoring Module. The Physical
Monitoring Module will provide information about the plume behavior in the water column and dredged material footprint
on the sea floor. The Biological Monitoring Module provides information about any detectable effects of the water
column plume on sea birds, marine mammals, and mid-water fishes. In the event that significant amounts of dredged
material (i.e., greater than 5 centimeters) extends outside of the designated site, any detectable impacts on the
benthos shall be investigated. The Chemical Monitoring Module provides data on sediment quality and will evaluate
any potential bioaccumulation of contaminants in benthic organisms if monitoring indicates that substantially
elevated concentrations of contaminants exist in the sediments. Tier 1 monitoring studies shall be performed annually
if dredged material disposal occurs at the proposed SF-DODS and will include portions of each module. Initiation
of subsequent studies under Tiers 2 and 3 shall be based on exceedances of parameters in Tier 1, as specified in the SMMP.
(1) Annual Tier 1 monitoring activities shall involve physical, chemical, and biological assessments. These activities
shall be initiated after a period of one year of disposal activities or disposal of 6 million cubic yards of dredged
materials, whichever comes first. A minimum volume of dredged material disposed in any one year period may be established
as a trigger for conducting the annual surveys of the footprint, based on ability to identify the dredged material
layer within the disposal site. A physical survey of the disposal site shall be conducted to determine whether disposed
dredged material is remaining at the proposed SF-DODS site. Sediment mapping techniques (utilizing appropriate
technology, such as sediment profile photography) shall be used to determine the areal extent and thickness of the
dredged material deposit footprint relative to the disposal site boundaries. Following the physical mapping of
the sediment footprint, boxcore samples for sediment chemistry and benthos shall be taken within the footprint and
in unaffected areas surrounding the footprint. If a ecologically significant thickness of dredged material (5 centimeters)
is not identified outside the boundary of the disposal site, then no management actions (relating to physical monitoring)
will be necessary. On the other hand, if significant thicknesses of dredged material are detected outside the site
boundary, then management actions (e.g., reevaluation of the site boundary, or restricting or stopping disposal)
and/or additional field studies (Tier 2) shall be implemented to evaluate potential impacts of the dredged material
deposits outside of the disposal site. The sediment chemistry samples shall be analyzed as a conservative measure
to assess any long-term accumulation of contaminants as a result of dredged material disposal. If contaminant trigger
levels are not exceeded, then no management actions (relating to chemical monitoring) will be necessary. If contaminant
trigger levels are exceeded, then management actions (e.g., restricting or stopping disposal) and additional field
studies (Tier 2) shall be implemented to evaluate the potential impacts. Biological monitoring will be based primarily
on continued collection and assessment of trends of time-series data for marine birds and mammals and midwater fishes
in the Gulf of the Farallones region. Periodic shipboard observations (which could be required in the permit, as appropriate)
taken from the vessels involved in disposal operations will provide additional data on any potential impacts to these
organisms. If no significant negative trends are detected and shipboard observations do not indicate that adverse
impacts are occurring as a result of disposal activities, then no management actions (relating to biological monitoring)
will be necessary. If statistically significant negative trends are detected or shipboard observations indicate
that adverse impacts are occurring as a result of disposal activities, then management actions (e.g., restricting
or stopping disposal) and additional field studies (Tier 2) shall be implemented to assess potential impacts. 
(2) Tier 2 monitoring shall occur based on management decisions in Tier 1 as described above with consideration of
study options, including collection of additional data to further evaluate the potential physical, chemical, and
biological impacts of dredged material dispersed in the water column and deposited outside of the proposed SF-DODS
on sensitive water column and benthic biological resources of concern. If warranted, additional physical oceanographic
studies shall be conducted to improve the models used to predict the dispersion and deposition of dredged material
at the disposal site. These additional studies may include: the collection of additional current meter data, deployment
of sediment traps, and deployment of Lagrangian drifters. If the additional data indicate that no detectable (above
background) concentrations of material are entering the sanctuaries, then no management actions would be necessary.
If the data do indicate significant elevated concentrations of sediments are entering the sanctuaries, then management
actions (e.g., restricting or stopping disposal) shall be implemented. The benthic resources of concern include
infauna, epifauna and demersal fishes identified in the Final EIS and in the 1985 to 1987 fish block data from the California
Department of Fish and Game. The benthic community within the sediment footprint will be compared to benthic communities
in adjacent areas outside of the footprint. Additional monitoring activities in a higher tier (Tier 3) may not be necessary
if a management decision can be made with the data obtained from the benthic community comparisons. If more data are
needed to make a management decision, Tier 3 monitoring shall be initiated with consideration of options, including
testing for bioaccumulation of contaminants in tissues of appropriate benthic and/or epifaunal organisms. EPA
and the Corps, in consultation with the OSWG, will determine the appropriate sampling methodologies for marine birds
and mammals based on results of the Physical Monitoring Module in Tiers 1 and 2.
(3) Tier 3 monitoring shall be conducted if chemical and/or biological triggers are exceeded in Tier 2. This tier involves
the assessment of benthic body burdens of contaminants and correlation with comparison of the benthic communities
inside and outside of the sediment footprint. EPA Region IX will determine whether the proposed SF-DODS is a source
of significant bioaccumulation in the tissues of benthic species collected at the proposed SF-DODS compared to adjacent
unimpacted areas. These data will be used to determine: the continuing use of the proposed SF-DODS; the management
options to further limit disposal times, quantities or characteristics of the dredged material; or the possible
closure of the site after another site is designated.
b. Guidelines for site use included in the Site Management and Monitoring Plan are:



(1) Use of the site shall be restricted to disposal of dredged sediments only, regulated under section 103 of MPRSA.
(2) All sediments proposed for dredging must be determined to be suitable for ocean disposal by EPA Region IX and the
Corps' San Francisco District in accordance with the 1991 EPA/Corps Green Book and Region Implementation Manual.
Suitability for ocean disposal will be determined after review of the results of physical, chemical and biological
testing of the sediments, except those sediments specifically exempted under the regulations (40 CFR 227.13(b)(1,2,3))
from such testing. When the material does not qualify for an exemption, testing and reporting procedures shall be
conducted as described in procedures approved by EPA Region IX and the Corps' San Francisco District.
(3) No dredged material will be disposed at the proposed SF-DODS without a MPRSA section 103 permit issued by the Corps'
San Francisco District, or as authorized in a Corps' Civil Works project. All such permits or Corps' Civil Works projects
are subject to the approval of EPA Region IX. All disposal operations shall be carried out according to special conditions
and other procedures set out in the MPRSA section 103 permits or specifications of the Corps' Civil Works project.
(4) If the dredged material is shown to form significant surface plumes, the timing of disposal operations may be restricted
in any 24-hour period.
(5) The maximum allowable volume of disposal is 6 million cubic yards per year. However, it is expected that lower volumes
of sediment would be disposed as a result of either unsuitability (as determined by sediment tests) or selection of
other disposal options such as beneficial use.
(6) All sediments shall be discharged within a 3,200-foot radius circle centered at the center coordinates of the
disposal site, unless otherwise directed.
(7) There are no restrictions on the type of disposal equipment that can be used; however, it is anticipated that most
of the dredged material will be excavated with clamshell dredges and disposed from towed split-hull scows or barges;
or excavated by hopper dredges and disposed from the hopper dredge or a towed barge.
(8) The U.S.C.G is responsible for surveillance of vessels disposing of dredged material at the site. As staff and
equipment availability permit, EPA Region IX, the Corps' San Francisco District or the U.S.C.G may provide an on-board
observer, an escort, or impose other requirements to confirm that disposal occurs within the central dumping zone.
(9) The following reporting requirements shall be incorporated into all MPRSA section 103 permits for use of the proposed
SF-DODS:



(a) The permittee shall notify EPA Region IX, the Corps' San Francisco District and the U.S.C.G Marine Safety Office
in Alameda at least two weeks before the start of the disposal activity.
(b) Each permittee shall provide EPA Region IX, and the Regulatory Branch of the Corps' San Francisco District, with
the following information within 30 days following the end of the disposal operation:


Project Information:

 Project name; permittee; permit number; project beginning and ending dates; project description, including map
of area dredged, depth of dredging, side slopes and tolerance dredging (overdredging depth); and type of dredging,
either construction or maintenance. 


Disposal Information (For each trip to the disposal site):

 Date; hopper dredge or towing vessel and scow or barge name, number and owner; master of the hopper dredge or towing
vessel; capacity of disposal vessel, hopper dredge, scow or barge (in cubic yards and cubic meters); volume discharged
(actual volume, not pay volume); a certified plot of all hopper dredge, barge or scow disposal tracks once inside the
boundaries of the proposed SF-DODS, including the time and coordinates for the beginning and ending of disposal;
and any unusual conditions affecting disposal on any trip (i.e., heavy seas, equipment malfunction, etc.).


Post-Dredging Information:

 A post-dredging hydrographic survey compared to a pre-dredging hydrographic survey taken at the dredging site shortly
before dredging began; number of disposal trips; total amount of dredged material dumped at the proposed SF-DODS
in cubic yards and cubic meters, and dredged quantity calculations necessary to determine the extent of dredging
at the project site; and if the dredged material is not exempt from testing, the mass loading of materials disposed
at the proposed SF-DODS should be calculated based on chemical analyses used to characterize the dredged material
before the permit was issued.
c. Monitoring shall occur as specified in the SMMP. If funds to implement the necessary monitoring are not available,
disposal operations will not be allowed to continue for that time period. If monitoring identifies that significant
adverse impacts are occurring at or beyond the site boundary, site use or designation can be modified or terminated
by EPA Region IX to reduce adverse environmental impacts. These modifications will be governed by the following criteria:



(1) Exceedance of Federal water quality criteria after disposal within the site or beyond the proposed SF-DODS boundary
as specified in the Ocean Dumping Regulations (40 CFR 227.29(a)). 
(2) Movement of disposed material toward significant biological resource areas or marine sanctuaries.
(3) Significant adverse changes in the structure of the benthic community outside the disposal site boundary.
(4) Significant adverse bioaccumulation in organisms collected from the disposal site or areas adjacent to the proposed
SF-DODS boundary compared to the reference site.
(5) Significant adverse impacts upon commercial or recreational fisheries resources near the site.
 

H. Action


EPA Region IX has concluded that the proposed SF-DODS may appropriately be designated for use over a period of 50 years
and not to exceed 6 million cubic yards of suitable dredged material per year. Designation of the proposed SF-DODS
complies with the general and specific criteria used for site evaluation. The proposed designation of the proposed
SF-DODS as an EPA-approved Ocean Dumping Site is being published as proposed rulemaking. Management of this site
will be the responsibility of the Regional Administrator of EPA Region IX in cooperation with the Corps' South Pacific
Division Engineer and the San Francisco District Engineer, based on objectives defined in the Site Management and
Monitoring Plan for the proposed SF-DODS. This Site Management and Monitoring Plan will be issued through a separate
Public Notice.
It should be emphasized, if an ocean dumping site is designated, such a site designation does not constitute or imply
EPA Region IX's or the Corps' San Francisco District's approval of actual ocean disposal of dredged materials. Before
ocean dumping of dredged material at the site may begin, EPA Region IX and the Corps' San Francisco District must evaluate
permit applications according to EPA's Ocean Dumping Criteria. EPA Region IX or the Corps' San Francisco District
have the right to deny permits if either agency determines that the Ocean Dumping Criteria of MPRSA have not been met.


I. Regulatory Assessments


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA is required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all rules
which may have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. EPA has determined that this action
will not have a significant impact on small entities since the site designation will only have the effect of providing
a disposal option for dredged material. Consequently, this rule does not necessitate preparation of a Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis. 
This action will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or cause any of the other effects
which would result in its being classified by the Executive Order as a major rule. Consequently, this action does not
necessitate preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.
This action does not contain any information collection requirements subject to Office of Management and Budget
review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission requests comments on whether it should establish a Federal Advisory Committee to negotiate proposed
technical rules governing the provision of terrestrial and satellite services in the 27.5-29.5 GHz frequency
band.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Commission hereby seeks comment on establishing an Advisory Committee to negotiate regulations defining the
technical rules appropriate to sharing the 27.5_29.5 GHz band by the proposed Local Multipoint Distribution Service
and by satellite services. The negotiations are to assist the Commission in developing regulations that will facilitate
the shared use of this spectrum by both satellite uplink and terrestrial point-to-multipoint service providers.
Any negotiating committee would be created under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5 U.S.C. App. 2, and the
Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990 (NRA), Public Law 101-648, November 28, 1990, and would consist of representatives
of the interests that will be significantly affected by the outcome of these rules.




The Commission has proposed to redesignate the use of the 27.5-29.5 GHz band from point-to-point terrestrial
service to point-to-multipoint service. Rulemaking to Amend Part 1 and Part 21 of the Commission's Rules to Redesignate
the 27.5-29.5 GHz Frequency Band and to Establish Rules and Policies for Local Multipoint Distribution Service,
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 8 FCC Rcd 557 (1993) (CC Docket 92-297). The band is also allocated on a coprimary
basis to fixed satellite services. One licensee, CellularVision of New York (CVNY, formerly Hye Crest Management,
Inc.), holds a regular license to provide terrestrial point-to-multipoint service in this band to the New York City
Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area. Other entities hold experimental licenses to test similar services in other
areas. As discussed in the Second Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, CC Docket No. 92-297, FCC 94-12, released
concurrently with this notice, some of the spectrum in the 28 GHz band may be needed for satellite earth stations that
will interconnect with mobile satellite systems. Moreover, the experimental Advanced Communications Technology
Satellite (ACTS) launched by NASA in 1993 is using a portion of the band (29.0-29.5 GHz) for research purposes.
The satellite has a four-year life expectancy. Hughes Space and Communications Company has filed an application
to provide service in this band. 



I. Regulatory Negotiation 



Regulatory negotiation is a technique through which the Commission hopes to develop better regulations that may
be implemented in a less adversarial setting. Negotiations are conducted through an Advisory Committee chartered
under FACA. The goal of the Committee is to reach consensus on the language or substance of appropriate rules. If a consensus
is reached, it is used as the basis of the Commission's proposal. All procedural requirements of the Administrative
Procedure Act (APA) and other applicable statutes continue to apply. 

When making a determination regarding the suitability of a proceeding for the negotiated rulemaking process, the
Commission must consider whether: 

(a) There is a need for the rules to be developed; 

(b) There are a limited number of identifiable interests that will be significantly affected by the rules; 

(c) There is a reasonable likelihood that a committee can be convened with a balanced representation of persons who:
(1) Can adequately represent the identifiable interests and (2) are willing to negotiate in good faith to reach a consensus
on the proposed rules; 

(d) There is a reasonable likelihood that a committee will reach a consensus on the proposed rules within a fixed period
of time; 

(e) The negotiated rulemaking procedure will not unreasonably delay the notice of proposed rulemaking and the issuance
of final rules;

<PARENT> FR940217-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(f) The agency has adequate resources and is willing to commit such resources, including technical assistance, to
the committee, and 
(g) The agency will, to the maximum extent possible consistent with the legal obligations of the agency, use the consensus
of the committee with respect to the proposed rules as the basis for the rules proposed by the agency for notice and comment.
Negotiated Rulemaking Act Sec. 3, 5 U.S.C. 583(a). 


II. Subject and Scope of Rule for Negotiated Rulemaking


The Commission is proposing that the technical regulations to govern the provision of Local Multipoint Distribution
Service and fixed satellite use of the 28 GHz band be developed through negotiation. We believe that the selection
criteria listed above are met. Technical rules are necessary to establish under what circumstances, if any, sharing
between satellite and terrestrial uses is feasible. The parties whose interests are affected are identifiable from
comments filed in this proceeding. These interests can be adequately represented on a committee, and we believe that
representatives will act in good faith to reach a consensus on technical rules within a set time frame. We believe that
the negotiated rulemaking process will better use public and private resources than would our requiring more iterations
of written comments will an adequate record is developed. We have adequate resources to commit to this endeavor and
would use the consensus report of the committee to develop proposed technical rules. 
The Commission has identified the following primary issue that should be addressed in the negotiations and resolved
in the proposed rules developed by the Committee: 




What technical rules should be adopted for the Local Multipoint Distribution Service and/or the fixed satellite
service so as to maximize the sharing of the spectrum among these services? 




If the Negotiated Rulemaking Committee is able to accommodate all proposed uses of the band, we ask that it proposes
specific rules to effectuate a sharing plan. We ask that it provide an analysis of how benefits of its proposed solution
outweigh other options for accommodating these services. Specifically, we ask that it explain: 



_The proper definition of the product market and geographic market for the services proposed;
_The degree of competition anticipated within the relevant market (including the extent to which the proposed services
are expected to compete with existing services);
_The degree to which new services and technological innovations will be stimulated by the proposed allocation;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940217-1-00040 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940217-1-00008 </PARENT>

_The amount and nature of investment in the national telecommunications infrastructure expected as a result of the
use of the band for the particular service(s);

_The kind and number of jobs that would be created as a result of the licensing of particular services;

_Any other available data concerning the economic growth expected to result from the allocation for the particular
service(s).




Other issues may be included by the parties. All recommendations or proposed rules must comply with International
Telecommunication Union treaty obligations.



III. Potential Interests and Participants



The Commission has identified the following interests as those most likely to be significantly affected by the proposed
rules:

(a) Developers, manufacturers, and licensees of Local Multipoint Distribution Service;

(b) Pending mobile-satellite applicants in the 1610-1625.5/2483.5-2500 MHz band filing by the June
2, 1991 cutoff date for these applications;

(c) Fixed-satellite service applicants and service providers.

The following have tentatively been identified as potentially affected interests should the Commission proceed
with a negotiated rulemaking: Suite 12 Group, Bell Atlantic Companies, Video/Phone Systems, Inc., Endgate Company,
Gigahertz Equipment Company, David Sarnoff Research Center, The University of Texas System, NASA, Ellipsat Corporation,
Motorola Satellite Communications, Inc., Constellation Communications, Inc., Loral/Qualcomm Satellite Service,
Inc., TRW, Inc., American Mobile Satellite Corporation, Hughes Space and Communications Company, a representative
of public television and educational parties commenting in CC Docket 92-297, Comsearch, Inc., and the Domestic
Facilities Division, Common Carrier Bureau, Federal Communications Commission.



IV. Formation of the Negotiating Committee



A. Procedure for Establishing an Advisory Committee



Under FACA, an Advisory Committee may be established only after consultation with the General Services Administration
(GSA) and the filing of a charter with Congress. The Commission will prepare a charter and initiate the requisite consultation
process prior to formation of the Committee and the commencement of negotiations.



B. Participants



The number of participants in the group is estimated to be about 20 and should not exceed 25. A number larger than this
could make it difficult to conduct efficient negotiations. Each interest will have the opportunity to be adequately
represented, although this does not necessarily mean that each potentially affected entity will have its own representative.
Further, we must be satisfied that the group, as a whole, reflects a proper balance and mix of interests. In this respect,
we are especially interested in receiving nominations to participate from public interest advocacy groups, users
groups, and educators and academics.

Entities that will be significantly affected by the proposed rules and which believe that their interests will not
be adequately represented by any entity specified in paragraph 8 above, may apply for, or nominate another entity
for, membership on the Committee. Each application for nomination must include:

(a) The name of the applicant or nominee and a description of the interests the entity will represent,

(b) Evidence that the applicant or nominee is authorized to represent parties related to the interests the entity
proposes to represent,

(c) A written commitment that the applicant or nominee shall actively participate in good faith in the development
of the rules under consideration,

(d) The reasons that the entities specified in paragraph 8 do not adequately represent the interests of the entity
submitting the application or nomination.

If, in response to this Notice, any additional entities request membership or representation in the negotiating
group, the Commission will determine whether that entity should be added to the group. The Commission will make that
decision based on whether the entity would be substantially affected by the rule and whether that entity is already
adequately represented in the negotiating group.

C. Agenda 



If the Commission decides to establish a negotiating committee and its charter is approved, it is anticipated that
the Committee's first meeting will take place in March or April, 1994, at the Commission's offices, Washington, DC,
at a building, room, date, and time that will be announced. At this initial meeting, the committee will complete action
on all procedural matters and establish a target date for submission of its recommendations. We expect that the target
date would be no later than July, 1994. We anticipate a publication of a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking not later
than October, 1994. 



V. Negotiation Procedures 



The following procedures and guidelines will apply to the Committee, if formed. These procedures may be modified,
however, after reviewing the comments received in response to this 

Notice

 or during the negotiation process. 



A. Facilitator 



The Commission will nominate a person to serve as a neutral facilitator for the negotiations of the Committee, subject
to the approval of the Committee by consensus. The facilitator will not be involved in the substantive development
of the regulations. The facilitator's roles are to: (1) Chair negotiating sessions, (2) help the negotiation process
run smoothly, (3) help participants define and reach a consensus, and (4) manage record-keeping and minute-keeping.




B. Good Faith Negotiations 



Since participants must be willing to negotiate in good faith, each organization_including the Commission_must
designate a qualified individual to represent its interests. Thomas S. Tycz, Deputy Chief, Domestic Facilities
Division, Common Carrier Bureau, will be the Commission's representative. 



C. Meetings and Compensation 



Meetings will be held in the Washington, DC area at the convenience of the Committee. The Commission, if requested,
will provide the facilities needed to conduct the meetings, and will provide the facilities needed to conduct the
meetings, and will provide any necessary technical support. Private sector members of the Committee will serve without
government compensation or reimbursement of expenses. Private sector members will not be special government employees
for any purposes whatsoever. 



D. Committee Procedures 



Under the general guidance and direction of the facilitator, and subject to any applicable legal requirements, the
members will establish the procedures for committee meetings that they consider most appropriate.

<TEXT>
 

E. Consensus 



The goal of the Committee is consensus. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act defines consensus as unanimous concurrence
among the represented interests, although the Act permits the Committee to agree to another specified definition.
In the event the Committee is unable to reach a consensus, the Committee may include in a report any other information,
recommendations, or materials that the Committee considers appropriate, and any Committee member may include as
an addendum to the report additional information, recommendations, or materials. Parties to the negotiation may
withdraw at any time. If this happens, the remaining Committee members and the Commission will evaluate whether the
Committee should continue. 



F. Record of Meetings 



Pursuant to FACA, the Committee will keep a record of all committee meetings. This record will be placed in the public
docket for this rulemaking (CC Docket 92-297). The Commission will announce committee meetings in the 

Federal Register

. These meetings will be open to the public. 



VI. Conclusion 



The Commission requests public comment on whether: (1) It should establish a Federal Advisory Committee, (2) it has
properly identified the interests that are significantly affected by the key issues listed above, (3) the suggested
committee membership reflects a balanced representation of these interests, and (4) regulatory negotiation is
appropriate for this rulemaking. 

Pursuant to the applicable procedures set forth in section 4(c) of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990, 5 U.S.C.
584(c), interested parties may file comments and applications for Committee membership on or before March 18, 1994.
Comments and/or applications should be sent to the Office of the Secretary, CC Docket No. 92-297, Federal Communications
Commission, Washington, DC 20554. Comments and applications will be available for public inspection during regular
business hours in the Dockets Public Reference Room of the Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20554. 

 


For further information pertaining to the establishment of the negotiation committee and associated matters, contact

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document addresses comments filed in response to the Commission's proposal to redesignate the 28 GHz frequency
band (27.5-29.5 GHz) from terrestrial point-to-point services, to terrestrial point-to-multipoint services.
In this action, the Commission modifies its prior proposal. In order to develop regulations for the use of the 28 GHz
band that optimize the public interest benefits to the Nation, the Commission is issuing concurrently with this document
a public notice requesting comments regarding the establishment of a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee (NRMC). The
NRMC, if established, will develop technical regulations reflecting a consensus determination whether proposed
terrestrial and satellite uses can share, on a co-frequency and co-coverage basis, the 28 GHz band. In the event that
sharing is not possible for some of the proposed uses of the 28 GHz band, parties will be requested to provide detailed
analyses of the costs and benefits of the various choices available to the Commission for the use of this frequency
band. All other issues pertaining to establishment of LMDS will await development of frequency coordination and
sharing criteria for space and terrestrial services and technical parameters for the service.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a synopsis of the Commission's Second Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in CC Docket 92-297, adopted January
19, 1994, and released February 14, 1994.

Synopsis of Second Notice of Proposed Rulemaking



In the NPRM, 58 FR 6400 (January 28, 1993), the Commission considered three petitions for rulemaking proposing a redesignation
of the 28 GHZ band. That band currently is designated for fixed point-to-point and fixed satellite service use. It
found that redesignation of the point-to-point and fixed satellite service use. It found that redesignation of the
point-to-point use of the band to point-to-multipoint use could stimulate greater use of a band that largely has lain
fallow. However, the Commission asked for comment from satellite entities regarding the effect of redesignation
on any proposed fixed satellite use of the band.

As requested by the petitions for rulemaking from Suite 12 and Video/Phone, the Commission proposed that the 28 GHz
band initially be licensed to two 1000 MHz blocks to two different carriers. Since it appeared that video service initially
would be the primary service offered in LMDS, it proposed to divide each of the 1000 MHz bands into 50 channels of 20 MHz
each. It also proposed allowing licensees to provide a wide variety of other services. 

The Commission sought comment on whether other assignment schemes might better meet its objectives. It gave one example
of a different assignment scheme, 

i.e., 

four blocks, two of which would have the capacity to carry 34 video channels, and two of which could be used for smaller
video systems or telecommunications systems.

Finally, the Commission requested comment on whether a separate assignment would be specifically required to accommodate
the proposed satellite service applications in the Ka-band, or whether adequate coordination and sharing criteria
could be developed to permit both terrestrial and fixed satellite services to operate compatibly in the band. It noted
that the multicell multipoint configurations in the Suite 12 proposal envisioned a wide area distribution of services
that might make frequency sharing with other services impossible.

Comments to the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking indicated that the majority of interested parties support
the Commission's finding of widespread interest in LMDS. However, satellite entities argued in opposition to LMDS,
saying that such operations would cause unacceptable interference into fixed satellite services, including feeder
links supporting mobile satellite service systems.

The Commission stated that its preference is to accommodate all potential users of the 28 GHz band, both terrestrial
and satellite. This outcome would be in keeping with the Commission's responsibilities under Sections 1 and 7 of the
Communications Act and would provide consumers with the maximum number of service choices to meet their needs.

Section 1 mandates that the Commission ``make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States
a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communications service with adequate facilities
at reasonable charges * * *''. 47 U.S.C. 151. Congress also requires the Commission, through Section
7, 47 U.S.C. 157(a), to ``encourage the provision of new technologies and services to the public.'' So important is
this policy, Congress has enjoined that ``[a]ny person or party (other than the Commission) who opposes a new technology
or service * * * shall have the burden to demonstrate that such proposal is inconsistent with the public
interest.'' It has been the Commission's experience, in the nearly sixty years since the Communications Act was enacted,
that accommodating new technology and service proposals serves these objectives. The Commission stated that in
its view, making the 28 GHz band available to all potential service providers would allow consumers to determine the
best use of this spectrum. Accommodating all proposals would result in the availability of maximum communications
services possible at the lowest consumer prices possible.

The Commission further stated that coordination issues involved in allowing all interested parties to use the 28
GHz band are highly technical, and their solutions depend upon the specific system design of various proposals to
use the 28 GHz band. Moreover, these system designs and the supporting technologies are still in the developmental
stage and the course of their development could be influenced by our decisions in this proceeding. The Commission
believes that the best way to resolve the issues discussed here would be to establish an advisory committee to negotiate
proposed regulations to govern this band. Issued concurrently with this Second Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is
a Public Notice requesting comments on the use of a Negotiated Rulemaking Process in accordance with the Federal Advisory
Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. App. 2, and the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990, Public Law 101-648, November 28, 1990.

In spite of parties' best efforts, sharing may not be possible for all proposed uses. The technology required to permit
sharing may not yet be developed, sharing efforts may result in unacceptable degradation of service to consumers,
or sharing techniques may be prohibitively expensive, thus making an otherwise competitive service unaffordable
to customers. 
The prospect that only some of the proposed services can be accommodated within the 28 GHz band leaves the Commission
with the duty to choose which non-shareable services should be licensed. In order to make these choices, the Commission
requires a record based on issues pertaining to the overall public interest in enabling only certain of the non-shareable
services. Options for choosing among services include, but are not limited to, enforcing a particular modulation
scheme for some or all users; segmenting the band to include as many services as possible with less spectrum than parties
requested; assigning all spectrum to satellite uses; or assigning all spectrum to terrestrial uses. 
In the event the Negotiated Rulemaking is unsuccessful in reaching a consensus regarding proposed technical rules
that would accommodate the proposals before the Commission, the Commission stated that it would require a record
to enable it to select the best choices among services proposed. Assuming the Commission ultimately must select among
service proposals for the 28 GHz band, the factors it will employ to do this will include: 
(a) Economic growth potential: Which solution holds the greatest potential for stimulating lower prices and higher
demand for services, and in what product markets and geographic markets? Which solution offers competition in existing
markets, and which markets? Which solution best promotes increased efficiencies in spectrum usage, and permits
the greatest number of service providers to operate commercially viable systems? Which solution best promotes the
offering of new, high-quality and innovative services? Which solution promises to create the greatest number of
high-paying jobs, and how? Which solution offers the greatest potential for maximizing interconnection of U.S.
telecommunications services and facilities?
(b) Other public interest concerns that may not be readily calculable in economic terms: Which proposed plan appears
most likely to make the most services, of the most valuable services, available to the broadest segment of the national
community? What are the services, and to whom would they be available? Do any of the proposals promise needed services
for unserved or underserved areas, and if so, what services, and to which communities would they be made available?
Are particular services more likely to be valuable for educational, job training and employment applications, health
care, environmental or public safety uses? Do any of the proposals serve our goal of facilitating the development
of a National Information Infrastructure, and if so, how? 
(c) Timing: When are the services likely to become available and when are the benefits they promise likely to materialize?
If different benefits are likely to be realized at different times, what are the relative advantages of the short-term
and long-term benefits of the various services proposed? For example, should the Commission license a service that
is likely to become available in one or two years, but outlive its usefulness in five to eight years, if doing so would
preclude licensing a service that is likely to produce tangible benefits only after five years, but which benefits
may be expected to have long-lasting impact on economic growth and other public interest concerns? What are the likely
opportunity costs of not licensing the particular service for operation in this band? Are there any contingencies
that would affect the likely offering of the proposed services in a timely manner, such as market entry barriers? The
relative efficiency of spectrum use and reuse capability among service providers may also be a factor entering into
any final decision.

The proposed standards require quantification on the record in order for the Commission to make decisions based on
these factors. To that end, it requests that commenters provide specific, detailed information that would permit
the Commission to base a decision on the public interest impact of various options. In particular, the Commission
requires precise data on the exact nature of services proposed to be offered by each applicant, what entities would
provide the services, the business plans of the service providers, and the expected primary and secondary benefits
of the proposed services.

Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis



1. 

Reason for action. 

The purpose of this Second NPRM is to obtain comment on the proposed changes in fixed terrestrial and satellite service
usage for the 28 GHz frequency band.

2. 

Objectives. 

The objective of this proposal is to consider methods for appropriating spectrum in the 28 GHz band among existing
and potential service proponents.

3. 

Legal basis. 

The authority for this action is the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553; and Sections 4(i), 4(j), 301, 303(r)
of the Communications Act of 1934 as amended, 47 U.S.C. 145, 301, and 303(r).

4. 

Reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance requirements. 

None.

5. 

Federal rules which overlap, duplicate or conflict with these rules. 

None.

6. 

Description, potential impact and number of small entities involved. 

Since the first NPRM was issued, the Commission has been made aware of numerous small entities interested in manufacturing
and/or providing customer services using a variety of new technologies being developed in the 28 GHz band. The proposals
contemplated herein, to the extent they limit the previously proposed rule changes, could impact these small businesses.
The impact on small entities described in the NPRM released January 8, 1993, applies to this action as well.

7. 

Significant alternatives. 

Since the first NPRM was issued, the Commission has been made aware of other firms researching the potential for new
technology for video and other telecommunications services in the 28 GHz band. In addition, satellite entities may
offer alternatives to some services that would be offered in this band. In part due to these alternatives, the Commission
is taking the instant action.

Increasing Contractor Liability on Research and Development Contracts



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Procurement, Procurement Policy Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with Public Law 102-588, NASA has carried out an assessment of the allocation of risk, as currently
prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation, between NASA and its contractors for research and development
contracts. This assessment included publishing a concept paper in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 16715, March 30, 1993) in order to solicit public and Federal comment on options for allocating risk for correction
of defects in materials and workmanship or other failures to conform to contract requirements. As a result of public
comment and consistent with the requirement of Public Law 102-588 to initiate rule making, NASA is proposing
certain changes to the clause, Inspection of Research and Development_Cost Reimbursement, and the associated prescription.



Essentially these changes, modified as a result of public comment on the concept paper, are made to the current FAR
coverage:

(1) Allocate additional financial risks to the contractor;

(2) Assign the Government the burden of proof when disallowing the costs of correction or replacement;

(3) Define ``routine'' operations clearly; and

(4) Prescribe the use of an advance agreement to identify routine operations, to the maximum extent practical.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background



The proposed clause, which would be used as a substitute for the clause at FAR 52.246-8, Inspection of Research
and Development_Cost Reimbursement, for certain procurements, adds two situations under which the Contractor
will bear additional financial responsibility to remedy failures to comply with the requirements of this contract:
(1) The contractor did not apply best efforts toward the accomplishment of the research and development objectives
of the contract, and (2) the contractor did not follow generally accepted industrial or engineering practices in
performing routine operations. The contractor's liability will be limited to 50 percent of the cost to remedy the
failure or 10 percent of the contract value at the time the failure occurred, whichever is less. The proposed clause
differs from the standard FAR clause in paragraphs (a) and (h). Current cost principles preclude the allowability
of costs for insurance to cover these potential costs.

If after evaluating public comments, NASA decides to adopt the revised clause proposed herein, NASA will also propose
and appropriate FAR revision to cover the matter, as required by FAR 1.404.



Impact



NASA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The regulation imposes no new burdens on the public within the ambit of the Paperwork Reduction Act, as implemented
at 5 CFR part 1320.

Cost reimbursement research and development contracts. 



(a) With the prior approval of the Procurement Officer, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.246-XX,
Inspection of High Risk Research and Development_Cost Reimbursement, in lieu of the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.246-8,
in solicitations and contracts for research and development when (1) the primary objective of the contract is the
delivery of end items other than designs, drawings, or reports, (2) a cost-reimbursement contract is contemplated,
and (3) the estimated value of the contract is $50 million or more. 

(b) In connection with this clause, an advance agreement should be included in the contract which, to the maximum extent
practicable, identifies those particular tasks and activities which are categorized as routine operations, as
that term is defined in the clause at 1852.246-XX, and those tasks and activities which embody the contract's
research and development objectives. Routine operations include activities such as moving or packaging pieces
of equipment, manufacturing standard parts, or conducting standardized tests. Research and development activities
encompass tasks, methods, or technical approaches for which success in meeting the contract objectives cannot be
reasonably assured.

Inspection of High Risk Research and Development_Cost Reimbursement (xxx 1994)



(a) 

Definitions. Contractor's managerial personnel, 

as used in this clause, means the Contractor's directors, officers, managers, superintendents, or equivalent representatives
who have supervision or direction of_

(1) All or substantially all of the Contractor's business; 

(2) All or substantially all of the Contractor's operation at any one plant or separate location at which the contract
is being performed; or 

(3) A separate and complete major industrial operation connected with performing this contract. 



Routine operation 

means a task or activity which is performed in accordance with customary or regular procedures and for which successful
performance is reasonably assured. Routine operations may involve the performance of a service function or the fabrication
of an item. 



Work, 

as used in this clause, includes data when the contract does not include the Warranty of Data clause. 

(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering the work
under this contract. Complete records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor shall be maintained and
made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires.


(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all work called for by the contract, to the extent practicable at
all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may
also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or its subcontractors engaged in the contract performance. The
Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.

(d) If the Government performs any inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor
shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe
and convenient performance of these duties.

(e) Unless otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall accept work as promptly as practicable after
delivery, and work shall be deemed accepted 90 days after delivery, unless accepted earlier.

(f) At any time during contract performance, but no later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the
contract) after acceptance of all of the end items (other than designs, drawings, or reports) to be delivered under
the contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct work not meeting contract requirements.
Time devoted to the replacement or correction of such work shall not be included in the computation of the above time
period. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (h) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall
be determined as specified in the Allowable Cost and Payment clause, but not additional fee shall be paid. The Contractor
shall not tender for acceptance work required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement
for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.

(g)(1) If the Contractor fail to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform replacement or correction, the Government
may_

(i) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost,
or make an equitable reduction in any fixed fee paid or payable under the contract;

(ii) Require delivery of any undelivered articles and shall have the right to make an equitable reduction in any fixed
fee paid or payable under the contract; or

(iii) Terminate the contract for default. 

(2) Failure to agree on the amount of increased cost to be charged the Contractor or to the reduction in fixed fee shall
be a dispute.

(h)(1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (f) and (g) of this clause, the Government may at any time require the Contractor
to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure to comply with the requirements
of this contract, if the failure is due to:

(i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel;

(ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the
Contractor's managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or
unqualified;

(iii) The Contractor not applying best efforts toward the accomplishment of the research and development objectives
of the contract (those for which success cannot be reasonably predicted at the time of contract award); or

(iv) The Contractor not following generally accepted industrial or engineering practices in performing routine
operations as part of contract performance.

(2) The contractor's liability for failures due to causes listed in subparagraphs (h)(1) (iii) and (iv) is limited
to the lesser of: (i) 50 percent of the cost to remedy the failure, or (ii) 10 percent of the contract value at the time
the failure occurred.

(i) This clause shall apply in the same manner to a corrected or replacement end item or components as to work originally
delivered.

(j) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under the contract to correct or replace articles not meeting contract
requirements at time of delivery, except as provided in this clause or as may otherwise be specified in the contract.

(k) Unless otherwise provided in the contract, the Contractor's obligations to correct or replace Government-furnished
property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to determine endangered status for the Barton Springs salamander
(

Eurycea sosorum

), known only from Barton Springs in Zilker Park, Austin, Travis County, Texas. The primary threat to this species
is contamination of the waters that feed Barton Springs due to the potential for catastrophic events (such as petroleum
or chemical spills) and chronic degradation resulting from urban activities. Also of concern are disturbances to
the salamander's surface habitat (the waters in Barton Springs, Eliza Pool, and Sunken Garden Springs) and reduced
groundwater supplies resulting from increased groundwater withdrawal. This proposal, if made final, would implement
Federal protection provided by the Act for the Barton Springs salamander.

The Service proposes to list as endangered the Barton Springs 
salamander (

Eurycea sosorum

), under the authority of the Endangered 
Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et. seq.

). 
The Barton Springs salamander is entirely aquatic and neotenic, 
meaning it does not metamorphose into a terrestrial form and retains 
its bright red external gills throughout life. Adults attain an 
average length of 6.35 centimeters (2.5 inches). This species is 
slender, with slightly elongate limbs and reduced eyes. Dorsal 
coloration varies from pale purplish-brown or gray to 
yellowish-cream. Irregular spacing of dorsal pigments and pigment 
gaps results in a mottled, ``salt and pepper'' pattern (Sweet 1978, 
Chippindale 

et al.

 1993). 
The Barton Springs salamander was first collected from Barton 
Springs Pool in 1946 by Bryce Brown and Alvin Flury (Chippindale 

et 
al.

 1993, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) 1993). 
Although he did not publish a formal description, Dr. Samuel Sweet 
(University of California at Santa Barbara) was the first to 
recognize the Barton Springs salamander as distinct from other 
central Texas 

Eurycea 

salamanders based on its restricted 
distribution and unique morphological and skeletal characteristics 
(such as its reduced eyes, elongate limbs, dorsal coloration, and 
reduced number of presacral vertebrae) (Sweet 1978, 1984). Formal 
description of the Barton Springs salamander, based on Sweet's work 
and genetic studies conducted by the University of Texas and TPWD 
(TPWD 1989, 1990, 1992), was published in June, 1993 (Chippindale 

et 
al.

 1993). An adult male, collected from Barton Springs Pool in 
November, 1992, was selected to be the holotype. 
The Barton Springs salamander is found near three of four 
hydrologically connected spring outlets collectively known as Barton 
Springs (Brune 1981). These three spring outlets are known as 
Parthenia, Eliza, and Sunken Garden springs and occur in Zilker 
Park, which is owned and operated by the City of Austin. No 
salamanders have been found at the fourth spring outlet, which is in 
Barton Creek immediately above Barton Springs Pool (Paul Chippindale 
and Dr. David Hillis, University of Texas at Austin; Dr. Andrew 
Price, TPWD; Sweet; pers. comms., 1993). The area around the main 
spring outlet (Parthenia Springs) was impounded in the late 1920's 
to create Barton Springs Pool. Flows from Eliza and Sunken Garden 
springs are also retained by concrete structures, forming small 
pools located on either side of Barton Springs Pool. The salamander 
has been observed under gravel and small rocks, submerged leaves, 
and algae; among aquatic vegetation; and buried in organic debris, 
at depths of about 0.1 to 5 meters (0.3 to 16 feet) of water 
(Chippindale 

et al. 

1993, TPWD 1993). It generally does not occur 
on bare limestone surfaces or in silted areas (Dr. Charles Sexton, 
City of Austin, Environmental Conservation Services Department, 
unpublished data). 
Hundreds of individuals were estimated to occur in Eliza Pool 
during the 1970's (James Reddell, University of Texas at Austin, 
pers. comm. in Chippindale 

et al. 

1993). The numbers apparently 
declined over the next decade. Fewer than a dozen and occasionally 
no individuals were observed during surveys conducted in Eliza Pool 
between 1987 and 1992 (Chippindale 

et al. 

1993; TPWD 1993; Price, 
unpubl. data). 
The Barton Springs salamander was reportedly abundant among 
the aquatic vegetation in the deep end of Barton Springs Pool in 
1946 (Chippindale 

et al. 

1993, TPWD 1993). Between 1989 and 1991, 
Sexton (

in litt., 

1992) reported finding salamanders on ``about one 
out of four [snorkeling] dives'' under rock rubble immediately 
adjacent to the main spring outflows. On July 28, 1992, at least 50 
salamanders (Hillis, pers. comm., 1993) were found over an area of 
roughly 400 square meters (4,300 square feet) near the spring 
outflows in Barton Springs Pool (TPWD 1993). Following reports of a 
fish kill at Barton Springs Pool on September 28, 1992 (Austin 
American Statesman, October 2, 1992; Daily Texan, October 13, 1992), 
only 10 to 11 salamanders were observed and could only be found in 
an area of about 5 square meters (54 square feet) in the immediate 
vicinity of the Parthenia Spring outflows (Chippindale 

et al. 

1993, 
TPWD 1993). Since that event, the salamander appears to be 
recolonizing Barton Springs Pool, which has been attributed to 
recent changes in pool cleaning operations (see further discussion 
under Factor A). At least 80 individuals were observed during a 
November 16, 1992, survey and about 150 individuals were seen on 
November 24, 1992 (Chippindale 

et al. 

1993, TPWD 1993).

The salamander was first observed at Sunken Garden Springs on 
January 12, 1993 (TPWD 1993). Five or fewer individuals have been 
sighted on any given visit to this outlet (Chippindale, pers. comm., 
1993). Biologists had speculated that the salamander occurred at 
Sunken Garden Springs; however, no salamanders were observed during 
previous surveys conducted at this location between 1987 and 1992. 
Low water levels and the presence of large rocks and sediment in the 
pool reportedly make searching for salamanders difficult at this 
location (TPWD 1993). 
The extent to which the salamander occurs in the aquifer is 
unknown. However, there is currently no evidence indicating that 
the species' range extends beyond the immediate vicinity of Barton 
Springs. Surveys of other spring outlets (including the spring 
outlet immediately above Barton Springs Pool) in the Barton Springs 
segment and other portions of the Edwards Aquifer have failed to 
locate additional populations (Chippindale 

et al.

 1993; William 
Russell, speleologist; Hillis; Price; Sweet; pers. comms., 1993). 
No other species of 

Eurycea 

is known to occur in this portion of the 
aquifer. 
The Barton Springs salamander's diet is believed to consist 
almost entirely of amphipods (Chippindale 

et al.

 1993). Primary 
predators are believed to be fish and crayfish (Chippindale, Hillis, 
Price, pers. comm., 1993). Observations of larvae and females with 
eggs (Chippindale 

et al.

 1993) indicate successful breeding is 
occurring. The species may breed year-round (Chippindale, pers. 
comm., 1993). 
The water that discharges at Barton Springs originates from 
the Barton Springs segment of the Edwards Aquifer (hereafter 
referred to as the ``Barton Springs segment''). The Barton Springs 
segment covers roughly 400 square kilometers (155 square miles) from 
southern Travis County to northern Hays County, Texas. The 
approximate boundaries are the ``bad water'' line to the east (where 
dissolved solids are less than 1,000 milligrams/l (mg/l) (1,000 
parts per million) in the aquifer, but greater than this to the 
east); the Colorado River to the north; the geologic divide between 
contiguous Edwards limestones overlying the aquifer and the Glen 
Rose limestones to the west; and a groundwater divide occurring 
roughly between the Onion Creek and Blanco River watersheds to the 
south. The area south of the southern boundary is known as the San 
Antonio segment of the Edwards Aquifer and drains toward San Marcos 
Springs. Groundwater movement from the San Antonio segment 
northward to the Barton Springs segment is believed to occur only 
during extreme drought conditions. North of the southern boundary, 
the water in the aquifer moves toward Barton Springs (Slade 

et al.

 
1986). 
Barton Springs drains about 391 square kilometers (151 square 
miles) of the Barton Springs segment. The remaining 10 square 
kilometers (4 square miles) discharge at Cold and Deep Eddy Springs 
and are believed to be hydrologically distinct from the area 
discharging to Barton Springs. Cold and Deep Eddy Springs are 
recharged by Dry Creek and a portion of Barton Creek. About 96 
percent of all springflow from the aquifer discharges through Barton 
Springs. The remaining 4 percent exits through intermittent 
springs, most of which are located in Barton Creek between Loop 360 
and Barton Springs. These springs flow only about 30 percent of the 
time and discharge up to 170 liters per second (l/s) (6 cubic feet 
per second (cfs)). The long-term mean discharge from Barton Springs 
is about 1,400 l/s (50 cfs), ranging from 283 l/s (10 cfs) to 4,700 
l/s (166 cfs) (Slade 

et al.

 1986). The mean water temperature is 
20
 C (68
 F) (Martyn-Baker 

et al.

 1992). 
The Barton Springs segment is divided into two major zones, 
the recharge zone and artesian zone. The recharge zone is that 
portion of the aquifer where Edwards limestones are exposed at the 
surface, and covers the western 79 percent (about 233 square 
kilometers (90 square miles)) of the aquifer. The artesian zone is 
confined by an impermeable layer of Del Rio clay and covers the 
eastern 21 percent of the aquifer. About 85 percent of all recharge 
is through sinkholes, fractures, and other openings in the beds of 
six major creeks that cross the recharge zone, including (from north 
to south) Barton, Williamson, Slaughter, Bear, Little Bear, and 
Onion creeks. The remaining 15 percent of recharge is through 
tributaries and direct infiltration between the creeks (Slade 

et al.

 
1986).

The watersheds of the six creeks upstream (west) of the 
recharge zone span about 684 square kilometers (264 square miles). 
This area is referred to as the contributing zone and includes 
portions of Travis, Hays, and Blanco counties. The recharge and 
contributing zones make up the total area that provides water to the 
aquifer, which equals about 917 square kilometers (354 square miles) 
(Slade 

et al. 

1986). 

Based on streamflow studies, Onion Creek and Barton Creek 
contribute the greatest percentages of total recharge to the aquifer 
(34 percent and 28 percent, respectively). Williamson, Slaughter, 
Bear, and Little Bear creeks each contribute 12 percent or less to 
total recharge. Owing to the amount of recharge contributed by 
Barton Creek and its proximity to Barton Springs, this creek has a 
greater impact on the water quality at the springs than any other 
recharge source in the Barton Springs segment (Slade 

et al. 

1986). 

The potential of the Edwards Aquifer to rapidly transmit large 
volumes of water with little filtration makes it highly susceptible 
to pollution (Slade 

et al. 

1986). The Edwards Aquifer is a 
``karst'' aquifer, characterized by subsurface features such as 
caves, sinkholes, and other conduits. The aquifer is made up of 
limestones that have high localized permeability and porosity. 
Dissolution of calcium carbonate along faults and fractures in the 
bedrock forms solution channels similar to an underground network of 
pipes. Because these subsurface ``pipes'' are not uniformly 
distributed, groundwater movement in the aquifer is highly variable, 
being rapid in areas where the ``pipes'' are large and extensive and 
slow where permeability and porosity are low. Transmissivity (the 
rate at which groundwater is transmitted through the aquifer) values 
for the Barton Springs segment have been estimated at 0.3 to 4,000 
square meters (3 to 47,000 square feet) per day and tend to increase 
as one moves northward toward the springs (Slade 

et al. 

1985). 

Karst aquifers are also more prone to pollution than other 
aquifers because few materials (such as sand, gravel, and organic 
matter) are present to filter out pollutants (U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) 1990). Furthermore, waters entering from 
the surface receive little filtration from the typically thin soils 
overlying the aquifer (Slade 

et al. 

1986). As a result, increasing 
urban development over the area supplying recharge waters to the 
Barton Springs segment can threaten water quality within the 
aquifer. The Texas Water Commission (TWC) has identified the 
Edwards Aquifer as being one of the most sensitive aquifers in Texas 
to groundwater pollution (TWC 1989; Margaret Hart, TWC, 

in litt

., 
1991). 

The Barton Springs salamander has been a Category 2 candidate 
species on the Service's candidate notices of review since December 
30, 1982 (47 FR 58454; September 18, 1985-50 FR 37958; January 6, 
1989-54 FR 554; and November 21, 1991-56 FR 58804), meaning that 
information then available indicated that a proposal to determine 
endangered or threatened status was possibly appropriate, but 
conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threats were not 
then available to support such a proposal. Through publication of 
the candidate notices, the Service requests any additional status 
information that may be available. On January 22, 1992, the Service 
received a petition from Dr. Mark Kirkpatrick and Ms. Barbara Mahler 
to list the Barton Springs salamander. The Service evaluated this 
petition and on November 25, 1992, determined that the petition 
presented information on threats indicating that the requested 
action may be warranted. A notice of that finding was published in 
the 

Federal Register

 on December 11, 1992 (57 FR 58779). The 
Service continued its status review of the species and solicited 
information regarding the status of the salamander. Although the 


Federal Register

 notice requested that comments be submitted by 
January 11, 1993, the Service sent out numerous notification letters 
indicating that it recognized additional time may be needed and 
requesting that pertinent information be submitted by February 10, 
1993. This proposed rule constitutes the final finding on the 
petitioned action for the Barton Springs salamander. 



Summary of Comments and Recommendations 



The Service received 205 letters from individuals and agencies 
providing information and comments on the petition and the 90-day 
finding. Of the letters received, 104 were form letters stating 
opposition to listing, 80 were other letters opposing listing, 14 
supported listing, and 7 were neutral. Some of the letters provided 
additional new, substantive information, which was considered in 
making a final determination on the petition. Major comments of a 
similar nature or point are grouped into a number of general issues 
and are presented and discussed here. 



Issue 1: 

Several commenters requested that the Service delay 
or preclude listing the Barton Springs salamander because too little 
is known about the salamander's biology, including factors such as 
its range, population size and status, dietary needs, predators, 
longevity, reproductive success, and sensitivity to contaminants and 
other water quality constituents. 



Response: 

The known range of the Barton Springs salamander is 
based on the most recent information available, including status 
surveys conducted by the University of Texas at Austin and TPWD 
pursuant to section 6 of the Act, and through personal communication 
with biologists who conducted surveys at other springs in central 
Texas. No new information was provided to contradict the finding 
that the salamander is endemic to the immediate vicinity of Barton 
Springs. Regarding other aspects of the species' biology, such as 
its population status, the Act requires a species to be determined 
endangered or threatened if one or more of the five factors 
described in section 4(a)(1) causes it to qualify under the Act's 
definition. Absolute population number may not be as significant in 
determining whether a species is endangered or threatened as 
knowledge that the species' entire range is threatened and cannot be 
preserved (see Factor A, ``The present or threatened destruction, 
modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range,'' and Factor 
D, ``The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms''). Although 
there are still biological questions regarding the Barton Springs 
salamander, the Service believes that the available scientific 
information is sufficient for status determination and strongly 
supports the need to designate the salamander as an endangered 
species. The data that support this conclusion are presented and 
discussed in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' 
section of this rule, particularly under Factor A (loss of habitat). 
Available information on the sensitivity of the salamander and its 
prey base (amphipods) to water quality deterioration is discussed 
under Factors A and E (``Other natural or manmade factors affecting 
its continued existence''). Once a species becomes listed as 
threatened or endangered, section 4(f) of the Act directs the 
Service to develop and implement a recovery plan for that species. 
Recovery is the process by which the decline of a listed species is 
arrested or reversed, and threats to its survival are eliminated or 
neutralized, so that its long-term survival in nature can be 
ensured. Further research is very often an essential component of 
recovery plans. The Service envisions that conducting research on 
the salamander's biology and other factors, such as those mentioned 
in this comment, will be an important part of the recovery process 
for this species (see Available Conservation Measures).

Issue 2: 

Several individuals questioned the taxonomic status 
of the salamander, asserting that it is still an undescribed species 
and may be part of the central Texas salamander (

Eurycea neotenes

) 
complex. 



Response: 

Formal description of the salamander as a distinct 
species has withstood peer-review and was published in June, 1993 
(see discussion in the Background section). 



Issue 3: 

Several commenters stated that water quality data at 
Barton Springs show no demonstrable deterioration, despite 
development immediately upstream from the springs, much of which 
occurred prior to implementation of water quality controls. 



Response: 

The Service recognizes that, other than high levels 
of fecal-group bacteria and turbidity immediately following storm 
events, water quality at Barton Springs is considered to be very 
good. However, only about 3 to 4 percent of the recharge and 
contributing zones is currently developed. As urban development 
over the recharge and contributing zones increases, the threat of 
water quality degradation from point-source and non-point-source 
pollution will increase. The threat of increased urbanization over 
these areas and impacts on water quality in the aquifer and at 
Barton Springs are discussed in Factor A. 



Issue 4: 

Most commenters opposed to the listing stated that 
existing State and local rules and regulations are adequate to 
protect the salamander and its habitat from groundwater degradation 
and depletion. 



Response: 

This issue is presented and discussed in Factor D. 
The Service recognizes that there are several rules and regulations 
aimed at protecting water quality and quantity within the aquifer, 
and that these rules and regulations will provide some benefits to 
the Barton Springs salamander if adequately enforced. However, no 
information was presented to show that these existing rules and 
regulations will ensure long-term protection of water quality and 
quantity at Barton Springs and will be adequate to protect the 
salamander and its habitat. Furthermore, there are no assurances 
that the existing rules and regulations will remain in place and be 
enforced. Regarding water quantity, the Barton Springs/Edwards 
Aquifer Conservation District (BS/EACD) has limited enforcement 
authority and does not regulate 30 to 40 percent of the total volume 
that is pumped from the Barton Springs segment. 



Issue 5: 

Several individuals expressed concern that listing 
the salamander could impose restrictions on the recreational use of 
Barton Springs Pool. 



Response: 

This issue is discussed under Factor B 
(``Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or 
educational purposes''). There is currently no evidence suggesting 
that swimming in Barton Springs Pool will adversely impact the 
Barton Springs salamander. The Service maintains the position that 
if pool maintenance activities are conducted in such a way as to 
avoid impacting the salamander and its habitat (such as avoiding the 
application of chemicals and the use of high pressure fire hoses to 
clean areas inhabited by salamanders), then activities associated 
with swimming at Barton Springs Pool should not disturb the 
salamander. 



Issue 6: 

The salamander has persisted despite past droughts, 
low springflows, and pollution events over the aquifer and its 
contributing zone and at Barton Springs (elevated fecal coliform 
bacteria and turbidity). 



Response: 

The Service acknowledges that these events have 
occurred and that the frequency of such events is likely to increase 
with increasing development over the aquifer and its contributing 
zone. Although the salamander has survived these past events, the 
point at which declining water quality and quantity would cause 
extinction of the salamander is uncertain. Amphibians in general 
are highly sensitive to changes in water chemistry, and the 
salamander's restricted range makes it especially vulnerable to 
water quality deterioration. A major pollution event has the 
potential of eliminating the entire species and/or its prey base. 
Amphipods, which comprise most of the salamander's diet, are 
especially sensitive to water pollution (see discussion in Factor 
E). 



Issue 7: 

A few commenters stated that the threat of declining 
aquifer levels is not substantial at Barton Springs and, in any 
event, no demonstrable evidence exists that lowered aquifer levels 
will cause a threat to the continued existence of the salamander. 



Response: 

This issue is addressed in Factor A. Although the 
Service recognizes that cessation of flows is not likely at Barton 
Springs in the near future, increased groundwater withdrawal and 
resulting reduced flows are expected due to increasing urbanization 
over the aquifer. Reduced aquifer levels may lead to the 
encroachment of the ``bad water'' line and increased concentrations 
of pollutants in the aquifer.

Issue 8:

 Many individuals opposed listing of the salamander on the grounds that listing would undermine the success of the
Balcones Canyonlands Conservation Plan (BCCP). 



Response:

 The BCCP currently proposes to acquire land in the Barton Creek watershed, which will provide some benefits to the
salamander by preserving the natural integrity of the landscape and positively contributing to water quality in
Barton Creek and Barton Springs. The BCCP participants are currently working toward providing additional water
quality protection for the Barton Springs salamander, including retrofitting of existing developments with non-point-source
pollution control structures and protecting the aquifer and Barton Springs from catastrophic pollution events
(see discussion in Factor D). 



Issue 9:

 Some commenters expressed concern regarding economic impacts of listing the salamander and stated that economic
impacts should be considered. 



Response:

 Under section 4(b)(1)(A) of the Act, the listing process must be based solely on the best scientific information available,
and economic considerations are not applicable. The legislative history of the Act clearly states the intent of Congress
to ``ensure'' that listing decisions are ``based solely upon biological criteria and to prevent non-biological
considerations from affecting such decisions'' (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 97-835 for the 1982 amendments). Because
the Service is specifically precluded from considering economic impacts in the listing process, the Service has
not addressed such impacts in proposing to list this species. 



Issue 10: 

The Service received one comment letter requesting that the Barton Springs salamander be emergency listed. 



Response:

 In accordance with section 4(b)(7) of the Act, a species may be listed as threatened or endangered on an emergency basis
if a significant risk to the well-being of the species is identified. Although the Service has determined that multiple
threats to the salamander exist (see discussion in ``Summary of Factors'' section), the Service is not able to justify
an emergency determination since these threats are not of such an immediate nature that the delay during the period
between this proposed rule and any final rule might pose a significant risk to the well-being of the species. 



Issue 11:

 A few commenters questioned the validity of the information and findings presented in several reports prepared by
the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) (including Slade 

et al.

 1985 and 1986, Veenhuis and Slade 1990). 



Response:

 The Service has reviewed the USGS reports used in preparation of this rule and has determined that the data were gathered
and analyzed in accordance with sound scientific principles. The Service accepts these reports as valid and relevant
scientific information and accepts their findings. 



Issue 12:

 A few individuals cited a 1922 report stating that elevated levels of fecal coliform bacteria have been documented
at Barton Springs since 1922 (T.U. Taylor, Austin City Water Survey, 

in litt.

, 1922).

Response:

 According to the City of Austin's review of the 1922 report, the method used to measure bacterial counts at the time
the report was prepared is different from that used today, and thus ``the bacterial counts are not directly comparable
to * * * current sampling'' techniques (Austin Librach, City of Austin Environmental Conservation
Services Department, 

in litt.

, 1991). Elevated counts during the 1920's may have been due to ranching activities or poor sanitary disposal of human
wastes, as well as natural sources (Librach, 

in litt.

, 1991). 



Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 



Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions
of the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered
or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application
to the Barton Springs salamander (

Eurycea sosorum

) are as follows: 

A. 

The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range.

 The primary threat to the Barton Springs salamander is contamination of the waters that feed Barton Springs. A discussion
of some potential effects of contaminants on the salamander and its prey base (amphipods) is provided in this section
and under Factor D. Potential factors contributing to contamination of this portion of the Edwards Aquifer are catastrophic
events (such as hazardous material spills) and chronic degradation resulting from urban activities. Water quality
degradation can result from point-source and/or non-point-source pollution. Point-source pollution originates
from identifiable areas, such as leaking pipelines. Non-point-source pollution enters the water supply through
diffuse sources, such as runoff from urban areas. The EPA (1990) and TWC (1989) have identified several major potential
sources of groundwater contamination, including leaking underground storage tanks, pipelines, septic tanks,
and pesticide and fertilizer use. Other threats to the salamander are disturbances to its surface habitat and reduced
groundwater supplies owing to increased groundwater withdrawal. 

Due to the Barton Springs salamander's restricted range, one or more catastrophic spills has the potential to impact
the entire species and its habitat. Catastrophic spills may result from leaking underground storage tanks, pipeline
ruptures, transportation accidents, and/or other sources. Spilled materials reported to the TWC for Travis and
Hays counties between 1986 and 1992 included oils, sewage, pesticides, ammonia, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric
acid, ferrous sulfate, trichloroethane, and perchloroethene. About a third of the spills involved gasoline or diesel
fuel, most of which resulted from underground storage tank leaks and transportation accidents. Leaking underground
storage tanks ``are considered to be one of the most significant sources of groundwater contamination'' in Texas
(TWC 1989). The Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) (1987) has estimated that thousands of underground storage
tanks in Texas may be leaking. According to the EPA (1990), ``a growing problem of substantial potential consequences
is leakage from underground storage tanks and from pipelines leading to them * * * gasoline leakage
has caused severe hazardous difficulties throughout the nation.'' The EPA (in TWC 1989) has estimated that at least
25 percent of the underground storage tanks in Texas ``will ultimately be confirmed as leakers.'' 

According to the TWC (1989), ``substances spilled on the land surface can be a serious threat if the surface and subsurface
materials are sufficiently permeable to permit downward movement'' and if spilled materials are not promptly or
adequately remediated. Transportation accidents involving hazardous materials at bridge crossings are of particular
concern, since creek beds can transport spilled materials directly into the aquifer. For example, if a contaminant
spill occurred at the Loop 360 bridge crossing over Barton Creek, less than 5 kilometers (3 miles) south of Barton Springs,
the contaminant could reach Barton Springs within hours. The Barton Springs Task Force report to the TWC (City of Austin
1991) states that ``the major fault that creates the discharge for Barton Springs crosses Barton Creek in the vicinity
of Loop 360 and appears to be a significant point of recharge which may provide direct transmission, similar to pipe
flow, to the Springs.'' Loop 360 provides a major route for transportation of petroleum and gasoline products to service
stations in the Austin area.

Oil pipeline ruptures also represent a potential source of 
groundwater contamination. Three oil pipelines run roughly parallel 
to each other across the Barton Springs segment and its contributing 
zone and cross Barton Creek near the Hays/Travis county line. Two 
of these lines ruptured within the recharge zone during the 1980's, 
about 13 kilometers (8 miles) south of Barton Springs. These two 
spills constitute the largest spills reported from Hays and Travis 
counties between 1986 and 1992 (TWC, unpubl. data). The first major 
spill occurred in 1986, about 270 meters (300 yards) from Slaughter 
Creek, when an oil pipeline was severed during a construction 
operation and released about 366,000 liters (96,600 gallons) of oil. 
The equipment necessary to contain the spill was on-site at the time 
the spill occurred (Russell 1987), and about 91 percent of the spill 
was recovered (Rose 1986). The second pipeline break occurred in 
1987 near the first spill site and released over 185,000 liters 
(49,000 gallons) of oil. According to the TWC database, more than 
97 percent of this spill was recovered (TWC, unpubl. data). 
Although the effects of these two spills on the Barton Springs 
salamander are unknown, similar spills that are not immediately 
remediated could adversely impact the salamander and its habitat. 
Peter Rose (1986), a geologist who has studied the effects of 
pipeline oil spills on the Edwards Aquifer, has estimated that oil 
spills of 160,000 liters (42,000 gallons) or more pose a 
``reasonable danger'' of entering and contaminating the Edwards 
Aquifer. ``Free oil entering an unconfined aquifer would be 
expected to spread and travel in the direction of water flow, 
emerging eventually at springs * * *'' (Rose 1986). Oil is highly 
toxic to aquatic life (Pyastolova and Danilova 1987). A study of 
the effects of oil on the sharp-snouted frog (

Rana arvalis

) showed 
that ``the presence of crude oil in an aquatic environment, even in 
small amounts (0.05 ml/l) exerts an unfavorable influence on both 
embryonic and larval development'' of the frog, including increased 
mortality and appearance of deformities (Pyastolova and Danilova 
1987). Because of physiological similarities among amphibian 
larvae, the Barton Springs salamander may exhibit similar or 
possibly more severe reactions. 
The conveyance and treatment of sewage in the watershed, 
particularly in the recharge zone, may also result in the impairment 
of local water quality and negative effects to the Barton Springs 
salamander. In 1982, high levels of fecal coliform bacteria at 
Barton Springs were attributed to a sewerline leak upstream from 
Barton Springs Pool. While fecal coliform bacteria are believed to 
be harmless, they may indicate the presence of other organisms that 
are pathogenic to aquatic life (Slade 

et al. 

1986), some of which 
may pose a threat to salamanders and/or their prey base. The USGS 
has stated that because ``there are many sewerlines near the 
springs, fecal coliform contamination of the springs may be a 
recurring problem'' (Slade 

et al. 

1986). There are over 145 
kilometers (90 miles) of wastewater lines in the recharge zone of 
the Barton Springs segment (Maureen McReynolds, City of Austin Water 
and Wastewater Utility, pers. comm., 1993). 
Once an aquifer is contaminated, it can be very difficult to 
remediate. TDA (1987) maintains that ``contaminated groundwater can 
be extremely difficult and expensive, and in some cases even 
impossible, to clean up. The only way to maintain groundwater 
quality is to prevent contamination in the first place.'' 
Regarding the effects of oil pipeline spills on the Edwards Aquifer, 
``* * * for all practical purposes, once spilled oil has been 
introduced into a cavernous carbonate aquifer, only time and nature 
can take care of the cleanup job'' (Rose 1986). 
Major contaminant spills that are not quickly remediated could 
enter the aquifer and contaminate the waters feeding Barton Springs. 
Response times to hazardous materials spills vary, depending on 
several factors, including detection capability, location and size 
of the spill, weather conditions, whether or not the spill is 
reported, and the party performing the cleanup. Generally, cleanup 
is initiated within several hours following detection of a spill, 
but many weeks may be necessary to complete the effort. In some 
cases in Travis County, cleanup of leaking storage tanks was not 
initiated until two months following leak detection (Philip 
Winsborough, TWC, pers. comm., 1993). In other cases, such as the 
oil pipeline ruptures that occurred within the recharge zone, 
cleanup was initiated the same day the spill was detected and 
completed the following day. 
Chronic water quality degradation of the aquifer resulting 
from increasing urban activities (including roadway, residential, 
commercial, and industrial development) may also lead to 
contamination of the waters feeding Barton Springs (see also 
discussion under Factor D). Because of the characteristics of karst 
aquifers discussed in the Background section, Barton Springs is 
believed to be ``heavily influenced by the quality and quantity of 
runoff,'' particularly in the recharge zone (City of Austin 1991). 
A report by USGS (Veenhuis and Slade 1990) on the relationship 
between urbanization and surface water quality in several streams 
throughout the Austin area (10 of 18 sample sites were along streams 
in the Barton Springs segment and its contributing zone) 
demonstrates that increases in impervious cover can lead to large 
increases in pollutant runoff. This is indicated in several streams 
with increased levels of suspended solids, biochemical oxygen 
demand, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, 
fecal-group bacteria, inorganic trace elements, and synthetic 
compounds. A preliminary review of water quality data for 15 wells 
in the Barton Springs segment also suggests that increasing 
impervious cover has resulted in increased concentrations of certain 
water quality constituents in the groundwater, including total 
nitrogen and total phosphorus (USGS 1992). These changes in 
groundwater quality may indicate future water quality changes at 
Barton Springs as development increases across the recharge and 
contributing zones.

Of the six creeks providing recharge to Barton Springs, Barton 
Creek has received the most intense development. The TWC has 
identified nutrients, fecal coliform bacteria, sediment, oil, and 
grease in Barton Creek, originating from rangeland, golf course 
runoff, highway construction, and highway runoff (Barbara Britton, 
TWC, 

in litt., 

1992). Increases in fecal coliform bacteria, 
nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), turbidity, and algal growth 
have been documented along Barton Creek between Highway 71 and Loop 
360 and are primarily due to sewage effluent irrigation and 
construction activities in this area (City of Austin 1991; Librach, 


in litt., 

1990). Changes in the aquatic invertebrate community 
along this portion of Barton Creek have also been attributed to golf 
course runoff (Librach, 

in litt., 

1990) and insecticide use (Dr. 
Chris Durden, Texas Memorial Museum, 

in litt., 

1991). These 
reported changes are significant because water quality at Barton 
Springs responds rapidly to changes in the quality of water 
contributed by Barton Creek. Groundwater originating from Barton 
Creek remains in the aquifer for short periods before discharging at 
the springs. Thus, there is little time for dilution or chemical 
breakdown of pollutants before discharging at Barton Springs (Slade 


et al. 

1986). 
Existing land use in the recharge and contributing zones has 
resulted in recurring fecal-group bacteria contamination and high 
turbidity (a measure of suspended solids or sediment) at Barton 
Springs (Slade 

et al.

 1986). Data suggest that bacteria and 
turbidity at Barton Springs increase significantly during storm 
events. Stormwater runoff has been identified as the major source 
of fecal coliform pollution at Barton Springs (City of Austin 1991). 
The level of nitrates at Barton Springs has also increased slightly 
from about 1.0 mg/l (measured as nitrate nitrogen) prior to 1955 to 
the current level of about 1.5 mg/l (Slade 

et al.

 1986). Increased 
nutrients may promote the growth of bacteria, algae, and nuisance 
aquatic plants (Slade 

et al.

 1986), which could reduce the dissolved 
oxygen available to the salamander. In Barton Springs Pool, the 
routine cleaning procedure necessary to remove algal growth may 
itself adversely impact the salamander and its habitat (see further 
discussion later in this section). 
High turbidity at Barton Springs has been attributed to 
construction activity in the Barton Springs segment (Slade 

et al.

 
1986, City of Austin 1991). Sources of turbidity are believed to be 
``primarily limited to 126 square miles [326 square kilometers] of 
the Barton Creek and immediately adjacent watersheds in the recharge 
zone'' (City of Austin 1991). Sediments have been observed 
emanating directly from the spring outlets in Barton Springs Pool 
(Doyle Mosier, LCRA; Debbie Dorsey, City of Austin Parks and 
Recreation Department; pers. comms., 1993). Potential problems 
resulting from increased sediment loads include (1) reduction of the 
salamander's habitat by covering substrates on which salamanders, 
their prey, and/or certain aquatic plants occur; (2) clogging of the 
salamander's gills, causing asphyxiation (Garton 1977), and 
smothering of eggs; (3) filling and blocking of underground conduits, 
restricting groundwater availability and movement; and (4) exposure 
of aquatic life to certain heavy metals and other toxins that 
readily bind to sediments. Contaminants that adsorb to the surface 
of sediments may be transported through the aquifer and later be 
released back into the water column. 
Aside from high levels of fecal-group bacteria and turbidity 
immediately following storm events, the water quality at Barton 
Springs is considered to be very good (Slade 

et al.

 1986, City of 
Austin 1991). However, only about 3 to 4 percent of the recharge 
and contributing zones is currently developed (USGS 1992), and both 
of these areas are under increasing pressure from urbanization (City 
of Austin 1988, Veenhuis and Slade 1990). The City of Austin has 
projected that the Austin metropolitan area will support a 
population of about 1.9 million by the year 2020, up from 577,000 in 
1982 (City of Austin Planning Department, in Veenhuis and Slade 
1990). Further development or urbanization in the recharge and 
contributing zones of the Barton Springs segment is likely to 
increase the chance of a major pollution event as well as chronic 
water quality decline in this area and thus increase the levels of 
pollutants reaching Barton Creek, other creeks serving as recharge 
paths, and Barton Springs (see also discussion under Factor D). The 
USGS (1992) has stated that ``much development is projected for the 
source area of Barton Springs * * *. [Thus] changes in water quality 
of Barton Springs * * * [are] possible in the near future.'' 
Water quality is highly variable throughout the Barton Springs 
segment and waters flowing from Barton Springs represent a mixture 
of these waters, originating primarily from the six streams crossing 
the recharge zone. Although much development has occurred along 
Barton Creek near Barton Springs, these waters are diluted by 
recharge waters from less developed watersheds, such as Onion Creek. 
Little development has occurred along Onion Creek, which, although 
farthest from the springs, contributes about 34 percent of the 
recharge waters (Slade 

et al.

 1986). According to the Capital Area 
Planning Council (CAPCO), Hays County experienced ``tremendous 
growth'' in the 1980's and has the second highest growth rate in the 
10-county CAPCO region. Dripping Springs, which is located in the 
contributing zone between Onion Creek and Barton Creek, ``will 
likely continue to experience a high rate of growth as development 
continues along U.S. 290 from the Oak Hill area westward'' (CAPCO 
1990). As development across these watersheds increases, the 
ability of the aquifer to dilute pollutants will continue to 
decrease. This decreased ability will likely be further compounded 
by increased pumping and/or drought conditions.

Another threat to the salamander is the degradation of its 
surface habitat, particularly at Barton Springs Pool and Eliza Pool. 
Following reports of a fish kill in Barton Springs Pool on September 
28, 1992 (Austin American Statesman, October 2, 1992; Daily Texan, 
October 13, 1992), the salamander's surface range contracted from 
about a 400 square meter (4,300 square foot) area to about a 5 
square meter (50 square foot) area immediately around the outflow of 
the spring (see discussion in Background). The fish kill has been 
attributed to the improper application of chlorine used to clean 
Barton Springs Pool (Chippindale et al. 1993, TPWD 1993). Previous 
fish kills, although rare events, have also occurred at Barton 
Springs Pool (Robert Sapronyi, City of Austin Parks and Recreation 
Department, pers. comm., 1992). Other cleaning procedures and park 
operations that may have had adverse impacts on the salamander and 
its surface habitat include lowering the water levels in Barton 
Springs Pool and Eliza Pool for cleaning, use of high pressure fire 
hoses in areas where salamanders are found, and removal of aquatic 
vegetation from Eliza Pool. Runoff from the area above Eliza Pool, 
which includes a maintenance area and concession stand for the 
Zilker Eagle train, may also have contributed to the decline in 
numbers of salamanders found at this location. 

Following the September 28 fish kill, the City of Austin 
discontinued the use of chlorine to clean Barton Springs Pool and 
Eliza Pool. The City of Austin is continuing to revise its pool 
maintenance practices in order to protect the salamander and its 
habitat, as well as maintain a safe environment for swimmers 
(Camille Barnett, City of Austin, 

in litt.,

 1993). Cleaning 
practices at Eliza Pool and other park operations near this pool are 
also being reevaluated. 

Another change that has been observed at Barton Springs is the 
loss of aquatic vascular plants in Barton Springs Pool, where 
salamanders were reportedly abundant in 1946. The plants 
disappeared during the late 1980's (Chippindale et al. 1993). The 
cause of the disappearance is unknown and may be due to changes in 
water quality originating upstream (such as increased turbidity), 
certain pool maintenance operations, and/or other factors. Aquatic 
plants are important because they provide cover where salamanders 
can hide from predators. Amphipods and other invertebrates that 
form the diet of salamanders also depend on aquatic vegetation 
(Hillis and Chippindale 1992). 

Reduced water levels in the Barton Springs segment could also 
adversely impact the Barton Springs salamander. The volume of 
springflow is self-regulated by the level of water in the aquifer. 
Discharge decreases as water storage in the aquifer drops, which 
historically has been due primarily to the lack of recharging rains 
rather than groundwater withdrawal for public consumption (Slade et 
al. 1986). Reduced aquifer levels may lead to the movement of water 
with high levels of total dissolved solids from the ``bad water'' 
zone to the freshwater zone of the Barton Springs segment, including 
Barton Springs (Slade et al. 1986). The increased concentration of 
dissolved solids resulting from this encroachment of ``bad water'' 
could have negative impacts on the plants and animals associated 
with Barton Springs. Reduced groundwater levels would also increase 
the concentration of pollutants in the aquifer. 

The potential for ``bad water'' encroachment is increased with 
(a) pumpage of the aquifer and (b) extended low recharge or low flow 
conditions (Slade et al. 1986). Barton Springs lies near the ``bad 
water'' line. Under low flow conditions, Barton Springs and a well 
near the ``bad water'' line (YD-58-50-216) show increased dissolved 
solid concentrations, particularly sodium and chloride, indicating 
that some encroachment of ``bad water'' has occurred at Barton 
Springs in the past (Slade et al. 1986). 

According to the Barton Springs/Edwards Aquifer Conservation 
District (BS/EACD) (1990), pumpage from the aquifer has increased in 
recent years, resulting in decreased discharges from Barton Springs. 
The USGS has stated that groundwater withdrawal in the area is 
expected to increase because of further urbanization in outlying 
areas of Austin. Currently, discharge from the Barton Springs 
segment (withdrawal plus springflow) is roughly equal to recharge. 
Thus, an increase in groundwater withdrawal is likely to cause a 
decrease in the quantity of water in the aquifer and discharge from 
Barton Springs (Slade et al. 1986). Based on the current population 
projection, water demands could almost double by the year 2000 (from 
about 470 hectare-meters/year (3,800 acre-feet/year) in 1982 to 
about 760 hectare-meters/year (6,200 acre-feet/year)) (Slade et al. 
1986). 

B. 

Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, 
or educational purposes.

 No threat from overutilization of this 
species is known to exist at this time. Several citizens have 
expressed concern over impacts to the salamander from recreational 
use of Barton Springs Pool for swimming. However, no evidence 
exists to indicate that swimming in Barton Springs Pool poses a 
threat to the salamander population. Provided that pool maintenance 
activities do not adversely impact the salamander and its habitat 
(see discussion under Factor A), swimming at Barton Springs Pool is 
not likely to disturb the salamander. 

C. 

Disease or predation.

 Certain naturally occurring 
populations as well as captive individuals of 

Eurycea neotenes

 have 
shown symptoms of redleg, a bacterial (

Aeromonas

 sp.) infection 
(Sweet 1978). The Barton Springs salamander may also be susceptible 
to this disease, although no diseases or parasites of the Barton 
Springs salamander have been reported. Primary predators of the 
Barton Springs salamander are believed to be fish and crayfish; 
however, no information exists to indicate that predation poses a 
major threat to this species.

D. 

The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. 

No 
existing rules or regulations specifically require protection of the 
Barton Springs salamander or its habitat. The salamander is not 
included on the TPWD's list of threatened and endangered species, 
and thus the species is not afforded protection by that agency. 
Several individuals who provided comments on the 90-day finding 
stated that existing state and local regulations are sufficient to 
mitigate potential water quality threats resulting from development 
activities in the Barton Springs segment and contributing zone. 
However, while there are many existing rules and regulations in 
place that will likely contribute positively to water quality and 
quantity, there are no assurances that they are adequate to protect 
the salamander and its habitat. Furthermore, whether the existing 
rules and regulations can provide long-term protection of the 
quality and quantity of the waters feeding Barton Springs is 
unknown. 
There are few measures in place to prevent the risk of 
hazardous material spills across the recharge and contributing 
zones. No regulations prohibit the transportation of hazardous 
materials across the Barton Springs segment (Tom Word, Texas 
Department of Transportation (TxDOT), pers. comm., 1993), and few 
existing roads have water quality control structures (such as 
hazardous materials traps, sediment basins, and filters) to protect 
against non-point-source pollution and chemical spills (Shyra Darr, 
Travis County Public Improvements and Transportation Department 
(PITD), 

in litt., 

1993; Barnett, 

in litt., 

1993; Roland Gamble, 
TxDOT, 

in litt., 

1993). Travis County and TxDOT have agreed to 
install water quality devices on new State and county roadway 
construction projects in the recharge zone (Barnett, 

in litt., 

1993; 
David Pimentel, PITD, 

in litt., 

1993; Gamble, 

in litt., 

1993). 
However, no program is currently in place to retrofit these 
water quality control structures on existing roadways in the Barton 
Springs segment (Barnett, 

in litt., 

1993). In addition, the 
effectiveness of these water quality control structures has not yet 
been determined (Gamble, 

in litt., 

1993). 
The major regulations affecting water quality in the Barton 
Springs segment include the Edwards Rules (31 Texas Administrative 
Code, Chapter 313), which are promulgated and enforced by the TWC, 
and the City of Austin's water quality protective ordinances 
(Williamson Creek Ordinance (1980), Barton Creek Watershed Ordinance 
(1981), Lower Watersheds Ordinance (1981), Comprehensive Watersheds 
Ordinance (1986), ``Composite Ordinance'' (1991), and the ``Save Our 
Springs'' (``SOS'') Ordinance (1992)). These ordinances are only 
implemented within Austin's city limits and five-mile 
extra-territorial jurisdiction, which is about a third of the entire 
area affecting Barton Springs. Each ordinance includes impervious 
cover limitations, development setbacks from water quality zones, 
erosion control measures, restricted or prohibited development on 
steep slopes, and other water quality protective measures. However, 
none of the ordinances include retrofit provisions for existing 
developments or land use regulations (Barnett, 

in litt., 

1993). 
Furthermore, the ordinances can be rendered ineffective by variance 
provisions and exemptions. The SOS Ordinance requires greater 
impervious cover limitations, further development restrictions in 
the water quality zones of Barton Creek, and limitations of 
exemptions from the ordinance provisions, and will attempt to reduce 
the risk of accidental contamination (Barnett, 

in litt., 

1993). 
The Edwards Rules regulate construction-related activities on 
the recharge zone that may ``alter or disturb the topographic, 
geologic, or existing recharge characteristics of a site'' as well 
as any other activity ``which may pose a potential for contaminating 
the Edwards Aquifer,'' including sewage collection systems and 
hazardous materials storage tanks. The Edwards Rules regulate 
construction activities through review of Water Pollution Abatement 
Plans (WPAPs). The WPAPs do not require site-specific water quality 
performance standards for developments over the recharge zone nor do 
they address land use, impervious cover limitations, or retrofitting 
for developments existing prior to the implementation of the Rules. 
(Travis County was not incorporated into the Rules until March, 
1990; Hays County was incorporated in 1984.) The WPAPs also do not 
regulate development activities in the aquifer's contributing zone. 
As yet, the Edwards Rules do not include a comprehensive plan to 
address the effects of cumulative impacts on water quality in the 
aquifer.

The long-term success of the watershed ordinances and the Edwards Rules in protecting water quality is unknown. Based
on the water quality data and changes observed in Barton Creek (see discussion under Factor A), some level of water
quality degradation in this area has already occurred (City of Austin 1991; Librach, 

in litt.

, 1990). Even if the Edwards Rules and the watershed ordinances are determined to be effective at protecting water
quality, about 50 percent of the area (most of which occurs in Hays County) affecting the waters of the aquifer and Barton
Springs is not covered by these City and State rules and regulations. Hays County recently filed a lawsuit against
the City of Austin to remove Hays County from the city's extra-territorial jurisdiction, which would further reduce
the area covered by the watershed ordinances. 

Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the SOS Ordinance or any of the preceding ordinances will remain in effect.
A lawsuit has been filed to invalidate the SOS Ordinance. Several bills have also been proposed in the Texas Legislature
aimed at restricting local environmental regulatory powers, and could prevent the City of Austin and other local
governments from implementing water quality protection ordinances such as the SOS ordinance. 

The Balcones Canyonlands Conservation Plan (BCCP) is being developed for Travis County to obtain a section 10(a)(1)(B)
permit allowing incidental taking of certain endangered species. Parties involved in the preparation of the BCCP
are TPWD, City of Austin, Travis County, and Lower Colorado River Authority. The current draft regional plan does
not explicitly provide for conservation of the Barton Springs salamander (City of Austin 

et al

. 1993). Proposals to acquire land within the Barton Creek watershed will provide benefits to the salamander by preserving
the natural integrity of the landscape and positively contributing to water quality in Barton Creek and Barton Springs.
The BCCP participants are currently working toward providing additional surface and groundwater quality protection,
including retrofitting existing developments with non-point pollution controls and protecting the 
aquifer and Barton Springs from catastrophic pollution events. The BCCP has not yet been completed or approved and
applies only to Travis County. The BCCP does not remove threats from development activities in Hays County. 

While the City of Austin has voluntarily committed to revising pool cleaning and other maintenance operations in
Zilker Park to assist in protecting the salamander and its surface habitat, no legal agreement or other incentive
is in place to ensure that these efforts will continue for the long term. 

To protect water quantity in the Barton Springs segment, the BS/EACD has developed a Drought Contingency Plan. Barton
Springs has always flowed during recorded history and one of the BS/EACD's goals is to assure Barton Springs springflow
``does not fall appreciably below historic low levels'' (BS/EACD 1990). The BS/EACD regulates municipal and industrial
wells that pump more than 10,000 gallons per day (about 60-70 percent of the total volume that is 
pumped from the Barton Springs segment) and has the ability to limit development of new wells, impose water conservation
measures, and curtail pumpage from these wells during drought conditions. According to the BS/EACD (Bill Couch,
BS/EACD, pers. comm., 1992), water well production in the higher elevations of the Barton Springs segment has been
limited during periods of lower aquifer levels in recent years. However, the ability of the BS/EACD to ensure the plan's
success is limited, since it has limited enforcement authority and does not regulate 30 to 40 percent of the total volume

that is pumped from the Barton Springs segment. Furthermore, the BS/EACD is not authorized to curtail groundwater
withdrawal specifically for the protection of the Barton Springs salamander and its habitat. 

E. 

Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.

 The very restricted range of the Barton Springs salamander makes this species especially vulnerable to acute and/or
chronic groundwater contamination. Since the salamander is an aquatic species, there is no possibility for escape
from contamination or other threats to its habitat. A single incident (such as a contaminant spill) has the potential
to eliminate the entire species and/or its prey base. Crustaceans, particularly amphipods, on which the salamander
feeds, are especially sensitive to water pollution (Mayer and Ellersieck 1986). Based on acute static toxicity data
for 63 species tested against 174 chemicals, the Service (Mayer and Ellersieck 1986) has identified amphipods as
being the third most sensitive taxonomic group tested.

The effects of environmental contaminants on amphibians has not been well documented, and the toxic effects of most
chemicals is unknown. However, current research indicates that amphibians, particularly their eggs and larvae,
are sensitive to many of the pollutants that have been tested, such as heavy metals; certain insecticides, particularly
cyclodienes (endosulfan, endrin, toxaphene, and dieldrin) and certain organophosphates (parathion, 
malathion); nitrite; salts; and oil (Harfenist 

et al.

 1989). Regarding pesticides, Christine Bishop (Canadian Wildlife Service) states that ``the health of amphibians
can suffer from exposure to pesticides (Harfenist 

et al.

 1989). Because of their semipermeable skin, the development of their eggs and larvae in water, and their position
in the food web, amphibians can be exposed to waterborne and airborne pollutants in their breeding and foraging habitats
* * * [Furthermore] pesticides probably change the quality and quantity of amphibian food and habitat''
(Bishop and Pettit 1992). Toxic effects to amphibians from pollutants may include morphological and developmental
aberrations, lowered reproduction and survival, and changes in behavior and certain biochemical processes. 

Available information on the effects of contaminants on central Texas 

Eurycea

 salamanders indicates that these species are very sensitive to changes in water quality. Captive 

Eurycea

 species, including the Barton Springs salamander, appear to be especially sensitive to changes in water quality
and are ``quite delicate and difficult to keep alive'' (Sweet, 

in litt.

, 1993). Sweet reported that captive individuals exhibit toxic reactions to plastic containers, aged tapwater,
and detergent residues. The water in which these salamanders are kept also requires frequent changing. The lack of
success in attempts at captive propagation of the Barton Springs salamander (Price, pers. comm., 1992) and the San
Marcos salamander (

Eurycea nana

) (Janet Nelson, Southwest Texas State University, pers. comm., 1992) may be due to these species' sensitivity to
environmental stress. As discussed under Factor A, the Barton Springs salamander also appears to be sensitive to
chlorine (Chippindale 

et al.

 1993, TPWD 1993). 

Recent contamination at Stillhouse Hollow Preserve also demonstrates the sensitivity of 

Eurycea

 salamanders to changes in water quality. This event appears to have resulted in the decline of a spring population
of another species of 

Eurycea

 found north of the Colorado River (locally known as the ``Jollyville Plateau salamander''). The preserve contains
two spring outlets, the larger of which has supported an abundant salamander population; a few individuals are typically
found at the smaller spring (Hillis and Price, pers. comms., 1993). During a routine inspection of this 
property on November 19, 1992, a City of Austin employee reported ``large amounts of foam'' emanating from the larger
spring outlet (Mike Kalender, City of Austin Parks and Recreation Department, pers. comm., 1993). The type and source
of the contaminant is unknown (Chuck Lesniak, City of Austin Environmental and Conservation Services Department,
pers. comm., 1993). Despite repeated search efforts following the incident, no salamanders were 
observed at or below this spring outlet until over three months later (February 24, 1993), when two individuals were
observed (Hillis, Kalender, and Price, pers. comms., 1993). 

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by this species in determining to propose this rule. The best scientific data indicate
that the Barton Springs salamander faces multiple threats from declining water quality and quantity and therefore
warrants listing. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list the Barton Springs salamander as endangered.
A decision to take no action would constitute failure to properly classify this species pursuant to the Endangered
Species Act and would exclude the salamander from protection provided by the Act. A decision to propose threatened
status would not adequately reflect its restricted distribution, vulnerability of habitat, and multiplicity of
threats that confront it. For the reason given below, critical habitat designation for the Barton Springs salamander
is not being proposed.

Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the 
maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary propose 
critical habitat at the time the species is proposed to be 
endangered or threatened. The Service's listing regulations at 50 
CFR 424.12(a)(1) specify that designation of critical habitat is not 
prudent when such designation would not be beneficial to the 
species. The Service finds that designation of the springs occupied 
by the Barton Springs salamander as critical habitat would not be 
prudent because it would not provide a conservation benefit to the 
species, and would actually be detrimental to the species by 
suggesting a misleadingly restricted view of its true conservation 
needs. 

Designation of Barton Springs as critical habitat would not 
provide a conservation benefit to the Barton Springs salamander 
beyond benefits provided by listing and the subsequent evaluation of 
activities under section 7 of the Act for possible jeopardy to the 
species. In the Service's section 7 regulations at 50 CFR 402, the 
definition of ``jeopardize the continuing existence'' includes ``to 
reduce appreciably the likelihood of both the survival and recovery 
of the listed species,'' and ``adverse modification'' is defined as 
``a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the 
value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a 
listed species.'' Because the species is endemic to such a highly 
localized area, actions that appreciably diminish water quality and 
quantity at Barton Springs would be fully evaluated for their 
effects on the salamander through analysis of whether the actions 
would be likely to jeopardize the continuing existence of the 
species. Any action that would appreciably diminish the value, in 
quality or quantity, of flows from Barton Springs would also reduce 
appreciably the likelihood of survival and recovery of the Barton 
Springs salamander. The analysis for possible jeopardy applied to 
the Barton Springs salamander would therefore be identical to the 
section 7 analysis for determining adverse modification or 
destruction of critical habitat; no distinction between jeopardy and 
adverse modification for activities impacting the waters of Barton 
Springs can be made at this time. Application of section 7 relative 
to critical habitat would therefore not add measurable protection to 
the species beyond what is achievable through review for jeopardy. 

Designation of the springs and their immediate environment as 
critical habitat would actually be detrimental to conservation 
efforts for the Barton Springs salamander, because it would promote 
the misconception that the Barton Springs are the only areas 
important to the conservation of the species. Conservation efforts 
for the species must address a wide variety of federally funded or 
authorized activities (summarized in the ``Available Conservation 
Measures'' section of this proposed rule) that affect the quality 
and quantity of water available to the species through their effects 
on the recharge sources and aquifer that supply water to the habitat 
of the salamander. Nearly all of these activities will occur beyond 
the immediate vicinity of Barton Springs, and some will occur 
several miles away. Designation of Barton Springs as critical 
habitat would be misleading in implying to federal agencies whose 
activities may affect the Barton Springs salamander that the 
Service's concern for the species is limited only to activities 
taking place at the springs occupied by the species. Designation of 
Barton Springs as critical habitat would therefore not be prudent. 



Available Conservation Measures 



Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered 
or threatened under the Act include recognition, recovery actions, 
requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against 
certain practices. Recognition through listing encourages and 
results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private 
agencies, groups, and individuals. The Act provides for possible 
land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that 
recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The 
protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against 
taking and harm are discussed, in part, below. 

Conservation and management of the Barton Springs salamander 
is likely to involve removing threats to the survival of the 
salamander, including (1) protecting the quality of springflow from 
Barton Springs by implementing comprehensive programs to control and 
reduce point sources and non-point sources of pollution throughout 
the Barton Springs segment of the Edwards Aquifer, (2) minimizing the 
likelihood of pollution events that would affect groundwater 
quality, (3) continuing to protect groundwater and springflow 
quantity by implementing water conservation and drought contingency 
plans throughout the Barton Springs segment, and (4) continuing to 
examine and implement pool cleaning practices and other park 
operations that protect and perpetuate the salamander's surface 
habitat and population. It is also anticipated that listing will 
encourage research on the Barton Springs salamander's distribution 
within the aquifer and critical aspects of its biology (e.g., 
longevity, natality, sources of mortality, feeding ecology, and 
sensitivity to contaminants and other water quality constituents). 

Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies 
to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is 
proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to 
its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations 
implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are 
codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requires Federal 
agencies to confer with the Service on any action that is likely to 
jeopardize the continued existence of a species proposed for listing 
or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed 
critical habitat. If a species is listed subsequently, section 
7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they 
authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the 
continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely 
modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a 
listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal 
agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.

Potential activities that may affect the salamander and its 
habitat include (1) urban development over the recharge and 
contributing zones that may lead to contamination of the species' 
water supply through one or more accidental contaminant spills or 
chronic water quality degradation, (2) increased groundwater 
withdrawal leading to reduced groundwater levels and springflow 
(compounded if drought occurs), and (3) certain pool maintenance 
practices or other activities that may impact the salamander and its 
surface habitat (such as use of chemicals and high pressure hoses in 
areas occupied by salamanders and removal of substrates used for 
cover). Federal agency actions that may require conference and/or 
consultation as described in the preceding paragraph include Army 
Corps of Engineers involvement in projects such as the construction 
of roads, bridges, and dredging projects subject to section 404 
of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344 

et seq

.) and section 10 of 
the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 401 

et seq

.), pipeline 
projects, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency authorized discharges 
under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), 
and Soil Conservation Service and U.S. Housing and Urban Development 
projects. 

The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 
set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply 
to all endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it 
illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States to take (includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, 
kill, trap, capture, or collect; or to attempt any of these), import 
or export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of commercial 
activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign 
commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, 
deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been 
taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service 
and State conservation agencies. 

Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited 
activities involving endangered wildlife species under certain 
circumstances. Regulations governing permits are codified at 50 CFR 
17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available for scientific 
purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, 
and/or for incidental take in the course of otherwise lawful 
activities. This species is not in trade, and such permit requests 
are not expected. 

Requests for copies of the regulations regarding listed 
wildlife and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits may be 
addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, room 420C, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, 
Virginia 22203 (703/358-2104; FAX 703/358-2281). 



Public Comments Solicited 



The Service intends that any final action resulting from this 
proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary proposes to amend the Student Assistance 
General Provisions and Federal Family Education Loan program 
regulations. These amendments are needed to implement changes in 
the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), and to 
improve the monitoring and accountability of institutions and 
third-party servicers participating in the student financial 
assistance programs authorized by Title IV of the HEA (Title IV, 
HEA programs). The changes would establish requirements 
governing contracts between institutions and third-party 
servicers to administer any aspect of an institution's 
participation in those programs. In addition, the changes would 
strengthen sanctions against institutions for violations of 
Title IV, HEA program requirements and establish similar 
sanctions for third-party servicers. The changes also would 
establish standards of administrative and financial 
responsibility for third-party servicers that administer any 
aspect of a guaranty agency's or lender's participation in the 
Federal Family Education Loan programs.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Student Assistance General 
Provisions (34 CFR part 668) currently apply to all institutions 
that participate in the Student Financial Assistance Programs 
authorized by Title IV of the HEA. For purposes of these 
regulations, the Title IV, HEA Student Financial Assistance 
Programs include the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Family Education 
Loan (FFEL), Federal Direct Student Loan, State Student Incentive 
Grant (SSIG), Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Work-Study (FWS), and 
Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) 
programs.

The FFEL program regulations (34 CFR part 682) govern the 
Federal Stafford Loan Program, the Federal Supplemental Loans for 
Students (Federal SLS) Program, the Federal PLUS Program, and the 
Federal Consolidation Loan Program, collectively referred to as 
the Federal Family Education Loan programs (formerly the 
Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) programs). With respect to 34 CFR 
part 682, the Federal Stafford Loan, Federal SLS, Federal PLUS, 
and Federal Consolidation Loan programs are hereinafter referred 
to as the Stafford, SLS, PLUS and Consolidation Loan programs. 

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101-239), enacted December 19, 1989, amended the HEA
to authorize the Secretary to promulgate regulations governing the limitation, suspension, or termination of the
eligibility of an individual or organization to contract with an educational institution to administer any aspect
of the institution's participation in any Title IV, HEA program. That act further amended the HEA to authorize the
Secretary to promulgate regulations to take emergency action against or to fine such an individual or organization.


The Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-325), 
enacted July 23, 1992, amended the HEA to expand the Secretary's 
authority to regulate the activities of those individuals and 
organizations, now called 

third-party servicers.

 Further, 
Public Law 102-325 authorizes the Secretary to promulgate 
regulations that are applicable to third-party servicers to 
establish minimum standards with respect to sound management and 
accountability of the FFEL programs and include standards for 
financial responsibility and the assessment of liabilities for 
FFEL program violations. These proposed regulations would 
implement those statutory provisions. In addition, these 
proposed regulations would strengthen and clarify the procedures 
for fining an institution or limiting, suspending, or terminating 
its participation in any Title IV, HEA program, and make other 
minor changes. 

The Secretary believes that establishing accountability 
guidelines for an institution's continued participation and the 
participation of an institution's third-party servicer in the 
Title IV, HEA programs is an important element in the general 
effort for better and more accountable schools, as called for in 
the National Education Goals. 



Negotiated Rulemaking 



Section 492 of the HEA contains procedural requirements that 
the Secretary is to follow in developing proposed regulations for 
parts B, G, and H of Title IV of the HEA, as amended by the 
Higher Education Amendments of 1992. Section 492(a) requires the 
Secretary to convene regional meetings to gain input on the 
content of proposed regulations. Section 492(b) requires the 
Secretary, subsequent to these meetings, to draft and submit 
regulations implementing parts B, G, and H to a negotiated 
rulemaking process. 

In accordance with the requirements of section 492, the 
Secretary convened four regional meetings to discuss issues 
related to implementation of parts B, G, and H. The Secretary 
invited representatives of groups involved in student financial 
assistance programs, such as students, legal assistance 
organizations that represent students, institutions of higher 
education, guaranty agencies, lenders, secondary markets, loan 
servicers, guaranty agency servicers, and collection agencies. 
As a precursor to the regional meetings, the Secretary held a 
meeting in Washington, DC, in August 1992, to invite comments 
from interested parties as to the key issues that should be 
addressed at the regional meetings. At the four regional 
meetings, the Secretary provided participants with a list of 
issues, based upon those identified in the meeting in August 1992 
that needed to be addressed in these proposed regulations. 
Regional meetings were held in New York, New York; San Francisco, 
California; Atlanta, Georgia; and Kansas City, Missouri during 
September 1992. Participants in the meetings were invited to 
nominate individuals to serve as participants in negotiated 
rulemaking sessions. The Secretary selected participants for the 
negotiations process from individuals nominated by groups 
participating in the regional meetings and attempted, to the 
extent possible, to have participants reflect the diversity of 
those participating in the student aid community. 

Negotiated rulemaking sessions were held in April, June, and 
August 1993 in and around the environs of Washington, DC. 
Taking into account views expressed at the regional meetings, the 
Department of Education prepared draft regulations on the main 
issues discussed. The draft served as the basis for the 
negotiated rulemaking process.

Regional Meeting Comments 


In connection with these regulations, one issue was 
identified during the August meeting for discussion at the 
regional meetings: The requirement under section 487(c)(1)(C)(i) 
of the HEA for an audit of a third-party servicer's 
administration of an institution's, lender's, or guaranty 
agency's Title IV, HEA program. During the regional meetings, 
participants were asked for their recommendations on formulating 
the compliance standards against which a third-party servicer 
would be measured in these proposed regulations. Recommendations 
from the regional meetings varied. 
Participants involved in the New York meeting suggested that 
the compliance standards for third-party servicers contracting 
with institutions should parallel institutional compliance 
standards. 
Participants in San Francisco recommended that compliance 
standards for third-party servicers should be developed by an 
independent accounting firm but that the Department of Education 
should specify servicer activities that would need to be included 
in the annual compliance audit report. Participants at this 
meeting further suggested separate standards for different types 
of third-party servicers. 
Participants meeting in Atlanta suggested that compliance audits of third-party servicers be limited to the area
of their specific function; for example, with respect to loan servicers, the default rate of Title IV, HEA program
loans should be an indicator of compliance with Title IV, HEA program requirements. Participants also recommended
that a third-party servicer, and not the institution with which the servicer contracts, should be cited for any violation
of an audit standard by that servicer. One participant recommended that the standards developed by the Association
of Independent Certified Public Accountants should be used in the Department of Education's audit guide. 
Participants attending the Kansas City regional meeting 
suggested that in devising audit standards for third-party 
servicers, the Secretary first should review the audit check list 
currently in use by the Office of Inspector General of the 
Department of Education for auditing third-party servicers. 
Participants did not consider consultants or software providers 
used by an institution to be included in the definition of 


third-party servicer. 

Participants suggested that the Department 
of Education devise a process for grading and validating 
software. 


Regulatory Changes 


The Secretary submitted a draft of the proposed regulatory 
language governing third-party servicers along with the issue 
described above for discussion at the negotiated rulemaking 
sessions. Consensus was reached on all major issues except where 
noted below.

The following summarizes the major changes in this notice of 
proposed rulemaking (NPRM): 


Part 668_Student Assistance General Provisions 




Section 668.1 Scope. 

Part 668 governs the administration 
of the Title IV, HEA programs by an institution and provides for 
various enforcement measures against institutions for any 
violations of program requirements by the institution or its 
agents. A third-party servicer, as an agent of an institution, 
must currently apply the requirements of part 668 to administer 
properly the Title IV, HEA programs on behalf of an institution. 
The Secretary proposes to specify that the requirements of the 
Student Assistance General Provisions regulations would be 
applied to a third-party servicer (as proposed to be defined in 
 668.2) to the extent that the servicer administers any aspect of 
an institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program. This 
proposal would enable the Secretary, for the first time, to 
directly oversee the conduct of third-party servicers. The 
Secretary also proposes to make clear that although the Secretary 
would hold a third-party servicer responsible for compliance with 
applicable regulations, an institution that contracts with the 
servicer always remains responsible for the servicer's 
compliance. This clarification merely restates the Department of 
Education's long-standing policy and requirements with respect to 
institutional responsibility. 


Section 668.2 General definitions. 

These proposed 
regulations would incorporate the statutory definition of 
third-party servicer in section 481(f) of the HEA. Under that 
definition (as amended by the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-208), enacted on December
20, 
1993), a third-party servicer is an ``individual, or any State, or 
private, profit or nonprofit organization'' that contracts with an 
eligible institution to administer any aspect of the 
institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program. The 
statutory definition includes additional elements applicable to a 
third-party servicer's administration of the FFEL programs. 
These aspects of the definition are addressed in a subsequent 
discussion on 34 CFR part 682. 
The Secretary also proposes to include as part of the 
definition of third-party servicer examples of services which a 
third-party servicer could provide to an institution that the 
Secretary considers to constitute the administration of the 
institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program. The 
Secretary believes that examples are necessary to alert those 
individuals and organizations that contract with an eligible 
institution of the specific activities that would be subject to 
the requirements proposed in these regulations. 
The examples that the Secretary proposes to include in the 
definition of third-party servicer are primarily examples that 
show an obvious relationship to the administration of the 
Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary proposes these examples to 
specifically detail which activities unequivocally constitute the 
administration of an institution's participation in the Title IV, 
HEA programs. While these examples are not all-inclusive, they 
do provide a baseline to judge other activities that could be 
deemed an aspect of the administration of an institution's 
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
The Secretary also proposes to include another set of 
examples that the Secretary believes do not constitute the 
administration of an institution's participation in the 
Title IV, HEA programs. For example, the Secretary does not 
consider the activity of publishing ability-to-benefit (ATB) 
tests to be a third-party servicer activity because publishers of 
ATB tests do not contract with institutions and under the statute 
would not fall within the definition of a third-party servicer. 
As another example, the Secretary does not consider 
performing activities as a Multiple Data Entry Processor (MDE) to 
be included in the scope of third-party servicer activities. 
While an MDE could be considered to administer certain aspects of 
an institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs, an 
MDE is bound by other Department of Education requirements. 
Therefore, the Secretary does not believe it necessary to 
separately regulate MDE activities as part of these proposed 
regulations. 
In general, the Secretary also proposes to exclude auditing 
activities from the scope of these regulations. Entities 
performing audits are required to be impartial and independent 
entities with no vested interest in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
Further, while auditors provide services needed to comply with 
Title IV, HEA requirements, their services are not directly 
connected to the day-to-day administration of Title IV, HEA 
assistance. The Secretary, therefore, believes that auditing 
activities should not be included in the scope of these 
regulations. 
Other proposed examples classified as being outside the 
scope of these regulatory requirements simply reinforce the 
Secretary's belief that certain activities performed by a 
third-party servicer that do not substantially affect the 
delivery of Title IV, HEA program aid do not constitute the 
administration of an institution's participation in the Title IV, 
HEA programs, (for example, contracting to warehouse records). 
As a result of deliberations during the negotiated 
rulemaking sessions, Federal and non-Federal negotiators 
concluded that it was not necessary to include or exclude 
computer services or software providers from the proposed 
definition of third-party servicer or the examples provided. The 
negotiators concluded that computer software and computer 
services are simply technological means to assist in carrying out 
specific administrative functions. Accordingly, the Secretary 
invites public comment on whether an individual, State, or 
organization providing computer software and services represented 
to satisfy Title IV, HEA program requirements should specifically 
be included in what the Secretary considers to constitute a 
third-party servicer's administration of an eligible 
institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program.

These proposed regulations would also make clear that an 
individual, State, or organization that engages in an excluded 
function is still considered to be a third-party servicer with 
respect to any other function that constitutes the administration 
of a Title IV, HEA program performed under a contract with an 
institution. 
The Secretary further proposes to remove the terms 


designated department official, initiating official, 

and 


show-cause official 

from subpart G of this part and place them in 
 668.2, because this section contains the general definitions applicable to all of part 668 and to all of the
Title IV, HEA 
programs. 


Section 668.11 Scope. 

The Secretary proposes that a 
third-party servicer's violation of an applicable provision of 
Subpart B of the Student Assistance General Provisions 
regulations may subject the servicer to a proceeding under 
subpart G. This change implements the statutory authority under 
section 487(c)(1) of the HEA to provide for the accountability of 
a third-party servicer's administration of any aspect of an 
institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
Subpart G governs emergency actions or fines against an 
institution and the limitation, suspension, or termination of the 
institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program. The 
Secretary proposes to add references to a third-party servicer in 
subpart G so as to provide for emergency actions and fines 
against a third-party servicer or the limitation, suspension, or 
termination of the servicer's eligibility to contract with an 
institution to administer any aspect of the institution's 
participation in a Title IV, HEA program (see the discussion 
beginning with  668.81). 
The Secretary also proposes to provide that if a third-party 
servicer violates an applicable provision of this subpart, the 
Secretary may also initiate an emergency action, a fine 
proceeding, or a limitation, suspension, or termination action 
against any institution under whose contract the servicer 
violated that provision. Because an institution has agreed to 
comply with all applicable Title IV, HEA requirements in its 
agreement with the Secretary, and because the institution must 
demonstrate under  668.12 the capability to administer the 
Title IV, HEA programs, the Secretary emphasizes that the 
institution is always responsible for the actions of any of its 
employees, officers, or agents. 


Section 668.12 Institutional participation agreement. 

The 
Secretary proposes to require an institution to agree, in its 
participation agreement, to be liable for all misused Title IV, 
HEA program funds, including those received on the institution's 
behalf by a third-party servicer, and to be liable for refunds, 
including those that a third-party servicer was required to pay 
on the institution's behalf. This provision emphasizes that an 
institution is always liable for the actions of its employees, 
officers, and agents regarding its participation in a Title IV, 
HEA program. 
The Secretary also proposes to amend this section by adding 
new paragraph (b)(2)(vi) to reflect a new statutory directive 
under the HEA governing the past performance of individuals, 
agencies, or organizations affiliated with an institution. Under 
section 487(a)(16) of the HEA, an institution may not knowingly 
contract with or employ any individual, agency, or organization 
that has been or whose officers or employees have been convicted 
of, or pled 

nolo contendere 

or guilty to, a crime involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure of Title IV, HEA program funds or been judicially
determined to have committed fraud involving Title IV, HEA program funds. An institution may not contract with another
institution or a third-party servicer that has been terminated under section 432 of the HEA involving the acquisition,
use, or expenditure of funds under the Title IV, HEA programs, or that has been judicially determined to have committed
fraud involving Title IV, HEA program funds. 

The Secretary's proposed rules, in accordance with the consensus reached at the negotiated rulemaking sessions,
would apply the prohibitions not only to instances of judicial determinations of criminal or fraudulent activity,
but also to administrative determination of fraud and judicial or administrative determinations of any other material
violations of law. Administrative proceedings are more frequent and often occur well in advance of related court
proceedings. The Secretary believes that administrative proceedings afford sufficient due process, including
notice, hearing, and review, to be relied upon for excluding individuals, agencies, or organizations under these
provisions from applicable employment or contracting, if such a determination of culpability has been made. The
Secretary believes that the reference to material violations of law is necessary, as Title IV, HEA funds are also endangered
by the employment of those determined to have violated laws governing the handling of those funds, even if those violations
do not rise to the level of fraud. For example, an institution should not employ a person or organization that has failed
to pay refunds required under law.

Finally, these proposed regulations would include 
determinations of misuse of all Federal (as opposed to simply 
Title IV, HEA programs) funds and State or local government 
funds. For example, a person determined to have committed fraud 
in the acquisition of State educational grant funds could 
foreshadow a potential danger to the Title IV, HEA programs if 
that person were employed by an institution. 
These additional requirements are needed to establish 
appropriate safeguards to protect the Title IV, HEA programs if 
serious questions are raised about the honesty and lawful conduct 
of an individual, agency, or organization that contracts with or 
is employed by an institution. 


Section 668.13 Factors of financial responsibility. 


Section 498(e) of the HEA introduces the concept of ``substantial 
control'' over an institution essentially by adopting the current 
regulatory concept of ``the ability to affect substantially the 
actions of'' an institution. Accordingly, the Secretary 
substitutes the new phrase where applicable in these proposed 
regulations. Further, the Secretary proposes to establish that 
an institution is not considered financially responsible_a 
condition of participation in the Title IV, HEA programs_if a 
person with substantial control over the institution_ 
(1) Has or had substantial control, either alone or in 
combination with members of his or her family, over another 
institution or a third-party servicer that owes liabilities 
for violations of Title IV, HEA program requirements, if 
those liabilities are not being properly repaid; 
(2) Has family members who, alone or in combination with one 
another, exercise or exercised substantial control over the 
other institution or servicer; or 
(3) Owes liabilities, or members of his or her family owe 
liabilities, for violations committed by the other 
institution or servicer, and the liabilities are not being 
properly repaid. 
The institution could continue to be considered 
financially responsible if_ 
(1) The person repays a proportion of the liabilities equivalent 
to the amount of control held over the other institution or 
servicer; 
(2) The institution can establish that the person does not, in 
fact, have substantial control over the institution; or 
(3) The institution can establish that neither the person nor 
any of his or her family members in fact has or had 
substantial control over the other institution or servicer. 
The definition of a family member (as currently defined in 
 668.13(j)) refers to a parent, sibling, spouse, or child; 
spouse's parent or sibling; or sibling's or child's spouse. 
Finally, the Secretary would apply the concepts of 
``substantial control'' and ``ownership interest'' (as currently 
defined in section 498(e) of the HEA and  668.13) to third-party 
servicers.

These provisions would expand the factors of financial 
responsibility of an institution to take into consideration 
substantial control over both other existing institutions (as opposed to only defunct institutions) and third-party
servicers. 
Section 498(e) of the HEA clearly contemplates this expansion. 
Furthermore, these requirements are needed for the same reasons 
that similar requirements recently were adopted for persons with 
substantial control over defunct institutions. A person might be 
responsible for incurring liabilities for Title IV, HEA program 
violations because of his or her substantial control over 
third-party servicers or other institutions. The person could, 
nevertheless, have the same level of control over a participating 
institution while avoiding responsibility for repayment of those 
liabilities. These requirements are intended to prevent those 
persons from continuing to participate either directly or 
indirectly in the Title IV, HEA programs without assuming 
responsibility for their prior actions. 

The Secretary also proposes technical changes to this 
section to remove as factors of financial responsibility the 
consideration of matters that would instead be included in 
 668.12 as conditions for participation in the Title IV, HEA 
programs, for the reasons given in the discussion of that 
section. 



Section 668.23 Audits, records, and examination.

 The 
Secretary proposes to specify that in addition to current 
requirements, an institution would be required to cooperate with 
a guaranty agency in whose program the institution participates 
and the State postsecondary review entity designated under 
subpart 1 of part H of Title IV of the HEA, in the conduct 
of audits, investigations, and program reviews. These requirements 
would clarify existing responsibilities to be accountable to 
authorized persons or organizations for the institution's 
activities with respect to the sound management of the 
Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary further proposes to apply 
these requirements to a third-party servicer that contracts with 
an institution to administer any aspect of that institution's 
participation in a Title IV, HEA program. This change would 
merely clarify existing responsibilities of a third-party 
servicer, as an agent of an institution, to be accountable and 
provide access to authorized persons for the servicer's 
activities on behalf of the institution's participation in a 
Title IV, HEA program. 

The Secretary proposes to add a requirement that a 
third-party servicer that administers funds or determines student 
eligibility under contract with an institution would be required 
to have prepared, at least annually, a compliance audit of all 
aspects of the servicer's administration of the participation in 
the Title IV, HEA programs of each institution with which the 
servicer contracts. (This requirement would be satisfied by an 
audit report submitted in accordance with the Single Audit Act or 
Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133.) This 
requirement is necessitated by section 487(c)(1)(C) of the HEA. 

The Secretary, however, believes that the contractual 
obligations of some third-party servicers do not necessitate 
audits of the servicers' activities. Accordingly, the Secretary 
proposes to require annual audits to be performed only by those 
servicers that administer funds or determine student eligibility 
on behalf of institutions. The consequences of the activities of 
those servicers to the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs 
justify stricter accountability to the Secretary. 

In addition, the Secretary proposes certain additional 
exceptions to the annual audit requirement in the discussion that 
follows. A third-party servicer that is required to have an 
audit performed would be excused from the annual audit 
requirement if that servicer contracts with only one 
participating institution and if that servicer's administration 
of a Title IV, HEA program would still be covered fully in that 
institution's compliance audit. (In proposed regulations to be 
published shortly after these, the Secretary intends to propose 
to excuse certain institutions from having an annual audit 
performed. If an institution were to be excused from an audit 
requirement, the activities of that institution's third-party 
servicer would not be fully covered, and thus the servicer would 
be required to have an audit performed to meet the requirements 
of this section). This provision would not harm the integrity of 
the Title IV, HEA programs as the servicer's activities still 
would be covered fully by the submission of an institution's 
compliance audit. 

A third-party servicer that is required to have an audit 
performed and that contracts with more than one participating 
institution could have performed, to meet the requirements of 
this section, a single comprehensive compliance audit that covers all of the servicer's activities for all of the
institutions that 
the servicer contracts with for Title IV, HEA program purposes, 
if the audit is conducted in such a way as to satisfy each 
individual audit requirement and if the audit covers all aspects 
of the servicer's administration of the participation in the 
Title IV, HEA programs of all institutions with which the 
servicer contracts. The Secretary believes that, by allowing 
third-party servicers to have one inclusive audit performed, 
instead of many individual audits, the burden associated with 
these regulations would be reduced (regulatory burden reduction 
is an objective under Executive Order (E.O.) 12866). 
Furthermore, the Secretary does not believe that this provision 
would in any way affect the soundness of the information required 
by these regulations.

A third-party servicer would be required to have an audit 
performed at least once every two years if the servicer 
administers less than $1,000,000 under the Title IV, HEA programs 
for the period covered by the audit, or if the servicer's most 
recently submitted audit report did not contain any material 
deficiencies and was submitted in a timely fashion. Also, a 
third-party servicer would not be required to have an audit 
performed for any year in which the servicer administers less 
than $250,000 under the Title IV, HEA programs. 

The Secretary is proposing these Title IV, HEA program fund 
thresholds, for purposes of exceptions to the audit requirements 
of this section, on the assumption that a large amount of 
Title IV, HEA program funds are not at risk in the case of a 
third-party servicer that administers less than $250,000 during 
the audit period. Similarly, the Secretary believes that a 
third-party servicer administering less than $1,000,000 in the 
Title IV, HEA programs during the audit period or whose most 
recently submitted audit report revealed no abnormal practices or 
material discrepancies in the servicer's administration of those 
funds, provided that the audit report was submitted in a timely 
fashion, would not be likely to endanger those funds. By 
proposing these exceptions to the audit requirements of this 
section, and thus limiting the scope of these provisions, the 
Secretary believes that the Department of Education will be able 
to concentrate on those third-party servicers that pose the 
greatest financial risk to the Title IV, HEA programs; these 
exceptions also reduce the administrative burden on those 
qualifying for the exemptions. The threshold amounts were 
extrapolated from similar exemptions to audit submission 
requirements for institutions under the Single Audit Act 
($100,000 and $25,000) and increased by a factor of ten in order 
to cover third-party servicer activities because these entities 
generally contract with multiple clients and thus would 
administer greater amounts of Title IV, HEA program funds than 
any single institution. 

These provisions are intended to parallel similar audit 
requirements for institutions (in proposed regulations to be 
published shortly after these). The intent is to minimize the 
burden associated with these regulations, both to the servicing 
industry and to the Federal Government, as called for under E.O. 
12866. The Secretary believes that these exceptions would not 
harm the integrity of the audit oversight that Congress intended 
under section 487(c)(1)) of the HEA. Under that section and 
these regulations, the Secretary retains the authority to require 
any third-party servicer to have an audit performed on an annual 
basis if the Secretary believes it is necessary. 

This section would be amended to provide that the servicer's 
first audit would cover the servicer's first full fiscal year 
after the effective date of these regulations and any period on 
or after the effective date of these regulations up to the 
beginning of the servicer's first full fiscal year. The 
Secretary believes that initial audits will be more useful and 
effective if they encompass an entire fiscal year. The Secretary 
also believes that allowing servicers additional time to prepare 
for the implementation of these regulations would enable 
servicers to comply more fully with these regulations as well as 
defray the costs associated with an audit of a partial fiscal 
year. Subsequent audits would, as required by statute, encompass 
the entire period since the servicer's previous audit. 

A third-party servicer that is required to have an audit 
performed would be required to submit that audit to the 
Department of Education's Inspector General by the deadlines 
established in the audit guide developed by the Department's 
Office of Inspector General. The Secretary also proposes to 
apply the statutory requirements of section 487(c) of the HEA to 
third-party servicers such that the results of these audits would 
be made available to the appropriate authorities, as detailed in 
the discussion at the beginning of this section. (The Secretary intends to propose similar requirements for institutions
required 
to have an audit performed in proposed regulations to be 
published shortly after these). 



Section 668.24 Audit exceptions and repayments.

 The 
Secretary proposes to extend to a third-party servicer the 
provisions governing audit exceptions and determinations of audit 
liabilities that currently apply to institutions. These 
modifications would simply reflect the Secretary's current 
practice under this section as applied to a third-party servicer. 
In addition, an institution or a third-party servicer would have 
an opportunity to demonstrate within 45 days (35 days is mandated 
under the current regulations) of the Secretary's notification 
that the expenditure or compliance was proper. The Secretary is 
proposing 45 days to make the response period consistent with 
other reporting requirements in this part.

In addition, this section would be amended to specify 
additional steps that the Secretary may take to insure the 
payment of any liabilities that are owed. Under this section, if 
an institution or third-party servicer owes funds, the Secretary 
may determine that an administrative offset (as provided for 
under 34 CFR 30.28) is an appropriate alternative to collect 
those funds. 

In the case of an institution or third-party servicer that 
provides surety or a guarantee for the benefit of the Secretary, 
such as a bond or letter of credit, the Secretary may determine it is necessary to collect from that surety or guarantee
before 
the procedures under subpart H of this part are completed, if 
circumstances warrant. 

The Secretary would collect a surety or guarantee before all 
available appeal procedures are completed_ 

(1) Where the need to provide relief to students or borrowers 
affected by the institution's or third-party servicer's 
actions, as applicable, that led to the assessment of 
liability, is more important than deferring collection 
activities until after the completion of appeal proceedings 
(for example, when unpaid refunds to the Title IV, HEA 
programs are identified, the Secretary may collect in 
advance of a final determination or exhaustion of appeal 
procedures, as the harm to students outweighs deferring 
collection); or 

(2) Where the conditions under which a surety or guarantee are 
held do not provide adequate assurances that the surety or 
guarantee will be available for collection through the 
completion of available appeal proceedings. 

These modifications would provide clarification in the 
regulations of the Secretary's existing practice and authority to 
collect from sureties or guarantees in accordance with their 
terms, prior to final determinations of liabilities or exhaustion 
of appeal procedures. 

The Secretary also proposes to make clear that an 
institution is responsible for repayment of any funds owed by its 
servicer until those funds are repaid by the servicer. The 
Secretary considers this provision necessary because an 
institution is always responsible for the actions of its agents. 

The Secretary proposes that if a determination is made to 
assess a liability against a third-party servicer, the servicer 
would be required to notify each institution under whose contract 
the servicer was assessed a liability of the Secretary's 
determination. The servicer would also be required to notify 
every institution that contracts with the servicer for the same 
service that the Secretary determined a liability is owed. 

Final consensus on this particular language was not reached 
as negotiators believed that this provision essentially requires 
the notification of all institutions with which a servicer 
contracts. Negotiators objected to a notice being provided to 
institutions that a servicer contracts with that would not be 
directly affected by a determination from the Secretary to assess 
liability. A number of negotiators opposed this language on the 
ground that such a blanket notification unnecessarily damages a 
servicer's reputation among unaffected institutions. However, 
the Secretary believes that an institution that contracts with a 
third-party servicer should be informed of determinations by the 
Department of Education that the institution's servicer is 
improperly administering the Title IV, HEA programs, especially 
given the potential liability exposure to the institution. These 
notification requirements would arise only if the Secretary 
determines that a third-party servicer owes a liability based on 
an audit finding, after providing the institution or third-party 
servicer an opportunity to respond to an audit report response. By limiting the requirement for notice provided by
a third-party 
servicer to institutions receiving the same service for which a 
liability was assessed, the Secretary believes that he has 
responded to any legitimate concerns raised by the negotiators. 



Section 668.25 Contracts between an institution and a 
third-party servicer.

 The Secretary proposes to redesignate  668.25, governing loss of institutional eligibility, as  668.26

and to add a new  668.25 that would establish minimum 
requirements for contracts between an institution and a 
third-party servicer. Proposed  668.25 would allow an 
institution to contract with a servicer to administer aspects of 
the institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program only 
to the extent that the servicer's eligibility to contract with 
that institution has not been limited, suspended, or terminated 
under the proceedings in Subpart G (as proposed to be amended). 
In addition, under these proposed regulations, a third-party 
servicer is considered eligible to contract with an institution 
to administer aspects of the institution's participation in a 
Title IV, HEA program to the extent that the servicer is not 
found to exhibit indicators of questionable past performance. 

Indicators of questionable past performance would be_ 

(1) A limitation, suspension, or termination action by the 
Secretary against the servicer within the preceding five 
years; 






</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940217-1-00078 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940217-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) An audit finding during the servicer's two most recent 
audits amounting to at least five percent of funds received 
or administered by the servicer under the Title IV, HEA 
programs; and 

(3) A citation within the preceding five years for the 
servicer's failure to submit a required audit report within 
an acceptable amount of time. 

A third-party servicer that shows these indicators of 
questionable past performance with regard to the Title IV, HEA 
programs could not, under paragraph (d) of this section, contract 
with an institution unless the persons or entities with 
substantial control over the servicer agree to be responsible for 
any potential liability arising from the servicer's 
administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. In the case of a 
third-party servicer that has been subjected to a termination 
action, the servicer could not contract with an institution 
unless either the servicer or persons or entities with 
substantial control over the servicer (or both) provide financial 
guarantees (specified by the Secretary) to the Secretary for 
potential liabilities arising from the administration of the 
Title IV, HEA programs. These provisions are necessary to hold 
persons who have substantial control over a third-party servicer 
accountable for their past performance in the administration of 
the Title IV, HEA programs. 

Any contract between an institution and a third-party 
servicer would have to require the servicer to agree to comply 
with all applicable Title IV, HEA program requirements, including 
using any Title IV, HEA program funds that the servicer 
administers and any earnings on those funds solely for Title IV, 
HEA program purposes. The servicer would have to agree to refer 
suspected instances of fraud and criminal activity to the 
Department of Education's Inspector General. These requirements 
would parallel those currently required of institutions in 
establishing an institution's administrative capability but add 
that the servicer would also have to refer suspected instances of 
fraud and criminal activity committed by the institution. The 
contract would have to require the servicer to agree to be liable 
to the Secretary, jointly and severally with the institution, for 
any violation by the servicer of any Title IV, HEA program 
requirement. 

With regard to third-party servicer liability, a number of 
negotiators opposed the Secretary's proposed language, submitted 
to negotiators at negotiated rulemaking, requiring a third-party 
servicer to share liability with an institution for an infraction 
by the servicer of any Title IV, HEA program requirement. The 
negotiators offered three basic reasons for their opposition. 

First, the negotiators stated that any imposition of 
liability would improperly interfere with the private contract 
between the servicer and the institution. The parties, in the 
view of the negotiators, should be free to decide how and if 
liability should be divided without Federal regulatory 
prescription.

The Secretary disagrees with this rationale. To ensure that the Title IV, HEA programs are properly administered
and Federal funds are safeguarded, the Secretary has always required an institution to demonstrate that it is administratively
capable and financially responsible. More and more institutions, however, are employing third-party servicers
to administer their programs, thereby delegating responsibility to entities that the Secretary has not reviewed
for administrative capability or financial responsibility. Because the Secretary does not directly approve or
regulate the qualifications of these servicers, the Secretary believes that it is reasonable to require these servicers
to stand behind their work and to be accountable to Federal taxpayers for any losses to Federal funds through the servicer's
administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. Moreover, if the issue of liability is left to the discretion of the contracting
parties, it is more than likely that some servicers will assume no responsibility for their actions. In proposing
direct third-party servicer accountability to the Department of Education, the Secretary believes that institutions
employing servicers to administer aspects of their participation in the Title IV, HEA programs would benefit from
increased servicer integrity in fulfilling contractual obligations. 
Second, the negotiators argued that it would be unreasonable to require a third-party servicer to be prepared to assume
liability potentially far in excess of the fees earned by the servicer from the institution. Under this argument,
the consequence of requiring third-party servicers to be liable for their actions would be to increase servicing
fees charged to institutions and could make it economically impossible, in many cases, for institutions to contract
with third parties for services related to the Title IV, HEA programs. The negotiators indicated that in some contracts,
institutions specifically give up the right to hold a third-party servicer responsible for the consequences of the
servicer's actions in exchange for a lower fee. 
The Secretary does not believe that assumption of liability by servicers will make servicers unavailable to institutions.
The Secretary believes that most servicers are, or should be, confident enough in the quality of their work to stand
behind it financially. To the extent that a third-party servicer is unwilling to assume responsibility, it would
seem to indicate that the servicer has no incentive to ensure compliance with the Title IV, HEA program requirements.

Third, the negotiators who objected to these proposed provisions claimed that the Department of Education does not
impose similar constraints on its own contractors to assume contingent liability for the consequences of their actions.

The Secretary disagrees with this rationale. Those that contract with the Department of Education have different
and more rigorous requirements imposed on them, both in their selection by the Department and in contracts into which
the Department enters to ensure the proper use of Federal funds. The Secretary is able to select the Department of Education's
contractors and retains the ability directly to enforce contractual provisions.
In an effort to respond to these objections during the negotiated rulemaking sessions, the Secretary suggested a
compromise that would have limited joint and several liability of a third-party servicer for violations by the servicer
of Title IV, HEA program requirements, in cases where the servicer was not an affiliate of the institution with which
the servicer contracts. In those cases, joint and several liability would be capped at the fees and compensation received
by the servicer from the institution during the period for which the liability is assessed. The Secretary suggested
that, for the purposes of this section, an affiliate could be construed as a third-party servicer that_ 
(1) Is a parent or subsidiary corporation of the institution; 
(2) Shares a person who exercises substantial control over the institution and servicer as defined in  668.13;
or 
(3) Shares a common owner, partner, or officer with the institution. 
The Secretary suggested this alternate language to decrease the financial risk for servicers that are not related
parties to the institutions with which they contract. However, the Secretary believes that servicers that are linked
to institutions should be fully accountable to prevent shielding of liability by shifting services to an affiliate.
The Secretary invited reaction from the non-Federal negotiators on whether this compromise would sufficiently
guard the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs by providing the Secretary the means to ensure that a liability is
repaid and the violation contributing to that liability is redressed and alleviate any legitimate objections raised
by the negotiators. 
The other negotiators did not accept the Secretary's offered compromise. Some negotiators would not agree to assumption
of any liability by a third-party servicer. Thus, there was no consensus on this matter. Because consensus was not
reached on either proposal, the Secretary is under no obligation to modify the position originally taken at the start
of the negotiated rulemaking sessions. The Secretary therefore proposes regulations consistent with the position
taken at the start of negotiated rulemaking because the Secretary believes that this proposal will best provide the
greatest protection for Federal tax dollars in the form of Title IV, HEA program funds. 
However, because the issue of joint and several liability was debated throughout the negotiated rulemaking sessions
without resulting in consensus, the Secretary invites specific comment on this issue, and in particular on the Secretary's
compromise rejected by the non-Federal negotiators, as explained previously.

Other contractual requirements would include, in the case of a third-party servicer disbursing or delivering funds
under the Title IV, HEA programs or other funds to students, a requirement that the servicer confirm a student's eligibility
before disbursing or delivering those funds to the student. A contract with that servicer also would require the servicer
to agree to calculate and pay refunds and repayments in accordance with applicable Title IV, HEA program regulations.
Any contract with a third-party servicer would have to provide for the return to the institution of all applicable
records and funds held by the servicer if either party terminates the contract, if the servicer stops providing services
for the administration of a Title IV, HEA program, or if the servicer goes out of business or files a petition under the
Bankruptcy Code. The servicer would have to return not only Title IV, HEA program funds, but also institutional or
other funds held by the servicer for the purposes of the Title IV, HEA program for which the servicer no longer provides
services. 
Consistent with the time frames for other reporting requirements in 34 CFR part 600 that could affect an institution's
eligibility or participation, this section also would require an institution to notify the Secretary, within 10
days, each time the institution enters into a new contract with a third-party servicer or significantly modifies
an existing contract or if such a contract is terminated. The Secretary intends this provision to cover substantive
modifications to existing contracts, such as the inclusion of additional responsibilities or any significant increase
in the volume of work performed, and not to cover minor modifications such as a routine adjustment of the compensation
owed to a third-party servicer due to inflation. This section also would require the institution to notify the Secretary,
within 10 days, if a third-party servicer stops providing services for the administration of a Title IV, HEA program,
goes out of business, or files a petition under the Bankruptcy Code. Any notification from an institution would have
to include the name and address of the servicer. Upon the request of the Secretary, an institution that has a contract
with a third-party servicer would have to provide information relevant to the contract and to the servicer's responsibilities
for administering Title IV, HEA programs as well as a copy of the contract. 
These changes are necessary for proper monitoring of and accountability for Title IV, HEA program funds. The requirement
for a third-party servicer to agree in a contract to observe all applicable Title IV, HEA program requirements, special
arrangements, agreements, and limitations is necessary to avoid situations where the servicer improperly argues
that it cannot comply with these actions due to provisions in its contract with an institution. 
The provisions governing the circumstances under which a third-party servicer must return records and funds to an
institution are necessary to protect the interests of participating institutions and students in the event that
a third-party servicer is no longer able to provide the services promised under a contract. In addition, the notification
provisions would help keep the Secretary informed about those third-party servicers authorized to administer the
Title IV, HEA programs on behalf of an institution, would assist the Secretary in providing appropriate materials
and funds only to authorized third-party servicers, and would help the Secretary to obtain timely access to institutional
records. 


Section 668.81 Scope and special definitions. 

The Secretary proposes to amend this section to provide that the Secretary may initiate an emergency action against
an institution or third-party servicer, fine an institution or servicer or limit, suspend, or terminate the institution's
participation in a Title IV, HEA program or the servicer's eligibility to contract with an institution to administer
any aspect of an institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs, if the institution's servicer, acting
under contract with the institution, violates any statutory provision of or applicable to Title IV of the HEA, any
regulatory provision prescribed under that statutory authority, or any applicable special arrangement, agreement,
or limitation prescribed under the authority of Title IV of the HEA. This change also makes clear that an institution
is always responsible for the actions of its servicers regarding its participation in the Title IV, HEA programs and
remains subject to possible administrative action.

Section 668.82 Standard of conduct. 

The Secretary proposes to amend paragraph (a) of this section to add that a third-party servicer is also a fiduciary
of the Department of Education. The Secretary also would amend paragraph (a) to provide that an institution or its
third-party servicers would be required at all times to act with the competency and integrity sufficient to qualify
the institution or servicer as a fiduciary. This change would clarify and emphasize the requirement that the fiduciary
standard always applies and is not to be construed narrowly. The Secretary wishes to point out that this standard is
not simply an additional requirement but, rather, it is a condition of initial and continued participation in or servicing
of the Title IV, HEA programs. An institution or servicer cannot selectively avoid fiduciary responsibility. 

This section would also be amended to specify that the Secretary would have the authority to initiate proceedings
against a third-party servicer under this subpart if the servicer violates its fiduciary duty. The Secretary proposes
to specify that the Secretary would have the authority to initiate a proceeding against an institution under this
subpart if the institution's third-party servicer, acting under contract with the institution, violates the servicer's
fiduciary duty. The Secretary wishes to emphasize that an institution is always responsible for the actions of its
third-party servicers. The Secretary also proposes to make a technical amendment to clarify the meaning of paragraph
(c) of this section. The Secretary's long-standing interpretation of these regulations is that a violation of an
institution's fiduciary duty is grounds for termination, limitation, suspension, and fine proceedings_ individually
or in combination. As a result of the enactment of a statute authorizing the imposition of emergency actions, the Secretary
also proposes to add emergency action to this list of potential consequences resulting from an institution's violation
of the institution's fiduciary duty. An emergency action also would be applicable against a third-party servicer
that violates its fiduciary duty. 

The Secretary proposes to specify that an institution or third-party servicer violates its fiduciary duty if the
servicer, an officer or employee of the servicer, or any person with substantial control over the servicer is guilty
of or has been judicially determined to have committed a crime involving Federal funds. These provisions also would
apply to a person, agency, or organization, or an officer or employee of an agency or organization with which the servicer
contracts. A violation of fiduciary duty for these reasons would also constitute grounds for the termination of the
participation of an institution under whose contract the servicer committed the violation. The Secretary proposes
to expand the breadth of paragraph (d) of this section to parallel similar provisions proposed to be included in  668.12,
previously discussed, except that, in this case, these provisions would prohibit a third-party servicer (as opposed
to the provisions of  668.12 which prohibit institutions) from employing or contracting with persons or organizations
that have questionable past performance with respect to government funds. Paragraph (d) would be similarly amended
to include misuse of State and local government funds and administrative determinations of fraud or other material
violations of law. 

Finally, the Secretary proposes to amend paragraph (d) of this section. An institution or servicer, to remain qualified
as a fiduciary, would have to meet the following requirement. If the institution or servicer becomes aware of a criminal
conviction, or an administrative or judicial determination of fraud or other violation of law, by a person involved
in the servicer's administration of an institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program or a person with substantial
control over the servicer, with respect to Federal, State, or local government funds, the institution or servicer
would be required to protect the Title IV, HEA programs, including removing that person from Title IV, HEA program
involvement or from exercising substantial control over the institution or servicer, as applicable. 

In addition, if an institution or a third-party servicer becomes aware that a violation of, or failure to carry out,
applicable statutes and regulations by the servicer's principals or affiliates (as those terms are defined in 34
CFR part 85), the institution or servicer is required to act to protect the Title IV, HEA programs, the beneficiaries
of those programs, and the Federal Government from the risks occasioned by those events. These risks may include,
but are not limited to, financial risks and risk to the reputation of the Title IV, HEA programs. An example of an action
that an institution or servicer must take to protect the Title IV, HEA programs, their beneficiaries, and the Federal
Government is the removal of all Title IV, HEA program administration duties from the assigned responsibilities
of an individual. A violation of these proposed provisions would constitute grounds for the termination of the participation
of an institution under whose contract the servicer committed the violation and the eligibility of the servicer to
administer any aspect of an institution's administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. These amendments parallel
similar changes made to the institutional participation agreement requirements under  668.12. 

The Secretary also proposes to amend this section to explain how a basis for debarment and suspension relates to the
standard of fiduciary responsibility. Specifically, the Secretary proposes to redesignate current paragraph
(e) of this section as paragraph (f) and to add a new paragraph (e). The new paragraph would specify that if an institution
or servicer becomes aware that cause for suspension or debarment of any of the institution's or servicer's principals
or affiliates (as those terms are defined in 34 CFR part 85) may exist, the institution or servicer is required to act
to protect the Title IV, HEA programs in the same manner discussed in the previous paragraph, pending the outcome of
a debarment or suspension action against that individual, or of proceedings that could give rise to suspension or
debarment action against that individual.

A violation of these provisions by a third-party servicer would constitute grounds for the termination of the participation
of an institution under whose contract the servicer committed the violation, if the institution knew or should have
known of the causes for suspension or debarment. The violation, of course, would also constitute grounds for the termination
of the eligibility of the servicer to administer any aspect of the institution's administration of the Title IV, HEA
programs. 

The Secretary invites comment on how to apply this requirement to owners and persons holding critical management
positions at an institution or servicer. In the final regulations, the Secretary may modify these proposed regulations
to address specifically their application to those persons. 

These changes are needed to establish appropriate safeguards to protect the Title IV, HEA programs when serious questions
are raised about the honesty and lawfulness of the conduct of an institution's or servicer's owners, officers, employees,
associates, or contracted help whose duties involve the administration of or influence over the Title IV, HEA programs.


The Secretary holds an institution to the highest standard of care and diligence required of a fiduciary. The use of
a third-party servicer confers that same standard on the servicer. However, the Secretary wishes to emphasize that
the use of a third-party servicer does not in any way reduce the institution's responsibility to ensure compliance
with Title IV, HEA program requirements. 

The Secretary also proposes technical changes to this section to remove provisions governing lender participation
in the FFEL programs that belong in 34 CFR part 682 and to incorporate provisions in 34 CFR part 682 concerning the consequences
of a debarment or suspension on lender participation. 



Section 668.83 Emergency action. 

The Secretary proposes to provide that an emergency action may be imposed on an institution or third-party servicer
if the initiating official receives reliable information that a third-party servicer, acting under contract with
the institution, is violating a Title IV, HEA program requirement. In an emergency action proceeding against a servicer,
the official would also be required to notify each institution that contracts with the servicer of the emergency action.
The Secretary believes that an institution that contracts with a third-party servicer should be kept informed of
any administrative actions taken by the Department of Education against that servicer that might affect the administration
of the institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. To the examples of violations that may lead to an
emergency action, the Secretary proposes to add a third-party servicer's lack of administrative ability to make
appropriate refunds if students do not complete educational programs or periods of enrollment. 

Any of these violations would be grounds for emergency action against a third-party servicer under this subpart.
However, because an institution is always responsible for the actions of the institution's servicers, the Secretary
believes that emergency action against the institution also may be necessary to prevent the likely loss of Title IV,
HEA program funds. 

The Secretary also proposes to include fraud committed by an institution or a third-party servicer as a specific example
of a possible basis for emergency action. The Secretary proposes to provide an additional list of specific examples
of fraud to emphasize the seriousness of these violations. Emergency actions based upon fraud are fully appropriate
under existing regulations. The examples involve falsification of documents related to the Title IV, HEA programs,
including_


(1) Documents pertaining to a student's eligibility; 

(2) Documents submitted to the Department of Education, a guaranty agency, an independent auditor, a third-party
servicer, or an institution by a third-party servicer; 

(3) Documents pertaining to an institution's legal authorization to provide postsecondary education or to the accreditation
or preaccreditation of the institution, the institution's educational programs, or the institution's additional
campuses; and 

(4) Documents pertaining to a servicer's loan collection activities (for example, due diligence activities), including
activities that are not specifically required by the HEA or applicable program regulations. 



Sections 668.84 Fine proceedings, 668.85 Suspension proceedings, and 668.86 Limitation or termination
proceedings. 

The Secretary proposes to include, as a specific basis for any of these proceedings against an institution or a third-party
servicer, a substantial misrepresentation of the institution's educational program, financial charges, or employability
of the institution's graduates by an institution or servicer under contract with an institution, as applicable.
The Secretary believes that substantial misrepresentation represents a clear indication of a deliberate intent
to misuse Title IV, HEA program funds by deceptively encouraging enrollment, thus abusing the purpose of Title IV,
HEA program funds, which is to provide equal access to a quality education for recipients of these funds. The Secretary
is proposing to employ the full range of sanctions at the Secretary's disposal against this possible misrepresentation
to preserve the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs and to ensure the accountability of those who administer the
programs. 

The Secretary proposes to amend these sections to provide for the imposition of a fine against an institution or third-party
servicer or the limitation, suspension, or termination of the institution's participation or the servicer's eligibility
to contract with an institution to administer any aspect of that institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA
programs if the institution's servicer, acting under contract with the institution, violates a Title IV, HEA program
requirement. Under   668.84, 668.85 and 668.86, if the Secretary begins a fine, suspension, limitation,
or termination proceeding against a third-party servicer, the Secretary may also begin a fine, limitation, suspension,
or termination proceeding against any institution under whose contract a third-party commits a violation. These
technical changes are needed to conform to the changes proposed to the scope of this subpart.

With respect to fine proceedings against third-party 
servicers, the Secretary proposes to amend  668.84 to specify 
under the procedures for fine proceedings that a designated 
department official notifies each institution that is affected by 
the alleged violations identified as the basis for the fine 
proceeding. To the extent possible, the official also notifies 
each institution that contracts with the servicer for the same 
service affected by the alleged violation. This change would 
parallel the notification requirements that the Secretary has 
proposed under  668.24(b). As explained in the prior discussion 
regarding notification requirements under  668.24(b), there was 
no consensus during negotiated rulemaking on this proposed 
provision. Some negotiators opposed this requirement on the 
grounds previously noted. In addition,   668.85 and 668.86 would 
require the official to notify each institution that contracts 
with a third-party servicer under a suspension, limitation, or 
termination proceeding. 
Fine, limitation, suspension, and termination proceedings 
would all require the official to include in the notice to a 
third-party servicer the consequences of the action to the 
institution, including that the Secretary may fine, limit, 
suspend, or terminate the institution, as applicable. Given the 
potential consequences to an institution, the Secretary deems it 
proper to provide notice to each institution that could be 
affected of the Secretary's intent to seek a sanction against the 
servicer, whether the Secretary also intends to seek a sanction 
against the institution or not. Even if the Secretary does not 
begin a fine, limitation, suspension, or termination proceeding 
against an institution, the Secretary believes that the 
institution should be kept informed of the status of any proposed 
sanction against the institution's servicer. Imposition of the 
sanction could have an effect on the institution's participation 
in a Title IV, HEA program. Further, the Secretary believes that 
an institution should be informed if its servicer's 
administration of a Title IV, HEA program is called into 
question. That information would permit the institution to make 
informed judgments about the institution's continued use of the 
servicer, and take corrective action prior to the outcome of any 
administrative proceeding. 


Sections 668.87 Prehearing Conference and 668.88 Hearing.

 
The Secretary proposes to add references to third-party servicers 
to conform to the proposed changes in the scope of this subpart. 


Section 668.89 Authority and responsibilities of the 
hearing official.

 The Secretary proposes to amend this section 
to make clear that a hearing official is bound by all applicable 
statutes and regulations. This change would codify in the 
regulations the existing responsibility of the hearing official. 



Section 668.90 Initial and final decisions_Appeals.

 This 
section would be amended to add references to third-party 
servicers to conform to the proposed changes in the scope of this 
subpart. In addition, paragraph (a)(3) of this section would be 
amended to reflect changes proposed under   668.12 and 668.82 
dealing with the past performance of individuals, agencies, or 
organizations that are affiliated with an institution, including, 
as applicable, third-party servicers. 
The Secretary proposes to add a new restriction on a hearing 
official's authority to modify a proposed sanction against an 
institution or third-party servicer. If a designated department 
official brings a termination action against an institution or 
servicer for engaging in fraud, and a hearing official finds that 
the institution or servicer has engaged in fraud, the hearing 
official must uphold the termination. The examples of fraud 
listed in this section are the same as those proposed for  668.83 
concerning emergency action. 
The Secretary believes that if an institution or third-party 
servicer engages in fraud involving a Title IV, HEA program, the 
institution's participation in the program should be terminated 
or the servicer's eligibility to contract with an institution to 
administer any aspect of that institution's participation in the 
Title IV, HEA programs, as applicable, should be terminated. The 
Secretary does not believe that a lesser sanction that permits 
the institution or servicer to continue to participate in the 
program or in the case of a third-party servicer to be eligible 
to contract, is a sufficient safeguard against the likely abuse 
of Title IV, HEA program funds. 
The Secretary proposes to amend paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section so that in a fine, limitation, or termination proceeding, 
the hearing official's initial decision automatically becomes the 
Secretary's final decision in 30 days (20 days is mandated under 
the current regulations) after the initial decision is issued and 
received by both parties unless that initial decision is 
questioned before the Secretary. The Secretary is proposing 
these new timeframes to make them consistent with other reporting 
requirements in this part. The Secretary does not believe that a 
ten-day difference in an institution's or servicer's right to 
appeal an initial decision would unduly affect the integrity of 
the Title IV, HEA programs. 
The Secretary also proposes to make technical changes in 
paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section to correct typographical 
errors that inadvertently appeared in final regulations published 
in the 

Federal Register

 on July 31, 1991 (56 FR 36698). 



Section 668.91 Filing of requests for hearings and appeals; 
confirmation of mailing and receipt dates.

 The Secretary 
proposes to add references to third-party servicers to conform to 
the proposed changes in the scope of this subpart.

Section 668.92 Fines.

 The Secretary proposes to add 
references to third-party servicers in this section to conform to 
proposed changes governing the imposition of fines in other 
sections of this subpart. 
This section would also be amended to provide for the 
consideration of the size of the servicer's business (including 
the number of institutions and student accounts served by the 
servicer) in determining the amount of a fine against a servicer. 
This provision would be similar to the provision already in place 
in this section that requires consideration of the size of an 
institution in determining the amount of a fine against the 
institution. The Secretary also proposes to take into account, 
in the case of a violation by a third-party servicer, the degree 
to which the servicer can provide evidence that the institution 
contributed to that violation and the extent to which repeated 
mechanical systemic unintentional errors contributed to that 
violation. For purposes of this section, repeated mechanical 
systemic unintentional errors would be counted as a single 
violation. This provision was requested by non-Federal 
negotiators to cover cases where errors in computer systems 
result in multiple violations. The Secretary proposes to adopt 
these measures in the interest of fairness to a third-party 
servicer in cases where a minor programming error leads to 
hundreds or thousands of violations. While the Secretary 
believes that all resulting losses should be compensated for by 
the institution or servicer, fines need not be unduly multiplied. 
The Secretary specifically invites comment on whether this 
provision is sufficiently specific and not excessively broad and 
effectively balances the Federal interest in ensuring compliance 
with the realities of computer processing. 
The Secretary also proposes to provide for the consideration 
of the amount of liability owed by an institution or third-party 
servicer on the misuse of Title IV, HEA program funds or refunds 
in determining the gravity of the institution's or servicer's 
violation, as applicable, of a Title IV requirement. The number 
of students affected by the violation also would be a 
consideration in that determination. The Secretary intends these 
provisions to serve as guidelines for evaluating the gravity of a 
violation. 


Section 668.93 Limitation.

 The Secretary proposes to add 
references to third-party servicers in this section to conform to proposed changes governing the imposition of limitations
in other 
sections of this subpart. The Secretary also proposes that a 
limitation on a third-party servicer's eligibility to contract 
with institutions to administer any aspect of an institution's 
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs could include a limit 
on the number or size of institutions with which the servicer may 
contract, the number of accounts (borrower or loan accounts) that 
the servicer may service under contract, an increase or reduction 
in the responsibilities allowed or required of the servicer under 
a contract, or a requirement for the servicer to obtain surety 
assuring the servicer's ability to meet financial obligations. 
The Secretary believes that these limitations are necessary 
to address the probable causes of improprieties in which a 
third-party servicer might engage. By limiting the number or 
size of institutions or accounts that a third-party servicer may 
serve (including, for example, requiring the servicer to transfer 
existing accounts back to the institution) the Secretary may 
address a problem involving the servicer's overextended 
resources. By limiting the responsibilities performed by the 
servicer under a contract, the Secretary may restrict the 
servicer's administration to a particular Title IV, HEA program 
while prohibiting the servicer from administering another 
Title IV, HEA program for which the servicer's past performance 
has been inadequate. By imposing additional responsibilities 
under a third-party servicer's contract, the Secretary may 
require the servicer to use additional safeguards before awarding 
or disbursing Title IV, HEA program funds or delivering Federal 
Stafford or Federal SLS loan proceeds.

Section 668.94 Termination.

 The Secretary proposes to add 
references to third-party servicers in this section to conform to 
proposed changes governing termination proceedings in other 
sections of this subpart. The Secretary proposes to specify that 
a termination of a third-party servicer's eligibility to contract 
with an institution to administer a Title IV, HEA program ends 
the authority of the servicer to administer that program under 
any existing contract between an institution and the servicer. 
In addition, if a third-party servicer's eligibility is 
terminated, the servicer would be required to return to each 
institution (or otherwise dispose of according to the Secretary's 
instructions) any funds received by the servicer under that 
program for that institution or the institution's students. The 
servicer also would be required to return to the institution all 
records pertaining to the servicer's administration of the 
institution's participation in that program. 



The Secretary believes that the termination of a third-party 
servicer's eligibility to contract with an institution should be 
treated like the termination of an institution's participation in 
a Title IV, HEA program. Not only should new contracts with an 
institution be prohibited, but the servicer's existing activities 
involving the administration of that program also should cease. 
Further, a third-party servicer may possess unexpended funds 
under that program for an institution's students at the time that 
termination takes effect. The servicer should be required to 
return those funds to the institution so that those students may 
receive their aid. The return of records to the institution is 
needed because of the recordkeeping requirements that the various 
Title IV, HEA program requirements that the various Title IV, HEA 
program regulations apply to institutions. 





Section 668.95 Reimbursements, refunds, and offsets.

 This 
section would be amended to add references to third-party 
servicers to conform to the proposed changes in the scope of this 
subpart. 





Section 668.96 Reinstatement after termination.

 The 
Secretary proposes to add references to third-party servicers to 
conform to proposed changes in the scope of this subpart. The 
Secretary also proposes to eliminate the provision that permits 
an institution to apply for reinstatement of its participation 
after three months if the institution's participation has been 
terminated for engaging in substantial misrepresentation. Like 
institutions whose participation is terminated for other 
violations, the institution would be able to apply for 
reinstatement only after 18 months from the date of the 
termination, unless the institution also was debarred or 
suspended under E.O. 12549 or the Federal Acquisition Regulations 
(FAR), 48 CFR subpart 9.4. The Secretary further proposes to 
extend these criteria to apply to a termination of a third-party 
servicer's eligibility to contract with an institution to 
administer any aspect of the institution's participation in the 
Title IV, HEA programs if the basis for that termination was 
engaging in substantial misrepresentation. 



The Title IV, HEA programs are most effective only if 
students, other members of the public, and governmental and other 
bodies can rely on the honesty of the representations of an 
institution or the institution's agents. The harm that 
substantial misrepresentation does to the integrity of the 
Title IV, HEA programs, to those who rely on the programs to help 
meet educational costs, and to the taxpayers who pay for the 
programs should carry equal weight with the harm done by any 
other violation of a Title IV, HEA program requirement. If an 
institution's participation or third-party servicer's eligibility 
is terminated because the institution or servicer engaged in 
substantial misrepresentation, the consequence of that 
termination should be no less than the consequence of a 
termination for other reasons. 





Section 668.97 Removal of limitation.

 The Secretary 
proposes to provide that an institution may not apply for removal 
of a limitation before the later of (1) 12 months from the 
effective date of the limitation, or (2) the expiration of a 
debarment or suspension under E.O. 12549 or the FAR, 48 CFR 
subpart 9.4. Parallel to the requirement for institutions, a 
third-party servicer would be able to apply for removal of a 
limitation only after 12 months from the date of the limitation, 
unless the servicer was also debarred or suspended.

These changes are necessary to conform to the proposed 
changes in the scope of this subpart. The Secretary would 
include the length of a debarment or suspension action as a 
criterion to apply for removal of a limitation to protect the 
Title IV, HEA programs, the beneficiaries of those programs, and 
the Federal Government from potential effects of doing business 
with irresponsible entities. 





Sections 668.111 Scope and purpose, 668.112 Definitions, 
668.113 Request for review, 668.114 Notification of hearing, 
and 668.116 Hearing.

 The Secretary proposes to add references 
to a third-party servicer to these sections to parallel 
institutional appeal procedures and thus establish procedures for 
a third-party servicer to appeal a final audit determination or 
final program review determination. The proposed procedures 
generally would be parallel to the procedures already established 
that govern appeals by an institution of a final audit 
determination or final program review determination. Under 
 668.116(e), the Secretary proposes to expand the types of 
evidence that an institution or servicer requesting review of the 
final audit or final program review determination may submit to a 
hearing official to include Department of Education program 
review reports and work papers for program reviews and 
institutional or servicer records and other materials (including 
records and other materials of institutions with which the 
servicer has contracts) provided to the Department in response to 
a program review. The Secretary also proposes to notify all 
institutions with which a third-party servicer contracts of final 
audit report or final program review determinations. The 
Secretary believes that an institution that contracts with a 
third-party servicer should be kept informed of any activities 
between the servicer and the Department that might affect the 
administration of the institution's participation in a Title IV, 
HEA program. 





Section 668.123 Collection.

 The Secretary proposes to 
modify this section to conform to the proposed changes to 
 668.24. 




Part 682_Federal Family Education Loan Programs 







Section 682.200 Definitions.

 The Secretary proposes to 
amend the definition of 

lender

 to exclude from the definition of 
an ``eligible lender'' any lender that (1) is debarred or suspended 
under E.O. 12549 or the FAR, (2) has principals or affiliates so 
debarred or suspended, (3) is an affiliate of any person so 
debarred or suspended, or (4) employs to administer or assist in 
the administration of FFEL program funds any person so debarred 
or suspended. The effect of these proposed changes would be 
automatically to exclude a debarred or suspended lender from 
participation in the FFEL programs for the duration of the 
debarment or suspension. A guaranty agency would thus be 
prohibited from guaranteeing a new loan made by the lender during 
this period. 



Like the proposed changes governing the standard of conduct 
of participating educational institutions and third-party 
servicers under 34 CFR 668.82, these changes are needed to 
establish appropriate safeguards to protect the integrity of the 
FFEL programs and the Federal financial interest if serious 
questions are raised about the honesty and lawfulness of the 
conduct of a lender's owners, officers, directors, management, 
employees, or affiliates whose duties involve the administration 
of or influence over the use of those funds. 



The Secretary proposes to amend this section to expand on 
the statutory definition of 

third-party servicer

 in the proposed 
regulations to clarify its applicability in the FFEL programs. 
Under that definition, a third-party servicer is an individual or 
organization that contracts with a lender or guaranty agency to 
administer any aspect of the lender's or guaranty agency's 
participation in the FFEL programs, including any applicable 
function described in the definition of third-party servicer in 
34 CFR part 668. The Secretary believes that by including the 
statutory definition as well as a reference to the proposed 
definition of third-party servicer under 34 CFR part 668, that 
individuals or organizations that contract with a lender or 
guaranty agency to administer any aspect of the lender's or 
guaranty agency's participation in the FFEL programs will be able 
to determine the applicability of these regulations to 
themselves. 





Section 682.401 Basic Program Agreement.

 The Secretary 
proposes to revise this section of the regulations to clarify a 
guaranty agency's responsibilities if it enters into a contract 
with a third-party servicer. As discussed previously under 
 682.200, the Secretary proposes to prohibit a guaranty agency 
from entering into a contract with a third-party servicer that 
the Secretary has determined is not financially responsible or 
has been determined by the Secretary to have not complied with 
the statutes and regulations that govern the FFEL programs. 



Under this proposed provision, a guaranty agency would be 
required to provide to the Secretary the names and addresses of 
any third-party servicer with which the agency contracts and, if 
requested by the Secretary, a copy of that contract. The 
Secretary is proposing to require submission by the agency of the 
name and address of any third-party servicer with which the 
agency contracts, and, upon request, the contract, to assist the 
Secretary in carrying out his responsibilities to monitor the 
performance of third-party servicers.

The Secretary believes that receipt of a copy of the 
contract is necessary because it states the services that a 
third-party servicer performs for a guaranty agency. With this 
information, the Secretary will be better able to monitor program 
compliance and integrity of the guaranty agency's portfolio that 
the servicer is administering. These changes would parallel the 
requirements concerning contracts between institutions and third-party servicers. 



Note that section 552 of the Administrative Procedure Act 
does not require disclosure to the public, under the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA), of subject matter that is deemed to be a 
trade secret or is of commercial or financial interest or is of a 
privileged or confidential nature (note also that the entity 
submitting the information is responsible for identifying 
information that is not subject to the FOIA's disclosure 
requirements). 





Section 682.413 Remedial actions. 

The Secretary proposes 
to revise this section of the regulations to clarify a lender's 
and its third-party servicer's responsibility to pay liabilities 
if the servicer has not complied with FFEL program statutes or 
regulations with respect to services it has contracted with a 
lender to perform. Under this section, a third-party servicer 
and lender under whose contract the servicer committed the 
violation would be considered jointly and severally liable for 
paying to the Secretary any interest benefits and special 
allowance or any compensation the servicer has received on any 
loan from the lender from the date that the servicer fails to 
comply with any of the requirements in  682.406(a)(1)-(a)(6), 
(a)(9), and (a)(12), for any period when the loan has lost its 
eligibility for reinsurance coverage as a result of the third-party servicer's actions, and for any period after
it erroneously 
bills the Secretary for interest benefits and special allowance. 
The Secretary would vigorously attempt to collect any of those 
liabilities first from the lender and, if the lender does not 
repay those liabilities within 30 days or does not make 
arrangements satisfactory to the Secretary to repay those 
liabilities, pursue the third-party servicer for the payment of 
those liabilities. 



This proposed section would also clarify a guaranty agency's 
and its third-party servicer's responsibilities to pay 
liabilities to the Secretary if the servicer has not complied 
with FFEL program statutes or regulations with respect to 
services that it has contracted with a guaranty agency to 
perform. Under this proposed provision, the Secretary would 
require a guaranty agency to repay to the Secretary any 
reinsurance payments the guaranty agency received on a loan if 
the third-party servicer contracting with the guaranty agency 
causes a loan to lose its eligibility for reinsurance. In 
addition to the repayment of reinsurance, if a third-party 
servicer makes an incomplete or incorrect statement in connection 
with any agreement entered into under this part or any other 
Federal requirement, the guaranty agency with which it has 
entered into a contract may be subjected by the Secretary to 
return payments made by the Secretary to the agency, have its 
payments withheld by the Secretary, or have its participation in 
the FFEL programs limited, suspended, or terminated. In addition 
to these penalties, the guaranty agency and its third-party 
servicer may be fined, may be required to repay any payments the 
Secretary became obligated to make to others as a result of an 
incomplete or incorrect statement or violation of any Federal 
requirement, or be responsible for repaying any interest 
benefits, special allowance, or reinsurance paid on a 
Consolidation loan for a violation of 34 CFR 682.206(f)(1). The 
guaranty agency and its third-party servicer would be considered 
jointly and severally liable for any of those liabilities. The 
method by which the Secretary would collect any liability would 
parallel the proposed provisions governing the circumstances 
under which a lender and third-party servicer would be jointly 
and severally liable to the Secretary. 



In the negotiated rulemaking sessions, the issue of third-party servicer liability generated controversy and dissension

among the negotiators. With regard to liabilities assessed 
against a third-party servicer under the FFEL programs, many 
negotiators raised the same objections previously discussed in 
connection with liability for servicers under 34 CFR part 668. 
Negotiators raised an additional objection, suggesting that 
liabilities assessed against third-party servicers under the FFEL 
programs are unnecessary given the ability of the Secretary to 
determine a loan to be uninsured and thus able to be collected 
directly from a lender or guaranty agency. In response to these 
objections, the Secretary offered the same modification of the 
concept of joint and several liability discussed previously in 34 
CFR part 668. As noted, no consensus was reached. However, the 
Secretary agreed to incorporate language into these proposed 
regulations to specify that the Secretary would first attempt 
collection from a lender or guaranty agency in the event of 
liability on the part of a third-party servicer. The Secretary 
included this provision at the request of negotiators because the 
Secretary believes that this provision would not adversely impact 
the integrity of the FFEL programs. The Secretary specifically 
invites further public comment on the issue of joint and several 
liability for servicers contracting with lenders and guaranty 
agencies in order to obtain additional advice from the higher 
education community in the development of final regulations. 



The Secretary specifically invites public comment on 
whether, and how, the Secretary should hold a third-party 
servicer that administers FFEL programs jointly and severally 
liable for any violation of an FFEL program requirement by that 
servicer and whether any alternative less than assumption of full 
liability is sufficient to protect the public interest. The 
Secretary notes that substantial losses have occurred in the FFEL 
programs due to third-party servicer violations.

Under these proposed regulations, the Secretary would follow 
the fine proceedings contained in 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, in 
imposing a fine against a third-party servicer. 





Section 682.414 Records, reports, and inspection 
requirements for guaranty agency programs. 

The Secretary 
proposes to amend this section to make a third-party servicer's 
responsibilities under this part conform to currently existing 
regulations with respect to a guaranty agency's obligation to 
maintain current records. Under this provision, a third-party 
servicer acting as an agent for a guaranty agency would be 
required to maintain current, complete, and accurate records for 
all loans that it services for that agency. These records would 
have to be updated at least once every 10 business days. The 
Secretary is proposing this provision to ensure that a 
third-party servicer with which a guaranty agency contracts is 
responsible for maintaining accurate records. 





Section 682.416 Requirements for third-party servicers and 
lenders contracting with third-party servicers. 

The Secretary 
proposes to add a new section to the FFEL program regulations 
that would set forth administrative and financial standards that 
a third-party servicer would be required to meet in order to be 
an eligible third-party servicer with which a lender or guaranty 
agency may contract for purposes of its responsibilities under 
the FFEL programs. Under these proposed regulations, a 
third-party servicer would be considered to be administratively 
responsible if it provides the services for which it has 
contracted to perform in accordance with the Federal laws and 
regulations that govern the FFEL programs, has business systems 
that are capable of meeting those requirements and has adequate 
personnel who are knowledgeable about the FFEL programs. The 
Secretary is proposing these standards because he believes that 
these are the minimum administrative standards that an agent or 
entity must meet to demonstrate satisfactorily to the Secretary 
that it is capable of performing FFEL program services in 
accordance with applicable statutes and regulations. 



The Secretary proposes to apply the standards governing 
financial responsibility under 34 CFR 668.13(c), (d), (g), and 
(h), governing the financial responsibility of institutions and 
third-party servicers contracting with those institutions, to a 
third-party servicer that administers any aspect of the FFEL 
programs under a contract with a guaranty agency or lender, for 
purposes of this part. 



During the negotiated rulemaking sessions, the proposed 
standards governing financial responsibility of third-party 
servicers and institutions generated disagreement among the 
negotiators. The Secretary intends that the financial 
responsibility standards in this section would parallel, as 
applicable, similar standards of financial responsibility for 
participating institutions that the Secretary intends to publish 
in proposed regulations to be published shortly after these. 
When published, this future NPRM will provide commenters with the 
opportunity to comment on financial responsibility standards 
governing both third-party servicers and institutions. 



The Secretary proposes these standards to ensure that a 
third-party servicer would not be able to maintain a contract 
with a lender or guaranty agency to administer any aspect of the 
lender's or guaranty agency's FFEL program unless that servicer 
periodically demonstrates to the Secretary the ability to meet 
its financial obligations with that lender or guaranty agency. 
Further, these standards would ensure that the servicer can 
demonstrate that it is financially stable and will be able to 
meet these obligations in the future. The Secretary believes 
that these standards are necessary because the financial failure 
of a third-party servicer could have an enormous impact on the 
FFEL programs that could create substantial losses for the 
Federal taxpayer. 



Under these proposed rules, the Secretary would, as 
determined necessary, conduct a special review of a third-party 
servicer to determine if it meets the administrative capability 
and financial responsibility standards proposed in this section. 
If the Secretary conducts that review, the servicer would be 
required to provide evidence to the Secretary that it meets these 
standards. Based on the review of the materials required by this 
section the Secretary could initiate a limitation, suspension, or 
termination action against the servicer. If the servicer is 
unable to demonstrate that it meets the established standards for 
administrative capability and financial responsibility, the 
servicer could provide evidence to the Secretary demonstrating 
that the limitation, suspension, or termination action is 
unwarranted. This latter provision was added at the request of 
negotiators to govern situations where a third-party servicer may 
not be able to meet the defined standards proposed in this 
section, but the servicer still considers itself to be 
administratively capable and financially responsible. This 
provision would allow a third-party servicer the opportunity to 
demonstrate to the Secretary that it is still administratively 
capable and financially responsible. 



This section would provide that a third-party servicer is 
not financially responsible under this section if the servicer, 
or the servicer's owner, majority shareholder, or chief executive 
officer is determined to have a questionable past performance. 
The past performance criteria in this section would parallel 
proposed requirements under 34 CFR 668.12 (implementing statutory 
requirements governing the past performance of persons or 
organizations associated with institutions that participate in 
Title IV, HEA programs) and under 34 CFR 668.82 (governing the 
standard of conduct of institutions and third-party servicers for 
purposes of the Title IV, HEA programs). Furthermore, the 
Secretary proposes to apply this provision to any person employed 
by the servicer or any person, entity, or any officer or employee 
of an entity that the servicer contracts with whose past 
performance is also questionable. In addition, in order to 
remain financially responsible, if a third-party servicer learns 
of such a conviction or determination, the servicer would have to 
take immediate action to safeguard the Title IV, HEA programs, as 
explained previously in the discussion concerning  668.82.

However, for purposes of this part, the Secretary proposes 
to specify that with regard to the conduct of an officer or 
employee of a third-party servicer or a person, entity, or 
officer or employee of an entity with which the servicer 
contracts, that conduct would be a factor in determining the 
servicer's financial responsibility only if the individual or 
entity is used in a capacity that involves administering any 
aspect of the Title IV, HEA programs. For example, the Secretary 
would not hold the conduct of a custodian employed by a 
third-party servicer as an element in determining the servicer's 
financial responsibility, if that custodian had no responsibility 
for administering a Title IV, HEA program. 
The Secretary also proposes to specify that a third-party 
servicer would not be considered to be financially responsible if 
the servicer, or any principal or affiliate of the servicer (as 
those terms are defined in 34 CFR part 85), is debarred or 
suspended under E.O. 12549 or the FAR, or is engaging in activity 
that is cause under 34 CFR 85.305 or 85.405 for debarment or 
suspension under E.O. 12549 or the FAR. 
Like the proposed changes governing the past performance of 
individuals or organizations associated with institutions that 
participate in the Title IV, HEA programs and standard of conduct 
of participating institutions and third-party servicers, these 
changes are needed to establish appropriate safeguards to protect 
the integrity of the FFEL programs and the Federal financial 
interest if serious questions are raised about the honest and 
lawful conduct of a servicer's owners, officers, directors, 
employees, or affiliates whose duties involve the administration 
of or influence over the use of those funds. 
Under this section, a third-party servicer would be required 
to have an annual independent audit of its administration of the 
FFEL programs that examines the servicer's compliance with the 
Act and applicable regulations and its financial management of 
FFEL program activities. These requirements and audit exceptions 
would parallel the proposed audit requirements and exceptions 
under 34 CFR 668.23 (governing audit requirements for third-party 
servicers contracting with institutions to administer any aspect 
of the institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA 
programs), except that the report of the audit would have to be 
submitted to the Secretary within six months of the end of the 
audit report period. A third-party servicer's initial audit 
would have to cover the same period required of audits performed 
for third-party servicers contracting with institutions to 
administer any aspect of the institution's participation in the 
Title IV, HEA programs (discussed previously in 34 CFR 668.23). 
The Secretary believes that initial audits will be more useful 
and effective if they encompass an entire fiscal year. The 
Secretary also believes that allowing servicers additional time 
to prepare for the implementation of these regulations would 
enable servicers to comply more fully with these regulations as 
well as defray the costs associated with an audit of a partial 
fiscal year and minimize the burden associated with implementing 
these regulations, as called for under E.O. 12866. Subsequent 
audits would, as required by statute, encompass the entire period 
since the servicer's previous audit. 
In addition, the Secretary proposes that the audit report 
would be conducted in accordance with the audit guide developed 
by the Inspector General of the Department of Education unless 
the third-party servicer is a governmental entity or nonprofit 
organization. A third-party servicer that is a governmental 
entity would be required to have an audit conducted in accordance 
with 31 U.S.C. 7502 and 34 CFR part 80, appendix G (pursuant to 
the Single Audit Act). A third-party servicer that is a 
nonprofit organization would be required to have an audit 
conducted in accordance with Office of Management and Budget 
Circular A-133, ``Audit of Institutions of Higher Education and 
Other Nonprofit Institutions,'' as incorporated in 34 CFR 
74.61(h)(3). 
These proposed rules would also limit a lender's ability to 
enter into a contract with a third-party servicer. As explained 
previously in the discussion for  682.200, under this proposal, a 
lender may not enter into a contract with a third-party servicer 
that the Secretary has determined does not meet the 
administrative capability or financial responsibility standards 
under this section. Further, a lender that contracts with a 
third-party servicer would have to provide the Secretary with the 
name and address of the third-party servicer, and, upon request, 
a copy of that contract. 


Sections 682.700 Purpose and scope, 682.701 Definitions of 
terms used in this subpart, 682.702 Effect on participation, 
682.703 Informal compliance procedure, 682.704 Emergency 
action, 682.705 Suspension proceedings, 682.706 Limitation or 
termination proceedings, 682.707 Appeals in a limitation or 
termination proceeding, 682.708 Evidence of mailing and receipt 
dates, 682.709 Reimbursements, refunds, and offsets, 682.710 Removal of limitation, and 682.711 Reinstatement
after 
termination. 

The Secretary proposes to amend subpart G to 
provide that the Secretary would have the authority to limit, 
suspend, or terminate a third-party servicer's ability to 
contract with an eligible lender if the Secretary determines the 
third-party servicer has violated any FFEL program requirement. 
Section 432(a)(1) of the Act authorizes the Secretary to take 
action against third-party servicers for any violation of any 
FFEL program requirement. Under these proposed regulations, the 
Secretary could also take emergency action against the servicer 
if the Secretary receives reliable information that the servicer 
is in violation of applicable requirements pertaining to the 
lender's portfolio of loans. The procedures under which the 
Secretary could take those actions and the procedures a third-party servicer could use to appeal those actions are
consistent 
with the long-standing procedures the Secretary uses to take 
those actions against a lender, and the procedures a lender may 
use to appeal those actions.

Executive Order 12866 


These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance 
with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the 
Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this 
regulatory action. 
The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations 
are those resulting from statutory requirements and those 
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering the 
Title IV, HEA programs effectively and efficiently. Burdens 
specifically associated with information collection requirements, 
if any, are identified and explained elsewhere in this preamble 
under the heading 

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980

. 
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both 
quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations, the 
Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed 
regulations justify the costs. 
The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory 
action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal 
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 
To assist the Department in complying with the specific 
requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites 
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce 
any potential costs or increase potential benefits resulting from 
these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and 
efficient administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 


The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations 
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. The small entities that would be 
affected by these regulations are small institutions of higher 
education; small organizations that contract with educational 
institutions to administer aspects of the institutions' 
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs; and small 
organizations that contract with lenders or guaranty agencies to 
administer aspects of the lenders' or agencies' participation in 
the FFEL programs. However, the regulations would not have a 
significant economic impact on these small entities because the 
regulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or 
require unnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations would 
impose minimal requirements to ensure the proper expenditure of 
program funds. 


Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 


Sections 668.13, 668.23, 668.25, 668.90, 668.96, 668.113, 
682.414, 682.416, and 682.711 contain information collection 
requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these 
sections to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its 
review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) 
Educational institutions that are public or nonprofit 
institutions or businesses or other for-profit institutions may 
participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. State entities, 
nonprofit institutions, businesses or other for-profit 
organizations, or individuals may contract with educational 
institutions to administer aspects of the institutions' 
participation in the programs and may contract with lenders and 
guaranty agencies to administer aspects of the lenders' and 
agencies' participation in the FFEL programs. Individuals may 
apply for student financial assistance under the programs. The 
Department of Education needs and uses the information to enable 
the Secretary to determine whether the States, institutions, 
organizations, businesses, and individuals comply with the 
requirements for eligibility and participation in the programs. 
Annual public reporting and recordkeeping burden contained 
in the collection of information proposed in these regulations is 
estimated to be 2,786 hours, including the time for searching 
existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, 
completing and reviewing the collection of information, and 
submitting materials. 
Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on 
the information collection requirements should direct them to the 
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 3002, New 
Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503; Attention: 
Daniel J. Chenok. 


Invitation to Comment 


Interested persons are invited to submit comments and 
recommendations regarding these proposed regulations. 
All comments submitted in response to these proposed 
regulations will be available for public inspection, during and 
after the comment period, in room 4318, Regional Office 
Building 3, 7th and D Streets, SW., Washington, DC, between 
the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday of 
each week except Federal holidays.

any aspect of the institution's participation in any 
Title IV, HEA program, the applicable rules in this part also 
apply to that servicer. An institution's use of a third-party 
servicer does not alter the institution's responsibility for 
compliance with the rules in this part.

(a) This subpart establishes standards that an institution 
must meet in order to participate in any Title IV, HEA program. 



(b) Noncompliance with these standards by an institution 
already participating in any Title IV, HEA program or with 
applicable standards in this subpart by a third-party servicer 
that contracts with the institution may subject the institution

part. These proceedings may lead to any of the following 
actions: 



(1) An emergency action.

questioned, the Secretary notifies the institution or servicer of 
the questioned expenditure or compliance. 
 

 (2) If the institution or servicer believes that the 
questioned expenditure or compliance was proper, the institution 
or servicer shall notify the Secretary in writing of the 
institution's or servicer's position and the reasons for that 
position.

certified as to accuracy and completeness by an independent 
auditor in accordance with the general standards and the 
standards for audits in the U.S. General Accounting Office's

notification to the institution or servicer. 
 

 (b)(1) Based on the audit finding and the institution's or

repayment.

owes a liability for its administration of an institution's

the determination. The servicer shall also notify every

(i) If an institution or third-party servicer has posted 
surety or has provided a third-party guarantee and the Secretary 
questions expenditures or compliance with applicable requirements 
and identifies liabilities, then the Secretary may determine that 
deferring recourse to the surety or guarantee is not appropriate 
because_ 


 (A) The need to provide relief to students or borrowers 
affected by the act or omission giving rise to the liability 
outweighs the importance of deferring collection action until 
completion of available appeal proceedings; or 
 

 (B) The terms of the surety or guarantee do not provide 
complete assurance that recourse to that protection will be fully 
available through the completion of available appeal proceedings; 
or

asserted in the notification against the institution or 
third-party servicer are upheld, the institution or third-party 
servicer shall repay those funds at the direction of the 
Secretary within 30 days of the final determination under 
subpart H of this part unless_ 


 (i) The Secretary permits a longer repayment period; or 
 

 (ii) The Secretary determines that earlier collection 
action is appropriate pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. 
 

 (d) An institution is held responsible for any liability 
owed by the institution's third-party servicer for a violation 
incurred in servicing any aspect of that institution's 
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs and remains 
responsible for that amount until that amount is repaid in full.

(2) The emergency action takes effect on the date the 
initiating official mails the notice to the institution or 
servicer, as applicable. 
 (3) The notice states the grounds on which the emergency

against an institution or third-party servicer only if that 
official_
(i) Receives information, determined by the official to be 
reliable, that the institution or servicer, as applicable, is 
violating any statutory provision of or applicable to Title IV of 
the HEA, any regulatory provision prescribed under that statutory 
authority, or any applicable special arrangement, agreement, or 
limitation; 
 (ii) Determines that immediate action is necessary to 
prevent misuse of Title IV, HEA program funds; and 
 (iii) Determines that the likelihood of loss from that 
misuse outweighs the importance of awaiting completion of any 
proceeding that may be initiated to limit, suspend, or terminate, 
as applicable_
(A) The participation of the institution in one or more 
Title IV, HEA programs; or 
 (B) The eligibility of the servicer to contract with any

 (ii) Using, offering to make available, or causing the use

(F) Falsification, including false certifications, of any 
document pertaining to the performance of any loan collection 
activity, including activity that is not required by the HEA or 
applicable program regulations. 
 (3) If the Secretary begins an emergency action against a 
third-party servicer, the Secretary may also begin an emergency 
action against any institution under whose contract a third-party 
servicer commits the violation. 
 (d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, after an emergency action becomes effective, an 
institution or third-party servicer, as applicable, may not_
(i) Make or increase awards or make other commitments of 
aid to a student under the applicable Title IV, HEA program; 
 (ii) Disburse either program funds, institutional funds, or

 (2) If the initiating official withdraws, by an emergency 
action, the authority of the institution or servicer to commit, 
disburse, deliver, or cause the commitment, disbursement, or 
delivery of Title IV, HEA program funds, or the authority of the 
servicer to administer any aspect of any institution's 
participation in any Title IV, HEA program, except in accordance 
with a particular procedure specified in the notice of emergency 
action, the institution or servicer, as applicable, may not take 
any action described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section except 
in accordance with the procedure specified in the notice. 
 (e)(1) Upon request by the institution or servicer, as 
applicable, the Secretary provides the institution or servicer, 
as soon as practicable, with an opportunity to show cause that 
the emergency action is unwarranted or should be modified. 
 (2) An opportunity to show cause consists of an opportunity 
to present evidence and argument to a show-cause official. The 
initiating official does not act as the show-cause official for 
any emergency action that the initiating official has begun. The 
show-cause official is authorized to grant relief from the 
emergency action. The institution or servicer may make its 
presentation in writing or, upon its request, at an informal 
meeting with the show-cause official. 
 (3) The show-cause official may limit the time and manner 
in which argument and evidence may be presented in order to avoid 
unnecessary delay or the presentation of immaterial, irrelevant, 
or repetitious matter. 
 (4) The institution or servicer, as applicable, has the 
burden of persuading the show-cause official that the emergency 
action imposed by the notice is unwarranted or should be modified 
because_
(i) The grounds stated in the notice did not, or no longer, 
exist; 
 (ii) The grounds stated in the notice will not cause loss 
or misuse of Title IV, HEA program funds; or 
 (iii) The institution or servicer, as applicable, will use 
procedures that will reliably eliminate the risk of loss from the 
misuse described in the notice. 
 (5) The show-cause official continues, modifies, or revokes 
the emergency action promptly after consideration of any argument 
and evidence presented by the institution or servicer, as 
applicable, and the initiating official. 
 (6) The show-cause official notifies the institution or 
servicer, as applicable, of that official's determination 
promptly after the completion of the show-cause meeting or, if no 
meeting is requested, after the official receives all the 
material submitted by the institution in opposition to the 
emergency action. In the case of a notice to a third-party 
servicer, the official also notifies each institution that 
contracts with the servicer of that determination. The 
show-cause official may explain that determination by adopting or 
modifying the statement of reasons provided in the notice of 
emergency action. 
 (f)(1) An emergency action does not extend more than 30 
days after initiated unless the Secretary initiates a limitation, 
suspension, or termination proceeding under this part or under 
34 CFR part 600 against the institution or servicer, as 
applicable, within that 30-day period, in which case the 
emergency action continues until a final decision is issued in 
that proceeding, as provided in  668.90 (c) or (f), as applicable. 
 (2) Until a final decision is issued by the Secretary in a 
proceeding described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the 
continuation, modification, or revocation of the emergency action 
is at the sole discretion of the initiating official, or, if a 
show-cause proceeding is conducted, the show-cause official. 
 (3) If an emergency action extends beyond 180 days by 
virtue of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the institution or 
servicer, as applicable, may then submit written material to the 
show-cause official to demonstrate that because of facts 
occurring after the later of the notice by the initiating 
official or the show-cause meeting, continuation of the emergency 
action is unwarranted and the emergency action should be modified 
or ended. The show-cause official considers any written material 
submitted and issues a determination that continues, modifies, or 
revokes the emergency action.

(g) The expiration, modification, or revocation of an 
emergency action against an institution or third-party servicer 
does not bar subsequent emergency action against that institution 
on grounds other than those specifically identified in the notice 
imposing the prior emergency action. Separate grounds may 
include violation by an institution or third-party servicer of an 
agreement or limitation imposed or resulting from the prior 
emergency action.

(C) The 50th day after the last day of the hearing, if the hearing official does not request the parties to make any posthearing
submission. 
(2) The hearing official's initial decision states whether the imposition of the fine, limitation, suspension,

official brought a termination action against the institution or servicer, the hearing official may, if appropriate,

participation is warranted;

participation or servicer's eligibility, as applicable, is warranted; 
(iii) If an action brought against an institution or third-party servicer involves its failure to provide surety
in the amount specified by the Secretary under  668.13, the hearing official must find that the amount of the
surety established by the Secretary was appropriate unless the institution can demonstrate that the amount was unreasonable;

(iv) In a limitation, suspension, or termination proceeding 
commenced on the grounds described in  668.15(b)(1), if the

loan and Federal SLS cohort default rate, as defined in 
 668.15(f), meets the conditions specified in  668.15(b)(1) for 
initiation of limitation, suspension, or termination proceedings, 
the hearing official finds that the sanction sought by the

been met; and 
 

 (vii) In a termination action against an institution or 
third-party servicer on the grounds that the institution or 
servicer, as applicable, engaged in fraud involving the

official finds that the institution or servicer, as applicable, 
engaged in that fraud. Examples of fraud include_ 


 (A) Falsification of any document received from a student 
or pertaining to a student's eligibility for assistance under a 
Title IV, HEA program; 
 

 (B) Falsification, including false certifications, of any 
document submitted by the institution or servicer to the 
Department of Education;

notice. If a hearing is conducted solely through written 
submissions, the parties must agree to findings of fact. 
 

 (b)(1) In a suspension proceeding, the Secretary reviews 
the hearing official's initial decision and issues a final 
decision within 20 days after the initial decision. The 
Secretary adopts the initial decision unless it is clearly 
unsupported by the evidence presented at the hearing. 
 

 (2) The Secretary notifies the institution or servicer and, 
in the case of a suspension proceeding against a third-party 
servicer, each institution that contracts with the servicer of 
the final decision. If the Secretary suspends the institution's 
participation or servicer's eligibility, the suspension takes 
effect on the later of_ 


 (i) The day that the institution or servicer receives the 
notice; or 
 

 (ii) The date specified in the designated department 
official's original notice of intent to suspend the institution's

(3) A suspension may not exceed 60 days unless a designated 
department official begins a limitation or termination proceeding 
under this subpart before the expiration of that period. In that 
case, the period may be extended until a final decision is issued 
in that proceeding according to paragraph (c) of this section. 
 

 (c)(1) In a fine, limitation, or termination proceeding, 
the hearing official's initial decision automatically becomes the 
Secretary's final decision 30 days after the initial decision is 
issued and received by both parties unless, within that 30-day 
period, the institution or servicer, as applicable, or the 
designated department official appeals the initial decision to 
the Secretary. 
 

 (2)(i) A party may appeal the hearing official's initial 
decision by submitting to the Secretary, within 30 days after the 
party receives the initial decision, a brief or other written 
statement that explains why the party believes that the Secretary

party shall provide a copy of that submission to the opposing 
party.

responsive statement to the Secretary, with a copy to the 
appellant, within 30 days after the opposing party receives the 
appellant's brief or written statement. 
 

 (iv) The appealing party may submit proposed findings of 
fact or conclusions of law. However, the proposed findings of 
fact must be supported by_ 


 (A) The evidence introduced into the record at the hearing; 
 

 (B) Stipulations of the parties if the hearing consisted of 
written submissions; or 
 

 (C) Matters that may be judicially noticed. 
 

 (v) Neither party may introduce new evidence on appeal. 
 

 (vi) The initial decision of the hearing official imposing 
a fine or limiting or terminating the institution's participation 
or servicer's eligibility does not take effect pending the

Secretary may delegate to a designated department official the 
functions described in paragraph (c)(2) (vii) through (ix) of this 
section. 
 

 (viii) In rendering a final decision, the Secretary 
considers only evidence introduced into the record at the hearing 
and facts agreed to by the parties if the hearing consisted only 
of written submissions and matters that may be judicially 
noticed. 
 

 (ix) If the hearing official finds that a termination is 
warranted pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the 
Secretary affirms that decision. In any other case, the 
Secretary may affirm, modify, or reverse the initial decision, or 
may remand the case to the hearing official for further 
proceedings consistent with the Secretary's decision. If the 
Secretary affirms the initial decision without issuing a 
statement of reasons, the Secretary adopts the opinion of the 
hearing official as the decision of the Secretary. If the 
Secretary modifies, remands, or reverses the initial decision, in 
whole or in part, the Secretary's decision states the reasons for 
the action taken.

Scope. 

(1) A suspension by the Secretary removes a lender's eligibility under the FFEL programs or a third-party servicer's
ability to enter into contracts with eligible lenders, and the Secretary does not guarantee or reinsure a new loan
made by the lender or new loan serviced by the servicer during a period not to exceed 60 days from the date the suspension
becomes effective, unless_

(i) The lender or servicer and the Secretary agree to an extension of the suspension period, if the lender or third-party
servicer has not requested a hearing; or

(ii) The Secretary begins a limitation or a termination proceeding.

(2) If the Secretary begins a limitation or a termination proceeding before the suspension period ends, the Secretary
may extend the suspension period until the completion of that proceeding, including any appeal to the Secretary.

Notice.

 (1) The Secretary, or a designated Departmental official, begins a suspension proceeding by sending the lender or
servicer a notice by certified mail with return receipt requested.

(2) The notice_

(i) Informs the lender or servicer of the Secretary's intent to suspend the lender's or servicer's eligibility for
a period not to exceed 60 days;

(ii) Describes the consequences of a suspension;

(iii) Identifies the alleged violations on which the proposed suspension is based;

(i) Ensures that a written record of the hearing is made;

(ii) Considers relevant written material presented before the hearing and other relevant evidence presented during
the hearing; and

(iii) Issues a decision based on findings of fact and conclusions of law that may suspend the lender's or servicer's
eligibility only if the presiding officer is persuaded that the suspension is warranted by the evidence.

(4) The formal rules of evidence do not apply, and no discovery, as provided in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
(28 U.S.C. Appendix), is required.

(5) The presiding officer shall base findings of fact only on evidence considered at or before the hearing and matters
given official notice.

(6) The initial decision of the presiding officer is mailed to the lender or servicer.

(7) The Secretary automatically reviews the initial decision of the presiding officer. The Secretary notifies the
lender or servicer of the Secretary's decision by mail.

(8) A suspension takes effect on either a date that is at least 20 days after the date the notice of a decision imposing
the suspension is mailed to the lender or servicer, or on the proposed effective date stated in the notice sent under
paragraph (b) of this section, whichever is later.

ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard proposes regulations to require all U.S. flag oil tankers of 150 gross tons and above and all other U.S.
flag ships of 400 gross tons and above, to carry approved shipboard oil pollution emergency plans. These regulations
would also require foreign oil tankers of 150 gross tons and above and other foreign ships of 400 gross tons and above,
to carry evidence of compliance with Regulation 26 when in the navigable waters of the United States. This proposal
would implement the requirements of Regulation 26 of Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of
Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978, as amended (MARPOL 73/78). The purpose of Regulation
26 is to improve response capabilities and minimize the environmental impact of oil discharges from ships.

Drafting Information



The principal person involved in drafting this document is Ms. Jacqueline L. Sullivan, Project Counsel and Project
Manager.



Background and Purpose



MARPOL 73/78



The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (33 U.S.C. 1901 

et seq.

) (the Act) authorizes the Coast Guard to administer and enforce Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention
of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978, as amended (MARPOL 73/78). Annex I of MARPOL 73/78
is entitled ``Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Oil'' and is designed to prevent the discharge of oil
into the marine environment. MARPOL 73/78 defines oil as petroleum in any form, including crude oil, fuel oil, sludge,
oil refuse and refined products; it does not include animal or vegetable based oil or noxious liquid substances.



Regulation 26



The Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted Regulation
26 of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 at its 31st session in July 1991. Regulation 26 requires every oil tanker of 150 gross tons
and above and every other ship of 400 gross tons and above to carry on board a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan
approved by its flag state. This requirement entered into force for party states, including the United States, on
April 4, 1993, for new ships and enters into force on April 4, 1995, for existing ships.

The 32nd session of IMO in March 1992 adopted a set of guidelines (Resolution MEPC.54(32)) with more specific information
for the preparation of shipboard oil pollution emergency plans. The guidelines are intended to assist parties to
Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 in developing regulations for domestic implementation of Regulation 26, and are the basis
of this proposal.



Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans

<DOCNO> FR940217-1-00124 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940217-1-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Regulation 26 requires that plans be prepared according to the guidelines developed by IMO and written in the working
language of the ship's master and officers. Plans must consist at least of_

(1) The procedure to be followed by the master or other persons having charge of the ship to report an oil pollution incident,
as required in article 8 and Protocol I of MARPOL 73/78;

(2) The list of authorities or persons to be contacted in the event of an oil pollution incident;

(3) A detailed description of the actions to be taken immediately by persons on board to reduce or control the discharge
of oil following the incident; and

(4) The procedures and point of contact on the ship for coordinating shipboard activities with national and local
authorities in responding to the pollution.

The Regulation 26 guidelines expand on the four mandatory provisions of Regulation 26, and also address the following
non-mandatory provisions: Plans and diagrams, ship-carried response equipment, public affairs, recordkeeping,
plan review, and plan testing.



Definitions



The proposed regulations would be inserted in part 151 of title 33 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which implements
other provisions of MARPOL 73/78. Most of the terms used in the proposal are currently defined in 33 CFR 151.05. Some
of the more important definitions are repeated here as an aid to understanding this proposal.



Ship

 means a vessel of any type whatsoever, operating in the marine environment. This includes hydrofoils, air-cushion
vehicles, submersibles, floating craft whether self-propelled or not, and fixed or floating drilling rigs and other
platforms.



Oceangoing

 ship means a ship that_

(1) Is operated under the authority of the United States and engages in international voyages;

(2) Is operated under the authority of the United States and is certificated for ocean service;

(3) Is operated under the authority of the United States and is certificated for coastwise service beyond 3 miles from
land;

(4) Is operated under the authority of the United States and operates at any time seaward of the outermost boundary
of the territorial sea of the United States as defined in 33 CFR 2.05; or

(5) Is operated under the authority of a country other than the United States.

The term ``oceangoing'' ship is used to apply MARPOL 73/78 requirements in 33 CFR parts 151 and 155, while the term ``seagoing''
ship is used in 33 CFR part 157. Both terms have been used to implement the Act, which applies Annexes I and II of MARPOL
73/78 only to ``seagoing'' vessels in 33 U.S.C. 1903. For the purposes of this proposed regulation, the two terms are
synonymous.

Oil tanker

 means a ship constructed or adapted primarily to carry oil in bulk in its cargo spaces and includes combination carriers
and any ``chemical tanker'' as defined in Annex II of MARPOL 73/78 when it is carrying a cargo or part cargo of oil in bulk.

The proposed regulations define the following terms:



New ship

 means a ship delivered on or after April 4, 1993.



Shipboard oil pollution emergency plan

 means a plan prepared, submitted, and maintained according to the provisions proposed in   151.26 through
151.28 of this NPRM for United States ships; or maintained according to the provisions proposed in  151.29(a)
of this NPRM for foreign ships operated under the authority of a country that is party to MARPOL 73/78 while in the navigable
waters of the United States.



Discussion of Proposed Amendments



The proposed regulations would apply to U.S. ships because the Act requires the Coast Guard to prescribe regulations
implementing shipboard oil pollution emergency plans for ships of U.S. registry or nationality, or operating under
the authority of the United States. In addition, the proposal would apply to Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODUs)
only when they are not engaged in their primary mode of operation. Any fixed or floating drill rigs, or other offshore
installations when engaged in the exploration, exploitation, or associated offshore processing of seabed mineral
resources, which have oil pollution emergency plans approved by another Federal or State agency will be considered
to be in compliance with Regulation 26.

Foreign ships operating in U.S. waters must also comply with Regulation 26. Ships of foreign countries that are party
to MARPOL 73/78 must have a plan approved by their flag state.

Although only 10 percent of the world's tonnage belongs to states not party to Annex I of MARPOL 73/78, 33 U.S.C. 1902(c)
requires that regulations be written to ensure that the ships of non-party states do not receive more favorable treatment
than vessels of parties to MARPOL 73/78. In accordance with 33 CFR 151.21, these ships must comply with MARPOL 73/78,
and carry evidence of such compliance issued by the government of a country that is party to MARPOL or by a recognized
classification society. The Coast Guard may review the shipboard oil pollution emergency plans of these ships.

Regulation 26 does not apply to warships; naval auxiliary ships; or other ships owned or operated by a country when
engaged in noncommercial service. In addition, the proposed regulation would exempt barges or other ships which
are so constructed or operated that no oil can be discharged from any portion thereof, intentionally or unintentionally,
including but not limited to, oil discharged as the result of the ships' casualties. This exemption is consistent
with similar exemptions from certain MARPOL Annex I based requirements under 33 CFR parts 151 and 155. See 33 CFR   151.17(d),
151.25(1), 155.350(c), and 155.370(e).

In accordance with 33 CFR 151.09, Canadian and U.S. ships operated exclusively on the Great Lakes or their connecting
and tributary waters, or exclusively on the internal waters of the U.S. are not required to comply with MARPOL 73/78.
This proposed regulations preserves the exclusion of ships operating exclusively in these waters. However, Canada
recently acceded in Annexes I and II of MARPOL 73/78 and may apply MARPOL 73/78 requirements to ships in Canadian waters.
Consequently, the Coast Guard is reconsidering whether Annexes I and II of MARPOL 73/78, including Regulation 26
provisions, should apply to ships operating in these waters. The Coast Guard solicits comments on the following questions
pertaining to ships operating exclusively on the Great Lakes of North America or their connecting and tributary waters:

1. What will be the economic impact of requiring these ships to prepare, submit, and maintain shipboard oil pollution
emergency plans?

2. Would an effective date of April 5, 1995, provide an owner of operator of a ship adequate time to prepare and submit
a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan?

3. What will be the economic impact of these regulations on ``small entities,'' under section 605(b) of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b))?

Comments are not limited to the above and are invited on any aspect of implementing Regulation 26 on the Great Lakes.

This proposal addresses only the four mandatory provisions of Regulation 26 that must be included in shipboard emergency
response plans: (1) An outline of procedures for reporting pollution incidents, (2) a list of authorities or persons
to be contacted in the event of an incident, (3) a detailed description of the actions to be taken immediately by persons
on board to reduce or control discharge of oil following an incident, and (4) a procedure for coordinating response
efforts with national and local authorities. The four mandatory provisions of Regulation 26 are the basic items necessary
for plans to serve as a tool for shipowners.

Proposed  151.26(b)(6)(ii)(A) of this NPRM would require each plan to include a separate appendix listing
agencies or officials of coastal state administrations responsible for receiving and processing incident reports.
The list issued by the MEPC as MEPC/Circ.267 may assist shipowners in complying with this provision. Although inclusion
of the MEPC list, or a similar successor list issued by IMO, is not mandated by the proposed regulation, its use would
be considered prime facie evidence of compliance with this requirement for enforcement purposes. If a shipowner
includes an alternate list in the plan, it should contain comparable information.

The non-mandatory provisions of the Regulation 26 guidelines provide guidance on additional information that could
be included in the shipboard oil pollution emergency plans, such as diagrams, response equipment, public affairs
practices, recordkeeping, regular plan review by the shipowner and exercising. The Coast Guard is soliciting comments
on whether plans should be required to address any or all of the non-mandatory provisions, particularly those addressing
response equipment, plan review, and plan testing.

This proposed regulation would require a shipowner to prepare and submit two English language copies of its plan to
the Captain of the Port (COTP) or Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI) at the ship's home port for review and
approval. The approval period for the plan is five years. When the approval period expires, the shipowner would be
required to resubmit the entire plan for review and reapproval. The proposed regulation would also require a shipowner
to review its plan annually and submit a letter to the COTP or OCMI at the ship's home port certifying that the review
has been completed.

Some of the provisions in this proposed regulation are similar to those of the vessel response plan (VRP) interim final
rule (IFR) (58 FR 7376; February 5, 1993) issued under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101-380).
The OPA 90 VRP IFR establishes requirements for tank vessels which include many of the non-mandatory provisions of
the Regulation 26 guidelines, in addition to many of the mandatory provisions. Like the VRP IFR, this proposed regulation
would require resubmission of shipboard oil pollution emergency plans every five years. However, differences between
this proposed regulation and the VRP IFR remain. Some of the more important differences include the following:

(1) This proposed regulation would apply to oil tankers of 150 gross tons and above and other ships of 400 gross tons
and above, while the VRP IFR requirements apply to all tank vessels which carry oil in bulk as cargo, regardless of size;

(2) This proposed regulation would require the creation and maintenance of a list of contacts in all regular ports
of call worldwide. The VRP IFR requires a complete geographic-specific listing of contacts and response resources
for U.S. ports only.

(3) This proposed regulation would require planning the response to all oil discharges, including the ship's fuel
oil, while the VRP IFR applies only to oil carried in bulk as cargo.

(4) This proposed regulation would require procedures and a point of contact on the ship for coordinating response
action with shore-based authorities. The VRP IFR generally requires more structured (formalized) arrangements
with response organizations in all U.S. ports of call, as well as a shore-based qualified individual to obligate funds
on the part of the shipowner or operator.

<TEXT>
 

Tank vessel owners or operators may find it helpful to refer to  155.1030 of the VRP IFR for additional requirements.
The VRP IFR allows for the submission of a vessel response plan which complies with both sets of response plan requirements.
This proposed regulation would require a combined shipboard oil pollution emergency plan and vessel response plan
to be submitted to Coast Guard Headquarters for review and approval. To facilitate compliance, the approval period
is the same for both plans.

For foreign flag tank vessels operating in U.S. waters, the OPA 90 VRP requirements may be considered a local requirement
under section 3.1 of the guidelines issued as Resolution MEPC.54(32), and may be included as an appendix to a Regulation
26 plan.

On March 5, 1993, the Coast Guard released Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC) No. 2-93 to provide
guidance to the affected community on compliance before Regulation 26 became effective for new ships on April 4, 1993.
The NVIC has no regulatory force; it simply provides guidance pending the issuance of regulations. The Coast Guard
also issued Change 1 to NVIC 2-93 on July 28, 1993, providing shipowners with the current list of national operational
contact points adopted by the MEPC.



Submission of Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans



Owners or operators of all U.S. Ships to which this regulation applies must prepare and submit two English language
copies of the shipboard oil pollution emergency plans to the appropriate Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP) or
Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI) for review and approval. Under Regulation 26, owners or operators of
new ships should have submitted plans by April 4, 1993. The term ``new ship'' means a ship that has been delivered on
or after April 4, 1993. For ships delivered after April 4, 1993, plans must be submitted at least 60 days before the owners
or operators intend to begin operations. Owners or operators of existing ships will be required to submit plans at
least 60 days prior to April 4, 1995, and must have an approved plan on board by April 4, 1995. The term ``existing ship''
is currently defined in  151.05 as ``a ship that is not a new ship.'' Therefore, for the purposes of this proposed
regulation, ``existing ship'' means a ship that has been delivered before April 4, 1993. Plans must be resubmitted
every five years for review and approval.

Owners or operators of tank vessels that must comply with OPA 90 VRP requirements may meet the requirements of Regulation
26 by submitting one response plan, pursuant to  155.1030, if the plan addresses the following Regulation 26
requirements in addition to the OPA 90 requirements: (1) Discharges of all oils defined under Annex I of MARPOL 73/78,
whether carried as cargo or as fuel; (2) contacts for all coastal state and regular ports of call worldwide; and (3)
the procedures and point of contact on the ship for coordinating shipboard action with national and local authorities
in combating the pollution. The letter of transmittal should clearly state that the plan is intended to comply with
the requirements of both Regulation 26 and OPA 90. Combined Regulation 26 and OPA 90 VRP plans must be submitted to the
Coast Guard at the following address: Commandant (G-MEP-6), U.S. Coast Guard, 2100 Second Street SW.,
Washington, DC 20593-0001.



Regulatory Evaluation



This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under Section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It is not significant under the
``Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). A draft evaluation
has been prepared and is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under 

ADDRESSES.

 This evaluation is summarized below. This proposal will not result in annual costs of $100 million or more; will have
no significant adverse effects on competition, employment, or other aspects of the economy, and will not result in
a major increase in costs and prices.

The Coast Guard estimates that 1,534 U.S. flag ships must comply with Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78. The Coast
Guard assumes that 1,234 existing non-tank vessels will prepare Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans to meet
the requirements of Regulation 26. In addition, the Coast Guard assumes that 284 existing tank vessels will prepare
and submit combined Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans and OPA 90 Vessel Response Plans. The Coast Guard estimates
that 16 ships will be constructed in the U.S. between April 4, 1993 and April 4, 1995. Therefore, the total number of
ships which must comply with this regulation will equal 1,534.

Based on hourly cost data of those required to comply with Regulation 26, it is estimated to cost $4,320.00 to prepare
a Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plan. It is estimated to cost $855.00 to prepare the additional requirements
of a VRP that complies with MARPOL Regulation 26. The total annualized cost to respondents for initial plan preparation
between 1993 and 1995 is estimated to be $5,642,820. The Coast Guard will review submitted Shipboard Oil Pollution
Emergency Plans to ensure compliance with Regulation 26. Total government annualized costs associated with review
of the Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans are estimated to be $78,663 between 1993 and 1995. The net present value
of the costs of the proposed regulation, discounted at 7 percent, is $4,675,060.

The dollar value of direct societal benefits derived from the proposed rule are not quantifiable, but may be substantial.
Historical data is insufficient to quantify benefits. However, this program should improve response capabilities
and minimize the environmental impact of oil discharges from ships. If efficiencies in the cleanup of spilled oil
go up by only a small percentage, the savings that would accrue to the maritime industry and to the public would exceed
the costs.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).

The Coast Guard expects that few new cost will be associated with this rule because few small entities own ships of the
gross tonnage to which this proposed regulation would apply. Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal,
the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews each proposed rule that contains a collection of information
requirement to determine whether the practical value of the information is worth the burden imposed by its collection.
Collection of information requirements include reporting, recordkeeping, notification, and other, similar requirements.

This proposal contains collection of information requirements in the following sections: 151.26, 151.27, and 151.28.
The following particulars apply:



DOT No.: 

2115.


OMB Control No.

: 2115-XXXX.


Administration:

 U.S. Coast Guard.


Title:

 Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans.


Need for Information:

 This proposed regulation would direct shipowners to prepare, submit, and maintain shipboard oil pollution emergency
plans.



Proposed Use of Information:

 The Coast Guard will review submitted plans to ensure compliance with Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78. The
information contained in the plans will improve the capabilities of individual vessel operators to respond to oil
spills and will enhance cooperative response efforts of the vessel operators and the government agencies. Also,
Coast Guard issuance of a vessel's International Oil Pollution Prevention (IOPP) Certificate evidencing compliance
with Regulation 26 will facilitate the oceangoing trade of U.S. vessels with foreign countries that are parties to
MARPOL 73/78.



Frequency of Response:

 Plans must be resubmitted every 5 years for review and approval. However, if there are any revisions or amendments
requiring approval, the plan must be resubmitted as appropriate. In addition, a letter certifying that the annual
review has been completed must be submitted annually.

.



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and
has determined that it does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2B.2 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This
proposal is expected to contribute to the reduction of the occurrence of ship-generated oil spills in the marine environment.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection of copying where indicated under


ADDRESSES.

societies to acquire such information. Nothing in this section shall be construed as creating a requirement for damage
stability plans or calculations beyond those required by law or regulation; and 

(C) Lightening procedures to be followed in cases of extensive structural damage. The plan must contain information
on procedures to be followed for ship-to-ship transfer of cargo. Reference may be made in the plan to existing company
guides. A copy of such company procedures for ship-to-ship transfer operations must be kept in the plan. The plan must
address the coordination of this activity with the coastal or port state, as appropriate. 

(5) 

National and local coordination. 

This section of the plan must contain information to assist the master in initiating action by the coastal State, local
government, or other involved parties. This information must include guidance to assist the master with organizing
a response to the incident should a response not be organized by the shore authorities. Detailed information for specific
areas may be included as appendices to the plan. 

(6)

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard proposes to expand the boundaries of the safety zone for the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP). A deepwater
port safety zone constitutes an area within which the erection of structures or mobile drilling operations for the
exploration for or extraction of oil or gas is prohibited. An expanded safety zone would enlarge the approach to the
terminal portion of the safety zone and provide more unobstructed maneuvering room for vessels arriving and departing
from LOOP. This would reduce the risk of a marine casualty and subsequent pollution.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Request for Comments



The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views,
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this rulemaking (CGD
93-080), and give the reason for each comment. The Coast Guard requests that all comments and attachments be
submitted in an unbound format suitable for copying and electronic filing. If not practical, a second copy of any bound
materials is requested. Persons wanting acknowledgment of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed
postcard or envelope.

The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. It may change this proposal in view
of the comments. The Coast Guard encourages individuals or organizations that commented on the notice of petition
for rulemaking to submit comments on this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).

Federal Register.



Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant Commander Walter (Bud) Hunt, Project Manager,
and Jacqueline Sullivan, Project Counsel, Oil Pollution Act (OPA 90) Staff, (G-MS-1).



Background and Purpose



The Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (33 U.S.C. 1501 

et seq.

) requires the Secretary of Transportation to designate a zone of appropriate size around and including any deepwater
port for the purpose of navigational safety and to protect the marine environment. This responsibility was delegated
to the Coast Guard in 49 CFR 1.46(s). A deepwater port safety zone is designed to promote safety of life and property,
marine environmental protection and navigational safety at any deepwater port and adjacent waters. No installations,
structures, or uses that are incompatible with port operations are permitted in a deepwater safety zone. 33 CFR part
150 establishes the geographic boundaries of the safety zone for the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) in Annex A
and provides for the modification of safety zone boundaries as experience is gained in deepwater port operations.
Changes in a safety zone at a deepwater port are subject to notification and consideration of the views of interested
parties.

On December 29, 1980, the Coast Guard established a safety zone to protect three single-point moorings at the Louisiana
Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) (45 FR 85644). The rulemaking was considered ``nonsignificant'' under existing Department
of Transportation (DOT) and Coast Guard regulatory guidelines. On May 13, 1982, the Coast Guard established a safety
fairway to provide unobstructed approach for vessels transmitting to the LOOP safety zone (47 FR 20580).

On January 16, 1984, LOOP submitted to the Coast Guard a request for a waiver of the requirements of 33 CFR 150.337(a)
which prohibits a tanker from entering or departing a safety zone by other than a designated safety fairway. LOOP submitted
to the Coast Guard chart 11359 and indicated two uncharted areas adjacent to the safety zone which they referred to
as excursion zones. LOOP requested that vessels calling at the deepwater port be provided with additional maneuvering
room by allowing use of these excursion zones when departing or entering the LOOP safety zone. Deviations from the
safety fairway into these zones came to be known as ``excursions.'' On February 20, 1987, the Coast Guard granted for
1 year a waiver of the requirements that tankers enter and leave the safety zone by the safety fairway. LOOP was required
to document the number of tanker maneuverings requiring transit outside the existing safety zone, the percentage
of excursions which occurred within the two uncharted areas identified as excursion zones, and the date, time, and
approximate track line used for each excursion. Since then, the Coast Guard has renewed the waiver on an annual basis.

On December 30, 1987, LOOP asked the Coast Guard to make the waiver permanent. On February 8, 1988, the request was denied
on the grounds that future exploration for or extraction of oil or gas might occur within one or both excursion zones.
If such activity took place, the Coast Guard might have to revoke the waiver for the sake of safety.

In May 1988, CONOCO, Inc. (CONOCO) was issued an oil and gas lease by the Department of the Interior's Minerals Management
Service (MMS) under the Outer Continental Shelf and Lands Act (OCSLA) (43 U.S.C. 1331 

et seq.

) in the area that was in the uncharted existing excursion zone. The lease included a provision for the government to
suspend or cancel the lease with compensation when provided by the OCSLA. In August 1990, LOOP notified the Coast Guard
that CONOCO intended to drill under authority of Lease OCS-G 9678 within Grand Isle Block 59, approximately
500 yards outside of the existing safety zone and safety fairway and inside the uncharted southerly excursion zone.
The Coast Guard is concerned that a vessel casualty could result in a catastrophic pollution incident if a vessel collided
with a drilling platform located in the existing excursion area. However, neither MMS policy nor budget provided
for repurchasing a lease. While MMS supports the Coast Guard's interest in minimizing the risk of a catastrophic pollution
incident at LOOP, it contends that CONOCO has a legal right of access to explore for and produce oil or gas from the lease.

On January 21, 1992, the Coast Guard published a notice of petition for rulemaking and request for comments in the 

Federal Register

 announcing a request by LOOP that the Coast Guard expand the safety zone that surrounds the deepwater port (57 FR 2236).
LOOP requested the Coast Guard to make the waiver permanent thereby enlarging the safety zone by adding the two excursion
zones, and prohibiting structures. The proposed safety zone would broaden the entrance to LOOP and prohibit the erection
of structures or mobile drilling operations. As a result, the enlarged safety zone would reduce the number of required
vessel maneuverings, eliminate structures from the zone, possibly reducing the risk of accidents and subsequent
pollution. The proposed safety zone reflects actual tanker activity at LOOP based on detailed records the Coast Guard
has required LOOP to maintain.

The Coast Guard received 48 comments in response to the notice of petition for rulemaking. Forty-three responses,
mostly from mooring masters and shipping companies, offered strong support for the safety zone expansion. Opposition
to the proposal came from CONOCO, MMS, and three oil exploration companies. MMS suggested that if CONOCO or other lessees
are denied access to potential oil and gas resources, restitution should be provided by either LOOP or the Coast Guard.
Neither the Coast Guard nor the DOT is prepared to provide restitution to CONOCO for loss of potential revenues or costs
already incurred in conjunction with oil or gas exploration.

To resolve the conflicting use problems in the excursion zones, LOOP has agreed to purchase from CONOCO the oil and
gas leases for Grand Isle Blocks 53, 58, 59, and 65. LOOP would then relinquish these blocks to MMS. LOOP would not seek
further expansion of the safety zone or oppose any exploration and production activity outside or adjacent to the
expanded safety zone.

On November 2, 1993, in a letter to the Department of Transportation, the MMS stated that it supports the agreement
between CONOCO and LOOP. MMS stated that it is prepared to prohibit surface occupancy of offshore oil and gas facilities
in the proposed safety zone. However, MMS stated that it may be economically and technically feasible to develop the
resources lying beneath the safety zone by directional drilling. MMS would not preclude subseabed access provided
that any surface facilities are located outside the safety zone. Such subseabed activity within the safety zone would
not interfere with vessel activity in the safety zone.

Under the Deepwater Port Act of 1974, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1509(d)(1)), the Secretary of Transportation is required
to consult with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary
of Commerce prior to issuing the safety zone around any deepwater port for the purposes of navigational safety. The
Coast Guard has informed the noted Departments of the proposed safety zone.



Discussion of Proposed Amendment



Appendix A, Annex A, section (a) of 33 CFR part 150 is amended to expand the boundaries of the deepwater port safety zone
at LOOP. This is being done at the request of LOOP, Inc. to enlarge the approach to the terminal portion and provide more
maneuvering area for tank vessels arriving or departing from the deepwater port. It does not amend the Areas to be Avoided
or the Anchorage Area listed in sections (b) and (c), respectively, in Annex A to Appendix A of 33 CFR part 150.



Regulatory Assessment



This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(F)(1) of Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735;
October 4, 1993) and it does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that
Order. It is not a significant regulation under the ``Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures''
(44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979).

The Coast Guard expects the economic consequences of this rulemaking to be minimal. Potential economic effects include
impacts on mineral extraction and the commercial fishing industry. The proposed expansion is relatively insignificant,
comprising an approximate 15 percent increase in the size of the safety zone.

When the original safety zone was established, it was not expected that there would be significant interference with
mineral extraction or navigation. Due to the relative size of the expansion, no impacts on mineral extraction or navigation
are expected in this case either. Access is available via alternative methods such as directional drilling.

The economic consequences of the proposed rulemaking are expected to primarily impact commercial vessels, including
commercial fishing vessels. Commercial fishing vessels are permitted restricted use of portions of the safety zone
as provided in 33 CFR Table 150.345(a). Therefore, the impact on fishing activities would be negligible due to the
small additional area involved. No opposition to the notice of petition for rulemaking was received from the commercial
fishing industry.

In addition, this proposed rulemaking will result in permanent safety benefits. Providing additional maneuvering
area minimizes the likelihood of a catastrophic pollution incident resulting from a vessel colliding with any portion
of the LOOP facility. Therefore, it is expected that expansion of the safety zone will reduce the environmental hazard.

Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposed safety zone will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small business concerns
under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). The small entities affected by this proposed rule are commercial
fishing activities at the deepwater port. Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard
certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposed safety zone will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This proposed rule does not require the collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501,


et seq.

).



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not have federalism implications and does not warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment. LOOP is located beyond State waters where only Federal jurisdiction applies.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2(c)
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposed rule is categorically excluded from further environmental
documentation. This rule will not result in significant impact on the quality of the human environment, as defined
by the National Environmental Policy Act. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection
or copying where indicated under 

ADDRESSES.

Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard proposes to amend the uninspected vessel regulations by requiring an emergency position indicating
radio beacon (EPIRB) on certain uninspected passenger vessels and uninspected vessels engaged as vessel assistance
towing vessels. The proposed EPIRB requirement would apply to these vessels operating more than 3 nautical miles
from the coastline or more than 4.8 Km (3 statute miles) from the coastline of the Great Lakes. However, under specific
circumstances, these vessels would be exempt from this proposed EPIRB requirement. The Coast Guard also proposes
requiring visual distress signals on all uninspected vessels, not presently required to carry them, when operating
in coastal waters.


The ``EPIRB's on Uninspected Vessels Requirements Act'' amended the shipping laws of the United States by requiring
uninspected commercial vessels to carry alerting and locating devices, including EPIRBs, as prescribed by regulations.
By implementing this law, the regulations will provide improved search and rescue assistance during emergency situations,
thereby reducing the potential for the loss of life and property.

Regulatory History



On April 19, 1990, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled ``Emergency Position
Indicating Radio Beacons for Uninspected Vessels; (CGD 87-016a) in the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 14922). The Coast Guard received 125 letters commenting on the NPRM. A public hearing was not requested and one
was not held.

On March 10, 1993, the Coast Guard published a final rule requiring EPIRBs on certain uninspected vessels, excluding
uninspected passenger vessels and vessel assistance towing vessels (58 FR 13364). The preamble of that final rule
sated that an additional supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) would propose new EPIRB regulations
and visual distress signal requirements for uninspected vessels not presently required to carry them. Uninspected
passenger vessels are those vessels carrying 6 or less passengers for hire and are commonly known as ``charterboats.''




Background and Purpose



Public Law 100-540, known as the ``EPIRB's On Uninspected Vessels Requirements Act'' (102 Stat. 2719, October
28, 1988), amended 46 U.S.C. 4102 by requiring uninspected commercial vessels operating on the high seas and on the
Great Lakes 4.8 Km (3 statute miles) from the coastline and beyond to carry alerting and locating equipment, including
EPIRBs, as prescribed by regulation. Consistent with this law, this SNPRM proposes EPIRB requirements for uninspected
passenger vessels and vessel assistance towing vessels, and proposes the carriage of visual distress signals for
certain uninspected vessels not currently required to carry them. In response to the comments received to the NPRM
of April 19, 1990 suggesting that EPIRBs were not needed on uninspected passenger vessels and vessel assistance towing
vessels, the Coast Guard conducted a detailed study of the available casualty record for uninspected passenger vessels.
A copy of this study entitled ``Uninspected Passenger Vessel Casualties'' is available for review and copying in
the docket at the location identified in the 

ADDRESSES

 section near the beginning of this notice.



Discussion of Comments



In response to the NPRM of April 19, 1990, the Coast Guard received comments from charterboat operators, interested
parties from the Great Lakes, various charterboat associations on the Great Lakes, New England charterboat captains,
New England Charterboat associations, and charterboat captains in Florida. Additional comments were received
from a publication serving the charterboat industry, and an association representing charterboat operators. The
Coast Guard also received comments from the Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM), the National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), a maritime hull and cargo surveyors corporation, and from interested parties
that did not identify their affiliation.

Some comments supported the rule as written, expressing the view that safety of charterboat operations and their
passengers would be greatly increased and would reduce search and rescue costs. Other comments from charterboat
interests expressed opposition to the proposed rule. The primary objections to the proposed requirement were: (1)
The price of the EPIR and the ability of the EPIRB to operate in the marine environment; (2) the actual need for the EPIRB;
and (3) the type of EPIRB.

(1) 

The price of the EPIRB and the ability of the EPIRB to operate in the marine environment:

 The cost of the 406 MHz Satellite EPIRB has been dropping steadily since its introduction. The current advertised
price of Satellite EPIRBs averages around $1350. This is one-half the estimated cost used in the NPRM dated April 19,
1990, and confirms the prediction stated in the NPRM that prices would fall. The Coast Guard expects that the cost of
the EPIRBs will continue to fall as a result of the combination of bulk purchase orders through associations and marketplace
response to keener competition.
The Coast Guard recognizes that exposure to the marine environment can be extremely detrimental, especially to electronic
equipment. With this in mind, the Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM) developed a standard for
the manufacture of the 406 MHz Satellite EPIRB. This standard incorporates rigorous environmental tests that include
long term exposure to salt, fog, and extreme vibrations. These tests were developed to ensure that the 406 MHz Satellite
EPIRB will provide successful service throughout its expected life. The Federal Communications Center requires
U.S. type accepted 406 MHz satellite EPIRBs to meet the RTCM standards.
(2) 

The actual need for an EPIRB:

 In response to the comments that EPIRBs were not needed on uninspected passenger vessels and vessel assistance towing
vessels, the Coast Guard conducted a detailed study of the available casualty record for uninspected passenger vessels.
A copy of this study entitled ``Uninspected Passenger Vessel Casualties'' is available for review and copying in
the docket at the location identified in the 

ADDRESSES

 section near the beginning of this notice.
The casualty study revealed that although there are a significant number of accidents involving charterboats with
deaths resulting, only a few lives would have been saved if these vessels were required to carry EPIRBs. This is because
help usually came in one of two ways. One source of assistance has come from other nearby vessels which saw that a vessel
was in distress. The other frequent means of obtaining assistance came from the use of a radio, used either to summon
the Coast Guard or a nearby vessel.
The Coast Guard disagrees that EPIRBs are not needed on uninspected passenger vessels and vessel assistance towing
vessels. However, as a result of the study, the Coast Guard believes that the uninspected passenger vessels in need
of EPIRBs are primarily those that operate: (1) At night; (2) out of sight of other vessels; or (3) out of radio range
to call for assistance.
(3) 

The type of EPIRB:

 The comments to the NPRM suggested allowing the carriage of a Category 2, 406 MHz Satellite EPIRB for a boat manufactured
under the level flotation requirements of 33 CFR Part 183. The comment expressed an opinion that the construction
of a vessel with level flotation defeats the design operation of the Category 1 EPIRB. The Coast Guard is proposing
to adopt the recommendation made in these comments.
The Category 1, 406 MHz Satellite EPIRB is a fully automatic, float-free device. It is mounted on the outside of a vessel
in a manner so that if a vessel sinks quickly, or unexpectedly, the device will float free, activate, and alert authorities
of the distress. The Category 2 406 MHz Satellite EPIRB is manually operated, manually launched, and depends upon
a person on the vessel to launch the device. 

'The Coast Guard requirement for level flotation construction in 33 CFR Part 183 applies only to recreational
vessels 6.06 meters (20 ft) in length and under. When a vessel of greater than 6.06 meters (20 ft) in length is manufactured
with enough flotation material to keep the boat afloat, this must be substantiated by a certification by the manufacturer
that the construction of the vessel includes inherently buoyant material which will prevent the vessel from sinking.


Discussion of Proposed Amendments


Due to information obtained from the casualty study and comments received from the NPRM, the Coast Guard reconsidered
the EPIRB proposals for uninspected passenger vessels and vessel assistance towing vessels. The uninspected passenger
vessels that are affected by this proposed rule are mostly charterboats. These boats typically make day fishing trips
with six or fewer paying passengers on board.
The statutory language requires manned uninspected vessels to carry an EPIRB. The legislative history clearly indicates
that Congress intended the EPIRB requirement to apply to manned uninspected vessels including tug boats, towing
vessels, offshore supply vessels, oceanographic research vessels, and passenger vessels carrying 6 or less passengers.
Consistent with the legislative history, the Coast Guard believes that applying the EPIRB requirement to manned
barges is unnecessary since these vessels can not operate without the assistance of another vessel required to carry
an EPIRB. Therefore, the Coast Guard proposes that this rule apply to self-propelled uninspected vessels.
The proposed rules would make 406 MHz satellite EPIRBs generally required on uninspected passenger vessels and vessel
assistance towing vessels operating more than 3 nautical miles from the coastline or more than 4.8 km (3 statute miles)
from the coastline of the Great Lakes, subject to the exceptions discussed below. These are the same areas in which
EPIRBs are required on other uninspected commercial vessels. However, the Coast Guard believes that virtually all
uninspected passenger vessels operating on these waters are charterboats, and that the proposed exemption conditions
would probably exempt most charterboats from the EPIRB requirement.

<TEXT>
 

An uninspected vessel and vessel assistance towing vessel would be exempt from the rule between one hour before sunrise
and one hour before sunset if the vessel: (1) Operates between 3 and 20 miles from shore and is equipped with an operable
VHF radio capable of transmitting and receiving on channels 6, 13, 16, and 22A and operates within the VHF radio range
of at least 1 VHF coast station (same as sea area A1 as defined in 47 CFR 80.1069) or (2) When operating more than 20 miles
from shore the vessel must be ``in company'' with at least one other vessel at all times and the vessels are equipped
with an operable VHF radio capable of transmitting and receiving on channels 6, 13, 16, and 22A.

The Coast Guard's proposal for a one hour before sunrise to one hour before sunset exemption criterion is intended
to incorporate, in principle, the recommendation from the charterboat operators to exempt vessels on voyages of
less than 12 hours duration. The proposed rule would allow day trips to get underway before sunrise. If trouble developed
early in a trip, search and rescue operations would still be able to take place in daylight. The proposed rule would
also require boats without EPIRBs to be within 3 nautical miles of shore (4.8 Km/3 statute miles on the Great Lakes)
at least one hour before sunset.

The Coast Guard is proposing to define the term ``in company'' to mean 2 or more vessels operating together in the same
area, remaining within visual and VHF radio contact, by predetermined agreement prior to getting underway, for the
purpose of ensuring mutual safety.

The condition to have a VHF radio and operate within range of a coast station recognizes the importance radio plays
in summoning assistance from the Coast Guard or other vessels. The specified channels are those most likely to be needed
in a search and rescue operation. However, in an accident involving a sudden capsizing or sinking, or one that quickly
results in a loss of power, an operator who chooses to comply with the regulation by carrying a VHF radio may still be
unable to summon help if out of sight of other vessels.

One way of dealing with a possible rapid loss of a vessel's power is to require an emergency battery that is not part of
the vessel's main power system. The Coast Guard is specifically interested in receiving comments addressing a requirement
that to be eligible for the EPIRB exemption, uninspected passenger vessels be required to have a VHF radio that can
be operated using an emergency battery that is not part of the vessel's main power system. Comments are invited on the
practicality of such an arrangement and whether this should be an additional condition of the final rule. If the battery-powered
operation is considered feasible, should a minimum operating period be specified?

Additionally, the Coast Guard is considering requiring uninspected vessels and vessel assistance towing vessels
that operate beyond 20 nautical miles from shore to have a 406 MHz satellite EPIRB. The Coast Guard specifically requests
comments on the practicality of such an arrangement and whether this should be an additional condition of the final
rule.

This notice also proposes requiring all uninspected commercial vessels to carry the same visual distress signals
now required to be carried on commercial fishing vessels in 46 CFR 28.145. For vessels operating in coastal waters
within 3 miles of the coastline, the requirements would be the same as the visual distress signals now required on recreational
boats in 33 CFR part 175 subchapter C. Vessels operating beyond 3 miles from the coastline would be required to have
brighter and longer-burning flares.

The casualty study shows that being seen by another vessel is a primary way in which assistance is obtained. Flares
and other visual distress signals are recognized by mariners as signals indicating that assistance is required,
so they play an important role where rescue depends on visual detection. The Coast Guard believes that most uninspected
passenger vessels and vessel assistance towing vessels already carry visual distress signals since those signals
are now required whenever such a vessel is operated as a recreational boat in coastal waters. These flares can be bought
for about $20. Therefore, the cost of this requirement would be minimal.

As proposed in this SNPRM, all vessels less than 11 meters (36 feet) in length and vessels of any length with positive
flotation could meet the EPIRB requirement by carrying either an installed Category 1 406 MHz Satellite EPIRB or a
readily accessible Category 2 (manual) 406 Satellite EPIRB mounted at or near the principal steering station of the
vessel. For purposes of this regulation, length is defined as the length listed on a vessel's Certificate of Documentation
or Certificate of Number.



Regulatory Evaluation



This proposal is not significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under the Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). A draft Regulatory Evaluation
is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under 

ADDRESSES

.

The specific number of vessels that would be affected by a regulation requiring EPIRBs on uninspected passenger vessels
and assistance towing vessels is difficult to determine. The largest group of these vessels are charterboats, most
of which make day fishing trips, but some are involved in overnight trips. Others operate as dive boats, excursion
boats, parasail boats, vessel towing assistance vessels, water taxis, and other services. Those over five net tons
are documented by the Coast Guard, and major accidents involving these vessels are required to be reported to the Coast
Guard. Smaller boats are state numbered, are difficult to distinguish from recreational boats, and are often not
captured in the Coast Guard's data on commercial vessels.

<PARENT> FR940217-1-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Furthermore, the number of uninspected passenger vessels is constantly changing since a boat used as a charterboat
one day may be used for the owner's recreational purposes on another day. When operating as a charterboat, the boat
comes under the regulations for uninspected commercial vessels in 46 CFR subchapter C. When used strictly for recreational
purposes with no paying passengers on board, the boat comes under the regulations in 33 CFR subchapter S.

Although there are about 65,000 persons licensed to operate uninspected passenger vessels in the U.S., the Coast
Guard believes that less than half of these licensed persons are actively employed as vessel operators. This proposed
rule would only apply to those vessels that operate more than 3 nautical miles from the coastline or more than 3 statutory
miles from the coastline of the Great Lakes. Consistent with a comment received to the NPRM, the Coast Guard believes
that approximately 12,000 charterboats would be affected by this proposed rule.

EPIRB regulations would only affect those vessels operating more than 3 nautical miles from the coastline or more
than 4.8 Km (3 statute miles) from the coastline of the Great Lakes. Therefore, if half of the uninspected vessels operate
in rivers, inland lakes, bays, or sounds, or within 4.8 Km (3 statute miles) of the coastline of the Great Lakes, about
15,000 uninspected passenger vessels would remain as being potentially affected by an EPIRB rule under the authority
in 46 U.S.C. 4102(e).

This number is fairly consistent with an estimate by the association of charterboat operators in one of its letters,
that 12,000 charterboats would be affected by the rules proposed in the NPRM. Coast Guard used the association's 12,000
vessel estimate in assessing the potential effects of the rules proposed in this notice.

The draft evaluation uses a cost estimate of $1350 for Category 1 406 MHz Satellite EPIRBs, and $1150 for Category 2
406 MHz Satellite EPIRBS. A set of visual distress signals would cost most vessels about $20. The draft Evaluation
estimates that about 1200 charterboats would not qualify for the EPIRB carriage exemption, and would have to purchase
a 406 MGz Satellite EPIRB. It also estimates that another 1200 vessels would have to purchase VHF-FM marine radios
at $400 each in order to qualify for the EPIRB exemption within Sea Area A1. In addition, an estimated 8500 uninspected
vessels would be required to carry visual distress signals for the first time. The estimated present value cost of
the proposed regulations to the industry, is about $3 million over 10 years. The number of lives that may be saved through
mandatory EPIRB and visual distress signal requirements cannot be accurately predicted. However, economic research
indicates that $2.5 million per statistical life saved is a reasonable estimate of people's willingness to pay for
safety. The saving of only two lives in ten years would justify the cost of these rules.

In addition to the saving of lives, primary benefits of the regulations include more timely notification to the authorities
that a casualty has occurred and more accurate identification of the object of the search and the search area, which
should contribute to large savings of money for the Coast Guard and other organizations involved in a search. This
rule, in effect, shifts some of the cost burden for search and rescue from the Coast Guard to owners and operators of
uninspected vessels. Many unsuccessful searches for overdue vessels have cost millions of dollars before being
abandoned. In contrast, a number of searches for pleasure, charter, and fishing vessels have been expedited by EPIRBs
carried voluntarily. The savings to the government as a result of elimination or significant reduction of only three
or four large-scale searches would justify the cost of these rules, even without considering the lives that may be
saved by more timely location of vessels in distress.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632).

<DOCNO> FR940217-1-00143 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940217-1-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Generally, uninspected vessel operators are considered to be small entities. They are typically not part of large
diversified corporations, and generally own no more than one or two vessels. When compared to the potential cost associated
with the loss of a vessel and/or human life or lives, and in comparison to the cost of most associated equipment necessary
to properly and safely operate most of these vessels, the Coast Guard believes the cost of an $1150 to $1350 EPIRB is
not considered significant.

Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If, however, you think that your business qualifies as
a small entity and that this proposal will have a significant economic impact on your business, please submit a comment

) explaining why you think your business qualifies and in what way and to what degree this proposal will economically
affect your business.



Collection of Information



This proposed rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

).



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612, and determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism assessment. This notice proposes amending the regulations for uninspected commercial vessels,
by requiring certain vessels to carry EPIRBs and visual distress signals. The proposed rule would apply to certain
vessels operating in coastal waters, on the high seas, and on the Great Lakes. Since this rule affects specific vessels
both inside and outside of state waters, the Coast Guard intends to preempt State action addressing the same subject
matter.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under section 2.B.2 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This
proposal is made to enhance the safety of personnel at sea, as well as improving the effectiveness of search and rescue,
and is expected to have no environmental impact. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket
for examination and copying where indicated under 

ADDRESSES

.
