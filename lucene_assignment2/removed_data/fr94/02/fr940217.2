<DOCTITLE>Chrome-Plated Lug Nuts From Taiwan</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of preliminary results of antidumping duty administrative review and partial termination.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In response to a request by a petitioner, the Department of Commerce has conducted an administrative review of the
antidumping duty order on chrome-plated lug nuts from Taiwan. The review covers four firms and the period April 18,
1991, through August 31, 1992. The review indicates the existence of margins for the firms.



As a result of this review, we preliminarily determine to assess antidumping duties equal to the difference between
United States price and foreign market value.

Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.

Scope of the Review



The merchandise covered by this review is one-piece and two-piece chrome-plated lug nuts, finished or unfinished,
which are more than 11/16 inches (17.45 millimeters) in height and which have a hexagonal (hex) size of at least 3/4
inches (19.05 millimeters). The term ``unfinished'' refers to unplated and/or unassembled chrome-plated lug nuts.
The subject merchandise is used for securing wheels to cars, vans, trucks, utility vehicles, and trailers. Zinc-plated
lug nuts, finished or unfinished, and stainless-steel capped lug nuts are not in the scope of this review. Chrome-plated
lock nuts are also not in the scope of this review.

During the POR, chrome-plated lug nuts were provided for under subheading 7318.16.00.00 of the Harmonized Tariff
Schedule (HTS). Although the HTS subheading is provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written description
of the scope of this review is dispositive.



Best Information Available



Based on information gathered while on verification, the Department determined that the data submitted by Gourmet
for this review are unverifiable because the response Gourmet submitted was based on an ``in-house'' accounting
system that could not be reconciled to an audited financial statement.

Reliance on the accounting system used for the preparation of the audited financial statements is a key and vital part
of the Department's determination that a company's constructed value data are credible. An ``in-house'' system
which has not been audited and is not used for the preparation of the financial statements or for any purpose other than
internal deliberations of the company does not assure the Department that such costs have been stated in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, or that all costs have been appropriately captured by the ``in-house''
system (see Final Determination at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain
Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products and Certain Cut-To-Length Carbon Steel Plate from Korea, 58 FR 37186 (July
9, 1993)). Since Gourmet's ``in-house'' system cannot be relied upon due to numerous deficiencies (see Use of BIA,
and Middleman dumping allegation memo to Holly Kuga, Director, Office of Antidumping Compliance), the Department
has determined to apply BIA to Gourmet's sales in the POR, pursuant to Section 776(c) of the Tariff Act.

Chu Fong and San Chien both failed to respond to the Department's questionnaire. Accordingly, we are applying BIA
to their entries.

In deciding what to use as BIA, the Department's regulations provide that the Department may take into account whether
a party refuses to provide requested information (19 CFR 353.37(b)). Thus, the Department may determine, on a case-by-case
basis, what constitutes BIA. For the purposes of these preliminary results, we applied the following two tiers of
BIA where we were unable to use a company's response for purposes of determining a dumping margin (see Final Results
of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review of Antifriction Bearings and Parts Thereof from France, et al., 58 FR 39739,
July 26, 1993):




1. When a company refuses to cooperate with the Department or otherwise significantly impedes these proceedings,
we used as BIA the higher of (1) the highest of the rates found for any firm for the same class or kind of merchandise in
the same country of origin in the less than fair value investigation (LTFV) or prior administrative reviews: or (2)
the highest rate found in this review for any firm for the same class or kind of merchandise in the same country of origin.

2. When a company substantially cooperates with our requests for information and, substantially cooperates in verification,
but fails to provide the information requested in a timely manner or in the form required or was unable to substantiate
it, we used as BIA the higher of (1) the highest rate ever applicable to the firm for the same class or kind of merchandise
from either the LTFV investigation or a prior administrative review or if the firm has never before been investigated
or reviewed, the all others rate from the LTFV investigation; or (2) the highest calculated rate in this review for
the class or kind of merchandise for any firm from the same country of origin.




Therefore, for parties refusing to respond, Chu Fong and San Chien, the first-tier BIA rate we applied in these preliminary
results is 10.67 percent, which is the highest rate the Department found in the original LTFV investigation, Gourmet
provided us with responses to our questionnaires, however the information on the record was unverifiable. Accordingly,
we applied the second-tier BIA rate of 6.47 percent. This rate represents the highest rate ever applicable to Gourmet.

King Kong Corporation received the ``all other'' rate because the Department attempted, but could not locate, an
address for it.



Preliminary Results of Review



We have preliminarily determined that the following margins exist for the period April 18, 1991, through August 31,
1992:






The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
Upon completion of this review, the Department will issue appraisement instructions concerning all respondents
directly to the U.S. Customs Service.

Furthrmore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise,
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this
administrative review, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed
firms will be those firms' established in the final results of this administrative review; (2) for previously reviewed
or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published
for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, or the original LTFV investigation,
but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer
of the merchandise; and (4) the ``all others'' rate will remain at 6.93 percent as established in the LTFV investigation.


 On May 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade, in 

Floral Trade Council

 v. 

United States,

 Slip Op. 93-79, and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company

 v. 

United States,

 Slip Op. 93-83, decided that once an ``all other'' rate is established for a company,it can only be changed through
an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate
to apply the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical
errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders for the purposes of establishing
cash deposit in all current and future administrative reviews. The ``all others'' rate in the LTFV investigation
was 6.93 percent. 

 These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review. 

 Interested parties may request disclosure within five days of the date of publication of this notice, and a hearing
within 10 days of the date of publication. Any hearing requested will be held as early as convenient for parties but
not later than 44 days after date of publication, or the first workday thereafter. Case briefs, or other written comments,
from interested parties may be submitted not later than 30 days after the date of publication of this notice. Rebuttal
briefs and rebuttal comments, limited to issues raised in the case briefs, may be filed not later than 37 days after
the date of publication. The Department will publish the final results of review, including its results of its analysis
of issues raised in any such written comments. 

 This notice serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 

 This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

Issuance of modification 

#

2 to scientific research permit No. 747 (P45H).





On August 8, 1991 (56 FR 40312), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) issued Permit No. 747 under the authority
of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (U.S.C. 1531-1543) and the NMFS regulations governing endangered
fish and wildlife (50 CFR parts 217-227). On March 3, 1993 (58 FR 14202) NMFS issued an emergency modification
to Permit No. 747, to be valid through December 31, 1993. On November 26, 1993 (58 FR 62328) notification was published
that FWS has applied for a modification which would authorize them to continue the activities authorized in the March
3, 1993 emergency modification for the duration of the permit. Notice is hereby given that on January 26, 1994, NMFS
issued Modification 

#

2 to Permit 747, authorizing the above request.
Permit 747 authorizes scientific research on and captive propagation of Sacramento River winter-run chinook (

Oncorhynchus tshawytscha

), including the capture of up to 20 adults per year for broodstock purposes, the incubations of up to 35,000 of their
eggs, and the rearing of the resulting juveniles for release into the upper Sacramento River. These activities are
permitted through December 31, 1995.
The emergency modification, and this modification, authorize the permittee to collect and sacrifice up to 450 coded-wire
tagged and adipose fin clipped juvenile winter-run chinook salmon released from the FWS's Coleman National Fish
Hatchery. The emergency modification was only valid through December 31, 1993. This modification will authorize
this take annually for the duration of the permit, through December 31, 1995.
Issuance of this modification was based on a finding that such modification: (1) Was applied for in good faith; (2)
will not operate to the disadvantage of the listed species which is the subject of this modification; (3) is consistent
with the purposes and policies set forth in section 2 of the ESA. This modification was also issued in accordance with
and is subject to parts 217-227 of title 50 CFR, NMFS regulations governing endangered species permits and modifications.
The application, permit, modifications and supporting documentation are available for review by interested persons
in the following offices (by appointment):
Office of Protected Resources, National Marine Fisheries Service, NOAA, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring,
MD 20910 (301-713-2232); and

This application modification is to request incidental harassment of sea turtles, and additional species of marine
mammals which have only occasionally been observed in Hawaiian waters. As described in the original permit application,
permission is requested to incidentally harass marine mammals and sea turtles by a low frequency (70 Hz) sound source
which will be located north of Haena, off the northern coast of Kauai, Hawaii, at a depth of 850-950m. This sound
source is part of the Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) program, and will be operated from February 1994
through December 1995, with a maximum duty cycle of 8%, to conduct research on the effects of this source on marine mammals
and sea turtles. The transmission bandwidth is 20 Hz with a level of 195 dB (re: 1 uPa at 1m), and the spectrum level for
the peak frequency (70 Hz) is 
182 dB. The effects of these transmissions on marine mammals and sea turtles will be monitored through passive acoustic
tracking of Mysticetes, shore-based visual observations of marine mammals, and aerial observations and surveys
of marine mammals and sea turtles.

<USBUREAU>Department of the Navy</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for Disposal and </DOCTITLE>
Reuse of the Naval Radio Transmitting Facility, Suffolk, VA




Pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as implemented by the Council on Environmental
Quality Regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), the Department of the Navy announces its intent to prepare an
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate the environmental effects of disposal and reuse of the Naval Radio
Transmitting Facility (NRTF) Driver, Suffolk, Virginia. This disposal is being conducted in accordance with the
Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990.

Closure of NRTF Driver was recommended by the 1993 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission to eliminate redundancy
in geographic coverage in naval telecommunications. The recommendations became effective in September 1993. The
proposed action to be evaluated in the EIS involves the disposal of land, buildings, and infrastructure of NRTF Driver
for subsequent reuse.

The Navy intends to analyze the environmental effects of the disposal of NRTF Driver based on the reasonably foreseeable
reuse of the property, taking into account uses to be identified by the City of Suffolk Reuse Planning Group. The property
will likely be developed for mixed uses, including recreation, housing, and light industry. In coordination with
the City of Suffolk's reuse plan, other federal agencies may offer uses for the property. The EIS will evaluate alternative
reuse concepts of the property, including the ``no-action'' alternative, which would be retention of the property
by the Navy in caretaker status. However, because of the process mandated by the Base Closure and Realignment Act,
selection of the ``no-action'' alternative would be considered impracticable for the Navy to implement.

The EIS will evaluate impacts of reuse of NRTF Driver on the natural environment including wetlands and wildlife habitat,
as well as the socioeconomic environment, which includes potential impacts to population, housing, and schools.
The Navy will conduct a cultural resource survey to determine whether any sensitive archaeological resources exist
within the property. Additionally, the Navy is conducting an Environmental Baseline Survey to determine if any areas
of environmental contamination exist.

The Navy will initiate a scoping process for the purpose of determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying
the significant environmental issues related to disposal and reuse of the property. The Navy will hold a public scoping
meeting on March 3, 1994, beginning at 7 p.m., at the John Yeates Middle School, located on 4901 Bennett Pasture Road,
Suffolk, Virginia. This meeting also will be advertised in local newspapers.

A brief presentation will precede request for public comments. The Navy and the City of Suffolk will provide a brief
introduction and description of the proposed action. Navy representatives will be available to receive comments
from the public regarding issues of concern to the public. It is important that federal, state, and local agencies
and interested individuals take this opportunity to identify environmental concerns that should be addressed during
the preparation of the EIS. In the interest of time, each speaker will be asked to limit his or her oral comments to 5 minutes.

Agencies and the public are also invited and encouraged to provide written comments in addition to, or in lieu of, oral
comments at the scoping meeting. To be most helpful, scoping comments should clearly describe specific issues or
topics that the commentor believes the EIS should address. The Navy will provide comment cards at the scoping meeting.
Prepared statements also will be accepted at the scoping meeting. Written statements and/or questions regarding
the scoping process should be mailed no later than March 18, 1994, to Commander, Atlantic Division, Naval Facilities
Engineering Command, 1510 Gilbert Street, Norfolk, Virginia 23511-2699.

<DOCTITLE>Naval Research Advisory Committee; Closed Meeting</DOCTITLE>



Pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App. 2), notice is hereby given that the
Naval Research Advisory Committee Panel on Littoral Warfare/Amphibious Warfare will meet on February 22, 23, 24,
and 25, 1994. The meeting will be held at the Applied Physics Laboratory, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.
The meeting will commence at 8:30 a.m. and terminate at 5:00 p.m. on each day. All sessions of the meeting will be closed
to the public.

The purpose of the meeting is to conduct Executive Sessions to write a briefing and report which provide the Department
of the Navy with (1) an assessment of the capabilities and readiness of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps to effectively
conduct littoral and amphibious warfare operations, and (2) recommendations for technological investments that
can improve performance while reducing risk to Marine and Naval forces. The agenda will consist of Executive Sessions
devoted to discussions of information received and drafting of the study briefing and report.

These discussions and resulting briefing and report will contain classified information that is specifically authorized
under criteria established by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense and are in fact
properly classified pursuant to such Executive order. The classified and non-classified matters to be discussed
are so inextricably intertwined as to preclude opening any portion of the meeting. Accordingly, the Secretary of
the Navy has determined in writing that the public interest requires that all sessions of the meeting be closed to the
public because they will be concerned with matters listed in section 552b(c)(1) of title 5, United States Code.

For further information concerning this meeting contact:
 Commander R. C. Lewis, USN, Office of the Chief of Naval Research, 800 North Quincy Street, Arlington, VA 22217-5000,

<DOCTITLE>Implementation Plan for the Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programmatic Environmental Impact
Statement </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Energy.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy announces the availability of the Implementation Plan for the Environmental Restoration
and Waste Management Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement. The purpose of the Implementation Plan is to
record the results of the public scoping and public participation processes and to serve as a plan for the preparation
of the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement. The Implementation Plan also states the alternatives and issues
to be evaluated in the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background 



On October 22, 1990, the Department of Energy issued a Notice of Intent in the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 42693) to prepare the Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programmatic Environmental Impact
Statement. In the Notice of Intent, the Department identified the proposed action of implementing an integrated
environmental restoration and waste management program, and requested comments on the scope of the Programmatic
Environmental Impact Statement. A public comment period was held from October 22, 1990, to February 19, 1991. Beginning
on December 3, 1990, the Department held 23 scoping meetings at various locations across the country to provide an
opportunity for public participation by interested individuals and organizations, and other governmental agencies.
During the public comment period, over 1,200 parties provided approximately 7,000 comments, either by participating
in the meetings or by submitting materials and letters to the Department. 

On February 4, 1992, the Department announced in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 4193) the availability of a Draft Implementation Plan and an additional opportunity for public review and comment.
The public comment period on the Draft Implementation Plan was held from February 4, 1992, to April 10, 1992. Beginning
on March 17, 1992, the Department conducted six regional workshops on the Draft Implementation Plan. More than 1,000
comments were received on the Draft Implementation Plan. 

After the close of the Draft Implementation Plan comment period, the Department revised the Plan and provided it to
the Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Advisory Committee for review and comment. The Committee is
composed of individuals from universities, trade associations, state and local governments, Indian Nations, labor
unions, environmental groups, and other interested parties. On December 21, 1992, the Committee submitted its formal
recommendations on the Draft Implementation Plan. After responding to the Committee's recommendations and discussing
further revisions with the Committee, the Department further revised the Implementation Plan. The Implementation
Plan now considers all the issues from the public scoping process, the public review and comment period on the Draft
Implementation Plan, and the Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Advisory Committee's review and recommendations.




Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Alternatives 



The programmatic alternatives for environmental restoration to be evaluated in the Programmatic Environmental
Impact Statement are structured in terms of the factors that affect the selection of remediation goals. In addition
to a No Action baseline alternative, four other alternatives will be evaluated: (1) An alternative reflecting the
current application of ``applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements'' under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; (2) an alternative emphasizing foreseeable land use to better define
likely exposure scenarios and appropriate waste management strategies; (3) an alternative equally balancing remedial
worker and transportation risks with the risk to a site's surrounding population; and (4) an alternative emphasizing
foreseeable land use to establish initial remediation objectives while also emphasizing worker and transport risks.
Evaluation of these five alternatives is intended to provide input into the development of Department of Energy policies
relevant to undertaking future environmental restoration that would incorporate consideration of land use and
all major elements of human health risks.

The programmatic alternatives for waste management to be evaluated in the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement
are structured in terms of configurations for each of six waste types: High-level radioactive waste; transuranic
radioactive waste; low-level radioactive waste; low-level mixed waste (waste consisting of hazardous and radioactive
components); commercial Greater-than-Class-C radioactive waste, and hazardous waste. In addition to a No Action
baseline, which includes only existing or approved waste management facilities, alternative configurations for
each waste type will be evaluated that reflect decentralized, regionalized, and centralized approaches for utilizing
existing and new waste management facilities at Department of Energy sites. The waste management facilities for
which alternative configurations will be evaluated are storage facilities for treated high-level waste and commercial
Greater-than-Class-C waste pending repository disposal; storage facilities for transuranic waste and treatment
facilities in the event that treatment of transuranic waste is required prior to disposal; and treatment, storage,
and disposal facilities for low-level, low-level mixed, and hazardous wastes. The evaluation of alternative configurations
for waste management facilities is intended to provide environmental input for decisions on the potential consolidation
of existing waste management facilities and locating new or expanded waste management facilities at Department
of Energy installations. The evaluation of alternative configurations for the treatment of low-level mixed wastes
also will provide environmental input for site-specific plans required by the Federal Facility Compliance Act.




Technology Development and Other Issues 



The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement will discuss emerging technologies and their effect on the analysis
of alternatives. Several other issues that are important to achieving cleanup and waste management goals and to the
implementation of the Department's Environmental Restoration and Waste Management program also will be discussed.
Issues to be addressed include budgeting and prioritization, job retraining programs, stakeholder roles, waste
minimization, and public involvement. Discussion of these issues is included to assist public understanding of
the decisions to be reached, and to provide the opportunity for public input on improving the conduct of the Department's
Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Program. The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement will
not evaluate site-specific actions at Department sites that would be covered by appropriate project-level National
Environmental Policy Act documentation. 



Spent Nuclear Fuel 



The Department had proposed to consider the storage of Department-owned spent nuclear fuel in the scope of the Programmatic
Environmental Impact Statement. On September 3, 1993, however, the Department announced that it would incorporate
the planned programmatic analysis of spent nuclear fuel into the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Environmental
Restoration and Waste Management Environmental Impact Statement to comply with a recent order issued by the U.S.
District Court for the District of Idaho. The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement will contain a summary
of the spent fuel analysis and will incorporate the results of that analysis into the Programmatic Environmental
Impact Statement's evaluation of cumulative environmental consequences. 



Availability of Implementation Plan 



Copies of the Implementation Plan have been sent to individuals and interested agencies and organizations who indicated
an interest in receiving a copy, and a copy of the Implementation Plan's Executive Summary has been provided to individuals,
agencies, and organizations that participated in the public scoping and workshop processes. The full Implementation
Plan will be provided to any additional interested parties upon request. Copies of the Implementation Plan also have

<SIGNJOB>
Acting Departmental Representative to the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board.


The Honorable John T. Conway,


Chairman, 

Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, 625 Indiana Avenue NW., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20004


Dear Mr. Conway: The Department of Energy fully accepts Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Recommendation
93-6, Maintaining Access to Nuclear Weapons Expertise.
The Department shares your concern of ensuring capability to safely conduct nuclear weapons testing operations
at the Nevada Test Site and to safely dismantle nuclear weapons at the Pantex Site. To meet this challenge, the Department
must identify and maintain access to the critical skills of nuclear weapons scientists, engineers, and technicians.
Where access to skills in the future is uncertain, the Department must find ways to capture knowledge, so safe dismantlement
procedures can be developed and utilized and safe testing operations can be conducted.
The forthcoming Implementation Plan for Recommendation 93-6 will capitalize on activities that have already
been initiated and provide a structured approach for ensuring the continued safe conduct of operations at Pantex
and the Nevada Test Site.



 Sincerely,

</SIGNJOB>
<SIGNER>
Hazel R. O'Leary.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On May 26, 1993, Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O'Leary announced her intention to establish a Contract Reform Team,
chaired by the Deputy Secretary, to review the Department's contracting mechanisms and practices. The Contract
Reform Team was charged with a review of a broad range of contracting issues, including the management and operation
of DOE weapons production facilities and national laboratories, support service contracting, and environmental
restoration activities, consistent with the Department's changing mission. 


The Contract Reform Team conducted a thorough analysis of the Department's contracting practices and provided a
list of specific recommendations to the Secretary regarding administrative, financial, and regulatory improvements
that are intended to increase contractor accountability, enhance competition, provide appropriate incentives
for contractors to meet and exceed performance criteria and achieve cost savings, and improve contract administration
and financial accountability. 
The Department is strongly committed to the President's and Vice President's efforts to reinvent Government and
recognizes that reforming DOE's contracting practices is critical to our success. This Report represents a major
step forward in the Secretary's efforts to reform the Department's contracting practices. The recommendations
are intended to create a system that focuses on efficient processes and quality results, rewards initiative and commitment,
and provides meaningful sanctions and penalties where necessary. 
The Department is interested in the views of stakeholders within and outside the Department on the Report's recommendations.
Following consideration of stakeholder views, the Department intends to proceed with the implementation phase
of its contract reform initiative.

agreement and for AER to abandon by sale to Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company (ALG) certain facilities in Marshall County,

AER states that its predecessor, Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company, and ONEOK's predecessor, Lone Star Gas Company,

to ONEOK in McClain County, Oklahoma and ONEOK redelivers the gas to AER in Marshall County, Oklahoma for delivery

that make the exchange between AER and ONEOK no longer necessary, it is stated. ALG would operate the lines and taps
as part of its rural distribution system in Oklahoma and continue to serve the Town of Kingston, Oklahoma, it is stated.


AER proposes to abandon by sale to ALG the exchange receipt facilities, consisting of a 2-inch tap and meter station,
and two 2-inch delivery taps and meter stations and approximately 9.4 miles of 3-inch pipeline, all located in Marshall
County, Oklahoma. AER and ONEOK also propose to abandon the exchange service under AER's Rate Schedule No. XE-45.
ONEOK asserts that it was not assigned a tariff or rate schedule when it accepted the assignment of service from Lone
Star. ONEOK is not proposing to abandon any facilities.

own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.

<USBUREAU>Office of Hearings and Appeals</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Issuance of Decisions and Orders During the Week of November 8 Through November 12, 1993 </DOCTITLE>




During the week of November 8 through November 12, 1993, the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with
respect to applications for other relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy.
The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.




Appeal 





The Gazette Newspapers, 11/9/93, LFA-0156 

 


The Gazette Newspapers filed an Appeal from a determination issued by the DOE Office of Naval Reactors (Naval Reactors)
in response to a request for information filed by the Gazette under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The Gazette
had requested certain radiological documents that were withheld by Naval Reactors as classified. In considering
the Appeal, the DOE found that Naval Reactors properly withheld the requested documents as classified under Executive
Order 12356. Accordingly, the Appeal was denied. 



Refund Applications 



Shell Oil Company/Brown Construction Company, 11/9/93, RR315-5 




The DOE issued a Decision and Order denying a Motion for Reconsideration filed in the Shell Oil Company special refund
proceeding by Resource Refunds, Inc. (RRI), on behalf of Brown Construction Company (Brown). The RRI Motion sought
reversal of a decision to deny the Brown Application for Refund in the Shell proceeding because the Application was
filed after the April 1, 1992 final filing deadline in this proceeding. RRI demonstrated that the late filing was the
result of it's own error and was not at all the fault of Brown. The DOE concluded that while RRI's error may have left it
responsible for the loss of Brown's potential refund, the agent's mishandling of the Brown's Application did not
justify reopening the Shell proceeding. Accordingly, the Motion for Reconsideration filed by RRI on behalf of Brown
was denied. 





Texaco Inc./Airport Texaco, 11/12/93, RF321-19277 




The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund filed by Mr. Ben Story in the Texaco Inc. special
refund proceeding on behalf of Airport Texaco, a service station located at 7770 Airport Boulevard in Mobile, Alabama.
In the Application, Mr. Story indicated that he owned and operated Airport Texaco from March 1978 through March 1984.
However, the DOE had previously granted an Application for Refund filed by John Locklier based upon purchases by the
service station during the period at the 7770 Airport Boulevard address. In support of his Application, Mr. Locklier
had provided Texaco invoices, accounting documents, cancelled checks, and copies of tax forms which established
that he operated Airport Texaco from February 1976 through December 1980. Mr. Story also provided a statement from
the State of Alabama Department of Revenue attesting to Mr. Story's payment of withholding tax, as reflected on W-2
forms, for the period from March 1978 through 1982. However, according to this statement, Mr. Story paid withholding
tax at Airport Texaco only in 1980 and 1981. Because W-2 forms are filed by employees and are based on their earnings,
the DOE determined that this evidence could not be taken as proof that Mr. Story was the owner and operator of Airport
Texaco. Mr. Story could produce no further documentation to substantiate his claim, and in the absence of a convincing
demonstration that he was the owner and operator of Airport Texaco during the refund period, his Application for Refund
was denied.

of section 746(a)(1), (previously section 781(a)(1), title VII of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended
by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, dated October 13, 1992. Comments are invited on
the proposed funding priorities stated below. 
Approximately $18.7 million will be available for this program in FY 1994. Total continuation support recommended
is $8.4 million. It is anticipated that $10.3 million will be available to support nine competing awards averaging
$1.14 million. 
The Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, makes the following amendments to this program.



(1) Period of Support 


The maximum period during which the AHEC programs may receive payments shall be 12 years, subject to annual approval
by the Secretary and the availability of appropriated funds. The maximum period during which an AHEC center developed
by a program may receive payments shall be 6 years. The provision for a 12-year maximum shall not be construed as establishing
a limitation on the number of awards under this authority that may be made to the school involved. 


(2) General Requirements 


As provided in section 746(b), a medical or osteopathic medical school may not receive an award for operational expenses
under the existing basic AHEC award authority unless the program: 
(a) Maintains preceptorship educational experiences for health science students; 
(b) Maintains community-based primary care residency programs or is affiliated with such programs; 
(c) Maintains continuing education programs for health professions or coordinates with such programs; 
(d) Maintains learning resource and dissemination systems for information identification and retrieval; 
(e) Has agreements with community-based organizations for the delivery of education and training in the health professions;

(f) Is involved in the training of health professionals (including nurses and allied health professionals), except
to the extent inconsistent with the law of the State in which the training is conducted; and 
(g) Carries out recruitment programs for the health science professions, or programs for health-career awareness,
among minority and other elementary or secondary students from the areas the program has determined to be medically
underserved; 


(3) Requirements for Participation of Other Health 
Professions Schools or Programs 


The former requirement that participating medical schools provide for the active participation of at least 2 schools
or programs of other health professions (including a school of dentistry if there is one affiliated with the medical
school's university) is modified to require also participation of a graduate program of mental health practice if
there is one affiliated with the university. 


(4) Requirement for Expenditure of at Least 75 Percent of Award in Centers 


The former requirement that at least 75 percent of the total funds provided to a school under any AHEC program authority
(basic AHEC programs, AHEC Special Initiatives or Model AHEC programs) be expended by the AHEC program in AHEC centers
has been amended, as provided in section 746(e)(1)(A) to require also that the school enter into an agreement with
each of such centers for purposes of specifying the allocation of the 75 percent of funds. 


(5) 

Alternative Matching Requirements for New AHEC Programs 
Developed Under Basic AHEC Authority 


As provided in section 746(e)(2), for an AHEC center developed as part of an AHEC program first funded under the basic
AHEC authority on or after October 13, 1992, the existing requirement that not more than 75 percent of total operating
funds be provided by the Federal Government (section 746(e)(1)(B)), is amended to establish a ceiling of 55 percent
of any fifth or sixth year of the development or operation of the center.

Previous Funding Experience 


Previous funding experience information is provided to assist potential applicants to make better informed decisions
regarding submission of an application for this program. 
In FY 1993, HRSA reviewed 17 applications for Cooperative Agreements for the Area Health Education Centers Program.
Of those applications, 58.9 percent were approved and 41.1 percent were disapproved. Eight projects, or 47 percent
of the applications received, were funded. 
In FY 1992, HRSA reviewed 11 applications. Of those applications, 73 percent were approved and 27 percent were disapproved.
Three projects or 27 percent of the applications received, were funded. 


Purpose 


Section 746(a)(1) of the PHS Act authorizes Federal assistance to schools of medicine and osteopathic medicine which
have cooperative arrangements with one or more public or nonprofit private area health education centers for the
planning, development and operation of area health education center programs. 


Eligibility 


To be eligible to receive support for an area health education center cooperative agreement, the applicant must be
a public or nonprofit private accredited school of medicine or osteopathic medicine or consortium of such schools,
or the parent institution on behalf of such school(s). 
Applicants may request up to 3 years of support with the expectation that AHECs planned and developed in years 1 and
2 would be fully operational no later than the 3rd year. The period of Federal support should not exceed 12 years for
an area health education center program and 6 years for an area health education center. 
The Health Professions Reauthorization Act of 1988, title VI of Public Law 100-607, amended the authority for
the area health education center program by: 
1. Providing for a waiver, under specified circumstances, of the provision now contained in section 746(a)(2)(C)
prohibiting an AHEC from being a school of medicine or osteopathic medicine, the parent institution of such a school,
or a branch campus or other subunit of a school of medicine or osteopathic medicine or its parent institution, or a consortium
of such entities. The waiver of this provision applies to an AHEC having, at the time of initial application, an operating
program supported by appropriations of a State legislature as well as local resources; 
2. Reducing the minimum number of individuals enrolled in first-year positions in a rotating osteopathic internship
or a medical residency training program in family medicine, general internal medicine, or general pediatrics from
six individuals to four; and 
3. Revising the requirement that each AHEC shall ``conduct interdisciplinary training and practice involving physicians
and other health personnel including, where practicable, physician assistants and nurse practitioners'' to add
``and nurse midwives.'' 
To receive support, programs must meet the requirements of the regulations as set forth in 42 CFR part 57, subpart MM.



Degree of Federal Involvement in the Planning, Development and Operation of Area Health Education Centers Program



The Bureau of Health Professions, within the Health Resources and Services Administration, has substantial programmatic
involvement in the planning, development, and administration of the AHEC projects by: 
1. Reviewing and approving plans upon which continuation of the cooperative agreement is contingent in order to permit
appropriate direction and redirection of activities;

2. Reviewing and approving all contracts and agreements among recipient medical or osteopathic schools, other health
professions schools and community-based centers; 


3. Participating with project staff in the development of funding projections; 


4. Developing, with project staff, individual project data collection systems and procedures; and 


5. Participating with project staff in the design of project evaluation protocols and methodologies. 




Matching Funds Requirement 




Section 746(e)(1)(B) of the Act requires that not more than 75 percent of total operating funds of a program in any year
shall be provided by the Federal Goverment. However, as provided in section 746(e)(2), for an AHEC center developed
as part of an AHEC program first funded under the basic AHEC authority on or after October 13, 1992, a ceiling of 55 percent
of any fifth or sixth year of the development or operation of a center is established. 




National Health Objectives for the Year 2000 




The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of Healthy People 2000, a PHS led national activity for setting priority areas. This program is related to the priority
area of Educational and Community-Based Programs. Potential applicants may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000
(Full Report; Stock No. 017-001-00474-0) or Healthy People 2000 (Summary Report; Stock No. 017-001-00473-1)
through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402-9325 (Telephone
202-783-3238). 



Education and Service Linkage 




As part of its long-range planning, HRSA will be targeting its efforts to strengthening linkages between U.S. Public
Health Service education programs and programs which provide comprehensive primary care services to the underserved.




Review Criteria 




The review of applications will take into consideration the following criteria: 


1. The degree to which the proposed project adequately 
provides for the program requirements set forth in 42 CFR 57.3804; 


2. The capability of the applicant to carry out the proposed project; and 


3. The extent of the need of the area to be served by the area health education centers. 



Other Considerations 




In addition, the following funding factors may be applied in determining funding of approved applications. 


1. Funding preference is defined as the funding of a specific category or group of applications ahead of other categories
or groups of approved applications, such as competing continuation projects ahead of new projects. 


2. Funding priority is defined as the favorable adjustment of aggregate review scores of individual approved applications
when applications meet specified criteria. 


It is not required that applicants request consideration for a funding factor. Applications which do not request
consideration for funding factors will be reviewed and given full consideration for funding. 



Established Funding Preferences for Fiscal Year 1994 




The following funding preference No. 1 was established in FY 1989 after public comment (at 54 FR 189) dated January
4, 1989. Funding Preference No. 2, was established in FY 1993, after public comment at 58 FR 12245, dated March 3, 1993.
These funding preferences are being extended in FY 1994. 


In making awards for fiscal year 1994, a funding preference will be given to: 


(1) Approved competing continuation applications under section 746(a)(1); and 


(2) Approved competing new applications under section 746 (a)(1) which propose to plan, develop and implement an
AHEC program in a State where there is no existing AHEC program. These applications will be funded after approved competing
continuation applications. 



Established Funding Priority for Fiscal Year 1994 




The following funding priority was established in FY 1989, after public comment at 54 FR 189, dated January 4, 1989,
and is being extended in FY 1994:

<DOCNO> FR940217-2-00052 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940217-2-00030 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A funding priority will be given to applications which demonstrate substantial clinical training (a student or resident
clerkship or preceptorship of 4 to 8 weeks) in sites that serve the medically underserved. 



Proposed Funding Priorities for FY 1994 




It is proposed that a funding priority be given to: 


1. Applicants which demonstrate an increase in the percentage of graduates who have entered a Primary Care (Family
Medicine, General Internal Medicine, General Pediatrics) Residency, for the most recent 3-year period. 


An overall goal of the AHEC Program is to utilize educational interventions to improve the geographic and specialty
distribution of primary care health personnel, and thereby increase access to health care to underserved populations.
The achievement of AHEC Program goals is enhanced by medical schools (allopathic and osteopathic) which can demonstrate
a commitment to increasing the number of students who select graduate training in a primary care specialty (family
medicine, general internal medicine, general pediatrics). Such a commitment can be demonstrated in the performance
and track record of the applicant medical schools, during a most recent 3-year period. In times of limited dollars,
it is reasonable to allocate funds to: (1) Training institutions that have primary care training goals that are consonant
with those of the Bureau of Health Professions and the AHEC Program; and (2) institutions that can demonstrate performance
in training an increasing number of medical students who upon graduation select a primary care career specialty.



2. Applicants which demonstrate an increase in the percentage of underrepresented minority graduates for the most
recent 3-year period. 


This funding priority is proposed to encourage the training of underrepresented minorities in an effort to increase
the number of underrepresented minorities who are accepted to medical school (allopathic or osteopathic) and complete
training. It is assumed that these individuals, following training, are most likely to provide much needed care in
medically underserved communities to predominantly minority populations. It is reasonable to provide limited
funds to institutions which demonstrate a commitment to increasing the number of underrepresented minorities who
graduate from medical school. Such commitment can be demonstrated in the performance and track record of the medical
school, during a most recent 3-year period. Current data indicate that the percentage of underrepresented minorities
attending and graduating from medical schools is not equal to the percentage of underrepresented minorities in the
United States. This priority will assist in addressing the needs of underserved minority populations. The term ``underrepresented
minorities'' means, with respect to a health profession, racial and ethnic populations that are underrepresented
in the health profession relative to the number of individuals who are members of the population involved. For this
program, it means American Indians or Alaskan Natives, Blacks, Hispanics, and, potentially, various subpopulations
of Asian individuals. Applicants must evidence that any particular subgroup of Asian individuals is underrepresented
in a specific discipline. 



Additional Information 




Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed funding priorities. All comments received on or before
March 21, 1994 will be considered before the final funding priorities are established. 


Written comments should be addressed to: Marc L. Rivo, M.D., M.P.H., Director, Division of Medicine, Bureau of Health

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The HRSA in collaboration with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announces the availability
of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for grants authorized under section 1910 of the PHS Act. These discretionary grants
will be made to States or accredited schools of medicine to support projects for the expansion and improvement of emergency
medical services for children (EMSC). Funds appropriated by Public Law 103-112 will be used for this purpose.
Under the EMSC program authority, awards are made for project periods of up to 2 years. 



The NHTSA participated with the HRSA in developing program priorities for the EMSC program for FY 1994. The NHTSA will
share the Federal monitoring responsibilities for EMSC awards made during FY 1994 and will continue to provide ongoing
technical assistance and consultation in regard to the required collaboration/linkages between applicants and
their Highway Safety Offices and Emergency Medical Services Agencies for the State(s). Grantees funded under this
program are expected to work collaboratively with the State trauma systems planning and development projects funded
by the Bureau of Health Resources Development, HRSA. 

The PHS is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000,
a PHS led national activity for setting priority areas. The EMSC grant program will directly address the Healthy People
2000 objectives related to emergency medical services and trauma systems linking prehospital, hospital, and rehabilitation
services in order to prevent trauma deaths and long-term disability. Potential applicants may obtain a copy of Healthy
People 2000 (Full Report: Stock No. 017-001-00474-0) or Healthy People 2000 (Summary Report: Stock

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Program Background and Objectives 



The Emergency Medical Services for Children statute (Section 1910 
of the PHS Act, as amended) establishes a program of two-year 
grants to States, through a State-designated agency, or to an 
accredited medical school within the State, for projects for the 
expansion and improvement of emergency medical services for 
children who need treatment for trauma or critical illness. For 
purposes of this grant program, the term ``State'' includes the 50 
States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 
the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American 
Samoa, the Republic of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall 
Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia. The term ``school 
of medicine'' is defined as having the same meaning as set forth in 
Section 799(1)(A) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 295p(1)(A)). 
``Accredited'' in this context has the same meaning as set forth in 
section 799(1)(E) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 295p(1)(E)). It is 
the intent of this grant program to stimulate further development 
or expansion of ongoing efforts in the States to reduce the 
problems of life-threatening pediatric trauma and critical 
illness. The Department does not intend to award grants which 
would duplicate grants previously funded under the Emergency 
Medical Services Systems Act of 1972 or which would be used simply 
to increase the availability of emergency medical services funds 
allotted to the State under the Preventive Health Services Block 
Grant. 



Funding Categories 



There will be four categories of competition for funding this 
year: State planning grants, State systems grants, targeted issue 
grants, and resource capacity grants. States may apply for only 
one of the first two categories, but are not restricted in 
applying for the last two categories. 



Category (1): State Planning Grants 



Planning grants are intended for States that have never received 
an EMSC grant and that are not at a stage of readiness to initiate 
a full-scale implementation project. States (or medical schools 
within those States) that have not received prior EMSC 
implementation grants are the only applicants eligible for this 
category. Planning grants are designed to enable a State to 
assess needs and develop a strategy to begin to address those 
needs. Funds may be used to hire staff to assist in the 
assessment of EMSC needs of the State; obtain technical assistance 
from national, State, regional or local resources; help formulate 
a State plan for the integration of EMSC services into the 
existing State EMS plan; and plan a more comprehensive grant 
proposal based upon a needs assessment performed during the 
planning grant project period. A comprehensive approach, 
addressing physical, psychological, and social aspects of EMSC 
along the continuum of care, should be reflected. An ongoing working relationship with Federal EMSC program staff
and resource 
center staff, beginning with the initiation of a planning grant 
application, is strongly encouraged. Budget requests in this 
category should not exceed $50,000, The project period is for one 
year only, with no renewal. Applications in this category are due 
earlier than other categories. The application deadline is 
March 25, 1994. 



Category (2): State Systems Grants 



This category of grants has two subcategories: implementation 
grants and system enhancement grants. Proposals for State systems 
grants may be framed within the context of the changing conditions 
of health care delivery anticipated under health care reform. 



Subcategory (A): implementation grants.

 Implementation grants will improve the capacity of a State's 
Emergency Medical Services program to address the particular needs 
of children. Implementation grants are used to assist States in 
integrating research-based knowledge and state-of-the-art systems 
development approaches into the existing State EMS/trauma systems 
using the experience and products of previous EMSC grantees. 
Grants of up to $250,000 per award for each twelve month budget 
period are anticipated. Project periods are up to two years. Up 
to five grants will be awarded. For this competition, we intend 
to fund applications from States (and medical schools within those 
States) that have not as yet received support, or that have 
received only partial support under this program as part of a 
regional alliance. This means that approved applications from 
States (and medical schools within those States) with no or very 
limited prior EMSC program support will be funded before approved 
applications from outside this group. Applications will not be 
accepted for both planning grants and implementation grants 
simultaneously from the same State.

Subcategory (B): system enhancement grants.

 System enhancement grants will fund activities that represent the 
next logical step or steps to take in institutionalizing EMSC 
activities within the State EMS system and achieving program goals 
outlined in this announcement and further elaborated in the 1993 
Institute of Medicine Report to Congress entitled Emergency 
Medical Services for Children. (A copy of the Executive Summary of 
this report will be enclosed with the application kit. The full 
report is available for $49.95 from National Academy Press, 2101 
Constitution Avenue, NW., Box 285, Washington, DC 20055.) For 
example, funding might be used to improve linkages between local 
and regional or State agencies, to develop pediatric standards for 
a region, or to assure effective field triage of the child in 
physical or emotional crisis to appropriate facilities and/or 
other resources. Activities implemented under prior EMSC program 
funding but not completed or made self-sustaining during the 
original implementation project period will not be considered 
suitable. States that have previously received EMSC funds may 
apply for a system enhancement grant, as long as they will not 
also be receiving implementation grant funds during the project 
period of the systems enhancement grant. Grants of up to $150,000 
are anticipated for the first year, with grants of up to $100,000 
for the second year. 




Category (3): Targeted Issues Grants 



The third funding category is that of targeted issues grants on 
topics of importance to EMSC. These grants are intended to 
address specific, focused issues related to the development of 
EMSC capacity, with the potential to serve as national or regional 
models. Proposals in this category must have a well conceived 
methodology to evaluate the impact of the activity. The Director 
of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) will judge the 
acceptability of projects proposed in this category. Prospective 
applicants are urged to contact EMSC program staff well in advance 
of submitting their formal applications, so that the work of 
proposal development can be avoided if the proposed project is 
judged to be inappropriate for submission in this category. 

Priorities for this category have been chosen from topics 
recommended by the 1993 Institute of Medicine Report on EMSC. 
Priorities and examples include: 




_Education and Training. For this priority, proposals 
are sought which develop or evaluate education or training geared 
to improving EMS providers' ability to address underdeveloped 
elements in EMSC. They may relate to particular areas of 
attention, such as the psychosocial aspects of EMSC, or to 
particular populations that are underserved or isolated. 
Proposals focusing on underserved or isolated populations of 
children might target the needs of Native Americans, Native 
Alaskans, or Native Hawaiians, adolescents, developmentally 
disabled, mentally ill, homeless, or children living in rural 
areas or inner cities. Educational programs might also be 
developed for particular groups, such as parents, volunteers, 
caretakers, teachers, firefighters, medical control or medical 
dispatch personnel. Assessment of the effectiveness of the 
training, using appropriate outcome measures, is a key objective 
for proposals in this category. Proposals are expected to 
incorporate existing materials whenever possible; however, 
innovations in media or instructional techniques are encouraged. 
Projects could include the conversion of previously developed 
teaching materials to interactive video format, the development of 
curricula or training exercises to promote improved EMS management 
of psychosocial crises, or the utilization of multidisciplinary 
seminars or study groups to enhance collaboration on pediatric 
emergency care between primary and specialty providers.

<TEXT>
 

_Data and Information System Management. For this 
priority, proposals are sought which reflect an understanding of 
the uses to which data are to be applied (e.g., patient care, 
quality assessment, resource allocation, research, etc.) and of 
the questions they are to answer. Projects should reflect 
familiarity with efforts of NHTSA, HRSA, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC), and the EMSC program to develop 
national uniform data sets, if appropriate to the proposed 
project. States are encouraged to develop EMS data systems which 
include all the elements of a national uniform data set and are 
capable of describing the nature of EMS provided to children. 
Demonstrations of linkage of data sources to provide an optimal 
picture of EMS furnished to children is one example of a proposed 
project under this priority; such proposals would be expected to 
show considerable familiarity with previous linkage efforts by the 
above organizations and others. Another example is the 
improvement of the quality of data that relate mechanisms of 
injury to assigned E-codes. 

_Communications. For this priority, proposals are 
sought which take advantage of new telecommunications technologies 
to improve EMS for children. Proposals could promote access to 
``911'' or ``enhanced 911'' emergency telephone systems. For example, 
projects might use the ``Make the Right Call'' campaign on a 
statewide basis, with modifications that include educating the 
public_including children_about when to access EMS services 
for children; such projects would be expected to incorporate a 
well conceived evaluation of the impact of such a campaign. 
Alternatively, proposals could promote the use of advanced 
technologies to improve care for children. For example, projects 
might use new technology to improve communications among health 
care facilities, linking hospitals, health care agencies and/or 
providers; or to educate various categories of providers by 
providing on-line pediatric medical control via new technology. 
Proposals are also sought which evaluate, describe, analyze, or 
improve the pattern of EMS communications, dispatcher protocols, 
or on-line medical control as they affect the care of children or 
in relationship to pediatric utilization of emergency medical 
services. This priority has been developed in cooperation with 
HRSA's Trauma Care Systems Planning and Development Program.
 
_Violence and Injury Prevention. For this priority, 
activities could include advocacy, education, training, or 
curriculum development, especially in the development of programs 
which expand the role of EMS personnel in prevention of injury, 
interpersonal violence, or youth-on-youth violence. Innovative 
strategies to link EMS personnel with law enforcement personnel, 
primary care providers, and community resources are sought. 
Examples are programs to reduce children's access to firearms or 
to educate children about the use of seatbelts or bicycle helmets. 
Further examples include the use of EMS personnel as 
trainer/educators, advocates, and organizers for community based 
violence prevention initiatives in schools and other settings 
serving youth, such as recreation centers, detention centers, or 
youth employment centers; or the use of EMS records to study the 
characteristics of violence or for education about the 
consequences of violence. Violence and injury prevention 
initiatives might also focus on enhancing preparation of EMS 
personnel for providing initial attention and arranging 
appropriate follow-up when there are violent, destructive, 
damaging, or hurtful behaviors, or when there are injury-risking 
behaviors, such as combined drinking and driving, substance abuse, 
or attempted suicide by intentional overdosing on drugs. 
_Psychosocial/Behavioral. Proposals are sought for this 
priority focusing on strategies to reduce the emotional toll of 
childhood emergencies on the child, family, and/or providers. 
Examples include development and evaluation of techniques to

Up to five grants will be awarded in Category (3), at least one in 
each priority area, if approved. States that have received EMSC 
funding as well as those that have never received EMSC funding may 
compete in this category. Grants for this activity of up to 
$150,000 per award for each twelve month budget period are 
anticipated. Project periods are up to two years. 



Category (4): Resource Capacity Cooperative Agreements 



Up to two resource centers will be supported through cooperative 
agreements under this funding category. One of these will include 
maintenance and distribution of EMSC products among its activities 
and will receive more funds than the other. Resource centers are 
intended to provide assistance to the public, professional groups, 
and grantees on issues of importance in developing an EMSC system. 
In addition to monitoring and technical assistance, Federal 
involvement will include the following: 




_Making available the services of experienced MCHB 
personnel as participants in the planning and development of all 
phases of the project. 
_Participation, as appropriate, in any conferences and 
meetings conducted during the period of the cooperative agreement. 
_Review, approval, and implementation of procedures to be 
established for accomplishing the scope of work. 
_Assistance and referral in the establishment of Federal 
interagency contacts that may be needed to carry out the project 
and assisting MCHB dissemination and program communication goals. 
_Participation in the dissemination of project products. 




If time permits, comments from the public will be accepted on the 
categories, priorities, and preferences described above. Any 
comments which members of the public wish to make should be 
submitted to: Chief, Grants Management Branch, at the address 
listed in the 

ADDRESSES 

section. 



Availability of Funds 



Approximately $7,500,000 is available for grants under the EMSC 
program, of which approximately $3,600,000 will be used for new 
grants. Of this total, the distribution of funds for new grants 
is anticipated to be as follows:

Special Concerns 



The MCHB places special emphasis on improving service delivery to children from culturally identifiable populations
who have been disproportionately affected by barriers to accessible care. This means that EMSC projects are expected
to serve and appropriately involve in project activities members of ethnoculturally distinct groups, unless there
are compelling programmatic or other justifications for not doing so. The MCHB's intent is to ensure that project
outcomes are of benefit to culturally distinct populations and to ensure that the broadest possible representation
of culturally distinct and historically underrepresented groups is supported through programs and projects sponsored
by the MCHB. This same special emphasis applies to improving service delivery to children with special health care
needs. 



Project Review and Funding 



The Department will review applications in the preceding funding categories as competing applications and will
fund those which, in the Department's view, are consistent with the statutory purpose of the program, with particular
attention to children from culturally distinct populations and children with special health care needs; and that
best meet the purposes of the EMSC program and address achievement of applicable Healthy People 2000 objectives related
to emergency medical services and trauma systems. 



Review Criteria 



The review of applications will take into consideration the following criteria: 



 For Category (1) State Planning Grants



_Evidence of the State's commitment to improve pediatric emergency care services and to continue with EMSC program
implementation. 

_The adequacy of the applicant's proposed method to identify problems and conduct a needs assessment.

Eligible Applicants 



Applications for funding will be accepted from States and 
accredited schools of medicine. Applications which involve more 
than a single State will also be accepted. In developing the 
proposed project, applicants must seek the participation and 
support of local or regional trauma centers and other interested 
entities within the State, such as local government and health and 
medical organizations in the private sector. If the applicant is 
a school of medicine, the application must be endorsed by the 
State. The State's endorsement must acknowledge that the 
applicant has consulted with the State and that the State has been 
assured that the applicant will work with the State on the 
proposed project. 

Any State (or medical school within that State) may apply for any 
category or subcategory of grant, subject to the following 
considerations based on equitable geographic distribution of EMSC 
funds, differences in purpose among EMSC grant categories, and 
variation among States in EMSC program progress: 

 For Category (1) Planning Grants, States (or medical schools 
within those States) that have received prior EMSC implementation 
grants may not apply for planning grants. 

 For Category (2)(A) Implementation Grants, applications from 
States (and medical schools within those States) that have not 
previously received EMSC program funds, or that have received only 
partial support under this program as part of a regional alliance, 
will receive preference for funding in this subcategory. This 
means that approved applications from States (and medical schools 
within those States) with no or very limited prior EMSC program 
support will be funded ahead of approved applications from outside 
this group. 

 For Category (2)(B) System Enhancement Grants, States (and 
medical schools within States) that have previously received EMSC 
funds may apply for a system enhancement grant, as long as they 
will not also be receiving implementation funds during the project 
period of the systems enhancement grant. States that have not 
previously received EMSC funds are advised to apply first for 
implementation category funds. 

 For Category (3) Targeted Issues Grants, eligibility is not 
affected by receipt of other EMSC funding. 

 For Category (4) Resource Capacity Cooperative Agreements, 
eligibility is not affected by receipt of other EMSC funding. 
Applications will not be considered for both Category (1) State 
Planning Grants and Category (2)(A) Implementation Grants 
simultaneously from the same State. Funding of an application for 
a planning grant or for either subcategory of State Systems Grant 
bars a State from future competitions for that category or 
subcategory. Although funding of a Category (3) Targeted Issue 
Grant does not preclude a State (or medical school) from applying 
for other categories of EMSC funding, applicants should taken care 
to avoid overlap in proposed project activities and associated 
Federal support for the separate categories. 



Allowable Costs 



The MCHB may support reasonable and necessary costs of EMSC 
Demonstration Grant projects within the scope of approved 
projects. Allowable costs may include salaries, equipment and 
supplies, travel, contracts, consultants, and others, as well as 
indirect costs as negotiated and certified. The MCHB adheres to 
administrative standards reflected in the Code of Federal 
Regulations, 45 CFR part 92 and 45 CFR part 74.

Public Health System Reporting Requirements 



This program is subject to the Public Health System Reporting 
Requirements (approved under OMB No. 0937-0195). Under these 
requirements, community-based nongovernmental applicants must 
prepare and submit a Public Health System Impact Statement 
(PHSIS). The PHSIS is intended to provide information to State 
and local health officials to keep them apprised of proposed 
health services grant applications submitted by community-based 
nongovernmental organizations within their jurisdictions. 
Community-based non-governmental applicants are required to submit 
the following information to the head of the appropriate State and 
local health agencies in the area(s) to be impacted no later than 
the Federal application receipt due date: 

(a) A copy of the face page of the application (SF 424). 

(b) A summary of the project (PHSIS), not to exceed one page, 
which provides: 

(1) A description of the population to be served. 

(2) A summary of the services to be provided. 

(3) A description of the coordination planned with the 
appropriate State or local health agencies. 



Executive Order 12372 




This program has been determined to be a program which is subject 
to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 concerning 
intergovernmental review of Federal programs by appropriate health 
planning agencies, as implemented by 45 CFR part 100. Executive 
Order 12372 allows States the option of setting up a system for 
reviewing applications from within their States for assistance 
under certain Federal programs. The application packages to be 
made available under this notice will contain a listing of States 
which have chosen to set up such a review system and will provide 
a single point of contact (SPOC) in the States for review. 
Applicants (other than federally-recognized Indian tribal 
governments) should contact their State SPOCs as early as possible 
to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any 
necessary instructions on the State process. For proposed 
projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to 
contact the SPOC of each affected State. The due date for State 
process recommendations is 60 days after the application deadline 
for new and competing awards. The granting agency does not 
guarantee to ``accommodate or explain'' for State process 
recommendations it receives after that date. (See part 148, 
Intergovernmental Review of PHS Programs under Executive Order 
12372 and 45 CFR part 100 for a description of the review process 
and requirements).

General Statutory Funding Preference 



As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_

(A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically
underserved communities; or 

(B) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase
in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above
the 20th percentile that have been recommended for approval by the peer review group. 



Proposed Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' 



``High rate'' means that 20 percent of the physician assistant program graduates in academic year 1991-92 or
academic year 1992-93, whichever is greater, are spending at least 50 percent of their work time in these settings.


``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1991-92 and 1992-93, the rate
of physician assistant program graduates in these settings has increased by at least 50 percent and that not less than
15 percent of the academic year 1992-93 graduates are working in these settings. 

Additional information concerning the implementation of this preference has been published in the 

Federal Register

 at 58 FR 40659, dated July 29, 1993. 

To allow new programs to compete more equitably in FY 1994, criteria for the statutory and the administrative funding
preferences have been developed to apply only to them. This criteria is provided in the application materials. 



Proposed Funding Preference for Fiscal Year 1994 



The following funding preference is proposed for FY 1994: 

A funding preference will be given to established physician assistant training programs which can demonstrate that
(a) More than 50 percent of their graduates in 1993 entered a generalist specialty (family medicine, general internal
medicine, general pediatrics); or (b) an average of 40 percent of graduates over the last 3 years (1991, 1992, and 1993)
entered a generalist specialty. 



Proposed Funding Priority for FY 1994 



The following priority is proposed for FY 1994: 

A funding priority will be given to approved applications that can demonstrate either substantial progress over
the last 3 years or a significant experience of 10 or more years in enrolling and graduating trainees from those minority
or low-income populations identified as at risk of poor health outcomes.

<DOCTITLE>Program Announcement and Proposed Funding Priorities for Special Project Grants to Schools of Public Health for
Fiscal Year 1994 </DOCTITLE>



The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces that applications will be accepted for fiscal
year (FY) 1994 Special Projects Grants to Schools of Public Health under the authority of section 762, title VII of
the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public
Law 102-408, dated October 13, 1992. Comments are invited on the proposed funding priorities. 

Approximately $2.4 million will be available in FY 1994 for this program to support 18 to 20 competing awards averaging
$120,000 to $133,000. 



Previous Funding Experience 



Previous funding experience information is provided to assist potential applicants to make better informed decisions
regarding submission of an application for this program. There were no competitive grant cycles in fiscal years 1992
and 1993. In FY 1991, HRSA reviewed 32 applications for this grant program. Of those applications, 53 percent were
approved and 47 percent disapproved. Seventeen grant projects, or 100 percent of the approved grant applications,
were funded. 



Purpose 



Section 762 of the Public Health Service Act (the Act), as amended, authorizes the Secretary to award grants to accredited
schools of public health for the costs of planning, developing, demonstrating, operating, and evaluating projects
that are in furtherance of the goals established by the Secretary for the year 2000 in the area of: (1) Preventive medicine;
(2) health promotion and disease prevention; (3) improving access to and quality of health services in medically
underserved communities; or (4) reducing the incidence of domestic violence. 

The period of initial Federal support will not exceed 3 years. 



Eligibility 



Eligible applicants for this program are accredited schools of public health. ``A school of public health'' means
a school as defined in section 799(1)(A) of the PHS Act which has been accredited by the Council on Education for Public
Health pursuant to section 799(1)(E) of the Act and which is located in a State as defined in section 799(9) of the Act.


Applicant schools must assure that the students of the school will, through participation in the project for which
the award is made, receive training in the activities carried out by the project. 

Section 762(e) of the PHS Act provides that the Secretary establish goals for projects under this authority and shall
require as a condition of the receipt of a Special Project Grant to Schools of Public Health that schools carry out activities
in furtherance of meeting the goals. Also the law provides that the Secretary establish and implement a methodology
for measuring the extent of progress that has been made toward the goals by schools receiving such a grant. A Report
to Congress describing the progress made by projects is due not later than February 1, 1994. The goals required by section
762(e) are currently in development and are expected to be available to be mailed with program application materials.




National Health Objectives for the Year 2000

Review Criteria 



The following review criteria were established in FY 1990 after public comment (55 FR 4482, dated 2/8/90) and the Administration
is again extending these criteria in FY 1994. 

The review of applications will take into consideration the following criteria: 




 The degree to which the proposed project adequately meets legislative intent; 

 The background and rationale for the proposed project; 

 Whether the project contains clearly stated realistic and achievable national or regional objectives which
are described in Healthy People 2000. 

 The extent to which the project contains a methodology which is integrated and compatible with project objectives,
including collaborative arrangements and feasible workplans; 

 Evaluation plans and procedures for program and trainees, if applicable; 

 The administrative and management capability of the applicant to carry out the proposed project, including
institutional infrastructure and resources; 

 The extent to which the budget justification is complete, cost-effective and includes cost-sharing, when
applicable; and 

 Whether there is an institutional plan and commitment for self-sufficiency when Federal support ends. 



Other Considerations 



In addition, the following funding factors may be applied in determining funding of approved applications. 

A funding preference is defined as the funding of a specific category or group of approved applications ahead of other
categories or groups of approved applications. 

A funding priority is defined as the favorable adjustment of aggregate review scores of individual approved applications
when applications meet specified criteria. 

It is not required that applicants request consideration for a funding factor. Applications which do not request
consideration for funding factors will be reviewed and given full consideration for funding. 



Statutory Preference 



In making awards of grants, preference will be given to qualified schools agreeing that the project for which the award
is made: (1) Will establish or strengthen field placements for students in public or nonprofit private health agencies
or organizations; and (2) will involve faculty members and students in collaborative projects to enhance public
health services to medically underserved communities. 



Proposed Funding Priorities 



It is proposed that a funding priority will be given to programs which demonstrate either substantial progress over
the last three years or a significant experience of ten or more years in enrolling and graduating trainees from those
minority or low-income populations identified as at risk of poor health outcomes. This priority is consistent with
a HRSA strategy to increase the number of minority health professionals, to assure equal access to health professions
education for all population groups, and ultimately, to provide a greater volume of health care in underserved areas.


It is also proposed that a funding priority be given for projects that address the program purpose of reducing the incidence
of domestic violence. The incidence of reported violence, especially domestic or family violence, has increased
significantly in recent decades. This proposed priority is intended to provide incentive to schools of public health
to take responsibility for helping to reduce domestic violence through the special projects grant program. 



Additional Information 



Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed funding priorities. The comment period is 30 days. All comments
received on or before March 21, 1994 will be considered before the final funding priorities are established. Written
comments should be addressed to: Neil Sampson, M.P.H., Director, Division of Associated, Dental, and Public Health
Professions, Bureau of Health Professions, Health Resources and Services Administration, Parklawn Building,
room 8-101, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857.

Availability of the Technical/Agency Draft Recovery Plan for the Pygmy Madtom for Review and Comment



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of document availability and public comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a draft recovery plan
for the pygmy madtom. This small catfish presently has a very fragmented distribution, but the species was probably
formerly much more widespread within the Tennessee River system. The pygmy madtom is currently known to inhabit only
two short river reaches within the Duck River, Humphreys County, Tennessee, and the Clinch River, Hancock County,
Tennessee. The species has been and continues to be impacted by water quality deterioration. This deterioration
occurred as a result of siltation (contributed by coal mining and poor land use practices), other water pollution,
and impoundments. The Service solicits review and comments from the public on this draft plan.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining
members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery
effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States.
Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish criteria for recognizing
the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost to implement the recovery measures
needed.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq

.) (Act), requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that a public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.

The primary species considered in this draft recovery plan is the pygmy madtom (

Noturus stanauli

). The area of emphasis for recovery actions is the Duck River, Humphreys County, Tennessee, and the Clinch River,
Hancock County, Tennessee. The protection of existing populations, habitat restoration, preservation of genetic
material, and public education are among the management actions outlined in the plan.



Public Comments Solicited



The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to approval of the plan.



Authority



The authority for this action is section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f).

 Notice of intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for a mining Plan of Operations (POO) for the Lone
Tree Mine project, Humboldt County, Nevada; and notice of scoping period and public meetings.

 



 
</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 Pursuant to section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and 43 CFR part 3809, the Bureau of
Land Management (BLM) will be directing the preparation of an EIS for the proposed expansion of a gold mine in Humboldt
County, Nevada. This EIS will be prepared by contract and funded by the proponent, Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation.
Public meetings will be held to identify issues to be addressed in the EIS, and to encourage public participation in
the review process. Representatives of the BLM and Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation will be summarizing the POO and
accepting comments from the audience. The BLM invites comments and suggestions on the scope of the analysis.



 </SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation of Albuquerque, New Mexico has submitted to the Winnemucca District Office of the
BLM, a POO for expansion of their existing gold mine, the Lone Tree Mine (LTM). The POO describes proposed expansion
of LTM mining operations in Humboldt County, approximately 34 miles east of Winnemucca, Nevada. A total of approximately
55 million tons of ore and 370 million tons of barren (nongold-bearing) rock may be excavated during the 15 year mine
life. Total surface disturbance for all mine facilities would be about 2251 acres. Existing key production facilities
would include the mine pits, barren rock piles, ore crushing, conveying, grinding, and oxidation circuits, heap
leach pads and solution ponds, gold extraction and refining equipment, and tailings disposal facilities. Nonprocessing
ancillary facilities to support the mining activities include administration, laboratory, warehouse, maintenance
shop buildings, fuel, oil, reagent and water storage facilities and other small structures required for operations.


 

This EIS will address the issues of geology, minerals, soils, water resources, vegetation, wildlife, grazing management,
air quality, aesthetic resources, cultural resources, paleontological resources, land use, access, recreation,
social and economic values related to expansion. 

 Federal, state, and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by
the BLM's decision on the POO are invited to participate in the scoping process. The Authorized Officer will respond
to public input and comment as part of the final EIS. The decision regarding the proposal will be recorded as a Record
of Decision, which is subject to appeal under 43 CFR part 4.

<DOCTITLE>Narrows Project, Utah; Draft Environmental Impact Statement</DOCTITLE>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability and notice of public hearings on draft environmental impact statement DEIS: INT-DES-94-07.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, the Department of the
Interior, Reclamation, has prepared a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) on the proposed Narrows Project.
The DEIS describes and presents the environmental effects of three alternatives, including no action, for a multiple-purpose
water development project that would provide water for irrigation and municipal use in north Sanpete County, Utah.
A public hearing will be held, in two sessions, to receive comments from interested organizations and individuals
on the environmental impacts of the proposal.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Sanpete Water Conservancy District is proposing to build a multiple-purpose water development project that would
provide water for irrigation and municipal use. Water from the project would come from a transmountain diversion
from upper Gooseberry Creek and its tributaries which are located in the Price River drainage. Irrigation water shortages
would be reduced from their present level of 30 percent to 19 percent.




Three alternatives, including no action, are considered in the draft statement. The two action alternatives are:
(1) Reclamation's Recommended Plan, and (2) Smaller Reservoir Plan. The Recommended Plan would provide to north
Sanpete County an average annual supply of 4,920 acre-feet of supplemental irrigation water for 15,420 acres of presently
irrigated farmland and 480 acre-feet of water for municipal use. The service area encompasses about 49,000 acres.
The project plan would include construction of Narrows Dam and Reservoir on Gooseberry Creek, pipelines to deliver
the water to existing water distribution systems, rehabilitation of the existing Narrows Tunnel, and relocation
of 2.9 miles of State Road 264. The project would also provide recreation opportunities and fish and wildlife improvements.
In addition to the two action plans and the No Action Plan, the DEIS also evaluates in less detail the impacts of several
nonviable alternatives.


The principal environmental consequences that would result from the two action plans include: increased crop production,
economic stability and growth, expanded fish and wildlife resources, and recreational opportunities.



Hearing Process Information




Organizations and individuals wishing to present statements at the hearing should contact the Bureau of Reclamation,
Upper Colorado Region, at the above address, to announce their intention to participate. Requests for scheduled
presentations will be accepted through 4 p.m. on March 21, 1994.


Oral comments at the hearing will be limited to 10 minutes. The hearing officer may allow any speaker to provide additional
oral comments after all persons wishing to comment have been heard. Whenever possible, speakers will be scheduled
according to the time preference mentioned in their letter or telephone requests. Speakers not present when called
will lose their privilege in the scheduled order and will be recalled at the end of the scheduled speakers.


Written comments from those unable to attend or those wishing to supplement their oral presentations at the hearing
should be received by Reclamation's Upper Colorado Regional Office at the above address by April 11, 1994, for inclusion

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Secretary, Labor.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Amendment of Privacy Act systems of records notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Labor hereby amends its current Privacy Act systems of records notice to give notice of the creation
of flexible workplace pilot projects. These projects will mean that, for short periods of time, participating employees
will take copies of agency records to alternative worksites, including their homes or satellite offices, because
they will be working at these locations. However, all appropriate safeguards will be taken by these employees so that
the records will be safe. This amendment will occur by adding a new category to the General Prefatory Statement within
the notice.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In 1993 the Secretary of Labor authorized flexible workplace pilot projects for Department of Labor employees. Flexiplace
is a voluntary program which allows employees to work at home or at geographically convenient satellite offices for
part of the workweek with equipment provided by the Department.





Section (e)(4)(A) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(A)) requires, in part, that each agency publish in the 

Federal Register

 the location for each of its systems of records. Since employees in the Flexiplace Pilot Programs will be taking copies
of Departmental records to these additional locations, the category for SYSTEM LOCATION, for every system, must
be amended to reflect the additional locations made possible by the flexiplace pilot programs. The Department's
current Privacy Act Systems of Records Notice was published on September 23, 1993 at 58 FR 49548. This amendment will
be accomplished by adding a new paragraph to the existing General Prefatory Statement which appears in that notice.
The General Prefatory Statement contains provisions that apply to and are incorporated by reference into all the
Department's systems of records under the Privacy Act.



Amendment to Privacy Act Systems of Records Notice



The Department hereby amends its September 23, 1993 Privacy Act Systems of Records Notice, 58 FR 49548, by adding the
following text to the current General Prefatory Statement which Statement begins at page 49554 of Volume 58 of the


Federal Register

.



System Location_Flexiplace Pilot Programs



This paragraph applies to and is incorporated by reference into all of the Department's systems of records under the
Privacy Act, within the category entitled, SYSTEM LOCATION:

Pursuant to the Department of Labor's Flexiplace Pilot Programs, copies of records may be temporarily located at
alternative worksites, including employees' homes or at geographically convenient satellite offices for part
of the workweek. All appropriate safeguards will be taken at these sites.

Class Exemption Relating to Certain Employee Benefit Plan Foreign Exchange Transactions 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, Labor. 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Grant of Class Exemption. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains a final exemption from certain prohibited transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and from certain taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code).
The class exemption permits the purchase and sale of foreign currencies between an employee benefit plan and a bank
or a broker-dealer or an affiliate thereof which is a party in interest with respect to such plan. 



The exemption affects participants and beneficiaries of employee benefit plans involved in such transactions,
as well as banks and broker-dealers and their affiliates which act as dealers in foreign exchange. 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Exemptive relief for the transactions described herein, as well as for other transactions not covered by the proposed
exemption, was requested in an application dated July 18, 1984 (Application No. D-5700) submitted by the American
Bankers Association (ABA) pursuant to section 408(a) of ERISA and in accordance with the procedures set forth in ERISA
Procedure 75-1 (40 FR 18471, April 28, 1975). 



In a letter to the ABA dated December 28, 1984, the Department of Labor (the Department) tentatively denied the application.
By letter dated June 21, 1985, the ABA modified its application in response to the Department's tentative denial,
explaining that it was no longer seeking exemptive relief for foreign exchange transactions between banks and plans
where the banks or their affiliates have investment management discretion over the plan assets involved in the transactions.
On September 15, 1986, the Department published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (51 FR 32695), requesting additional information from the public on various issues being considered by the Department
in deciding whether to propose a foreign exchange class exemption in response to the ABA application. The comment
period ended on February 24, 1987. Seventeen substantive responses to the solicitation of comments were received.

1

 





On March 20, 1991, the Department published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 11757) of the pendency of a proposed class exemption from the restrictions of section 406(a)(1) (A) through
(D) of the Act and from the taxes imposed by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code by reason of certain transactions described
in section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (D) of the Code. The notice of pendency invited all interested persons to submit
written comments concerning the proposed class exemption by May 20, 1991. The Department received nine public comments
requesting, among other things, that the Department broaden the scope of the exemption to provide relief for transactions
entered into pursuant to standing instructions. In view of those comments, the Department published a notice of public
hearing in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 46806 (September 16, 1991)). The hearing was held on October 3, 1991. Upon consideration of all of the comments
received and testimony offered at the public hearing, the Department has determined to grant the proposed class exemption,
subject to certain modifications. These modifications and the major comments are discussed below.

Discussion of the Comments 



The proposed exemption provided retroactive and prospective relief from section 406(a)(1) (A) through (D) of the
Act and section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (D) of the Code for foreign exchange transactions between a party in interest
bank or affiliate thereof and an employee benefit plan. 

One commentator urged the Department to expand the final exemption to permit broker-dealers who are registered under
the Securities Act of 1934 (1934 Act) and their affiliates to engage in foreign exchange transactions with plans.
According to this commentator, the same reasons for granting the exemption to banks apply with equal force to broker-dealers
and their affiliates. Broker-dealers act as custodians and provide other services to plans which cause them to be
parties in interest as defined in section 3(14) of the Act. In addition, broker-dealers may also participate in foreign
exchange transactions. Accordingly, absent the availability of an exemption, many major money market broker-dealers
and their affiliates might not be able to deal with plans with respect to foreign exchange transactions. The commentator
also asserts that in order for the ``general'' arm's length test contained in the exemption to work effectively, the
exemption must include significant participants in the foreign exchange market. Finally, the commentator notes
that broker-dealers which are registered under the 1934 Act are subject to extensive regulatory control consisting
of a panoply of federal, self-regulatory organization and state regulations and supervisory structures. The Department
has considered this comment and determined that it would be appropriate to include broker-dealers which are registered
under the 1934 Act and their affiliates within the scope of relief provided by the final class exemption. Accordingly,
the final exemption has been modified in this regard. 

One commentator requested that the exemption be expanded to provide relief for individual retirement accounts (IRAs)
and Keogh plans which are not employee benefit plans covered by title I of the Act.

2

 The Department does not believe that a sufficient showing has been made regarding the demand for exemptive relief
for non-title I IRAs and Keogh Plans. Therefore, the Department is unable to conclude that the final exemption should
be expanded as requested. 





The proposed exemption contained a condition requiring that the bank maintain written policies and procedures regarding
the handling of foreign exchange transactions with plans which assure that the person acting for the bank knows that
he or she is dealing with a plan. 

One commentator expressed concern that requiring the person acting for the bank to know that he or she is dealing with
an ERISA plan will require the institution of new procedures at foreign exchange desks which will increase the cost
of transactions for ERISA plans. The commentator stated that it treats all client transactions in a uniform manner.
Finally, the commentator stated that it does not believe that the condition will achieve beneficial results for plan
transactions at its facility.

While the commentator states that all client transactions at its facility are treated in a uniform manner, the Department
notes that purchases and sales of foreign currency between an employee benefit plan and a party in interest bank or
broker-dealer are prohibited in the absence of exemptive relief. The purpose of the above-noted condition is to put
persons who act for the bank or broker-dealer on notice that they are dealing with a plan in order that any additional
steps or procedures that are necessary to comply with the conditions of the exemption may be implemented. The Department
believes that the identification of the client as a plan will help assure compliance with the conditions of the exemption.
Accordingly, the Department has determined not to revise the final exemption in this regard. 



Section III(c)(6) of the proposed exemption required the issuance of a written confirmation statement for each covered
transaction. The proposal required that the confirmation statement disclose the amount of U.S. dollars purchased
or sold. 
A commentator noted that U.S. dollars are not involved in every foreign currency transaction. In response to this
comment, the Department has modified section III(c)(6) to require disclosure of the currencies purchased and sold
pursuant to the final exemption. 



The proposed exemption included a recordkeeping requirement which provided that the bank, broker-dealer or affiliate
must maintain within territories under the jurisdiction of the United States Government, the records necessary
to determine whether the applicable conditions of the exemption have been met. Several commentators objected to
the requirement that records be maintained within territories under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Government. In
this regard, they represented that this requirement creates difficulties for those banks who maintain foreign exchange
trading desks in a country or countries other than the United States. In addition, one commenter suggested that the
recordkeeping requirement may result in higher costs to plans involved in foreign exchange transactions. 



The ABA suggested that the recordkeeping requirement should permit the required records to be maintained on a computer
system located at a foreign facility which would be accessible in the United States. These systems could print out
any information requested and produce a hard copy to anyone who is authorized to have such information. These systems
would contain all the bank's foreign exchange transactions on a daily basis for employee benefit plans as well as other
entities. In this way, all information needed to test for compliance would be available in the United States. Other
commenters suggested that requirements similar to those provided in the regulations under section 404(b) of the
Act regarding the maintenance of the indicia of ownership of plan assets should be adopted. Specifically, they requested
that the exemption permit the required records to be maintained at foreign locations described under the section
404(b) regulations. 



The Department notes that the purpose of the record maintenance requirement is to ensure that the persons described
in paragraph III(e) of the exemption will have access to bank, broker-dealer or affiliate records involving covered
foreign exchange transactions. The Department is unable to determine how the alternatives for holding securities,
which are described in the regulations under section 404(b) of the Act, would operate in the context of a record maintenance
requirement. If the records were maintained outside of the jurisdiction of the United States Government and became
unavailable for reasons beyond the control of the bank, broker-dealer or affiliate, there would be no comparable
records available for determining compliance with the terms of this exemption. Accordingly, the Department is not
persuaded that the conditions described in the regulations under section 404(b) of the Act would be appropriate with
respect to the record maintenance requirement. 



The Department has considered the ABA's suggestion to modify the final exemption to include records which are maintained
on a foreign computer system that could be accessed in the United States. We note, however, that the ABA is unable to
represent that such records could always be accessed on a foreign computer system without the risk of restriction
by a foreign government. Accordingly, the Department is unable to conclude that the final exemption should be modified
to include this method of recordkeeping.

The ABA, as well as a number of other commentators, requested that the Department expand the proposed exemption to
include retroactive and prospective relief for foreign exchange transactions entered into pursuant to a standing
authorization, hereinafter ``standing instruction.'' Similarly, many of those commenters also requested that
the Department amend the definition of the term ``directed transaction'' by modifying the requirement that the independent
plan fiduciary effect the foreign exchange transaction at a specific exchange rate. 



The commentators represent that the utilization of a standing instruction is an integral component in foreign exchange
transactions involving employee benefit plans. They further indicate that standing instructions are necessary
to repatriate relatively minor amounts of income such as dividend and interest payments routinely generated by foreign
securities which are held by plans. In this regard, they state that obtaining individual directions for each income
receipt would be impractical and that plan beneficiaries would lose investment income due to the time that it would
take to receive directions from investment managers and convert the payments. In addition, many investment managers
who wish to effectuate a foreign exchange transaction do not contact the foreign exchange desk directly, but instead
leave their trading instructions with their account managers in the bank's trust or global area. Transactions effected
in this manner can be bulked or added together with other transactions from employee benefit plans as well as other
trusts and custodial accounts so as to obtain a more beneficial exchange rate. Under the circumstances described
above, foreign exchange transactions would not meet the definition of ``directed'' as set forth in the proposed exemption
because of the inability to comply with the requirement that the independent plan fiduciary designate a specific
exchange rate. 



The Department notes that a bank or broker-dealer engages in violations of section 406(b) of the Act whenever it uses
its fiduciary authority or control with respect to the plan assets involved in the transaction to increase the amount
of its compensation by determining the timing or the specific exchange rate for the foreign exchange transaction.
The Department did not propose relief with respect to such transactions because it was unable, at the time, to make
the findings required under section 408(a) of the Act. Specifically, the Department was unable to conclude that the
conditions proposed by the ABA would effectively and consistently address the potential for abuse of discretion
by party in interest banks or broker-dealers in setting exchange rates for foreign exchange transactions. 



The commenters have responded to the Department's concerns by suggesting additional conditions which would limit
the amount of discretion that a bank or broker-dealer would have in executing the foreign exchange transactions pursuant
to standing instructions. Thus, some of the commenters suggested that the class exemption could limit relief to those
situations where the triggering event, such as the receipt of cash dividends, would not be within the control of the
bank or broker-dealer. In addition, the exchange transaction would have to take place within a short period of time
following the triggering event. As a further limitation on the bank or broker-dealer, a commenter suggested that
the exchange rate could be set daily prior to execution of the covered foreign exchange transaction using objective
criteria which would be disclosed to and approved by a plan fiduciary independent of the bank or broker-dealer. Finally,
it was represented that conditions relating to the information which must be provided or made available to the independent
plan fiduciary could require very detailed disclosures which would enable such fiduciary to determine the reasonableness
of the foreign exchange rates paid by the plan. 



On the basis of the comments received following publication of the proposed exemption, the Department believes that
it may be appropriate, under certain circumstances, to provide relief from section 406(b)(1) of the Act. Pursuant
to the requirements of section 408(a) of the Act, however, the Department is required to offer interested persons
an opportunity to present their views and an opportunity for a hearing before granting an exemption from section 406(b)
of the Act. Therefore, in order not to delay the publication of an exemption from section 406(a) of the Act for foreign
exchange transactions, the Department has decided to grant the exemption described herein while it continues to
consider additional exemptive relief for foreign exchange transactions between a plan and a party in interest bank,
broker-dealer or affiliate thereof where such transactions are engaged in pursuant to a ``standing instruction.''

Miscellaneous 
 


One commenter requested that the Department clarify that the term ``foreign exchange transaction'' which is defined
in section IV(a) of the proposed exemption as ``the exchange of the currency of one nation for the currency of another
nation or a contract for such exchange'' includes options to buy or sell foreign currency. The commenter is concerned
that a footnote to the supplementary information accompanying the proposed exemption which describes foreign exchange
transactions as ``generally * * * either `spot', `forward', or `split''' delimits the scope of the
literal language of the exemption. 
 
The commenter represents that options contracts operate in a manner similar to that of forward contracts. For example,
a forward contract to sell a specified sum of Yen for dollars would enable a party to sell Yen at the agreed upon rate even
if the value of Yen declined over the time period covered by the forward contract; the same forward contract would require
the counterparty to buy Yen from the party at a rate favorable to the counterparty if the Yen appreciated during the
same time period. A similar economic result could be achieved if the party had bought an option to sell Yen at the forward
contract rate, and sold an option to buy Yen at the same rate. 
 
After considering this comment, the Department has decided to amend the final exemption to specifically include
options to buy or sell currency. 
 
One commenter requested that the Department expand the final exemption to include relief from section 406 (b)(1)
& (b)(2) of the Act and section 4975(c)(1)(E) of the Code so that it would be clear that a fiduciary bank would not
violate those provisions when it engaged in a foreign exchange transaction if it did not exercise its fiduciary authority
to cause the plan to pay it an additional fee. The regulations at 29 CFR 2550.408b-2(e)(2) specifically state
that a fiduciary does not engage in an act described in section 406(b)(1) of the Act if the fiduciary does not use any
of the authority, control or responsibility which makes such person a fiduciary to cause a plan to pay additional fees
for a service furnished by such fiduciary. Accordingly, the Department has determined that it is unnecessary to modify
the final exemption as requested. 
 
Finally, for purposes of clarity, the Department has added a definition to section IV of the class exemption. Paragraph
(g) defines the term ``employee benefit plan'' for purposes of this class exemption. 



General Information 
 


The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
 
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply and
the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act which require, among other things, that
a fiduciary discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interests of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of the Act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 
 
(2) The exemption, will not extend to transactions prohibited under section 406(b) of the Act and section 4975(c)(1)
(E) and (F) of the Code; 
 
(3) In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, and based upon the entire record,
the Department finds that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of plans and of their participants
and beneficiaries and protective of the rights of the participants and beneficiaries of plans. 
 
(4) The exemption is supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and the Code, including
statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction is subject
to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction. 
 
(5) The exemption is applicable to a transaction only if the conditions specified in the exemption are met.

is independent of the bank, the broker-dealer, and any affiliate thereof, and (ii) the conditions set forth in section
II are met. 

(b) Effective June 18, 1991, the restrictions of section 406(a)(1) (A) through (D) of the Act and the taxes imposed

exchange transaction between a bank or broker-dealer or an affiliate thereof and an employee benefit plan with respect
to which the bank or broker-dealer or an affiliate thereof is a trustee, custodian, fiduciary, or other party in interest,
provided that (i) the transaction is directed (within the meaning of section IV(e)) on behalf of the plan by a fiduciary
which is independent of the bank, the broker-dealer, and any affiliate thereof, and (ii) all of the conditions set
forth in sections II and III are met. 


Section II. General Conditions 



Section I of this exemption applies only if the following conditions of this section II are satisfied. In the case of
transactions described in section I(b), all of the conditions specified in section III below must also be satisfied.


(a) At the time the transaction is entered into, the terms of the transaction are not less favorable to the plan than

respect to the investment of the plan assets involved in the transaction or renders investment advice (within the
meaning of 29 CFR 2510.3-21(c)) with respect to the investments of those assets. 



Section III. Specific Conditions 



Section I(b) of this exemption applies only if the conditions specified in section II above and the following conditions
are satisfied:

(b) The bank, or broker-dealer, maintains at all times written policies and procedures regarding the handling of
foreign exchange transactions with plans with respect to which the bank or broker-dealer is a trustee, custodian,
fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person which assure that the person acting for the bank or broker-dealer
knows that he or she is dealing with a plan. 

(c) A written confirmation statement is issued with respect to each covered transaction to the independent plan fiduciary
who directs the transaction for the plan. 

The confirmation shall disclose the following information:

United States Government, for a period of six years from the date of the transaction, the records necessary to enable
the persons described in paragraph (e) of this section to determine whether the applicable conditions of this exemption
have been met. Notwithstanding these recordkeeping requirements, a prohibited transaction will not be considered
to have occurred if, due to circumstances beyond the bank's or broker-dealer's control, the records are lost or destroyed
prior to the end of the six-year period, and no fiduciary of a plan who is independent of the bank or broker-dealer or
any affiliate thereof, which engages in a transaction covered by the exemption, shall be subject to the civil penalty
that may be assessed under 502(i) of the Act, or to the taxes imposed by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code, solely because
the records are not maintained by the bank, the broker-dealer, or its affiliate, or are not made available for examination
by the bank or broker-dealer or affiliate as required by paragraph (e) below. 

(e)(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph and notwithstanding any provisions of subsection

(A) Any duly authorized employee or representative of the Department of Labor or the Internal Revenue Service.

or representative of such employer. 

(ii) None of the persons described in subparagraphs (B) and (C) shall be authorized to examine a bank's or broker-dealer's
trade secrets or commercial or financial information of a bank or broker-dealer or an affiliate thereof which is privileged
or confidential. 



Section IV. Definitions and General Rules

exchange transactions. 

(b) A ``bank'' means a bank which is supervised by the United States or a State thereof, or any affiliate thereof. 

(c) A ``broker-dealer'' means a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or any affiliate

AGENCY:

 Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, Labor.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Grant of individual exemptions.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 


Notices were published in the 

Federal Register

 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, D.C. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have
complied with the requirements of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for
a hearing, unless otherwise stated, were received by the Department. 
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor. 


Statutory Findings 


In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and the procedures set forth in 29
CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990) and based upon the entire record, the Department makes
the following findings: 




(a) The exemptions are administratively feasible; 
(b) They are in the interests of the plans and 
their participants and beneficiaries; and 
(c) They are protective of the rights of the 
participants and beneficiaries of the plans.

Exemption 


The sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through
(E) of the Code, shall not apply to the sale for cash of certain shares of stock from the Account to R. Scott Taylor, a disqualified
person with respect to the Account, provided that the following conditions are met: 
1. The fair market value of the stock is established by an appraiser independent of G. Robert Taylor; 
2. The buyer pays no less than current fair market value for the stock; 
3. The transaction is entirely for cash; and 
4. The Account pays no fees or commissions in regard to the sale.

Control means the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a person other than
an individual. 
For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this
exemption, refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on November 15, 1993 at 58 FR 60219. 
Written Comments: The Department received one written comment and no requests for hearing. The comment was submitted
on behalf of the applicants Penn Mutual, PTC and ICMI. The issues addressed in the comment and the Department's responses
are summarized as follows: 
1. The applicants request that the first sentence of Section I. Covered Transactions section of the Exemption be revised
to include the following phrase at the end of subsequent (2) and (3) ``or in connection with a non-benefit withdrawal
from the Fund,''. The applicants represent that the added phrase is intended to reflect the fact that it is contemplated
that there may be sales of assets of a Fund which form a part of the Stable Asset Trust to Penn Mutual in connection with
a non-benefit withdrawal from the Fund by a participating plan. Such sales are authorized in section 5.6(e) of the
declaration of trust for the Stable Asset Trust. In accordance with the applicants' request the Department has included
the above-referenced phrase at the end of subsections (2) and (3) of Section I of the final exemption. 
2. Paragraph 1 of Section II of the proposed exemption states that the decision to invest in a Fund will be made by a plan
fiduciary who is responsible for and knowledgeable regarding the investment of plan investments in GICs and similar
investment products. Similarly, paragraph 15(a) of the Summary of Facts and Representations section of the proposed
exemption states that the applicants represent that investment of a Plan's assets in a Fund will be made and approved
by a plan fiduciary who is responsible for and knowledgeable regarding the investment of plan assets in guaranteed
investment contracts and similar products. 
The applicants wish to clarify that this condition will be satisfied by an express representation that will be required
to be made by the Plan's independent fiduciary under the Independence Stable Asset Trust Participant Investment
Agreement. 
3. The applicants have noted two factual errors in paragraph 1 of the Summary of Facts and Representation section of
the proposed exemption. The correct name of the affiliate listed in the proposed exemption as ``Penn Assurance and
Annuity Company'' is ``Penn Insurance and Annuity Company.'' Secondly, as of December 31, 1992, Penn Mutual had $6.9
billion in consolidated assets and not $46.9 billion as reported in the proposed exemption. 
4. Paragraph 10 of the Summary of Facts and Representations section of the proposed exemption includes a description
of the non-benefit withdrawal provisions of the synthetic GIC product. The description includes statements to the
effect that the withdrawing plan would be subject to a surrender charge and that there would be a credit against the
amount of the surrender charge owing based on the excess of the market value of the units of the Fund held by the Plan over
the Plan Account Amount as of such date. 
The applicants represent that there may be cases where no surrender charges will be applied with respect to non-benefit
withdrawals and also there may be circumstances where surrender charges will be applied and will not be subject to
any offset. Thus, the word ``would'' as noted above should be changed to ``may''. These provisions, in each case, however,
will be determined and approved by the Plan fiduciary at the Fund's inception. 
5. Paragraph 11 of the Summary of Facts and Representations section of the proposed exemption includes a reference
to paragraph 12, which does not appear to relate to the substance of that paragraph. The Department notes that the paragraph
labeled ``12'' was incorrectly identified in the 

Federal Register

 and the designation for paragraph 13 omitted. As corrected, paragraphs 12 and 13 read as follows.

12. PTC, at its discretion, will be entitled at a Fund's Termination Date to sell any one or more of the Fund assets to
Penn Mutual for a cash price sufficient to obtain net proceeds equal to the aggregate of the Plan Account Amounts of
plans holding units in the Fund. The obligations of the parties under these arrangements will be netted against one
another, resulting in a ``swapping-out'' of the entire remaining portfolio at an amount equal to the aggregate Plan
Account Amounts. 

13. Penn Mutual's fee for its minimum yield, liquidity guarantees and Plan Account Amount assurances will be an amount
computed on and payable as of pre-set quarterly dates from each Fund. The fee will be equal to the product of the cost
of the remaining invested assets in the Fund adjusted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, times the Penn Mutual Quarterly Compensation Percentage
specified in the applicable Fund Supplement.

After consideration of the entire record, including the comment, the Department has determined to grant the exemption
as amended in the manner described above.

General Information 



The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 

(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of
the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive
benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; 

(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code,
including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction
is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and 

(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

<DOCTITLE>Baltimore Gas and Electric Company; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact </DOCTITLE>





The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission] is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements
of 10 CFR part 50, appendix A, General Criterion 2, ``Design Bases For Protection Against Natural Phenomena,'' to
Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (the licensee), for the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit No. 2, located
at the licensee's site in Calvert County, Maryland.


Environmental Assessment


Identification of Proposed Action


The proposed exemption would allow relief from General Design Criterion 2 (GDC-2) during the upgrading of the
Unit 1 emergency diesel generator (EDG) No. 11. The proposed exemption will permit the temporary removal of a steel
missile door which provides missile protection for the No. 11 EDG, which will be out-of-service to allow for modifications
which will increase its load capacity, and also provides missile protection to portions of the support systems for
EDGs Nos. 12 and 21. EDGs Nos. 12 and 21 are required to be operable to support the operation of Unit 2. 
The upgrading of the Unit 1 EDG will be performed during the upcoming Unit 1 refueling outage (RFO-11). RFO-11
is scheduled to commence on February 8, 1994, and be completed in early May 1994. The steel missile door will be required
to be removed about four times during the outage. The licensee estimates that each of the removals will last for about
24 hours, which will result in a total removal time of about 100 hours during the scheduled 89 day RFO-11.


Need for the Proposed Action


The proposed temporary exemption is needed to permit the completion of highly desirable upgrades to the Unit 1 EDG
No. 11 without requiring a dual unit shutdown.


Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action


The proposed exemption does not involve any measurable environmental impacts during normal operation of Unit 2 since
the plant configuration is changed only minimally for short periods of time when the missile door will be removed and
overall plant operation is not changed. The likelihood of tornado-generated or other high wind-generated missile
damage during the time the exemption would be in effect and which could affect equipment required to be operable to
avoid radiological impact is low. Also, the licensee indicates that the missile door will be installed whenever severe
weather conditions arise. Thus, the proposed temporary exemption would not significantly affect the probability
or consequences of potential reactor accidents and would not otherwise affect radiological plant effluents. Consequently,
the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological impacts associated with the proposed exemption.

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption involves features located entirely within
the owner-controlled area defined in 10 CFR part 20. The EDG upgrade project activities do not affect nonradiological
plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the staff concludes that there are no significant
nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.


Alternatives to the Proposed Action


The principal alternative to requesting the temporary exemption for implementation of the EDG upgrade would be to
comply with the restrictive requirements of GDC-2. However, this alternative would not significantly enhance
the protection of the environment, and would result in a significant loss of power generation since a dual unit outage
would be required. 


Alternate Use of Resources


This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the April 1973 Final Environmental
Statement for the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2.


Agencies and Persons Consulted


The NRC staff contacted the State of Maryland, Department of Natural Resources, regarding the environmental impact
of this proposed action. 


Finding of No Significant Impact


Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the staff concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment and has determined, therefore, not to prepare an environmental impact

<DOCTITLE>Northeast Nuclear Energy Co.; Issuance of Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206</DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given that the Director, Office of Enforcement, has taken action with regard to a Petition for action
under 10 CFR 2.206 received from Mr. Paul M. Blanch (Petitioner) dated August 2, 1993, regarding the Northeast Nuclear
Energy Company (licensee) and the Millstone Facility.

The Petitioner requested that the NRC reconsider the May 4, 1993 enforcement action issued to the licensee for discrimination
against the Petitioner in violation of 10 CFR 50.7.

The Petitioner requested reconsideration based on his view that additional enforcement action is warranted. Specifically,
Petitioner requests: (1) An enforcement action against a licensee Vice President for alleged willful violation
of 10 CFR 50.7 and alleged deliberate misconduct under 10 CFR 50.5 in the discriminatory actions against Petitioner;
(2) a Severity Level I violation against the licensee corporate officer allegedly responsible for directing action
against two of Petitioner's former subordinates; (3) Severity Level I violations against three licensee corporate
officers allegedly resonsible for harassment, intimidation and discrimination against the Petitioner; (4) a Severity
Level I violation and a Severity Level II violation against a licensee attorney and a licensee manager respectively
for threatening individuals with letters of reprimand if they did not communicate with licensee attorneys prior
to being interviewed by the NRC's Office of Investigations on the discrimination matter; and (5) a minimum of a Severity
Level II violation against a licensee manager for a retaliatory audit of the Petitioner's group.

The Director of the Office of Enforcement has reviewed the bases for the Petitioner's request and has found that the
Petitoner has not presented information that would warrant reconsideration of the May 4, 1993 enforcement action.
Therefore, the Petitoner's request has been denied. The reasons for the denial are explained in the ``Director's
Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206'' (DD-94-01) which is available for public inspection at the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the Local Public Document Room
for the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, unit 3, Learning Resources Center, Thames Valley State Technical College,
574 New London Turnpike, Norwich, Connecticut 06360.

A copy of this Decision will be filed with the Secretary of the Commission for the Commission's review in accordance
with 10 CFR 2.206(c) of the Commission's regulations. As provided by that regulation, the Decision will constitute
the final action of the Commission 25 days after the date of issuance of the Decision unless the Commission, on its own
motion, institutes a review of the decision within that time.




Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 9th day of February 1994.






For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. Relating to Assessments and Fees on Members



February 10, 1994.




Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on February 9, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The NASD has designated this proposal as one
establishing or changing a fee under section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act, which renders the rule effective upon the
Commission's receipt of this filing. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change




The NASD is proposing a rule change to amend Schedule A, Section 2(b) to the By-Laws
 to add the provision that any initial or transfer application for registration as a registered representative or
registered principal with the NASD which requires a special registration review shall be assessed a surcharge of
$85.





II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




Any initial or transfer application to register as a representative or principal with the Association requires the
submission of Form U-4, the Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer (``Form
U-4''). Item 22 on page three of Form U-4 requires disclosure of violations of certain criminal and securities
laws, rules and regulations. Any ``yes'' answer to item 22 requires additional detailed disclosure on the disclosure
reporting page of Form U-4, which in turn requires a special registration review of such information by the Association.


Pursuant to Article VI of the By-Laws of the Association, the NASD requires its members to pay a $65 fee for each application
submitted to the Association for the registration or transfer of registration of a registered representative or
registered principal, as set forth in Schedule A, Section 2(b) to the By-Laws. The NASD is proposing to amend Schedule
A, Section 2(b) to the By-Laws to add the provision that any initial or transfer application which requires a special
registration review shall be assessed a surcharge of $85.


There are additional costs associated with performing a special registration review of information disclosed in
the Form U-4 and maintaining such information in the NASD's Central Registration Depository disciplinary
database (``CRD database''). These costs relate to conducting research on all criminal actions, disciplinary actions
taken by the states, SROs and the SEC disclosed in the U-4 and including information on such actions on the CRD
database. A special registration review will also require CRD to provide information on any criminal, disciplinary,
or SEC action.


Based on data for 1991, the Association estimates the extra costs attributable to U-4s in 1994 for which a special
registration review is required will be approximately $85 per U-4 filing. The NASD, therefore, in accordance
with its objective to align revenues with the cost of providing particular services to members and, specifically,
its objective to focus fee increases on actions that impact the disciplinary process, is proposing to amend Schedule
A, Section 2(b) to the By-Laws to add the provision that any initial or transfer application which requires a special
registration review shall be assessed a surcharge of $85. The surcharge will take effect on March 1, 1994 for all initial
and transfer filings either that have a ``yes'' answer to item 22 on Form U-4 or for which information exists in
the CRD database that would require a ``yes'' answer to item 22 regardless of how it is answered.

<DOCNO> FR940217-2-00124 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940217-2-00069 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of section 15A(b)(5) of the Act,
 which require that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and
other charges among members in that the proposed rule change equitably allocates the extra costs associated with
U-4s for which a special registration review is required to the member firms incurring such costs.





(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The foregoing rule change has become effective upon filing pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act and section
(e) of Rule 19b-4 promulgated thereunder in that it constitutes a due, fee or other charge. However, the NASD
will implement the fee change on March 1, 1994.

At any time within 60 days of the filing of a rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, the Commission may
summarily abrogate the rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in
the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by March 10,
1994.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).

Availability of Environmental Document and Public Hearing; Greater Rockford Airport, Rockford, IL



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice to hold a public hearing and accept additional scoping comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is issuing this notice to advise the public that an Environmental Document
has been prepared for proposed development at Greater Rockford Airport, Rockford, Illinois. In addition, it is the
intent of this notice to also inform the public that the Airport will be conducting a Public Hearing. Major development
items, proposed to be completed over the next 5 to 10 years, are depicted on the Airport Layout Plan (ALP).




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FAA issued a 

Federal Register

 Notice on April 22, 1993 announcing its intent to prepare an Environmental Document (possible Environmental Impact
Statement) and to hold a May 26, 1993 scoping meeting. At the scoping meeting no significant impacts were identified.
Some concerns were expressed over possible noise, floodplain and wetland impacts. The airport sponsor indicated
that any impacts would be mitigated below the level of significance as an integral part of the development. Recently,
United Parcel Service (UPS) announced their intention to initiate a cargo hub at the airport in an area not covered
by the previous scoping meeting. Below is a refined listing of the major associated and indirect development projects,
incorporating items scoped originally and those newly identified as part of the UPS project.





1. Develop the midfield area for aviation-related industrial users. (scoped originally)


2. Expand the existing cargo apron and buildings west of the existing terminal building to accommodate a minimum of
26 cargo aircraft. (expansion scoped originally; to accommodate 26 aircraft_new)


3. Extend Runway 7/25 to a length of 10,000 feet by constructing a 3,500-foot southwesterly extension with parallel
and connecting taxiways and associated lighting and navigation aids. This would include the installation of a CAT
II Instrument Landing System (ILS) for Runway 7. (scoped originally)


4. Relocate approximately 12,000 feet of Belt Line Road and 9,300 feet of Kishwaukee Road. (scoped originally)


5. Expand the existing terminal building and auto parking lot and upgrade the existing airport entrance roadway.
(scoped originally)


6. Construct a general aviation apron and T-hangars. (scoped originally)


7. Remove miscellaneous support buildings. (scoped originally)


8. Construct a new 4,000-foot general aviation visual approach runway, parallel to and 5,100 feet southeast of existing
Runway 7/25, with associated taxiways and instrumentation. (scoped originally)


9. Construct and realign various taxiways parallel to Runway 1/19. The majority of the realignment work proposed
is adjacent to and west of the approach end of Runway 19. (scoped originally)



10. Implement actions recommended in the 1993 Master Drainage/Stormwater Management Plan. (scoped originally)


11. Implement actions recommended in the updated Noise Compatibility Plan. (scoped originally)


12. Acquire approximately 1,100 acres of land for airfield development and noise and floodway mitigation. Included
in this acquisition is the relocation of approximately 28 residential dwellings, of which only eleven are considered
to be noise impacted and must be acquired and residents relocated prior to the start of any operation resulting from
the Proposed Action Alternative. The remaining residential dwellings would be acquired for purposes of airfield
development and floodway mitigation. (land acquisition scoped originally; new noise impacted homes)

13. Compensate for wetland impacts caused by the development of the Proposed Action Alternative through the creation
of approximately 25 acres of new wetlands. (scoped originally) 
 
14. An additional 1,500 flights annually beyond those originally forecasted but with a greater number of stage three
aircraft. This is based on UPS's proposal to initiate an air cargo operation at Greater Rockford Airport. (new) 
 
An informational workshop and Public Hearing will be held from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Tuesday, March 22, 1994 in the Auditorium
and Classroom of the Operations & Public Safety Center at Greater Rockford Airport, 60 Airport Drive, Rockford,
Illinois. Comments on the Draft Environmental Assessment are invited from Federal, State, and local agencies, and
all other interested parties to provide additional opportunity for scoping comments and to insure that a full range
of issues and alternatives related to the proposed projects and actions are addressed and all issues identified.
Comments may be provided in writing and/or orally at the Public Hearing or submitted in writing either to the FAA at
the address provided above or to Mr. Frederick C. Ford, Executive Director, Greater Rockford Airport, 3600 Airport

<DOCTITLE>Availability of Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Establishment of an Instrument Landing System
(ILS) on Runway 11 at Newark International Airport, Newark, NJ</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is issuing this Notice to advise the public, local, State and Federal agencies,
and all other interested parties of the availability of a final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which assesses
the potential effects of constructing and operating an Instrument Landing System (ILS) facility on Runway 11 at Newark
International Airport, Newark, New Jersey. The EIS has been prepared in accordance with the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969. The purpose of this proposed action is to reduce delays to the aircraft and passengers utilizing
Newark International Airport and to provide more efficient use of the existing runways.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

An FAA evaluation concluded that the installation of an ILS on Runway 11 at Newark International Airport would reduce
aircraft and passenger delays and provide for greater efficiency in the use of the existing runways. The FAA, in cooperation
with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), began the preparation of an Environmental Assessment
(EA) for an Instrument Landing System/Microwave Landing System (ILS/MLS).




A public hearing was held on September 19, 1991 to receive comments regarding the Draft Environmental Assessment
(EA) for the proposed Runway 11 ILS/MLS at Newark International Airport; and a notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) was published in the 

Federal Register

 by the FAA on March 29, 1993 inviting comments. Both verbal and written comments were received. Comments from the public
hearing and those arising from the publication of the Notice of Intent were incorporated into a Draft Environmental
Impact Statement (DEIS). Due to technical reasons and considerations, an MLS was no longer a part of the proposed action.

A notice of Availability of the DEIS was published in the 

Federal Register

 by the FAA on September 20, 1993 and by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on September 24, 1993.
Both verbal and written comments were received, incorporated into, and addressed in the Final EIS.

Several alternatives to the proposed action were evaluated in the EIS, including: shifting the demand to other airports;
restricting aircraft operations during peak operating hours; installing a precision instrument landing system
on another runway; and no action.

An analysis of both the function of the ILS and the data used to develop the Environmental Assessment led to the recommendation
to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the proposed installation of an ILS on Runway 11 at Newark International
Airport. In addition, based on this analysis the FAA determined that the Runway 11 precision approach is separate
and independent of those issues and actions considered in the EIS currently being completed for the Expanded East
Coast Plan (EECP).

The EIS for the Newark Runway 11 ILS project specifically addresses the environmental impacts resulting from the
installation and use of a precision approach landing system for Runway 11 at Newark International Airport. The installation
of an ILS on Runway 11 is not a component part of the EECP. The scope of the EECP EIS analyzes procedures involving aircraft
above 3,000 feet. Utilization of the precision approach to Runway 11 will only effect procedures relevant to, and
aircraft operations conducted below 3,000 feet. The Runway 11 ILS precision approach will in no way limit the choice
of reasonable alternatives in the current EECP EIS. Rather, the Runway 11 ILS is a stand alone project of independent
utility, needed to reduce operating delays at Newark International Airport. Therefore, the preparation of a separate
EIS for this project is appropriate.

The EIS is available for public review at the following locations: (1) Cranford Public Library, 224 Walnut Avenue,
Cranford, New Jersey (contact the Head Librarian); (2) Elizabeth Public Library, 11 South Broad Street, Elizabeth,
New Jersey (contact the Head Librarian); (3) Newark Public Library, 5 Washington Street, Newark, New Jersey (contact
the Head Librarian); (4) Air Traffic Control Tower, room 112, Tower Road, Newark International Airport (ask for Mr.
Lucious Riley).

To obtain a copy of the EIS, submit a written request to: Mr. Thomas Hom (AEA-451.3), Supervisor, Navaids/Visaids/Weather
Section, Airway Facilities Division, Federal Aviation Administration, Fitzgerald Federal Building

Federal Direct Student Loan Program; Notice









Federal Register

  Vol. 59, No. 33  Thursday, February 17, 1994  Notices




<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</USDEPT>



Federal Direct Student Loan Program




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Education.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of standards for participation and solicitation of applications.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Secretary of Education issues standards for participation in the Federal Direct Student Loan (Direct Loan) Program
for the 1995-1996 academic year, which is the academic year beginning July 1, 1995. The Secretary also invites
applications from schools to participate in the Direct Loan Program for the 1995-1996 academic year. This notice
relates to the Federal Direct Stafford Loan Program, the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program, and
the Federal Direct PLUS Program, collectively referred to as the Direct Loan Program.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Student Loan Reform Act of 1993, enacted on August 10, 1993, established the Direct Loan Program under the Higher
Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). See Subtitle A of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-66).
Under the Direct Loan Program, loan capital is provided directly to student and parent borrowers by the Federal Government
rather than through private lenders.



Background



The statute directs the Secretary to exercise his discretion in the selection of schools so that the loans made under
the Direct Loan Program will represent 40 percent of the new student loan volume for academic year 1995-1996,
the second year of this program. See section 453(a)(2) of the HEA.

The standards for participation in the second year of the Direct Loan Program are issued in this notice in final form.
They do not encompass standards, criteria, procedures, and other regulations to implement the Direct Loan Program
in the 1995-1996 and subsequent academic years. Those program regulations will be developed through negotiated
rulemaking to the extent practicable. The Secretary expects to publish final program regulations by December 1,
1994. The Secretary anticipates publishing standards for repayment of Direct Loans and standards for Federal Direct
Consolidation Loans for the 1994-1995 academic year by May 1994. In addition, the Secretary anticipates publishing
standards and procedures for loan origination for the 1995-1996 academic year by April 1994. Both sets of standards,
which will be published in final form, will be determined with as much input from the higher education community as
practicable.

A school may participate in both the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program and the Direct Loan Program or only
in the Direct Loan Program. A school that is selected to participate in the Direct Loan Program but wishes to withdraw
after publication of the rules for loan origination or the other program regulations for the 1995-1996 academic
year will be allowed a reasonable period to do so.



I. Eligibility Requirements


A. Eligibility for Federal Family Education Loan Program



To participate in the Direct Loan Program in the 1995-1996 academic year, a school must be eligible to participate
in the FFEL Program. Among other requirements, a school must have a cohort default rate of less than 25 percent for one
of the three most recent fiscal years for which data are available, unless the school is exempt from this requirement
under section 435(a)(3)(C) of the HEA. That section provides that until July 1, 1994, (a) Historically Black Colleges
and Universities as defined in section 322(2) of the HEA, (b) tribally controlled community colleges within the meaning
of section 2(a)(4) of the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978, and (c) Navajo Community
Colleges under the Navajo Community College Act are exempt from the cohort default rate requirement.



B. Default Rate Requirement for the Direct Loan Program



The Secretary believes that it is not in the best interest of the Direct Loan Program to allow a school to participate
in the 1995-1996 academic year if there is a high probability that the school will lose its statutory eligibility
to participate in the Federal student loan programs. Therefore, the Secretary will continue to select schools for
the Direct Loan Program that also meet the stricter default rate requirements adopted for that program for the 1994-1995
academic year. Consequently, in order for a school to participate in the 1995-1996 academic year, the school
must also have a cohort default rate of less than 25 percent in one of the two most recent fiscal years for which data are
available at the time of the first selection decision following its application.

If a statutory exemption from the three-year default rate requirement in section 435(a) is extended beyond July 1,
1994, the Secretary reserves the right to waive the two-year cohort default rate requirement for any school exempted
from the three-year requirement. The Secretary may select a school that is currently exempt from the statutory requirement
on a provisional basis pending a decision by the Congress on extending the exemption.

C. Consortia


If schools apply as a consortium, each school must be an eligible institution. Schools in a consortium interact with
the Secretary in the same manner as other schools with one exception: communication between the Secretary and the
schools in the consortium is consolidated and channeled through a single point.


II. Selection Criteria


The Secretary will select schools to participate in the Direct Loan Program in the 1995-1996 academic year from
among those that apply to participate. An application will be evaluated on the basis of whether the school is willing
to participate electronically and whether it is capable of administering the program. From among eligible schools
that meet these criteria, the Secretary will, to the extent possible, select schools that are reasonably representative
in terms of several factors.


A. Electronic capability


Schools participating in the campus-based programs, which include the Federal Perkins Loan Program, the Federal
Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program, and the Federal Work-Study Program, must do so electronically.
The majority of schools participating in the Federal Pell Grant Program also do so electronically. The Secretary
intends to make maximum use of available technology in the Direct Loan Program and will therefore give strong consideration
to whether the school is willing to participate in the program electronically.


B. Administrative Capability


In selecting schools for the 1995-1996 academic year, the Secretary will evaluate a school's demonstrated
capability in administering student financial aid programs. While the Secretary retains discretion to evaluate
all relevant circumstances, the Secretary has identified certain factors as indicators of a lack of administrative
capability. These factors are listed in the standards for participation in this notice.


C. Representativeness


In selecting schools from among eligible applicants that are capable of administering the Direct Loan Program and
are willing to participate electronically, the Secretary will select, to the extent practicable, schools that are
reasonably representative in terms of several factors. These factors are listed in the standards for participation
in this notice.


III. Selection Process


A. Currently Pending Applications


A school that has been selected to participate in the Direct Loan Program for the 1994-1995 academic year, and
an eligible school that applied to participate in the program for that year but was not selected, need not submit an
application for the 1995-1996 academic year. If an eligible school that applied but was not selected for participation
in the first year wishes not to be considered for participation in the second year, it should notify the Secretary.
