ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that applies to certain Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation
(Twin Commander) Models 685, 690, 690A, and 690B airplanes. This action requires modifying the wing ribs at Wing Station
(WS) 39, inspecting (one-time) WS 39 for cracks or corrosion, treating any corrosion found, and replacing any cracked
wing front spar lower cap (spar cap). Several reports of cracked spar caps and cracked and deformed wing ribs at WS 39
on the affected airplanes prompted this action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of
the wing structure caused by a cracked spar cap or cracked or deformed wing rib at WS 39.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that would apply to certain Twin Commander
Models 685, 690, 690A, and 690B airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register 

on June 30, 1993 (58 FR 34959). The proposed AD would require (1) modifying the wing ribs at Wing Station (WS) 39; (2)
inspecting (one-time) the main spar lower cap and lower wing stringer No. 7 at WS 39 for cracks or corrosion; and (3)
replacing the spar cap if any cracks are found and treating any corrosion found. The proposed inspections would be
accomplished in accordance with the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS section of Twin Commander SB No. 211, Revision
1, dated July 7, 1992. Replacing the spar cap, if required, would be accomplished in accordance with Twin Commander
Custom Kit 144, Revision A, dated November 12, 1992; or AVIADESIGN, Inc. Supplemental Type Certificate SA5740NM,
dated July 16, 1992, as applicable.



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the 10 comments received.

Five commenters concur with the proposal as written.

One commenter recommends excluding Model 685 airplanes that show no signs of corrosion based on the inspection required
by AD 91-08-09. The commenter feels that the proposal is unreasonably burdensome to private aviation
(i.e., 14 CFR part 91 operators) and should not be mandatory. The FAA does not concur. AD 91-08-09 requires
inspecting for corrosion on the main wing spar lower cap, but the inspection procedure will not detect cracks in the
wing front spar lower cap (spar cap). Even if the inspection required by AD 91-08-09 reveals corrosion,
there is no assurance that cracks at WS 39 do not exist. The purpose of the proposal is to provide a way to detect and correct
cracks at WS 39. The FAA has determined that these cracks or failures of the WS 39 wing rib can occur on airplanes in any
type of operation, and that this action is the best course to achieve the safety objective of returning the airplane
to its original certification level of safety. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment.

Another commenter, the Civil Aviation Authority of Australia (CAA), recommends replacing the wing spar cap before
the next 500 hours time-in-service (TIS) if corrosion is found, instead of treating any corrosion found. The CAA states
that, if a corroded spar is not replaced, then the small fatigue crack formed as a result of the corrosion will grow to
weaken the spar to a level below its design strength. The FAA is currently conducting a study to determine the fatigue
crack growth rates from irregular corroded surfaces. Part of this study includes the consideration of a replacement
time period for spar caps found corroded. When this study is complete, the FAA will consider taking further AD action
to cover this issue. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment.

A third commenter states that the inspection should be repetitive. This is one of the items the FAA is considering in
the current study to determine the fatigue crack growth rates from irregular corroded surfaces. When this study is
complete, the FAA will consider taking further AD action to cover this issue. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result
of this comment.

A fourth commenter requests a change in the compliance time from 50 hours TIS to 180 days. This commenter believes that
there will be a jam of airplanes in service shops, causing a possible parts shortage or forcing airplane owners/operators
to utilize less qualified shops in order to meet the deadline. The FAA does not concur. Twin Commander has assured the
FAA that there are adequate parts available for all repairs that could be required. In addition, the FAA has determined
that there is an adequate number of certified maintenance shops available to accomplish the actions on all airplanes
within the proposed compliance time. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment.

A fifth commenter, the Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation, requests that the preamble of the proposal change to
reflect that, of the 13 airplanes reported to have cracked spar caps, 12 were examined in detail and none had cracks
exceeding the specified limits. The FAA concurs, and, because the entire preamble of the proposal is not repeated
in the final rule action, the FAA is so noting this fact.

After careful review of all available information including the comments referenced above, the FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for minor editorial corrections.
The FAA has determined that these minor corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden
upon the public than was already proposed.

The FAA estimates that 439 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
168 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55
an hour (total labor cost of $9,240 per airplane). Parts cost approximately $1,300 per airplane. Based on these figures,
the total cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,627,060 ($10,540 per airplane). As previously
discussed, 89 of the 439 affected airplanes have already accomplished the required actions. This reduces the cost
impact of this AD upon U.S. operators from $4,627,060 to $3,689,000.

In addition, if the required inspection reveals cracks or corrosion that exceeds a certain amount, replacing the
spar cap will be required at a cost of approximately $100,000 per airplane, parts and labor included. An airplane affected
by this AD could have a compliance cost as low as approximately $10,540 (labor + parts) if cracks or corrosion is not
found during the inspection, and as high as approximately $110,540 (inspection and modification + spar cap replacement)
if the operator replaces the spar cap.

Based on an expected average remaining operating life of 30 years per affected airplane, the annualized compliance
cost would be:

 If only inspecting the spar cap and wing rib at WS 39 and modifying at WS 39 are necessary: $10,540  x  0.8145
(capital recovery factor at a 7 percent interest rate) = $858 annualized cost; or

A If replacing the spar cap is necessary: approximately $110,540  x  0.8145 (capital recovery factor
at a 7 percent interest rate) = $9,003 annualized cost.

The required AD's from Dockets No. 92-CE-26-AD (for Model 690B and No. 92-CE-58
AD (for Models 685, 690, 690A, and 690B) will also affect certain airplanes included in this AD. The compliance costs
of these other AD's will add to the cost discussed above. However, replacing the spar cap will only be required once,
so the $100,000 replacement cost, if required, is a one-time action.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
or disproportionally burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires government agencies to determine whether
rules would have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' and, in cases where
they would, conduct a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in which alternatives to the rule are considered. FAA Order
2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, outlines FAA procedures and criteria for complying with
the RFA. Small entities are defined as small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations that are independently
owned and operated or airports operated by small governmental jurisdictions.

The 350 U.S.-registered airplanes affected by this AD that have not complied with Twin Commander SB No. 211, Revision
1, dated July 7, 1992, are owned according to the following breakdown: 60 by individuals, 2 by U.S. government agencies,
9 by states or local governments, and 279 by other entities. Twenty entities own more than one of the affected airplanes:
one owns 7, one owns 5, another owns 4, and the other seventeen own 2 each.

The FAA cannot determine the sizes of all the affected non-individual owner entities nor the relative significance
of the costs estimated above. Because of these uncertainties, no cost thresholds for significant economic impact
can be reasonably determined. Based on the possibility that this AD could have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities, the FAA conducted a regulatory flexibility analysis. A copy of this analysis may be obtained
by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption 

ADDRESSES

.
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does costs
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979) because
of substantial public interest; and, (3) may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The FAA has conducted an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Analysis and has considered alternatives
to this action that could minimize the impact on small entities. A copy of this analysis may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption 

ADDRESSES

. After careful consideration, the FAA has determined that the required action is the best course to achieve the safety

Airworthiness Directives: Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation Models 500S and 690B Airplanes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that applies to certain Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation
(Twin Commander) Models 500S and 690B airplanes. This action requires removing a sample of the wing front spar lower
cap (spar cap) material for examination, and, depending upon the results of that examination, inspecting or replacing
the spar cap. Reports of cracks caused by stress corrosion in the spar cap on several of the affected airplanes prompted
this action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the wing structure caused by cracks
in the spar cap.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that applies to certain Twin Commander
Models 500S and 690B airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 30, 1993 (58 FR 34957). The action proposed to require removing a sample of the spar cap material for examination,
and, depending upon the results of the examination, inspecting or replacing the spar cap. The proposed inspections
would be accomplished in accordance with Twin Commander SB No. 215, dated March 3, 1992. The proposed replacements,
if necessary, would be accomplished in accordance with one of the following, as applicable: 



 Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK-144, Revision A, dated November 12, 1992, which applies to Twin Commander
Model 690B airplanes;

 Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK-145, dated August 21, 1992, which applies to Twin Commander Model 500S
airplanes; or 

 AVIADESIGN, Inc. Supplemental Type Certificate (STC), dated July 16, 1992, which applies to Twin Commander
Model 690B airplanes. 

Of the 80 affected airplanes registered in the United States, 34 have already accomplished this inspection in accordance
with Twin Commander SB No. 215, dated March 3, 1992. For five of these airplanes, or approximately 15 percent, the examination
revealed a grain structure that would require spar cap replacement under the criteria of this proposed AD. These five
airplane operators voluntarily replaced the spar cap in order to assure safety of their airplane. 

Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the 10 comments received.

Eight commenters concur with the proposed rule as written. 

One commenter recommends deleting the terms ``fine equi-axed'' and ``unusual cap grain structure'' from the proposal.
This commenter states that there is no standard for grain structure in aluminum alloy products and believes that characterizing
the spar cap grain structure as unusual is inappropriate and may not focus on the best course of corrective action.
The Commenter also states that the word fine in ``fine equi-axed grain structure'' is so imprecise that the structure
is unable to be accurately measured. The FAA concurs that ``unusual grain structure'' could be inappropriate and
has changed the wording in the final rule AD to ``smaller than the large elongated grains, but not fine equi-axed''.
The FAA does not concur that the term ``fine equi-axed'' is imprecise because the FAA included in the proposal (Note
2) a definition of this term. In addition, the EMTEC Corporation, which is the laboratory conducting the metallurgical
examinations, has established, with the FAA and Twin Commander, the acceptable grain structure size of the spar cap.


This commenter also states that the grain structure should not be the sole indicator of susceptibility to stress corrosion.
The FAA concurs. The affected airplanes are also included in the applicability of the actions specified in Dockets
No. 92-CE-38-AD and No. 92-CE-43-AD, which require other inspections of the spar
cap. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment. 

The same commenter also recommends consideration of other comprehensive corrective actions that deal with the impact
of design and operating stress and sources of bi-metallic-initiated general corrosion. The FAA has determined that
the current corrective action is one that will return the airplane to its original certification level of safety.
The FAA will evaluate any detailed corrective action, and, if determined to provide an equivalent level of safety,
will approve it as an alternative method of compliance to that portion of the required action. The proposed AD is unchanged
as a result of this comment. 

Another commenter, the Civil Aviation Authority of Australia (CAA), recommends that the FAA expand the range of serial
numbers in the applicability and expand the spar cap replacement to include all unusual grain structures as well as
fine equi-axed grain structures. The FAA has re-examined all information related to this subject and has determined
that the airplanes manufactured with spars of the fine equi-axed grain structure are limited to those manufactured
between May 1978 and October 1979. The results of inspections received to date including those from the CAA verify
this conclusion. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment. 


After examining all available information including the comments referenced above, the FAA has determined that
air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for the minor wording change
and minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these minor corrections will not change the meaning
of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed. 

The FAA estimates that 80 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
15 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55
an hour. Parts cost approximately $32 per airplane, and the metallurgical inspection will cost approximately $150.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $81,360. As previously
discussed, 34 of the 80 affected airplanes have already accomplished the required actions. This reduces the cost
impact of this AD upon U.S. operators to $56,392. The manufacturer will also incur the cost of the required metallurgical
examination. The EMTEC Corporation will bill the manufacturer and send the results of the required inspection to
the airplane owner/operator. This will further reduce the cost impact upon U.S. operators by $8,400 from $56,392
to $47,992.

In addition, if the required examination reveals a fine equi-axed grain structure, replacing the spar cap will be
required at a cost of approximately $100,000, parts and labor included. If the required examination reveals an unusual
grain structure that was not a fine equi-axed structure, inspecting the spar cap for stress corrosion will be required
at a cost of approximately $2,750 (50 workhours at $55 per hour). An airplane affected by this AD could have a compliance
cost as low as $1,007 if the spar cap was found acceptable during the metallurgical examination, and as high as approximately
$100,857 if the operator replaces the spar cap.

Based on an expected average remaining operating life of 30 years per affected airplane, the annualized compliance
cost would be:

 If only a metallurgical examination is necessary: $1,007^$150 (cost incurred by manufacturer)=$857 x 0.8145
(capital recovery factor at an interest rate of 7 percent)=$70 annualized cost; or 

 If replacing the spar cap is necessary: approximately $100,857 x 0.8145 (capital recovery factor at
an interest rate of 7 percent)=$8,215 annualized cost.

The required AD's from Dockets No. 92-CE-38-AD (for Model 690B), No. 92-CE-43-AD
(for Model 500S), and 92-CE-58-AD (for both Models 500S and 690B) also affect certain airplanes
included in this AD. The compliance costs of these other AD's add to the cost discussed above. However, replacing the
spar cap is only required once, so the $100,000 replacement cost, if required, would be a one-time action.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
or disproportionally burdened by government regulations.The RFA requires government agencies to determine whether
rules would have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' and, in cases where
they would, conduct a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in which alternatives to the rule are considered. FAA Order
2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, outlines FAA procedures and criteria for complying with
the RFA. Small entities are defined as small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations that are independently
owned and operated or airports operated by small governmental jurisdictions.

Of the 56 U.S.-registered airplanes affected by this AD that have not complied with Twin Commander SB No. 215, dated
March 3, 1992, no owner owns more than one. Of these 56 different owners, 50 are businesses, not-for-profit enterprises,
or state or local governments; and six are individuals.

The FAA cannot determine the sizes of all the 50 non-individual owner entities nor the relative significance of the
costs estimated above. Because of these uncertainties, no cost thresholds for significant economic impact can be
reasonably determined. Based on the possibility that this AD could have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities, the FAA conducted a regulatory flexibility analysis. A copy of this analysis may be obtained by
contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption 

ADDRESSES.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between

have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979) because

[Amended]



2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new AD:






94-04-11 Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation:

 Amendment 39-8831; Docket No. 92-CE-26-AD.






Applicability:

 The following Model and serial number airplanes, certificated in any category: 








Compliance:

 Required within the next 50 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, unless already accomplished.

To prevent failure of the wing structure caused by stress corrosion cracks in the wing front spar lower cap, accomplish
the following:

(a) Remove a sample (coupon) of the wing front spar lower cap in accordance with the INSTRUCTIONS: PART I section (Model
500S airplanes) or the INSTRUCTIONS: PART II section (Models 690B airplanes) of Twin Commander Service Bulletin
(SB) No. 215, dated March 3, 1992, as applicable. Prior to further flight, send this coupon for a metallurgical examination
to the EMTEC Corporation, 124 East Sheridan, suite 101, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73104, and wait for the results of
the examination.






Note 1:

 The manufacturer will incur the cost of the required metallurgical examination. The EMTEC Corporation will bill
the manufacturer and send the results of the inspection to the airplane owner/operator.




(b) If the results of the metallurgical examination required by paragraph (a) of this AD reveal a fine equi-axed grain
structure, prior to further flight, replace the wing front spar lower cap in accordance with the instructions in one
of the following, as applicable:

(1) For Model 690B, Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK-144, Revision A, dated November 12, 1992;

(2) For Model 500S, Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK-145, dated August 21, 1992; or 

(3) For Model 690B, AVIADESIGN, Inc. Supplemental Type Certificate SA5740NM.






Note 2:

 A fine equi-axed grain structure refers to a grain structure that is approximately equal in all three axes and the grains
are considerably smaller than what is typical of the wing spar extrusion. This is in contrast to the elongated, highly
directional grain structure with relatively large grains typical of the wing spar extrusion.




(c) If the results of the metallurgical examination required by paragraph (a) of this AD reveal a grain structure that
is smaller than the large elongated grains, but not fine equi-axed, prior to further flight, inspect the wing front
spar lower cap for stress corrosion cracking in accordance with an inspection procedure approved by the Manager,
Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Northwest Mountain Region.

(1) Send the result of this inspection in writing to the FAA at the address specified in paragraph (e) of this AD, within
10 days after the inspection or 15 days after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later. State whether any
cracks or corrosion was found, the location and length of any cracks found, and the location and depth of any corrosion
found. (Reporting approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB No. 2120-0056).

(2) If any cracks are found, prior to further flight, replace the wing front spar lower cap in accordance with the instructions
in one of the following, as applicable:

(i) For Model 690B, Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK-144, Revision A, dated November 12, 1992;

(ii) For Model 500S, Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK-145, dated August 21, 1992; or

(iii) For Model 690B, AVIADESIGN, Inc. Supplemental Type Certificate SA5740NM.

(d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with 14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location
where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.

(e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an equivalent level of
safety may be approved by the Manager, Seattle ACO, FAA, Northwest Mountain Region, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton,
Washington 98055-4056. The request shall be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector,
who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO, FAA, Northwest Mountain Region






Note 3:

 Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Seattle ACO, FAA, Northwest Mountain Region.




(f) The inspections required by this AD shall be done in accordance with Twin Commander Service Bulletin, No. 215,
dated March 3, 1992. The replacement (as applicable) required by this AD shall be done in accordance with the instructions
to either Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK-144, Revision A, dated November 12, 1992; or Twin Commander Custom
Kit No. CK-145, dated August 21, 1992, whichever is applicable. This incorporation by reference was approved
by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. Copies may be obtained from
Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation, 19003 59th Drive, NE, Arlington, Washington 98223. Copies may be inspected

Airworthiness Directives: Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation Models 500, 560A, 560E, 680, 680E, and 720 Airplanes




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that applies to certain Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation
(Twin Commander) Models 500, 560A, 560E, 680, 680E, and 720 airplanes. This action requires inspecting the wing front
spar lower cap (spar cap) for interference, fretting, or corrosion between the firewall flange and spar cap flange
at Wing Station (WS) 96, and clearing any interference, repairing any fretting or corrosion damage, and replacing
any cracked spar cap. Reports of two of the affected airplanes have cracked spar caps at WS 96 prompted this action.
The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the wing structure caused by a cracked spar cap at
WS 96.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that applies to certain Twin Commander
Models 500, 560A, 560E, 680, 680E, and 720 airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 30, 1993 (58 FR 34950). The action proposed to require inspecting the spar cap for interference, fretting,
or corrosion between the firewall flange and spar cap flange at WS 96, and clearing any interference, repairing any
fretting or corrosion damage, and replacing any cracked spar cap. The proposed inspection and repair, if applicable,
would be accomplished in accordance with Twin Commander SB No. 212, dated November 3, 1992.




Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the nine comments received.

Seven commenters concur with the proposal as written.

One commenter, the Civil Aviation Authority of Australia (CAA), states that the proposal should require an eddy current
inspection of the spar cap. The CAA questions whether fretting and corrosion are the sole contributors to fatigue
damage to WS 96, or if these merely aggravate what is already a fatigue-sensitive location. The CAA goes on to state
that, if a crack can start from a corrosion pit as small as 0.006 inches (as happened on a Swedish airplane), then there
is a good chance that even a clean airplane will crack over time. Also, the CAA states that, if a fatigue crack has started
at the base of a corrosion pit, the blending of the corrosion will smear over the crack and conceal it from the dye penetrant
inspection (which is called for in the SB), and that an eddy current inspection is the only method for detection of this
crack. The FAA does not concur. The proposal relates to fretting that may occur because interference between a firewall
stiffener and the forward flange of the lower spar cap. It would require action for fatigue cracks found as a result
of this interference and fretting. Fretting does have a synergistic relationship with corrosion and fatigue, and
its existence greatly accelerates fatigue crack growth. The FAA has received no reports of fatigue cracks in the affected
area that were not a direct result of fretting. Also, the spar cap at WS 96 is extremely difficult to inspect using eddy
current methods because of other structures in the area interfering with placement of the eddy current probe. Dye
penetrant inspections are used extensively in the aviation industry and have proved very reliable in detecting cracks.
The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment.

Another commenter, the Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation states that owners/operators should have their airplanes
inspected regardless of whether the spar cap has been replaced because interference may even exist on a new spar. The
FAA concurs that interference may exist if a new spar is installed, unless it was installed in accordance with replacement
procedures obtained from the manufacturer through the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (as specified
in paragraph (a)(3) of the proposed AD). The Seattle Aircraft Certification Office has not issued any of these procedures
to airplane owners/operators; therefore, no airplane has the spar cap replaced in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)
of the proposal and the proposal would affect all of the airplanes listed under the Applicability section. The proposed
AD is unchanged as a result of this comment.

After careful review of all available information including the comments referenced above, the FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for minor editorial corrections.
The FAA has determined that these minor corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden
upon the public than was already proposed.

The FAA estimates that 332 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by the proposed AD, that it will take approximately
20 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required inspection, and that the average labor rate is approximately
$55 an hour. Parts to accomplish the required inspection cost approximately $20. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the inspection specified in this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $371,840. One airplane owner
has already accomplished the required inspection, and found no damage or cracks.




In addition, if the required inspection reveals cracks, or corrosion that exceeds certain limits, replacing the
spar cap would be required at a cost of approximately $100,000, parts and labor included. An airplane affected by this
AD could have a compliance cost as low as approximately $1,120 (labor + parts) if no cracks, interference, or corrosion
damage is found during the inspection, and as high as approximately $101,120 (inspection + spar cap replacement)
if the operator replaces the spar cap.

Based on these airplanes having an expected average remaining operating life of 10 years or 15 years, the annualized
compliance cost would range between:

 If only inspecting the spar cap at WS 96 is necessary for airplanes with an average remaining operating life
of 10 years: $1,120 x 0.14349 (10-year capital recovery factor at a 7 percent interest rate)=$168 annualized
cost;


 If only inspecting the spar cap at WS 96 is necessary for airplanes with an average remaining operating life
of 15 years: $1,120 x 0.11434 (15-year capital recovery factor at a 7 percent interest rate)=$126;


 If replacing the spar cap is necessary for airplanes with an average remaining operating life of 10 years: approximately
$101,120 x 0.15349 (capital recovery factor at a 7 percent interest rate)=$15,520; or

 If replacing the spar cap is necessary for airplanes with an average remaining operating life of 15 years: approximately
$101,120 x 0.11434 (capital recovery factor at a 7 percent interest rate)=$11,562.



The required AD's from Dockets No. 92-CE-43-AD (for Models 500, 560A, 560E, 680, 680E, and 720) and
No. 92-CE-58-AD (for Models 685, 690, 690A, and 690B) will also affect certain airplanes included
in this AD. The compliance costs of these other required AD's would add to the cost discussed above. However, replacing
the spar cap would only be required once, so the $100,000 replacement cost, if required, would be a one-time action.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
or disproportionally burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires government agencies to determine whether
rules would have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' and, in cases where
they would, conduct a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in which alternatives to the rule are considered. FAA Order
2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, outlines FAA procedures and criteria for complying with
the RFA. Small entities are defined as small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations that are independently
owned and operated or airports operated by small governmental jurisdictions.

The 331 U.S.-registered airplanes affected by the required AD that have not complied with Twin Commander SB No. 212,
dated November 3, 1992, are owned according to the following breakdown: 196 by individuals, 2 by U.S. government agencies,
7 by states or local governments, and 126 by other entities. Six entities own 2 airplanes each.

The FAA cannot determine the sizes of all the affected non-individual owner entities nor the relative significance
of the costs estimated above. Because of these uncertainties, no cost thresholds for significant economic impact
can be reasonably determined. Based on the possibility that this AD could have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities, the FAA conducted a regulatory flexibility analysis. A copy of this analysis may be obtained
by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption 

``ADDRESSES''

.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979) because
of substantial public interest; and, (3) may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The FAA has conducted an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Analysis and has considered alternatives
to this action that could minimize the impact on small entities. A copy of this analysis may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption 

``ADDRESSES''

. After careful consideration, the FAA has determined that the required action is the best course to achieve the safety
objective of returning the airplane to its original certification level of safety.

Airworthiness Directives: Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation 500, 600, and 700 Series Airplanes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment supersedes Airworthiness Directive (AD) 65-06-01, which currently requires repetitively
inspecting the wing front spar lower cap (spar cap) of both the left and right wings on certain Twin Commander Aircraft
Corporation (Twin Commander) 500 and 600 series airplanes, and replacing any cracked spar cap. Front spar cap cracks
developing on certain Twin Commander model airplanes not affected by that AD prompted this action. In addition, the
manufacturer has updated the inspection procedures through improved service information. This action retains
the inspection and repair requirements of AD 65-06-01, and requires inspecting in accordance with updated
service information and increases the applicability to include other model airplanes. The actions specified by
this AD are intended to prevent failure of the wing structure caused by cracks in the spar cap.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that would apply to certain Twin Commander
500, 600, and 700 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register 

on June 30, 1993 (58 FR 34955). The action proposed to supersede AD 65-06-01 with a new AD that would (1) retain
the inspection and repair requirements of the spar caps required by AD 65-06-01; (2) incorporate the updated
service information into the proposed AD; and (3) increase the effectivity of the current AD to include other airplane
models of the Twin Commander 500, 600, and 700 series. The proposed inspections would be accomplished in accordance
with Twin Commander SB No. 90C, dated March 30, 1992, and Twin Commander Service Publications revision notice of SB
No. 90C, Revision 1, dated June 5, 1992.



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the 10 comments received.

Nine commenters concur with the proposal as written.

Twin Commander supports the proposal and makes recommendations. Twin Commander states that the Compliance section
of the proposal contains the following: ``* * * or 500 hours after the wing front lower spar cap was replaced
in accordance with one of the three modifications referenced in paragraph (b) of this AD * * *'', and
points out that paragraph (b) of this AD only specifies two modifications and that the wording in the Compliance section
of the proposal should be changed accordingly. The FAA concurs and has changed the proposed AD by inserting the words
``in accordance with one of the two modifications'' in place of ``in accordance with one of the three modifications''
under the Compliance section.

Twin Commander also states that the proposed AD should include the Model 680F(P) airplanes in the applicability to
coincide with SB 90C. The FAA concurs that these airplanes should be included. Adding this airplane model to the applicability
goes beyond the scope of what was originally proposed, and would obligate the FAA to issue a supplemental notice of
proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to allow additional time for the public to comment. The FAA has determined that the additional
comment time is unnecessary for the model airplanes included in the applicability of the proposed AD, and, after the
proposed rule becomes final, the FAA will issue an NPRM to add the Model 680F(P) airplanes into the applicability of
that AD. The proposed rule is unchanged as a result of this comment.

After careful review of all available information including the comments referenced above, the FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for the minor wording change
and other minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these minor corrections will not change the meaning
of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed.

The FAA estimates that 1,303 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
32 (average) workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately
$55 an hour. Parts are not required for 1,054 airplanes, and parts cost approximately $700 per airplane for 105 airplanes
and $1,700 per airplane for 144 airplanes. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the inspections specified
in this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,611,580 (cost per airplane varies by model).

<TEXT>
 

AD 65-06-01 currently requires the same actions as this AD on 1,025 of 1,303 airplanes. Of the remaining
307 airplanes affected by this AD, the FAA estimates that it will take approximately 18 workhours for 156 airplanes
and 100 workhours for 151 airplanes, depending upon the particular model. Parts are not required for 156 airplanes
and cost approximately $1,700 for 151 airplanes. Based on these figures, the cost impact of this AD upon U.S. operators
not already affected by AD 65-06-01 is approximately $1,241,640 (cost per airplane varies by model).

In addition, if the required inspection reveals cracks in the spar cap, replacing the spar cap is required at a cost
of approximately $100,000, parts and labor included. An airplane affected by this AD could have a compliance cost
as low as approximately $990 (18 workhours) or $7,200 (100 workhours) if cracks were not found during the inspection,
and as high as approximately $100,990 (inspection using 18 workhours + spar replacement) to $107,200 (inspection
using 100 workhours + spar replacement) if the operator replaces the spar cap.

The FAA estimates that the airplanes affected by the required AD are utilized an average of approximately 200 hours
time-in-service per year, or an average time-interval between the required inspections of 2.5 years.

Based on an expected average remaining operating life of 20 years per affected airplane, the annualized compliance
cost would be:


 If only repetitively inspecting the spar cap is necessary at 18 workhours: $456 annualized cost (using a 7 percent
interest rate);

 If only repetitively inspecting the spar is necessary at 100 workhours: $2,700 annualized cost (using a 7 percent
interest rate); or 

 If replacing the spar cap is necessary: approximately $9,971 annualized cost (with 18 workhours for inspection
and using a 7 percent interest rate) and $10,372 annualized cost (with 100 workhours for inspection and using a 7 percent
interest rate) if the spar cap is replaced during the first inspection.

The required AD's from Dockets No. 92-CE-26-AD (for Model 500S), No. 92-CE-57-AD
(for Models 500, 560A, 560E, 680, 680E, and 720), and No. 92-CE-58-AD (for Models 500S, 500U, 680FL,
680W, and 681), also affect certain airplanes included in this AD. The compliance costs of these AD's add to the cost
discussed above. However, replacing the spar cap is only required once, so the $100,000 replacement cost, if required,
would be a one-time action.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
or disproportionally burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires government agencies to determine whether
rules would have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' and, in cases where
they would, conduct a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in which alternatives to the rule are considered. FAA Order
2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, outlines FAA procedures and criteria for complying with
the RFA. Small entities are defined as small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations that are independently
owned and operated or airports by small governmental jurisdictions.

The 307 U.S.-registered airplanes affected by this AD that are not already affected by AD 65-06-01 are
owned according to the following breakdown: 80 by individuals, 3 by U.S. government agencies, 9 by states or local
governments, and 215 by other entities. Four entities own more than one of the affected airplanes that are not affected
by AD 65-06-01: two own 2 each, and two own 5 each. Three entities own models that will be affected by this
AD, as well as AD 65-06-01.

The FAA cannot determine the sizes of all the affected non-individual owner entities nor the relative significance
of the costs estimated above. Because of these uncertainties, no cost thresholds for significant economic impact
can be reasonably determined. The FAA solicited comments concerning the impact of the NPRM on owners of affected airplanes,
and received no comments on this matter. Based on the possibility that this AD could have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities, the FAA conducted a regulatory flexibility analysis. A copy of this analysis may be obtained
by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ``

ADDRESSES

''.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979) because
of substantial public interest; and, (3) if promulgated, may have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The FAA has conducted an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Analysis and
has considered alternatives to this action that could minimize the impact on small entities. A copy of this analysis
may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ``

ADDRESSES

''. After careful consideration, the FAA has determined that the required action is the best course to achieve the
safety objective of returning the airplane to its original certification level of safety.

Airworthiness Directives: Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation 500, 680, 681, 685, and 690 Series Airplanes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment supersedes Airworthiness Directive (AD) 91-08-09, which currently requires the following
on certain Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation (Twin Commander) 500, 680, 681, 685, and 690 series airplanes: Repetitively
inspecting the wing front spar lower cap (spar cap) for corrosion; and replacing the spar cap if corrosion exceeds
certain limits. This action incorporates updated and more detailed inspection procedures, extends the repetitive
inspection intervals, and provides the option of incorporating one of three modifications as terminating action
for the repetitive inspections. The actions specified by the AD are intended to prevent wing structural damage that,
if not detected, could progress to the point of failure.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that applies to certain Twin Commander
Models 685, 690, 690A, and 690B airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 30, 1993 (58 FR 34952). The proposed AD would supersede AD 91-08-09 with a new AD that would (1) retain
the requirement of repetitively inspecting the spar cap, and replacing the spar cap if certain corrosion limits are
exceeded; (2) incorporate Twin Commander SB No. 208A, dated November 9, 1992; and (3) incorporate spar cap replacement
procedures specified in Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK-144, Revision A, dated November 12, 1992; Twin Commander
Custom Kit No. CK-145, dated August 21, 1992; and AVIADESIGN, Inc. Supplemental Type Certificate (STC), dated
July 16, 1992.




Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the 10 comments received.


Seven commenters concur with the proposal as written.


Twin Commander states that the proposal should be changed to reflect that Custom Kit-145, which specifies procedures
for replacing the spar cap for certain airplanes, also affects Models 680W and 681. The FAA concurs and has added these
models to paragraph (b)(2) of the proposal, and has deleted paragraph (b)(4).


Another commenter, the Civil Aviation Authority of Australia (CAA), recommends replacing the wing spar cap before
the next 500 hours time-in-service (TIS) if corrosion is found, instead of treating any corrosion found. The CAA states
that, if a corroded spar is not replaced, then the small fatigue crack formed as a result of the corrosion will grow to
weaken the spar to a level below its design strength. The FAA is currently conducting a study to determine the fatigue
crack growth rates from irregular corroded surfaces. Part of this study includes the consideration of a replacement
time period for spar caps found corroded. When this study is complete, the FAA will consider taking further AD action
to cover this issue. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment.

A third commenter requests an extension of the time period for reinspection of a spar cap found not corroded from 36
calendar months to 60 calendar months. This commenter states that a well-maintained airplane that is always hangared
and removed from a coastal environment should only have these inspections every 60 months. The FAA does not concur
that this compliance time should be extended. The FAA has determined that the majority of airplanes affected by this
proposal are not maintained and operated in the conditions referenced above, and that the 36-month inspection interval
is suitable for the typical affected airplane when found corrosion-free. In addition, establishing a reliable corrosion
growth rate for these airplanes is extremely difficult, especially considering the diverse environment and operating
conditions these airplanes are approved for. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment.
After careful review of all available information, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest
require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for the minor change discussed above and minor editorial corrections.
The FAA has determined that these minor corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden
upon the public than was already proposed.
Of the 562 affected airplanes registered in the United States, 10 have already accomplished the required inspection
in accordance with Twin Commander SB No. 208A, dated November 9, 1992. None of these airplanes required spar cap replacement.
The compliance time for this AD is presented in calendar time instead of hours time-in-service (TIS). The FAA has determined
that a calendar time for compliance would be the most desirable method because the unsafe condition described by the
AD is caused by corrosion. Corrosion can occur on airplanes regardless of whether the airplane is in service. 
The FAA estimates that 562 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by this AD, that it would take between 110
and 162 workhours per airplane (varies by model; a weighted average of 146 workhours) to accomplish the required inspection,
and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based on these figures, the total initial cost impact
of the inspection specified by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,688,980 ($8,343 per airplane). As previously
discussed, 10 of the 562 affected airplanes have already accomplished the required inspection. This reduces the
initial cost impact of the inspection specified by this AD on U.S. operators to $4,432,560.
The inspections currently required by AD 91-08-09 carry an earlier FAA-estimated cost impact on U.S.
operators of $880 (16 workhours  x  $55 per hour) per airplane. In actuality, those inspections range from $1,100
(20 workhours  x  $55 per hour) to $1,980 (36 workhours  x  $55 per hour) depending on the airplane model.
Because of the more comprehensive inspection procedures specified in Twin Commander SB No. 208A, the initial cost
impact of the inspections of this AD carries an additional cost impact of between $4,950 to $6,930 per airplane over
that which is already required by AD 91-08-09. This AD provides owners of the affected airplanes some relief
from some of the provisions of AD 91-08-09. For example:
 If no corrosion is found, this AD would require repetitive inspections at 36-calendar month intervals instead
of 12-calendar month intervals, which is a savings of between $2,200 to $3,960 over the next 24 calendar months depending
on the airplane model.
 If corrosion is less than 50 percent of the allowable service limits referenced in Twin Commander SB 208A, this
AD would require reinspection at 30-calendar month intervals instead of 12-calendar month intervals, which is a
savings of between $2,750 to $4,950 over the next 30 calendar months depending on the airplane model. 
 Replacing the spar cap terminates this repetitive inspection requirement, which is a savings of $1,100 to
$1,980 per year depending on the airplane model.
In addition, if the required inspection revealed corrosion in excess of certain established limits, then replacing
the spar cap would be required at a cost of approximately $100,000, parts and labor included. If the spar cap did not
reveal corrosion in excess of certain established limits, then an airplane affected by this AD could have an incremental
compliance cost as low as $4,950 (proposed inspection cost at 110 workhours minus the cost of the inspection required
by AD 91-08-09) or $6,930 (required inspection cost at 162 workhours minus the cost of the inspection required
by AD 91-08-09). If replacing the spar cap would be necessary, an airplane affected by this AD could have
an incremental compliance cost as high as approximately $104,950 (required inspection at 110 workhours minus the
cost of the inspection required by AD 91-08-09 plus spar cap replacement) to $106,930 (required inspection
at 162 workhours minus the cost of the inspection required by AD 91-08-09 plus spar cap replacement).

The FAA cannot predict the results of the required inspections, especially as the airplanes continue to age. Approximately
61 percent of the airplanes inspected in accordance with Twin Commander SB No. 208 (AD 91-08-09) had no
significant spar cap corrosion, 24 percent had less than 50 percent of the established corrosion service limits,
and 13 percent had between 50 to 100 percent of the established corrosion service limits. Less than 3 percent of the
airplanes exceeded the established corrosion service limits.
Based on an expected average remaining operating life of 20, 25, or 30 years per affected airplane (depending on the
model), the incremental annualized compliance cost would be:
 If only repetitively inspecting the spar cap is necessary for airplanes with an average operating life of 20
years: $904 to $7,239 incremental annualized cost (depending on the airplane model and frequency of inspection,
and using a 7 percent interest rate);
 If only repetitively inspecting the spar cap is necessary for airplanes with an average operating life of 25
years: $1,195 to $7,176 incremental annualized cost (depending on the airplane model and frequency of inspection,
and using a 7 percent interest rate);
 If only repetitively inspecting the spar cap is necessary for airplanes with an average operating life of 30
years: $1,290 to $7,495 incremental annualized cost (depending on the airplane model and frequency of inspection,
and using a 7 percent interest rate);
 If replacing the spar cap is necessary for airplanes with an average operating life of 20 years: approximately
$9,675 incremental annualized cost (using a 7 percent interest rate) if the spar cap is replaced during the first inspection;
 If replacing the spar cap is necessary for airplanes with an average operating life of 25 years: approximately
$8,719 incremental annualized cost (using a 7 percent interest rate) if the spar cap is replaced during the first inspection;
and
 If replacing the spar cap is necessary for airplanes with an average operating life of 30 years: approximately
$8,145 incremental annualized cost (using a 7 percent interest rate) if the spar cap is replaced during the first inspection.
The required AD's from Dockets No. 92-CE-26-AD (for Model 500S and 690B), No. 92-CE-38-AD
(for Models 685, 690, 690A, and 690B), and No. 92-CE-43-AD (for Models 500S, 500U, 680FL, 680FL(P),
680W, and 681) will also affect certain airplanes included in this AD. The compliance costs of these other required
AD's will add to the cost discussed above. However, replacing the spar cap would only be required once, so the $100,000
replacement cost, if required, would be a one-time action.
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
or disproportionally burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires government agencies to determine whether
rules would have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' and, in cases where
they would, conduct a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in which alternatives to the rule are considered. FAA Order
2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, outlines FAA procedures and criteria for complying with
the RFA. Small entities are defined as small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations that are independently
owned and operated or airports operated by small governmental jurisdictions.
The 562 U.S.-registered airplanes affected by this AD are owned according to the following breakdown: 92 by individuals,
7 by U.S. government agencies, 20 by states or local governments, and 443 by other entities. Twenty seven entities
each own more than one of the affected airplanes: One owns 7, four own 5 each, three own 3 each and nineteen own 2 each.
The FAA cannot determine the sizes of all the affected non-individual owner entities nor the relative significance
of the costs estimated above. Because of these uncertainties, no cost thresholds for significant economic impact
can be reasonably determined. Based on the possibility that this AD could have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities, the FAA conducted a regulatory flexibility analysis. A copy of this analysis may be obtained
by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption 

``ADDRESSES

''.
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979) because
of substantial public interest; and, (3) may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The FAA has conducted an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Analysis and has considered alternatives
to this action that could minimize the impact on small entities. A copy of this analysis may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption 

ADDRESSES

. After careful consideration, the FAA has determined that the required action is the best course to achieve the safety
objective of returning the airplane to this original certification level of safety.

Airworthiness Directives; de Havilland, Inc., Model DHC-8-100 and DHC-8-300 Series Airplanes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC-8-100
and DHC-8-300 series airplanes, that requires inspections to detect breakage in the engine rear mount
strut assemblies, and replacement of broken struts. This amendment also requires eventual replacement of all currently
installed struts with new and/or reworked struts, as terminating action for the inspections. This amendment is prompted
by several reports of failure of the engine rear mount struts, due to fracture at one of the rosette welds on the shank
of the strut where full weld depth was not achieved during manufacture. The actions specified by this AD are intended
to prevent fracture of the engine rear mount struts, which could reduce the structural integrity of the nacelle and
engine support structure.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC-8-100 and DHC-8-300 series airplanes was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 55031). That action proposed to require repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect
breakage in the engine strut assemblies, and replacement of broken struts with new and/or reworked struts. That action
also proposed to require eventual replacement of the currently installed struts with new and/or reworked struts;
when accomplished, this replacement would terminate the need for the repetitive inspections. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the single comment received. 
The commenter supports the proposed rule. 
After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
The FAA estimates that 125 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 16
work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $110,000, or $880 per airplane. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption

To prevent fracture of the engine rear mount struts, and subsequent reduced structural integrity of the nacelle and
engine support structure, accomplish the following: 


(a) Within 50 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, perform a detailed visual inspection to detect
breakage in the engine strut assemblies, part number 8711016-001, -003, -005, or -007, in
accordance with De Havilland, Inc., Service Bulletin S.B. 8-71-17, dated April 3, 1992. 


(1) If any broken strut is detected, prior to further flight, replace the broken strut with a new strut, part number
87110016-009, or a reworked strut, part number 8DK1763-001; Post-Modification 8/1763; in accordance
with the service bulletin.

 





Note 1: 

The Post-Modification 8/1763 struts are either new struts, part number 87110016-009, or reworked struts,
part number 8DK1763-001.

 



(2) If no broken strut is detected, repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 50 flight hours. 

(b) Within 24 months after the effective date of this AD, replace all of the currently installed engine rear mount struts
with new struts, part number 87110016-009, and/or reworked struts, part number 8DK1763-001; Post-Modification
8/1763; in accordance with de Havilland, Inc., Service Bulletin S.B. 8-71-17, dated April 3, 1992. This
replacement constitutes terminating action for the repetitive inspection requirements of this AD. 

(c) As of the effective date of this AD, no person shall install an engine rear mount strut, part number 8711016-001,
-003, -005, or -007, on any airplane. 

(d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, New York Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Engine and Propeller
Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector,
who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, New York ACO.

 




Note 2:

Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC-10-10, -10F, -15, -30, -30F,
-40, and -40F Series Airplanes, and Model KC-10A (Military) Airplanes 



<AGENCY>

ACTION:

 Final rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC-10
series airplanes and Model KC-10A (military) airplanes, that requires inspections to detect cracking in the
No. 2 engine pylon lower spar forward mount and thrust link fitting attach bolts, replacement of cracked bolts, and
the eventual replacement of all bolts made of H-11 material with bolts made of Inconel. This amendment is prompted
by reports of failures of these attach bolts due to stress corrosion. The actions specified by this AD are intended
to prevent failure of the attach bolts, which could reduce the fail-safe capability of the attachment assembly.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC-10 series airplanes and Model KC-10A (military) airplanes
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 26, 1993 (58 FR 57568). That action proposed to require inspections to detect cracking in the No. 2 engine
pylon lower spar forward mount and thrust link fitting attach bolts, replacement of cracked bolts, and the eventual
replacement of all bolts made of H-11 material with bolts made of Inconel. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 

One commenter supports the proposal. 

Two commenters request that the proposed compliance time for the inspections be extended to coincide with normally
scheduled maintenance intervals. These commenters suggest that if the compliance times were extended to 24 months,
the confusion and expense of special scheduling could be avoided. The FAA does not concur. In developing the proposed
compliance time, the FAA primarily considered analyses of the mode of failure of the subject bolts due to stress corrosion,
as well as the service history of the fleet. Based on this data and the safety implications presented by loss of fail-safe
capability of the attachment assembly should the bolts fail, the FAA has determined that the proposed compliance
times of 12 months for the initial inspection and 18 months for the repetitive inspection interval are both appropriate
and warranted. Further, the FAA took into account the average utilization rate of the affected fleet, the practical
aspects of an orderly inspection of the fleet during regular maintenance periods, and the availability of required
replacement parts. The compliance times as proposed should allow ample time for the inspections to be conducted concurrently
with scheduled maintenance, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling. In light
of all of these factors, the FAA considers that any extension of the compliance intervals to be unacceptable. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 

There are approximately 354 Model DC-10 series airplanes and Model KC-10A airplanes of the affected design
in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 206 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD 

The inspections required by this AD will take approximately 8 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average
labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the inspections requirements of this
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $90,640, or $440 per airplane, per inspection cycle. 

The replacement actions required by this AD will take approximately 8 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an
average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $2,700 per airplane. Based on these
figures, the total cost impact of the replacement actions of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $646,840,
or $3,140 per airplane.

The total cost impact figures discussed above are based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of
the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were
not adopted. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action modifies the Class D airspace at Hood Army Airfield (AAF) and Robert Gray AAF, and establishes Class E airspace
at Killeen Municipal Airport, Killeen, TX. In accordance with airspace reclassification, effective September
16, 1993, the Class D airspace encompassing Killeen Municipal Airport required aircraft operators to establish
two-way communications with Hood AAF Airport Traffic Control Tower (ATCT), or when Hood ATCT was closed, Robert Gray
AAF ATCT. This action removes the airspace surrounding Killeen Municipal Airport from Hood AAF's Class D airspace,
and establishes Class E airspace around Killeen Municipal Airport. This action is intended to maintain adequate
Class D airspace and two-way radio communications at Hood AAF and Robert Gray AAF, while removing Killeen Municipal
Airport, TX, from the current Class D airspace, and establishing Class E airspace around Killeen Municipal Airport,
Killeen, TX.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


History


On January 12, 1994, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class
D airspace at Hood AAF and Robert Gray AAF and to establish Class E airspace at Killeen Municipal Airport, TX, was published
in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 1679).
Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Except for the addition of some descriptive
information in the narrative portion of the rule for the Class D airspace at Robert Gray AAF, Texas, this amendment
is the same as that proposed in the notice. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum
83. Class D airspace designations are published in paragraph 5000, and Class E airspace areas designated as surface
areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September
16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298 July 6, 1993). The Class D and Class E airspace
designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.

The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations, modifies the Class D airspace at Hood Army Airfield
(AAF) and Robert Gray AAF to remove the Class D airspace surrounding Killeen Municipal Airport from Hood AAF's Class
D airspace and establishes Class E airspace around Killeen Municipal Airport, Killeen, TX.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need
frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the antibiotic drug regulations by updating, making noncontroversial
technical changes, and making corrections in accepted standards of antibiotic and antibiotic-containing drugs
for human use. These changes will result in more accurate and usable regulations.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA is amending the antibiotic drug regulations by updating, making noncontroversial technical changes, and making
corrections in certain antibiotic drug regulations that provide for accepted standards of antibiotic and antibiotic-containing
drugs intended for human use.


In  442.216a(a)(1) (21 CFR 442.216a(a)(1)), separate limits for the pyridine content are being given for the


L

-arginine formulation and the sodium carbonate formulation. Separate limits are needed because the current limits
allow the 

L

-arginine formulation to contain up to 5.2 milligrams (mg) of pyridine per gram (g) of ceftazidime activity, while
the sodium carbonate formulation may not contain more than 4.4 mg of pyridine per g of ceftazidime activity.
In  442.216a(b)(1)(ii)(

a

), different loss on drying procedures are given for the 

L

-arginine formulation and the sodium carbonate formulation. This is necessary because the procedure in the current
monograph would not remove all of the water from the sodium carbonate formulation of the product (some water is ``trapped''
as sodium hydrogen carbonate), and the procedure will thus lead to falsely high potency values. Because the two formulations
contain differing amounts of ceftazidime pentahydrate as a percent weight by weight of the powder blend, different
loss on drying limits are now being given for each formulation. The loss on drying limits are now not more than 12.5 percent
if it contains 

L

-arginine and not more than 13.5 percent if it contains sodium carbonate. The asymmetry of the arginine peak is also
revised from the current limit of 2.5 to a limit of 4.0. This limit is more realistic of the values obtained in this assay.
Revisions are being made in the descriptions of certain ophthalmic products (21 CFR part 444) and peptide products
(21 CFR part 448). FDA has discovered that some of these monographs contain errors that would allow formulation without
preservatives and other essential inactive ingredients to fit the monographs. FDA has not reviewed any of these products
without these ingredients and does not know if they are safe and effective. The agency is, therefore, revising certain
ophthalmic monographs to correct these errors.
In  455.185a(a)(1) (21 CFR 455.185a(a)(1)), FDA is making a revision to allow vancomycin hydrochloride for
oral solution to contain a suitable stabilizing agent. The agency has reviewed this formulation and found it to be
safe and effective.


Environmental Impact


The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required. 


Submitting Comments and Filing Objections 


These amendments institute changes that are corrective, editorial, or of a minor technical nature. Because the amendments
are not controversial, and because when effective they provide notice of accepted standards, FDA finds that notice,
public procedure, and delayed effective date are unnecessary and not in the public interest. This final rule, therefore,
becomes effective February 22, 1994. However, interested persons may, on or before March 24, 1994, submit written
comments to the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except
that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the
heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.
Any person who will be adversely affected by this final rule may file objections to it and request a hearing. Reasonable
grounds for the hearing must be shown. Any person who decides to seek a hearing must file (1) on or before March 24, 1994,
a written notice of participation and request for a hearing, and (2) on or before April 25, 1994, the data, information,
and analyses on which the person relies to justify a hearing, as specified in 21 CFR 314.300. A request for a hearing
may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and
substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. If it conclusively appears from the face of the data, information,
and factual analyses in the request for a hearing that no genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the action
taken by this order, or if a request for a hearing is not made in the required format or with the required analyses, the
Commissioner of Food and Drugs will enter summary judgment against the person(s) who request(s) the hearing, making
findings and conclusions and denying a hearing. All submissions must be filed in three copies, identified with the
docket number appearing in the heading of this document and filed with the Dockets Management Branch.
The procedures and requirements governing this order, a notice of participation and request for a hearing, a submission
of data, information, and analyses to justify a hearing, other comments, and grant or denial of a hearing are contained
in 21 CFR 314.300.
All submissions under this order, except for data and information prohibited from public disclosure under 21 U.S.C.
331(j) or 18 U.S.C. 1905, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

Ceftazidime pentahydrate for injection.


(a) 

Requirements for certification

_(1) 

Standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity

. Ceftazidime pentahydrate for injection is a dry mixture of ceftazidime pentahydrate and sodium carbonate or 

L

-arginine. Its ceftazidime potency is satisfactory if each milligram of ceftazidime pentahydrate for injection
contains not less than 900 micrograms and not more than 1,050 micrograms of cefazidime activity when corrected for
both loss on drying and its sodium carbonate or 

L

-arginine content, as appropriate for the formulation. Its ceftazidime content is satisfactory if it is not less
than 90 percent and not more than 120 percent of the number of milligrams of ceftazidime that it is represented to contain.
It is sterile. It is nonpyrogenic. Its loss on drying is not more than 12.5 percent if it contains 

L

-arginine and not more than 13.5 percent if it contains sodium carbonate. The pH of its aqueous solution is not less
than 5.0 and not more than 7.5. Its pyridine content, if it contains sodium carbonate, is not more than 0.4 percent,
except that for the issuance of a certificate for each batch of the sodium carbonate formulation, the pyridine content
is not more than 0.12 percent. Its pyridine content, if it contains 

L

-arginine, is not more than 0.3 percent, except that for the issuance of a certificate, the pyridine content of the


L-

arginine formulation is not more than 0.10 percent. The ceftazidime pentahydrate conforms to the standard prescribed
by  442.16a(a)(1).

Antibiotic Drugs; Vancomycin Hydrochloride Injection



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the antibiotic drug regulations to provide for the inclusion of
accepted standards for a new dosage form of vancomycin hydrochloride, vancomycin hydrochloride injection. The
manufacturer has supplied sufficient data and information to establish its safety and efficacy.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA has evaluated data submitted in accordance with regulations promulgated under section 507 of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 357), as amended, with respect to a request for approval of a new dosage form of vancomycin
hydrochloride, vancomycin hydrochloride injection. The agency has concluded that the data supplied by the manufacturer
concerning this antibiotic drug are adequate to establish its safety and efficacy when used as directed in the labeling
and that the regulations should be amended in 21 CFR part 455 to provide for the inclusion of accepted standards for
this product.


Environmental Impact


The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.


Submitting Comments and Filing Objections


This final rule announces standards that FDA has accepted in a request for approval of an antibiotic drug. Because
this final rule is not controversial and because when effective it provides notice of accepted standards, FDA finds
that notice and comment procedure is unnecessary and not in the public interest. This final rule, therefore, is effective
March 24, 1994. However, interested persons may, on or before March 24, 1994, submit written comments to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Any person who will be adversely affected by this final rule may file objections to it and request a hearing. Reasonable
grounds for the hearing must be shown. Any person who decides to seek a hearing must file (1) on or before March 24, 1994,
a written notice of participation and request for a hearing, and (2) on or before April 25, 1994, the data, information,
and analyses on which the person relies to justify a hearing, as specified in 21 CFR 314.300. A request for a hearing
may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and
substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. If it conclusively appears from the face of the data, information,
and factual analyses in the request for hearing that no genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the action
taken by this order, or if a request for a hearing is not made in the required format or with the required analyses, the
Commissioner of Food and Drugs will enter summary judgment against the person(s) who request(s) the hearing, making
findings and conclusions and denying a hearing. All submissions must be filed in three copies, identified with the
docket number appearing in the heading of this document and filed with the Dockets Management Branch.
The procedures and requirements governing this order, a notice of participation and request for a hearing, a submission
of data, information, and analyses to justify a hearing, other comments, and grant or denial of a hearing are contained
in 21 CFR 314.300.
All submissions under this order, except for data and information prohibited from public disclosure under 21 U.S.C.
331(j) or 18 U.S.C. 1905, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS); Coverage of Screening Mammography and
Papanicolaou (PAP) Tests, Certified Marriage and Family Therapists, and Requirements for Coverage and Reimbursement
of Services of Physicians in Teaching Settings


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Secretary, DoD.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule revises the exclusions and limitations of the CHAMPUS regulation pertaining to preventive care and
unnecessary diagnostic tests not related to a specific illness, injury, or definitive set of symptoms, to allow coverage
for screening mammography and PAP tests on a preventive basis initially following the recommended guidelines of
the American Cancer Society as a basis for coverage. The final rule also removes the requirement for physician supervision
and referral for certified marriage and family therapists; requires all certified marriage and family therapists
to accept CHAMPUS payment as payment in full; ensures that the relationship of certified marriage and family therapists
is consistent with other mental health practitioners with comparable education and training; protects the CHAMPUS
beneficiary from incurring added out-of-pocket costs for care rendered that is not part of the current CHAMPUS mental
health benefits package; and better defines the specific requirements of existing CHAMPUS policies for coverage
and reimbursement of services of teaching physicians and physicians in training.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 21, 1991 (56 FR 41498), and November 12, 1991 (56 FR 57501), the Office of Secretary of Defense published for
public comment notices of proposed rulemaking to comply with sections 701 and 702 of the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 1991. These statutory provisions are codified at 10 U.S.C. 1079 (a) (2), (8), and (13). This final
rule consolidates the comments and the changes based on comments of three proposed rule amendments to implement sections
701 and 702 of the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 1991 (Pub. L. 101-510), and to revise requirements
for coverage and reimbursement of services of physicians in teaching settings. The publication of the final rule
amendments was delayed as a result of the Presidential moratorium on regulation changes. This final rule completes
the action required to amend this part as outlined in the three previously published proposed rules. The proposed
rules provided specific coverage requirements, screening frequencies, payment limitations and provider certification
requirements, for mammography and PAP tests, removed the requirement for physician supervision and referral for
certified marriage and family therapists and required all certified marriage and family therapists to accept CHAMPUS
payment as payment in full. Additionally, in FR Doc. 91-28934, appearing in the 

Federal Register

 on December 10, 1991 (56 FR 64491), the Office of Secretary of Defense also published for public comment a notice of
proposed rulemaking to revise the comprehensive CHAMPUS regulation, DoD 6010.8-R, pertaining to basic CHAMPUS
benefits to better define the specific requirements for coverage and reimbursement of services of teaching physicians
and physicians in training. We refer the reader to the proposed rules for a more detailed explanation of this change.
We provided a 30-day comment period on each of the proposed amendments to the CHAMPUS regulation. The following summarizes
the comments received following publication of each proposed rule amendment, and the actions taken based on these
comments.



Discussion of Comments for



1. Screening Mammographies and PAP Smears



We received two (2) public comments and one (1) comment from the government agencies which by law we are required to
consult with during the rulemaking process in response to the proposed rule regarding CHAMPUS coverage for screening
mammography and papanicolaou (PAP) tests related to the proposed screening frequencies for mammography and PAP
testing. A summary of the comments and our responses to them are listed below.



Comment:

 The coverage limitations for screening mammography set out in section II of the proposed rule are virtually identical
to the Medicare requirement. However, we wish to point out that the American College of Radiology and other groups
including the National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, American Medical Association, and other physician
organizations recommend that women 65 years of age or older have mammograms on an annual basis. We recommend adopting
the position of national professional organizations over Medicare current coverage policy.



Response:

 We have found your argument persuasive and have amended the language in the Final Rule to follow the expert opinion
and recommendation of national professional organizations. The amended language will allow annual screening for
women 65 years of age or older.



Comment:

 The Department of Defense has proposed adopting current Medicare regulations for use in the CHAMPUS program. Under
these regulations, screening mammography would be allowed only once every two years for ``asymptomatic women over
the age of 65.'' Mammography is the only screening device currently available that detects breast cancers before
they become palpable. Diagnosed in the early stages, breast cancer is more amenable to less invasive medical therapies.
This translates into money saved as a result of fewer and shorter hospitalizations, less radical and more inexpensive
treatments, and a lower recurrence rate. This organization believes that all women over the age of 50 should undergo
annual screening mammography and clinical breast examination as part of their overall preventive health-care plan.

<DOCNO> FR940222-0-00030 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940222-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response:

 In order to remain in keeping with nationally recognized breast cancer screening frequencies which recommend that
annual mammograms should be allowed for all women age 50 and over, we have added clarifying language to the final rule.
The new language allows women between the ages of 50 and 64 years of age to have annual mammography screening.



Comment:

 Because of greater risk, annual screening mammography is important for women 65 and over. Additionally, the proposed
rule which allowed coverage for screening PAP tests on an annual basis is inconsistent with the consensus of the scientific
community, which suggests that following three consecutive annual PAP tests with negative findings, and in the absence
of risk factors, screening may safely be decreased to every two (2) to (3) years.



Response:

 We have amended language in the final rule to allow coverage of screening PAP tests every two (2) years after three consecutive
annual exams with normal findings and in the absence of risk factors.



2. Certified Marriage and Family Therapists



We received twelve (12) public comments from five (5) interested professional organizations and three (3) comments
from the Government agencies which by law we are required to consult with during the rulemaking process in response
to the proposed rule to remove the requirement for physician supervision and referral for certified marriage and
family therapists and require all certified marriage and family therapists to accept CHAMPUS payment as payment
in full. Three (3) of the professional organizations provided similar comments. A summary of the comments and our
responses to them are listed below:



Comment: 

One commentor expressed great concern that the proposed rule contained no provision to address the need for either
medical differential diagnosis by a physician or evaluation by a mental health professional of the level of clinical
psychologist or clinical social worker. The commenter strongly urged that OCHAMPUS require that patients being
seen by any of these various categories of nonphysician mental health practitioners be evaluated by physicians,
including psychiatrists, to assure that appropriate medical care will be provided.



Response:

 We, too, share the concerns of this professional organization. However, based upon the provisions of the FY 1991 Defense
Authorization Act, as cited above, we can no longer require physician referral and supervision. We have added language
which states that patients with medical conditions must receive appropriate concurrent management by a physician.
Additionally, claims for services by certified marriage and family therapists shall continue to be reviewed in accord
with appropriate medical concepts.



Comment:

 One commenter questioned by OCHAMPUS would forward with this proposal, knowing assuredly that costs will inevitably
increase. Even with the ``payment in full'' requirements for this proposed regulation, the expansion to independent
practice and billing will be costly.



Response:

 As previously stated, this change was mandated by Congress. Program costs associated with this final amendment are
not expected to be substantial, since this amendment will eliminate administrative requirements for CHAMPUS, the
beneficiary, and the provider population.

Comment:

 The proposed rule would also permit mental health counselors and pastoral counselors to be certified and removed
from physician supervision and referral requirements. There certainly is no legislative authority for the proposed
expansion for others than marriage and family therapists, and we think this effort is misguided.



Response:

 Neither the proposed nor final rules permit mental health or pastoral counselors to practice without physician supervision
and referral. Both rules keep the requirement for physician supervision and referral for mental health and pastoral
counselors.



Comment:

 We believe it inappropriate that OCHAMPUS has gone ahead and promulgated federal criteria that would recognize independent
practice and payment under CHAMPUS for practitioners that are not permitted such legal right under state law. We do
not believe that OCHAMPUS should be usurping the traditional state role and responsibility to regulate individual
professions. This permits unregulated practice without any quality assurance to protect patients.




Response:

 CHAMPUS requires all providers comply with state licensure and certification requirements, and to practice within
the parameters of their scope of licensure. This means that if a state requires a certified marriage and family therapist
to practice with physician involvement, OCHAMPUS would also require the provider to practice within the state standard.



Comment:

 We strongly request that you add mental health counselors as mental health providers not needing physician referral.



Response:

 The legislation which mandated the removal of physician supervision and referral only authorized removal of the
requirement for one category of provider, that is, certified marriage and family therapists. By law, the physician
supervision and referral requirement is still required for services rendered by pastoral counselors and mental
health counselors under CHAMPUS.



Comment:

 We recommend correcting the national organization which offers clinical membership for marriage and family therapists
to the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy rather than the American Association of Marriage and
Family Counselors which was listed in proposed paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(D)(

2

).



Response:

 We have revised the regulatory language to reflect the correct name of the national organization which offers clinical
membership for marriage and family therapists.



Comment:

 The experience requirements delineated in  199.6(c)(3)(iv)(A)(

2

) are outdated and cumbersome to administer given the many specific requirements detailed. We recommend that CHAMPUS
change the experience requirement to reflect current American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy clinical
membership criteria. Such a change would be consistent not only with the current standards established by the nationally
recognized credentialing organization for marriage and family therapy, but it would also establish criteria consistent
with other independent CHAMPUS providers.



Response:

 We do not find this argument persuasive. A comparison of the requirements shows that the hours of training for marriage
and family therapists are identical. However, the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy standards
do not include the requirement for psychotherapy experience even though psychotherapy is one of the major services
certified marriage and family therapists provide. Since the CHAMPUS benefit does not include counseling services
and certified marriage and family therapists will primarily be providing psychotherapy services to CHAMPUS beneficiaries,
we feel a requirement for psychotherapy experience is critical.

Comment:

 We recommend that certified marriage and family therapists be removed from the ``extramedical'' provider category
( 199.6(c)(3)(iv)(A)) and be listed under ``Other allied health professionals'' as  199.6(c)(3)(iii)(H)(

3

). The American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy is concerned that the extramedical designation may lead
beneficiaries and providers to believe that a certified marriage and family therapist still requires a physician's
supervision and referral.



Response:

 CHAMPUS beneficiaries will be advised of the elimination of the physician supervision and referral requirement
for certified marriage and family therapists through changes in the beneficiary's handbook and other public news
releases. This should eliminate any confusion.



Comment:

 In paragraph (c)(3) to  199.6(c)(3)(iv), the proposed rule refers to ``paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section
for more specific information regarding licensure.'' We assume that this paragraph refers to paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(D)
of the proposed rule which discusses additional information applicable to each of the extramedical providers.



Response:

 Your assumption is correct.



Comment:

 For the sake of clarity, we believe that paragraph (c)(3) to  199.6(c)(3)(iv) should explicitly state that
``In jurisdictions that do not provide for licensure or certification, the provider must be certified by or eligible
for full clinical membership in the appropriate national professional association that sets standards for the specific
profession.'' Currently, the proposed rule could be mistakenly interpreted to mean that if providers live in a state
that does not regulate marriage and family therapy, they cannot be CHAMPUS authorized providers.



Response:

 We have incorporated the above technical revision.



Comment:

 Paragraph (c)(3) to  199.6(c)(3)(iv) also does not address the professional status of marriage and family
therapists licensed or certified in California, Michigan, and New Jersey. Although marriage and family therapists
in each of these jurisdictions meet CHAMPUS' educational and experience requirements, they are technically regulated
as marriage, family and child counselors or marriage and family counselors. We fear that California, Michigan, and
New Jersey's marriage and family therapists may be denied CHAMPUS provider status based on the semantics of a professional
title, despite the fact that the credentials and scope of practice are the same in these states as they are for marriage
and family therapists in other regulated jurisdictions.



Response:

 CHAMPUS denial of provider status is not based solely on professional title. Licensing is but one part of the marriage
and family certification and review process. Authorization as a certified marriage and family therapist under CHAMPUS
includes licensure, graduation from a regionally accredited school, a degree in an appropriate field, and post-graduate
clinical training.



Comment:

 We assume and would like to clarify that CHAMPUS providers who currently qualify as marriage and family counselors
will qualify as certified marriage and family therapists without having to redocument their credentials. We understand
that they must agree to accept the CHAMPUS allowable charge as payment in full as stipulated by proposed paragraph
4 (now paragraph 5) of  199.6(c)(3)(iv)(A)(

4

), (now paragraph (

5

)), but we do not understand the change to be a requirement for the resubmission of credential materials. We feel it
would be an administrative burden to both OCHAMPUS and individual providers to require such redocumentation of professional
qualifications. We recommend language be incorporated within the final rule to circumvent the possibility for such
an administrative nightmare.

Response: 

The legislation required that all marriage and family therapists be certified. We have interpreted this to mean that
only providers who meet the very minimum level of requirements should remain authorized under CHAMPUS. Additionally,
the legislation did not provide grandfathering provisions for marriage and family counselors already authorized
under CHAMPUS. We feel recertification will ensure CHAMPUS beneficiaries receive care provided by both certified
and qualified providers.



Comment: 

Will certified marriage and family therapists who have signed a participation agreement with OCHAMPUS be able to
terminate the agreement.



Response: 

Certified marriage and family therapists who have signed a participation agreement with OCHAMPUS may terminate
the agreement upon notification to OCHAMPUS. The participation agreement will stipulate the number of days required
for notification to terminate.




Comment: 

Will certified marriage and family therapists who have terminated their participation agreement be eligible to
qualify as another category of provider under CHAMPUS? If this allowed, we foresee a number of problems in the adjudication
of claims, particularly if they choose to switch to a category of provider which still requires physician supervision
and referral and continue to treat the same patients.




Response: 

Upon application to OCHAMPUS, a provider must indicate under which category of provider he/she wishes to be authorized.
Once a determination by OCHAMPUS is made that the applicant meets the qualifications of the provider category for
which he/she is applying, switching from one group to another seldom occurs. Switching could be allowed if the provider
has continued his/her education and such additional education qualifies him/her for a different provider category
(i.e., nurse to M.D., clinical psychologist to psychiatrist, or M.D. to psychiatrist). Such upward or changed speciality
movement generally does not create an adjudication problem. However, we agree that the new legislative provisions
regarding certified marriage and family therapists may create adjudication problems, since the provisions of the
law allow certified marriage and family therapists to practice without physician supervision and referral. Switching
and movement within any other extramedical provider category where physician supervision and referral is required
would result in CHAMPUS beneficiaries incurring costs for denied care. Care denied for lack of physician supervision
and referral would not be subject to the hold harmless provisions of the new legislation since these provisions only
apply to the certified marriage and family therapists provider category. We feel it would be inappropriate to require
retroactive physician supervision and referral for care that has already been rendered, or for continuing care.
To prevent CHAMPUS beneficiaries from incurring costs Congress did not intend them to incur with this change, we have
added language to the final rule which precludes marriage and family therapists from switching within the extramedical
provider category. As of the effective date of termination, the certified marriage and family therapist will no longer
be recognized as an authorized provider under CHAMPUS. Subsequent to termination, the certified marriage and family
therapist may only be reinstated as an authorized CHAMPUS extramedical provider by entering into a new participation
agreement as a certified marriage and family therapist.



3. Services of Physicians in Teaching Settings



We received one (1) public comment from a national physician organization and one (1) comment from one of the government
agencies which by law we are required to consult with during the rulemaking process.

Comment: 

It is not uncommon for physicians to have a contract with an academic hospital to provide individual, personal services
to hospital patients and for the contract to provide for the physicians to bill the patient or their insurer directly
for those services. In these cases, the hospital does not bill patients/insurers and makes no payment to the physician
for the services. To require hospitals to change such billing arrangements serves no useful purpose. 



Response: 

We agree, and it was not our intent to require hospitals to change their billing arrangements. The CHAMPUS regulation
has always had the requirement that physicians who are employed by or under contract to the hospital cannot bill for
their services. This, however, is intended to apply only to those contracts which incorporate payment to the physicians.
It does not include contracts which only provide physicians with normal privileges to admit patients and to render
services in the hospital on a fee-for-service basis. In order to reflects this intent, we have modified the language
in  199.4 (c)(3)(xiii)(A)(

4

) as well as in  199.6 (c)(1). 



Comment: 

In addition to interns and residents, fellows in certain subspecialties are also ``physicians in training.'' It
is unclear from the document whether or not a fellow in a subspecialty would be considered a ``physician in training.''




Response: 

We consider fellows to be physicians in training, and we have added them to the definition in  199.2. 

Section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354) requires that each federal agency
prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis when the agency issues a regulation
which would have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Department of Defense certifies,
pursuant to section 605(b) of title 5, United States Code, enacted by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354),
that this final amendment will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses, organizations,
or government jurisdictions. For purposes of the RFA, we consider small entities to include all hospitals and third-party
payers. 

We have determined that this final amendment is a routine amendment necessary to provide specific requirements for
existing policies and to implement legislation which authorized expanded CHAMPUS benefits, and relieved administrative
requirements for the CHAMPUS beneficiary and provider community. It is not, therefore, a ``major rule'' under Executive
Order 12291. This final rule only provides specific requirements for existing policies; expands benefits; and ensures
equitable administration of CHAMPUS requirements among mental health providers with comparable education and
training while also protecting CHAMPUS beneficiaries from incurring added costs for mental health care not normally
covered under the CHAMPUS program. It will not involve any significant burden on CHAMPUS beneficiaries or providers.


Although this change does not qualify as a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291, a cost analysis for costs associated
with implementing screening mammogram and Pap tests was provided in the proposed rule amendment on screening mammogram
and PAP tests. Additionally, an increase in program costs related to implementation of this final amendment for the
issues related to certified marriage and family therapists and physicians in teaching settings are not expected
to be substantial, since this amendment will eliminate administrative requirements for certified marriage and
family therapists for CHAMPUS, the beneficiary and the provider population and only better defines the specific
requirements for coverage of existing policies related to physicians in teaching settings. 

This final rule does not impose information collection requirements. Therefore, it does not need to be reviewed by
the Executive Office of Management and Budget under authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3511).

(b) * * *



Approved teaching programs.

 For purposes of CHAMPUS, an approved teaching program is a program of graduate medical education which has been duly
approved in its respective specialty or subspecialty by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
of the American Medical Association, by the Committee on Hospitals of the Bureau of Professional Education of the
American Osteopathic Association, by the Council on Dental Education of the American Dental Association, or by the
Council on Podiatry Education of the American Podiatry Association.



* * * * *





Attending physician. 

The physician who has the primary responsibility for the medical diagnosis and treatment of the patient. A consultant
or an assistant surgeon, for example, would not be an attending physician. Under very extraordinary circumstances,
because of the presence of complex, serious, and multiple, but unrelated, medical conditions, a patient may have
more than one attending physician concurrently rendering medical treatment during a single period of time. An attending
physician also may be a teaching physician.



* * * * *





Marriage and family therapist, certified. 

An extramedical individual provider who meets the requirements outlined in  199.6.

Mental health counselor. 

An extramedical individual provider who meets the requirements outlined in  199.6



* * * * *





Pastoral counselor. 

An extramedical individual provider who meets the requirements outlined in  199.6.



* * * * *





Physician in training. 

Interns, residents, and fellows participating in approved postgraduate training programs and physicians who are
not in approved programs but who are authorized to practice only in a hospital or other institutional provider setting,
e.g., individuals with temporary or restricted licenses, or unlicensed graduates of foreign medical schools.



* * * * *





Teaching physician. 

A teaching physician is any physician whose duties include providing medical training to physicians in training
within a hospital or other institutional provider setting.

(i) 

Billing practices.

 To be considered for benefits under  199.4(b), covered services and supplies must be provided and billed for
by a hospital or other authorized institutional provider. Such billings must be fully itemized and sufficiently
descriptive to permit CHAMPUS to determine whether benefits are authorized by this part. Depending on the individual
circumstances, teaching physician services may be considered an institutional benefit in accordance with  199.4(b)
or a professional benefit under  199.4(c). See paragraph (c)(3)(xiii) of this section for the CHAMPUS requirements
regarding teaching physicians. In the case of continuous care, claims shall be submitted to the appropriate CHAMPUS
fiscal intermediary at least every 30 days either by the beneficiary or sponsor or, on a participating basis, directly
by the facility on behalf of the beneficiary (refer to  199.7).

on a fee-for-service basis for professional services rendered. Such billings must be itemized fully and be sufficiently
descriptive to permit CHAMPUS to determine whether benefits are authorized by this part. See paragraph (c)(3)(xiii)
of this section for the requirements regarding the special circumstances for teaching physicians. For continuing
professional care, claims should be submitted to the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary at least every 30 days

provider practicing within the scope of his or her license. Qualified mental health providers are: psychiatrists
or other physicians; clinical psychologists, certified psychiatric nurse specialists, clinical social workers,
and certified marriage and family therapists; and pastoral and mental health counselors under a physician's supervision.
No payment will be made for any service listed in paragraph (c)(3)(ix)(A) of this section rendered by an individual
who does not meet the criteria of  199.6 for his or her respective profession, regardless of whether the provider

(A) 

Teaching physicians.

(1

) 

General.

 The services of teaching physicians may be reimbursed on an allowable charge basis only when the teaching physician
has established an attending physician relationship between the teaching physician and the patient or when the teaching
physician provides distinct, identifiable, personal services (e.g., services rendered as a consultant, assistant
surgeon, etc.). Attending physician services may include both direct patient care services or direct supervision
of care provided by a physician in training. In order to be considered an attending physician, the teaching physician
must:

(

i

) Review the patient's history and the record of examinations and tests in the institution, and make frequent reviews
of the patient's progress; and

(

ii

) Personally examine the patient; and

(

iiii

) Confirm or revise the diagnosis and determine the course of treatment to be followed; and

(

iv

) Either perform the physician's services required by the patient or supervise the treatment so as to assure that appropriate
services are provided by physicians in training and that the care meets a proper quality level; and

(

v

) Be present and ready to perform any service performed by an attending physician in a nonteaching setting when a major
surgical procedure or a complex or dangerous medical procedure is performed; and

(

vi

) Be personally responsible for the patient's care, at least throughout the period of hospitalization.

(

2

) 

Direct supervision by an attending physician of care provided by physicians in training.

 Payment on the basis of allowable charges may be made for the professional services rendered to a beneficiary by his/her
attending physician when the attending physician provides personal and identifiable direction to physicians in
training who are participating in the care of the patient. It is not necessary that the attending physician be personally
present for all services, but the attending physician must be on the provider's premises and available to provide
immediate personal assistance and direction if needed.

(

3

) 

Individual, personal services.

 A teaching physician may be reimbursed on an allowable charge basis for any individual, identifiable service rendered
to a CHAMPUS beneficiary, so long as the service is a covered service and is normally reimbursed separately, and so
long as the patient records substantiate the service.

(

4

) 

Who may bill.

 The services of a teaching physician must be billed by the institutional provider when the physician is employed by
the provider or a related entity or under a contract which provides for payment to the physician by the provider or a
related entity. Where the teaching physician has no relationship with the provider (except for standard physician
privileges to admit patients) and generally treats patients on a fee-for-service basis in the private sector, the
teaching physician may submit claims under his/her own provider number.

(B) 

Physicians in training.

 Physicians in training in an approved teaching program are considered to be ``students'' and may not be reimbursed
directly by CHAMPUS for services rendered to a beneficiary when their services are provided as part of their employment
(either salaried or contractual) by a hospital or other institutional provider. Services of physicians in training
may be reimbursed on an allowable charge basis only if:

(

1

) The physician in training is fully licensed to practice medicine by the state in which the services are performed,
and

(

2

) The services are rendered outside the scope and requirements of the approved training program to which the physician
in training is assigned.



* * * * *

(1) 

Not medically or psychologically necessary.

 Services and supplies that are not medically or psychologically necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of a covered
illness (including mental disorder) or injury, for the diagnosis and treatment of pregnancy or well-baby care except
as provided in the following paragraph.

(2) 

Unnecessary diagnostic tests.

 X-ray, laboratory, and pathological services and machine diagnostic tests not related to a specific illness or injury
or a definitive set of symptoms except for cancer screening mammography and cancer screening papanicolaou (PAP)
tests provided under the terms and conditions contained in the guidelines adopted by the Director, OCHAMPUS.



* * * * *



(37) * * *

(vii) Screening mammography for asymptomatic women 35 years of age and older when provided under the terms and conditions
contained in the guidelines adopted by the Director, OCHAMPUS.

(viii) Cancer screening papanicolaou (PAP) test for women who are or have been sexually active, and women 18 years
of age and older when provided under the terms and conditions contained in the guidelines adopted by the Director,
OCHAMPUS.



* * * * *



(39) 

Counseling.

 Counseling services that are not medically necessary in the treatment of a diagnosed medical condition: For example,
educational counseling, vocational counseling, nutritional counseling, and counseling for socioeconomic purposes,
diabetic self-education programs, stress management, lifestyle modification, etc. Services provided by a certified
marriage and family therapist, pastoral or mental health counselor in the treatment of a mental disorder are covered
only as specifically provided in  199.6. Services provided by alcoholism rehabilitation counselors are covered
only when rendered in a CHAMPUS-authorized treatment setting and only when the cost of those services is included
in the facility's CHAMPUS-determined allowable cost rate.



* * * * *



4. Section 199.6 is amended by revising the introductory text of paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(1)(iv) and (3)(iv), and by
adding a new paragraph (d)(6), to read as follows:



 199.6 

Authorized providers.



* * * * *



(c) * * *

(1) 

General.

 Individual professional providers of care are those providers who bill for their services on a fee-for-service basis
and who are not employed by an institutional provider or under a contract which provides for payment to the individual
professional provider by an institutional provider. This category also includes those individuals who have formed
professional corporations or associations qualifying as a domestic corporation under 26 CFR 301.7701-5.
Such individual professional providers must be licensed or certified by the local licensing or certifying agency
for the jurisdiction in which the care is provided; or in the absence of state licensure/certification, be a member
of, or demonstrate eligibility for full clinical membership in, the appropriate national or professional certifying
association that sets standards for the profession of which the provider is a member. Services provided must be in
accordance with good medical practice and prevailing standards of quality of care and within recognized utilization
norms.



* * * * *



(iv) 

Physician referral and supervision.

 Physician referral and supervision is required for the services of paramedical providers as listed in paragraph
(c)(3)(iii)(H) of this section and for pastoral counselors and mental health counselors. Physician referral means
that the physician must actually see the patient, perform an evaluation, and arrive at an initial diagnostic impression
prior to referring the patient. Documentation is required of the physician's examination, diagnostic impression,
and referral. Physician supervision means that the physician provides overall medical management of the case. The
physician does not have to be physically located on the premises of the provider to whom the referral is made. Communication
back to the referring physician is an indication of medical management.

(iv) 

Extramedical individual providers. 

Extramedical individual providers are those who do counseling or nonmedical therapy and whose training and therapeutic
concepts are outside the medical field. The services of extramedical individual professionals are coverable following
the CHAMPUS determined allowable charge methodology provided such services are otherwise authorized in this or
other sections of the regulation.
(A) 

Certified marriage and family therapists. 

For the purposes of CHAMPUS, a certified marriage and family therapist is an individual who meets the following requirements:
(

1

) Recognized graduate professional education with the minimum of an earned master's degree from a regionally accredited
educational institution in an appropriate behavioral science field, mental health discipline; and
(

2

) The following experience:
(

i

) Either 200 hours of approved supervision in the practice of marriage and family counseling, ordinarily to be completed
in a 2- to 3-year period, of which at least 100 hours must be in individual supervision. This supervision will occur
preferably with more than one supervisor and should include a continuous process of supervision with at least three
cases; and
(

ii

) 1,000 hours of clinical experience in the practice of marriage and family counseling under approved supervision,
involving at least 50 different cases; or
(

iii

) 150 hours of approved supervision in the practice of psychotherapy, ordinarily to be completed in a 2- to 3-year period,
of which at least 50 hours must be individual supervision; plus at least 50 hours of approved individual supervision
in the practice of marriage and family counseling, ordinarily to be completed within a period of not less than 1 nor
more than 2 years; and
(

iv

) 750 hours of clinical experience in the practice of psychotherapy under approved supervision involving at least
30 cases; plus at least 250 hours of clinical practice in marriage and family counseling under approved supervision,
involving at least 20 cases; and
(

3

) Is licensed or certified to practice as a marriage and family therapist by the jurisdiction where practicing (see
paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(D) of this section for more specific information regarding licensure); and
(

4

) Agrees that a patients' organic medical problems must receive appropriate concurrent management by a physician.
(

5

) Agrees to accept the CHAMPUS determined allowable charge as payment in full, except for applicable deductibles
and cost-shares, and hold CHAMPUS beneficiaries harmless for noncovered care (i.e., may not bill a beneficiary for
noncovered care, and may not balance bill a beneficiary for amounts above the allowable charge). The certified marriage
and family therapist must enter into a participation agreement with the Office of CHAMPUS within which the certified
marriage and family therapist agrees to all provisions specified above.
(

6

) As of the effective date of termination, the certified marriage and family therapist will no longer be recognized
as an authorized provider under CHAMPUS. Subsequent to termination, the certified marriage and family therapist
may only be reinstated as an authorized CHAMPUS extramedical provider by entering into a new participation agreement
as a certified marriage and family therapist.

(B) 

Pastoral counselors. 

For the purposes of CHAMPUS, a pastoral counselor is an individual who meets the following requirements:
(

1

) Recognized graduate professional education with the minimum of an earned master's degree from a regionally accredited
educational institution in an appropriate behavioral science field, mental health discipline; and
(

2

) The following experience:
(

i

) Either 200 hours of approved supervision in the practice of pastoral counseling, ordinarily to be completed in a
2- to 3-year period, of which at least 100 hours must be in individual supervision. This supervision will occur preferably
with more than one supervisor and should include a continuous process of supervision with at least three cases; and
(

ii

) 1,000 hours of clinical experience in the practice of pastoral counseling under approved supervision, involving
at least 50 different cases; or
(

iii

) 150 hours of approved supervision in the practice of psychotherapy, ordinarily to be completed in a 2- to 3-year period,
of which at least 50 hours must be individual supervision; plus at least 50 hours of approved individual supervision
in the practice of pastoral counseling, ordinarily to be completed within a period of not less than 1 nor more than 2
years; and
(

iv

) 750 hours of clinical experience in the practice of psychotherapy under approved supervision involving at least
30 cases; plus at least 250 hours of clinical practice in pastoral counseling under approved supervision, involving
at least 20 cases; and
(

3

) Is licensed or certified to practice as a pastoral counselor by the jurisdiction where practicing (see paragraph
(c)(3)(iv)(D) of this section for more specific information regarding licensure); and
(

4

) The services of a pastoral counselor meeting the above requirements are coverable following the CHAMPUS determined
allowable charge methdology, under the following specified conditions:
(

i

) The CHAMPUS beneficiary must be referred for therapy by a physician; and
(

ii

) A physician is providing ongoing oversight and supervision of the therapy being provided; and
(

iii

) The pastoral counselor must certify on each claim for reimbursement that a written communication has been made or
will be made to the referring physician of the results of the treatment. Such communication will be made at the end of
the treatment, or more frequently, as required by the referring physician (refer to  199.7).
(

5

) Because of the similarity of the requirements for licensure, certification, experience, and education, a pastoral
counselor may elect to be authorized under CHAMPUS as a certified marriage and family therapist, and as such, be subject
to all previously defined criteria for the certified marriage and family therapist category, to include acceptance
of the CHAMPUS determined allowable charge as payment in full, except for applicable deductibles and cost-shares
(i.e., balance billing of a beneficiary above the allowable charge is prohibited; may not bill beneficiary for noncovered
care). The pastoral counselor must also agree to enter into the same participation agreement as a certified marriage
and family therapist with the Office of CHAMPUS within which the pastoral counselor agrees to all provisions including
licensure, national association membership and conditions upon termination, outlined above for certified marriage
and family therapist.





Note: 

No dual status will be recognized by the Office of CHAMPUS. Pastoral counselors must elect to become one of the categories
of extramedical CHAMPUS provides specified above. Once authorized as either a pastoral counselor, or a certified
marriage and family therapist, claims review and reimbursement will be in accordance with the criteria established
for the elected provider category.

(C) 

Mental health counselor.

 For the purposes of CHAMPUS, a mental health counselor is an individual who meets the following requirements:
(

1

) Minimum of a master's degree in mental health counseling or allied mental health field from a regionally accredited
institution; and
(

2

) Two years of post-masters experience which includes 3000 hours of clinical work and 100 hours of face-to-face supervision;
and
(

3

) Is licensed or certified to practice as a mental health counselor by the jurisdiction where practicing (see paragraph
(c)(3)(iv)(D) of this section for more specific information); and
(

4

) May only be reimbursed when:
(

i

) The CHAMPUS beneficiary is referred for therapy by a physician; and
(

ii

) A physician is providing ongoing oversight and supervision of the therapy being provided; and
(

iii

) The mental health counselor certifies on each claim for reimbursement that a written communication has been made
or will be made to the referring physician of the results of the treatment. Such communication will be made at the end
of the treatment, or more frequently, as required by the referring physician (refer to  199.7).
(D) The following additional information applies to each of the above categories of extramedical individual providers:
(

1

) These providers must also be licensed or certified to practice as a certified marriage and family therapist, pastoral
counselor or mental health counselor by the jurisdiction where practicing. In jurisdictions that do not provide
for licensure or certification, the provider must be certified by or eligible for full clinical membership in the
appropriate national professional association that sets standards for the specific profession.
(

2

) Grace period for therapists or counselors in states where licensure/certification is optional. CHAMPUS is providing
a grace period for those therapists or counselors who did not obtain optional licensure/certification in their jurisdiction,
not realizing it was a CHAMPUS requirement for authorization. The exemption by state law for pastoral counselors
may have misled this group into thinking licensure was not required. The same situation may have occurred with the
other therapist or counselor categories where licensure was either not mandated by the state or was provided under
a more general category such as ``professional counselors.'' This grace period pertains only to the licensure/certification
requirement, applies only to therapists or counselors who are already approved as of October 29, 1990, and only in
those areas where the licensure/certification is optional. Any therapist or counselor who is not licensed/certified
in the state in which he/she is practicing by August 1, 1991, will be terminated under the provisions of  199.9.
This grace period does not change any of the other existing requirements which remain in effect. During this grace
period, membership or proof of eligibility for full clinical membership in a recognized professional association
is required for those therapists or counselors who are not licensed or certified by the state. The following organizations
are recognized for therapists or counselors at the level indicated: Full clinical member of the American Association
of Marriage and Family Therapy; membership at the fellow or diplomate level of the American Association of Pastoral
Counselors; and membership in the National Academy of Certified Clinical Mental Health Counselors. Acceptable
proof of eligibility for membership is a letter from the appropriate certifying organization. This opportunity
for delayed certification/licensure is limited to the counselor or therapist category only as the language in all
of the other provider categories has been consistent and unmodified from the time each of the other provider categories
were added. The grace period does not apply in those states where licensure is mandatory.
(E) 

Christian Science practitioners and Christian Science nurses. 

CHAMPUS cost-shares the services of Christian Science practitioners and nurses. In order to bill as such, practitioners
or nurses must be listed or be eligible for listing in the Christian Science Journal
 at the time the service is provided.




* * * * *


(d) * * *
(6) 

Mammography suppliers.

 Mammography services may be cost-shared only if the supplier is certified by Medicare for participation as a mammography
supplier, or is certified by the American College of Radiology as having met its mammography supplier standards.

Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Eureka Slough, CA



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

At the request of the North Coast Railroad, the Coast Guard is amending the regulation for the North Coast Railroad
Bridge crossing Eureka Slough, mile 0.3 at Eureka. The existing regulation requires 24 hour advance notice for openings.
The amended regulation stipulates that the draw need not open for the passage of vessels, however the draw must be restored
to full operation within six months of notification to take such action from the District Commander. This amendment
will relieve the bridge owner of the burden of maintaining the machinery and of having a person available to open the
draw, and will still provide for the reasonable needs of navigation.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Jerry P. Olmes, Project Manager, and Lieutenant Robin
Barber, Project Attorney.



Regulatory History



In 58 FR 7497, Feb. 8, 1993, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the regulation that the
draw no longer need open for the passage of vessels. In addition, the Commander, Eleventh Coast Guard District also
published the proposal in a Public Notice dated February 16, 1993. Six comments were received on the proposal. A public
hearing was not requested and one was not held.



Background and Purpose



Presently, the North Coast Railroad Bridge is required to open on signal if at least 24 hours advance notice is given.
The North Coast Railroad had requested that the draw no longer need open for vessels since there had been no requests
for opening for at least eight years. Except for tests, Coast Guard bridge records show no bridge openings for at least
thirty-six years.



Discussion of Comments and Changes



The Coast Guard received 6 comments on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Four offered no objection. The California
Department of Boating and Waterways (CalBoating) requested that the Coast Guard reevaluate the need for persons
to be available to operate the bridge if boating activities increase. The Humboldt County Association of Governments
(HCAOG) objected to the original proposal, as they felt that permanent closure was too final an action to take. Even
though no vessel had requested an opening for many years, the HCAOG's Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) felt that
the bridge should remain functional, and suggested possibly a 30 day window for notice of opening. The TAC advised
that many business and properties upstream of the bridge had dikes which were in some disrepair, that fuel spills or
hazardous material in the slough could be inapproachable should the bridge be closed on a permanent basis, and that
bridge closure could impact future economic development along reaches of the Eureka Slough by eliminating waterfront
access.

The Coast Guard found that dike and levee maintenance is presently done by dragline instead of dredges and that pollution
response would likely be done from landside as well. The bridge would not prevent small motorboats from reaching sites
upstream of the bridge to transport pollution containment booms or investigate spills. The regulation would prevent
larger vessels from travelling upstream or mooring upstream. The CalBoating and HCAOG comments prompted the Coast
Guard to develop a compromise proposal that the bridge need not open for vessels, but in the event of development requiring
bridge openings, the bridge would be restored to service in six months upon order of the District Commander. On September
22, 1993, the HCAOG agreed to the compromise, and on January 6, 1994, the North Coast Railroad also agreed.



Regulatory Evaluation



This rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under
the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979). The Coast
Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as `'small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632). Because it expects the impacts of this change to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under section
605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.





Collection of Information



This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

).



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and
has determined that this rule does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.g.(5) of
Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, promulgation of operating requirements or procedures for drawbridges is categorically
excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the
docket.

Safety Zone; Ohio River Miles 468.5 to 473.0


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone on the Ohio River. The regulation is needed to control vessel traffic
in the regulated area to prevent potential environmental and safety hazards associated with commercial vessels
transporting cargoes regulated under title 46 Code of Federal Regulations Subchapters D and O, while transiting
downbound at night during high water conditions. The regulation will restrict commercial navigation in the regulated
area for the safety of vessel traffic and the protection of life and property along the river.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Drafting Information


The drafter of this regulation is LT Dale L. Hutchinson, Project Officer, Marine Safety Office, Louisville, Kentucky,
and LCDR A. O. Denny, Project Attorney, Second Coast Guard District Legal Office.


Regulatory History


In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, the high water periods in the Cincinnati, Ohio area are
natural events which cannot be predicted with any reasonable accuracy. The Coast Guard deems it to be in the public's
best interest to issue a regulation now as the situation presents an immediate hazard to navigation, life, and property.


Background and Purpose


The situation requiring this regulation is high water in the Ohio River in the vicinity of Cincinnati, Ohio. The Ohio
River in the Cincinnati area is hazardous to transit under the best of conditions. To transit the area, mariners must
navigate through several sweeping turns and seven bridges. When the water level in the Ohio River reaches 45 feet,
on the Cincinnati gage, river currents increase and become very unpredictable, making it difficult for downbound
vessels to maintain steerageway. During hours of darkness the background lights of the city of Cincinnati hamper
mariners' ability to maintain sight of the front of their tow. The regulation is intended to protect the public and
the environment, at night, during periods of high water, from a potential hazard of large downbound tows carrying
hazardous material through the regulated area.


Regulatory Evaluation


This rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under
Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979), it will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of information
requirements.
The Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.


Federalism Assessment


Under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 12612, this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.


Environmental Assessment


The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation as an
action required to protect the public and the environment.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone on the Ohio River back channel that separates Coraopolis, Pennsylvania
from Neville Island, Pennsylvania. This regulation is needed to control vessel traffic in the regulated area during
demolition of the main span of a bridge at Ohio River back channel mile 9.6. This regulation will restrict general navigation
in the regulated area during demolition operations for the safety of vessel traffic.

The drafters of this regulation are LT John Meehan, Project Officer, Marine Safety Office, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
and LCDR A.O. Denny, Project Attorney, Second Coast Guard District Legal Office.



Regulatory History



In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, a bridge is being removed from a navigable waterway. Bridge
removal operations pose inherent risks to the waterway because the structure is progressively weakened as the operation
proceeds. Once commenced, such operations should be completed as quickly as possible. Removal operations involving
structural supports for this bridge have proceeded ahead of schedule, leaving insufficient time to publish a notice
of proposed rulemaking. The Coast Guard deems it to be in the public's best interest to issue a regulation without waiting
for a comment period, as immediate implementation of navigation restrictions is needed to ensure the safety of vessels
transitting the area and to minimize the time a bridge in a weakened condition remains over the waterway.

Background and Purpose


The Coraopolis Highway Bridge at mile 9.6 on the Ohio River back channel between Coraopolis, Pennsylvania and Neville
Island, Pennsylvania is no longer an active highway bridge and must be removed. The bridge consists of several small
spans that are located over land and two 300 foot main spans that cross over the waterway and meet atop a stone pier at
the center of the channel. As part of the overall bridge removal operation, each main span will be demolished with seven
simultaneously detonated explosive charges. The first main span demolition will occur at approximately 9:00 a.m.
on February 14, 1994 for Span 

#

3 on the left descending bank (Coraopolis side) of the back channel. Since this explosive demolition will pose obvious
hazards to vessels in the area, vessel traffic will be prohibited from entering the Ohio River back channel from mile
9.3 to mile 9.9 during the day of the demolition. The second main span demolition for Span 

#

4 on the right descending bank (Neville Island side) of the back channel is scheduled for approximately 9 a.m. on February
28, 1994. Steel members and debris from the demolition of Span 

#

4 will fall into the sailing line of the channel, creating an unsafe condition for vessels attempting to transit. The
contractor will immediately commence clearing operations in the channel, but it will require 4 days to restore the
navigability of this section of the Ohio River back channel. Accordingly, no vessel traffic will be permitted in the
safety zone extending from Ohio River back channel mile 9.3 to mile 9.9 during this second demolition and subsequent
channel clearing operations from 8 a.m. on February 28, 1994 to 4 p.m. on March 4, 1994. For the remaining period that
this safety zone is in effect, vessel traffic will be permitted to proceed without restriction with vessels transmitting
the bridge site along the sailing line of the channel. In the event of unanticipated delays involving the demolitions
discussed above, the Captain of the Port Pittsburgh will notify the marine community of schedule changes affecting
the duration of vessel traffic restrictions within the safety zone via marine Safety Information Radio Broadcasts
on VHF Marine Band Radio, Channel 22 (157.1 MHz) and via on site broadcast advisors on Channel 13 (156.650 MHz).


Regulatory Evaluation


This rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under
Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979), it will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of information
requirements. A full regulatory analysis is unnecessary because the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation
to be minimal due to the relatively short duration of vessel traffic restrictions, the relatively small size of the
area regulated, and the infrequency of commercial vessel transits along this section of Ohio River back channel.


Federalism Assessment


Under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 12612, this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.


Environmental Assessment


The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c.
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation
as an action required to protect public safety.

 Technical amendment. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, this 
document displays the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control 
numbers issued under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) for 
Determining Conformity of General Federal Actions to State or 
Federal Implementation Plans. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA is today amending the table of 
currently approved information collection request (ICR) control 
numbers issued by OMB for various regulations. Today's amendment 
updates the table to accurately display those information 
requirements promulgated under the Determining Conformity of 
General Federal Actions to State or Federal Implementation Plans 
rule which appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on November 30, 1993 
(58 FR 63214). The affected regulations are codified at 40 CFR 
part(s) 51, Subpart W and 93, Subpart B. EPA will continue to 
present OMB control numbers in a consolidated table format to be 
codified in 40 CFR part 9 of the Agency's regulations, and in 
each CFR volume containing EPA regulations. The table lists the 
section numbers with reporting and recordkeeping requirements, 
and the current OMB control numbers. This display of the OMB 
control number and its subsequent codification in the Code of 
Federal Regulations satisfies the requirements of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

) and OMB's implementing 
regulations at 5 CFR part 1320. 


This ICR was previously subject to public notice and comment 
prior to OMB approval. As a result, EPA finds that there is 
``good cause'' under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative 
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) to amend this table without 
prior notice and comment. Due to the technical nature of the 
table, further notice and comment would be unnecessary. For the 
same reasons, EPA also finds that there is good cause under 5 
U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

Lifting of Shipping Restrictions to Vietnam 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Secretary, DOT, and Department of 
Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Departments of Commerce and Transportation imposed a shipping 
restriction prohibiting any ships documented under the laws 
of the United States or any aircraft registered under the 
laws of the United States from transporting goods or 
traveling to Vietnam. On February 3, 1994, President Clinton announced the lifting of 
the ban on Vietnam. Pursuant to the President's 
announcement, the restriction in the regulation is being 
removed.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 44 CFR part 403 currently imposes a shipping 
restriction prohibiting any ships documented under the laws of the United States or any aircraft 
registered under the laws of the United States from 
transporting goods or traveling to North Korea and Vietnam. 
On February 3, 1994, President Clinton signed a memorandum 
directing the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Treasury, and the Secretary of Commerce 
to lift the embargo against Vietnam. 



Pursuant to the President's memorandum, the Departments 
of Commerce and Transportation are revising their 
regulations to reflect this change in policy, effective at the time of the President's announcement. 44 CFR 
part 403 is being revised to remove all references to 
Vietnam. 

Pursuant to the foreign affairs exception in title 5 
U.S.C. 553(a)(1), this rulemaking is exempt from the 
Administrative Procedure Act. 



Paperwork Reduction Act



In accordance with the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511), there are no 
requirements for information collection associated with 
this final rule. 



National Environmental Policy Act



DOT has also analyzed 
this final rule under the National Environmental Policy Act and 
determined that it will not have a significant impact on 
the human environment. 



Executive Order 12612 (Federalism)



Finally, DOT has 
analyzed this rule in accordance with the principles and 
criteria contained in E.O. 12612, and has determined that this rule 
will not have sufficient federalism implications to 
warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Review of the Pioneer's Preference Rules



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In October 1993, the Commission initiated a review of its pioneer's preference rules to assess the effect of competitive
bidding authority recently enacted by Congress. In this First Report and Order the Commission concludes that any
changes to its pioneer's preference rules will not be applied to the three proceedings in which Tentative Decisions
have been issued. The action is intended to ensure the equitable treatment of pioneer's preference applicants in
these proceedings.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a summary of the Commission's First Report and Order adopted December 23, 1993, and released January 28, 1994.
A summary of the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Notice) initiating this proceeding may be found at 58 FR 57578 (October
26, 1993). This action will not change the public reporting burden. The full text of this Commission decision is available
for inspection and copying during regular business hours in the FCC Reference Center (Room 239), 1919 M Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20554. The complete text of the decision also may be purchased from the Commission's duplication contractor,
International Transcription Service, (202) 857-3800, 2100 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20037.



Summary of First Report and Order



1. In the Notice the Commission initiated a review of the effect on its pioneer's preference rules of new authority
to assign licenses by competitive bidding. Comment was solicited, 

inter alia,

 on whether repeal or amendment of the pioneer's preference rules should apply to the three proceedings in which Tentative
Decisions, but not final Orders, have been issued that address preference requests.

2. In response to the Notice, American Personal Communications (APC) requested that the Commission address early
and separately whether to apply to the 2 GHz broadband Personal Communications Services (PCS) proceeding, GEN Docket
No. 90-314, any changes or repeal of the pioneer's preference rules. Most parties concurred with APC that it
would be unfair to apply any modifications to the pioneer's preference rules to the 2 GHz broadband PCS proceeding
and to two additional proceedings in which Tentative Decisions have been made. With regard to amending or repealing
the rules with respect to the 2 GHz PCS preference applicants in particular, several parties expressed agreement
with APC that it would be arbitrary for the Commission to treat the 2 GHz PCS preference applicants different from the
900 MHz PCS applicants solely because the Commission bifurcated its PCS proceeding and reached conclusions on narrowband
issues first. See GEN Docket No. 90-314/ET Docket No. 92-100.

3. The Commission has issued Tentative Decisions in two proceedings in addition to 2 GHz PCS. With respect to the 28
GHz Local Multipoint Distribution Services (LMDS) proceeding, CC Docket No. 92-297, the Commission tentatively
awarded a pioneer's preference to Suite 12 Group. Suite 12 argued that if the Commission decides to eliminate or alter
significantly the pioneer's preference rules, equity demands that the tentative grants, including that for LMDS,
be judged in accordance with the existing rules. With respect to the 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) proceeding,
ET Docket No. 92-28, the Commission tentatively decided that no pioneer's preference award was merited. Motorola
Satellite Communications, Inc. argued that there is no reason to change the preference rules as they apply to this
proceeding and that authorization of competitive bidding does not undermine the basis of the Commission's decision
to consider pioneer's preference requests in this proceeding because the MSS applications are not mutually exclusive.

4. Nextel Communications, Inc., Paging Network, Inc., and PageMart, Inc. (PageMart) maintained that under the notice
and comment rule making procedures involved, the Commission may revise, modify, and even reverse its tentative conclusions
based on the record developed in response to its solicitation for comments. BellSouth, PageMart, and Southwestern
Bell Corporation also argued that it would be more equitable to charge pioneers in proceedings in which Tentative
Decisions have been made if other licensees in the same service generally will be selected using competitive bidding.

5. The Commission concluded that it would be inequitable to apply any changes in the pioneer's preference rules to
pending proceedings in which Tentative Decisions have been issued. The Commission found that notwithstanding that
other licensees in the three proceedings at issue may have to bid at auction and pay for their licenses, preference
applicants in these proceedings submitted their requests and publicly disclosed substantial detail of their system
designs in reliance on the continued applicability of the pioneer's preference rules. The Commission stated that
had the rules been different, these applicants might have structured their requests differently; or conducted research,
development, and experimentation differently; or elected not to disclose detailed information about their systems.
The Commission concluded that notwithstanding its legal authority to treat 2 GHz broadband PCS pending applicants
differently than the 900 MHz narrowband PCS applicants and also to apply changed rules to pending applicants in the
28 GHz LMDS and 1.6/2.4 GHz MSS proceedings, to do so would be inequitable. Accordingly, the Commission decided to
render final decisions on pioneer's preference requests in these proceedings based on the existing pioneer's preference
rules.

6. This action concluded the Commission's review of the pioneer's preference rules with respect to proceedings in
which Tentative Decisions have been made. The Commission anticipates concluding its review of the pioneer's preference
rules with respect to other proceedings in a separate Report and Order.



Ordering Clause



7. Accordingly, 

It is ordered 

that this First Report and Order IS ADOPTED. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Request for Separate and Expedited Treatment
of ``Existing Pioneer Preference'' Issues, filed by American Personal Communications, IS GRANTED to the extent
indicated herein. This action is taken pursuant to sections 4(i), 7(a), 303(c), 303(f), 303(g), 303(r), and 309(j)
of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. sections 154(i), 157(a), 303(c), 303(f), 303(g), 303(r),
