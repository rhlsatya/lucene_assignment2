Availability of Determination of Nonregulated Status of Calgene, Inc., Genetically Engineered Cotton Lines 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of determination.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is announcing the issuance of a determination that certain
trademarked cotton lines, designated BXN

TM

 cotton, do not present a plant pest risk and are therefore no longer regulated articles under its regulations. APHIS'
determination has been made in response to a petition received from Calgene, Inc., of Davis, CA, on July 15, 1993, seeking
a determination from APHIS that BXN

TM

 cotton does not present a plant pest risk and is therefore no longer a regulated article. The effect of this determination
is that cotton lines meeting the definition of BXN

TM

 cotton and that have been field tested under permit, will no longer be subject to regulation. This notice also announces
the availability of the determination that provides the basis for the ruling, as well as the availability of an environmental
assessment of this action.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On September 8, 1993 (58 FR 47249-47250, Docket No. 93-116-1), the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) published a notice announcing receipt of a petition from Calgene, Inc. (Calgene) of Davis, CA, that
requested a determination on the regulatory status of BXN

TM

 cotton. This notice also indicated the role of the Food and Drug Administration and the United States Environmental
Protection Agency in the regulation of food products derived from BXN

TM

 cotton and the potential use of the herbicide bromoxynil on BXN

TM

 cotton, respectively. This notice further announced that the petition was available for public review and invited
written comments on whether BXN

TM

 cotton poses a plant pest risk, to be submitted on or before November 8, 1993. 


Comments 


APHIS received a total of 45 comments from State officials, universities, farmers associations and cooperative
extension services, environmental and consumer organizations, and business and professional associations. Among
these commenters, 34 were in favor of granting the petition, 9 were opposed, and 2 others addressed APHIS' decision
on the petition itself only parenthetically. APHIS has provided a complete discussion of the comments and any issues
raised by the commenters in the determination document, which is available upon request from the individual listed
under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. 
BXN

TM

 cotton, as defined by its developer (Calgene, Inc., of Davis, CA), is any cotton cultivar or progeny of a cotton line
containing the BXN gene (a gene, derived from the soil microbe 

Klebsiella pneumoniae

 subsp. 

ozaenae

 that encodes the enzyme nitrilase, which can degrade the herbicide bromoxynil) with its associated regulatory sequences,
i.e., sequences that allow for expression of the gene's enzyme product. By definition, BXN

TM

 cotton may also contain: the 

kan

r

 marker gene (encoding the enzyme aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase II, which confers resistance to the antibiotic
kanamycin) with its associated regulatory sequences; a DNA fragment containing the origin of replication of the
pRi plasmid from 

Agrobacterium rhizogenes

; T-DNA left and right border sequences from an 

Agrobacterium tumefaciens

 Ti plasmid; a segment of DNA from transposon Tn

5

; a portion of a synthetic polylinker sequence from 

lacZ'

; and a segment of DNA containing the origin of replication of plasmid pBR322. Expression of the BXN

TM

 gene and the 

kan

r

 gene is directed by copies of the promoter from the 

35S

 gene from cauliflower mosaic virus and terminated using sequences derived from the 

tml 

gene from the octopine-type Ti plasmid pTiA6 from 

A. tumefaciens. 
BXN

TM

 cotton contains components from organisms that are known plant pathogens, i.e., the bacterium 

Agrobacterium tumefaciens

 and cauliflower mosaic virus. BXN

TM

 cotton has therefore been a regulated article under APHIS jurisdiction, and its field tests in 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992,
and 1993 have been in accordance with APHIS regulations at 7 CFR part 340. APHIS' determination that BXN

TM

 cotton that has been field tested under permit does not present a plant pest risk is based on an analysis of data provided
to APHIS by Calgene and other relevant published scientific data obtained by APHIS concerning the components of BXN

TM

 cotton and observable properties of the cotton lines themselves. From this review, we have determined that these
BXN

TM

 cotton lines: (1) Exhibit no plant pathogenic properties; (2) are no more likely to become a weed than their non-engineered
parental varieties; (3) are unlikely to increase the weediness potential for any other cultivated plant or native
wild species with which the organism can interbreed; (4) will not cause damage to processed agricultural commodities;
and (5) are unlikely to harm other organisms, such as bees and earthworms, that are beneficial to agriculture. In addition,
we have determined that there is a reasonable certainty that progeny BXN

TM

 cotton lines bred from these lines will not exhibit new plant pest properties, i.e., properties substantially different
from any observed for the BXN

TM

 cotton lines already field tested, or those observed for cotton in traditional breeding programs. However, APHIS
believes that it is prudent to require information to corroborate that new BXN

TM

 cotton lines, not derived from BXN

TM

 lines already field tested under permit, do not exhibit unexpected qualities. 
Calgene has provided information and data from field testing of some of the cotton lines fitting their definition
of BXN

TM

 cotton and intended to be representative of all those lines. Our determination, however, applies only to cotton lines
that fit Calgene's definition of BXN

TM

 cotton and that have been field tested under permit. The effect of this determination is that such cotton lines will
no longer be considered regulated articles under the APHIS regulations at 7 CFR part 340. Permits under those regulations
will no longer be required from APHIS for field testing, importation, or interstate movement of BXN

TM

 cotton lines that have been field tested under permit or their progeny. Normal agronomic practices involving these
BXN

TM

 cotton lines, e.g., cultivation, propagation, movement, and cross-breeding with other non-regulated cotton lines,
can now be conducted without an APHIS permit. (Importation of BXN

TM

 cotton (and nursery stock or seeds capable of propagation) is still, however, subject to the restrictions found in
the Foreign Quarantine Notices regulations at 7 CFR part 319.) Variety registration and/or seed certification for
individual cotton lines carrying the BXN

TM

 gene may involve future actions by the U.S. Plant Variety Protection Office and State Seed Certification officials.

The potential environmental impacts associated with this determination have been examined in accordance with regulations
and guidelines implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq

.; 40 CFR parts 1500-1508; 7 CFR part 1b; 44 FR 50381-50384; and 44 FR 51272-51274). An Environmental
Assessment (EA) was prepared and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) was reached by APHIS for the determination
that BXN

TM

 cotton that has been field tested under permit is no longer a regulated article under its regulations at 7 CFR part 340.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting
competitive applications under its Minority Business Development Center program (MBDC) to operate a Rural Minority
Business Development Center (RMBDC) for approximately a 3-year period, subject to agency priorities, recipient
performance and the availability of funds. The total cost of performance for the first budget period (12 months) from
July 1, 1994 to June 30, 1995 is estimated at $411,765. The application must include a minimum cost-share of 15% of the
total project cost, through non-Federal contributions. The Federal amount includes $8,540 for an annual audit fee.
Cost-sharing contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, client fees, in-kind contributions or combinations
thereof. The RMBDC will operate in the State of South Carolina geographic service area with the exceptions of Greenville,
Charleston and Columbia, MSAs. The headquarters of the RMBDC will be located in Orangeburg, South Carolina.


The award number for this RMBDC will be 04-10-94007-01.
The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.
The RMBDC will provide business development services to the rural minority business community to help establish
and maintain viable rural minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate
public and private sector resources on behalf of rural minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of management
and technical assistance to rural minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance
regarding rural minority business.
Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of rural minority
businesses, individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing rural business
development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements
included in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points).
An application must received at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered
programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will
then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the
demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose
of the MBDC program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal
awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest points score will
not necessarily receive the award.
If an application is select for funding, DOC has no obligation to provide any additional future funding in connection
with that award. Renewal of an award to increase funding or extend the period of performance is at the total discretion
of DOC. Award under this program shall be subject to all Federal laws and Federal and Departmental regulations, policies,
and procedures applicable to Federal assistance awards.
The RMBDC shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
To assist in this effort, the RMBDC may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, the RMBDC will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross
sales of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000.
Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine is funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as the RMBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.

Atlantic Shark Fisheries 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of control date for entry into the Atlantic shark fisheries.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces that anyone entering any Atlantic shark fishery after February 22, 1994 (control date), may
not be assured of future access to or an allocation of the shark resource in the Atlantic Ocean under the Fishery Management
Plan for Atlantic Sharks (FMP). This notice is intended to promote awareness of potential eligibility criteria for
access to the Atlantic shark fisheries and to discourage new entries into the fisheries based on economic speculation
while the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) contemplates whether and how access to the Atlantic shark resources
should be controlled.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Atlantic shark fisheries are defined and managed under regulations at 50 CFR part 678 under the authority of the
Magnuson Fisheries Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). The Magnuson Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L.
101-627, transferred management authority over the Atlantic shark fisheries to the Secretary as of November
28, 1990. 



One of the concerns of the Atlantic shark industry, and the Secretary, is that current participants in the fisheries
who will bear the brunt of the management restrictions on the fisheries, which are necessary for stock rebuilding,
may not be the ones to whom future benefits accrue. To address these concerns, and to avoid speculative entry into a
fishery that is overfished and may be overcapitalized, the Secretary is establishing a control date of February 22,
1994, for possible limited entry. The date selected is the date of publication. Vessels that have not entered the shark
fishery prior to this date may not be allowed entry if a limited entry program, based on any criteria (such as individual
catch levels or gear type used) that is developed. Also, NMFS advises that vessels already in the fishery may not meet
eligibility criteria when and if these criteria are established. 

For the purposes of this notice, NMFS has not developed specific criteria to define entry into a shark fishery. Entry
into the fishery may mean either purchase of a shark vessel or fishery permit, investment in the construction or modification
of a vessel or gear for the purpose of fishing for Atlantic sharks (directly or incidentally), the documented landing
of a specified quantity of Atlantic sharks, or a specified number of Atlantic shark landings. The Secretary, after
full public process, may adopt one or more of these definitions of entry into the shark fishery at the time a limited
access regime is proposed, but may choose other options as well. 

Speculative entry into a fishery often is responsible for a rapid increase in fishing effort in fisheries already
fully- or over-developed. Those seeking possible windfall gain from a potential management change can exacerbate
the original problems. To help distinguish 

bona fide

 and established Atlantic shark fishermen from speculative entrants into the fishery, a control date may be set before
beginning discussions and planning of limited access regimes. As a result, fishermen are notified that entering
an Atlantic shark fishery after that date will not necessarily assure them of future access to the fishery resource
on grounds of previous participation. 

This establishment of a control date does not commit the Secretary to any particular management regime or criterion
for entry into Atlantic shark fisheries. Fishermen are not guaranteed future participation in the Atlantic shark
fisheries regardless of their date of entry or intensity of participation in the fishery before or after the control
date. The Secretary may subsequently choose a different control date, or he may choose a management regime that does
not make use of such a date. The Secretary is free to apply other qualifying criteria for fishery entry. The Secretary
may give varying considerations to fishermen in the fisheries before and after the control date. Finally, the Secretary
may choose to take no further action to control entry or access to the fisheries.

Import Situation and Conclusion



U.S. imports of men's and boys' cotton and man-made fiber woven shirts, Category 340/640, from Egypt reached 424,073
dozen during the year ending October 1993, more than six and one half times the 62,423 dozen imported from Egypt in the
year ending October 1992. In the first ten months of 1993, imports of Category 340/640 from Egypt reached 402,042 dozen,
nearly seven times the January-October 1992 level and nearly five times Egypt's total calendar year 1992 Category
340/640 imports.

The sharp and substantial increase of Category 340/640 imports from Egypt is causing a real risk of disruption in the
U.S. market for men's and boys' cotton and man-made fiber woven shirts.


</SIGNJOB>
<SIGNJOB>
U.S. Production, Import Penetration and Market Share



U.S. production of men's and boys' cotton and man-made fiber woven shirts fell from 16,956,000 dozen in 1989 to 12,850,000
dozen in 1992, a decline of 24 percent. This decline continued in 1993, with U.S. production falling to 6,320,000 dozen
in the first half of 1993, 3 percent below the January-June 1992 level. In contrast, U.S. imports of Category 340/640
increased from 26,637,000 dozen in 1989 to 30,395,000 dozen in 1992, a 14 percent increase. Category 340/640 imports
continued to increase in 1993, reaching 27,275,000 dozen during the first ten months of 1993, five percent above the
January-October 1992 level.

The ratio of imports to domestic production increased from 157 percent in 1989 to 236 percent in 1992. This trend continued
in 1993, with the ratio of imports to domestic production reaching 238 percent during January-June 1993. The domestic
manufacturers' share of this market fell from 39 percent in 1989 to 30 percent during the first half of 1993, a decline
of 9 percentage points.

<SIGNJOB>
Duty-Paid Value and U.S. Producers' Price



Approximately 77 percent of Category 340/640 imports from Egypt during the year ending in October 1993 entered the
U.S. under HTSUSA 6205.20.2046_men's and boys' yarn dyed, napped woven cotton shirts, other than dress and corduroy;
HTSUSA 6205.20.2065_men's woven cotton shirts, other than dress and corduroy, with one color in the warp and/or the
filling; and HTSUSA 6205.20.2075_boys' woven cotton shirts, other than dress and corduroy, with one color in the
warp and/or the filling, other than imported as a part of a playsuit. These shirts entered the U.S. at landed duty-paid
values below U.S. producers' prices for comparable men's and boys' woven shirts.

The EM Director of the Office of Integrated Risk Management or his/her designee will be responsible for this system
of objective merit review of discretionary financial assistance applications funded by EM.


III. Deviations


Single-case deviations from the following procedures may be authorized in writing by EM's Responsible Official
upon the written request by a member of the EM staff. Whenever a proposed review would deviate from 10 CFR part 600, the
deviation must also be authorized in accordance with the procedures prescribed in that part.


IV. Evaluation Process


A. Initial Screening Procedure


1. Applications will normally be submitted to the Department of Energy, Office of Management Support, HR-532,
Washington, DC 20585. Applications will be assigned a control number by HR-532 and those pertaining to the Office
of Environmental Restoration and Waste Management (EM) will be provided to EM. EM will assign an EM Project Office
for initial screening to assure the following standards are met before conducting a detailed merit review and evaluation:
a. 

Appropriateness to the EM Mission: 

Applications must be relevant to EM mission requirements as stated in this notice.
b. 

Technical/Scientific Content and Merit: 

Those applications judged to be without sufficient detail for evaluation will not be considered.
c. 

No Unnecessary Duplications or Overlap: 

Applications proposing to perform research already being supported by DOE or other Federal agencies generally will
not be subjected to formal merit review unless there is a convincing programmatic reason to do so.
d. 

Completeness: 

Applications not meeting the requirements of 10 CFR 600, subpart A, may be returned to the sender for correction or
modification. Until the application meets the above standards, it will not be given detailed merit review.


B. Proposal Format


The proposal must consist of two sections, technical and cost.
Technical Proposal will be no more than 50 pages in length; resumes of key personnel involved should be submitted as
an appendix and will not be considered part of the technical proposal 50 page limit. It is left to the proposer to determine
how best to use the 50 pages: however the technical proposal should be divided into the following four sections:


Section 1_Executive Summary

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940222-2-00018 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940222-2-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Section 2_Proposal



This section will provide the detailed technical explanation of the proposed activities. The activities should
be addressed with respect to the preliminary screening standards and technical evaluation criteria listed in Subsection
G, Evaluation Criteria. 



Section 3_Statement of Work



A statement of work is to be supplied that discusses the specific tasks to be carried out to achieve the goals stated
in Section I. 



Section 4_Selection Criteria Index



An index must be provided showing the pages on which each of the selection criteria are addressed. 



Appendix A._Key Personnel 



R&eacute;sum&eacute;s should be succinct and clearly illustrate how the individuals technical background and
experience are related achieving the proposals objectives. 

Cost Proposals will have no page limit or page layout requirement. However, the cost proposal must include a summary
breakdown of all costs, and give a detailed breakdown of costs on a task-by-task basis for each task appearing in the
Statement of Work. In addition, any expectation concerning cost sharing shall be clearly stated. While cost sharing
is encouraged, it shall not be consideration in the selection process and shall be considered only at the time the award
is negotiated. 

2. The determination to return an application based on the above standards will be made in writing by the EM Project
Officer. In cases where the Project Officer is also the selection official, approval will be obtained from at least
one level higher than that of the Project Officer. 



C. Qualifications of Reviewers and Selection Official 



1. The members of the reviewing group may be a mixture of Federal or non-Federal experts. The review group, when possible,
will consist of at least three qualified persons from outside the 
Office of Integrated Risk Management in addition to the designated Project Officer if the Project Officer serves
on the group. When possible, the merit review group will exclude anyone who, on behalf of the Federal Government, performs
any of the following functions: 

a. Providing substantial technical assistance to the applicant. 

b. Approval/disapproval or having any other decision-making role regarding the application. 

c. Serving as the project manager or otherwise monitoring, auditing, evaluating the recipient's programmatic performance.


d. Exercising line authority over anyone ineligible to serve as reviewers because of the above limitations. 

2. Reviewers will be chosen by the Director of the Office of Integrated Risk Management based on their expertise and
professional qualifications as related to the proposed work. 

3. Reviewers may be Federal employees, including those from EM that are neither the selection official nor those in
a direct line of supervision above the Project Office. Non-Federal employees may also be reviewers. 

4. Reviewers will not include former employees of the Project Officer's immediate office or any former employee having
line authority over that immediate office within the past 1 year. 

5. The designated Project Officer will not serve on the review group or be an external reader unless specifically approved
by the Responsible Official.

6. Selection officials and reviewers must comply with the requirements of 10 CFR 1010 (a) and 1010.302(a)(1) concerning
conflict of interest. Individuals who cannot meet these requirements with regard to a particular application may
not review, discuss, or make an evaluation of an application in which they have a conflict of interest; and may not participate
in any meeting involving the review of an application in which there is a conflict of interest. 



D. Project Officer/Contracting Officer Representative 



1. The Project Officer will be a Federal Employee, from Headquarters or the field, assigned to review the application.
The Project Officer may also be designated as the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) from an eventual contract
action. This assignment will be made in writing by, or with the concurrence of, the employee's supervisor. 

2. The Project Officer will be responsible for coordinating the Merit Review and providing guidance to external reviewers
as described in this notice. 

3. The Project Officer is responsible for conducting the initial screening. If the application does not satisfy the
initial screening, the Project Officer will provide the applicant a rejection letter (informing appropriate officials)
or request additional information if required.

4. The Project Officer will be responsible for compiling the information from the Merit Review and preparing the Selection
Report/Justification for Acceptance for the Selection Official. This report should address the evaluation criteria
including the information from the initial screening, any programmatic comments reflecting a Federal policy perspective,
and the rationale for selection or rejection. 

5. For solicited applications, once the Selection Official approves the Selection Report, the Contracting Officer
will inform the applicant. For other applications, once the Selection Official approves the Justification for Selection,
the Project Officer is then responsible for preparing the rejection letter or Procurement request documents. The
Project Officer will also recommend assignment to a field office for award and implementation if the award is not made
at Headquarters. 



E. Formal Review Mechanism 



There will be one mechanism available to accomplish a merit review. At least three qualified individuals will perform
the review. In those instances where three or more qualified reviewers cannot be obtained to conduct a formal merit
review, the selection official must issue a waiver, which is based upon a written explanation of the situation by the
assigned Project Officer. In the event that the Project Officer is a reviewer and is also the selection official, this
waiver shall be considered and issued by an EM official one level higher than that of the Project Officer or selection
official. The formal review mechanism is as follows: 



1. Review Group



a. An organization of standing committees called Technical Peer Review Groups (TPRGs) will be the principal method
of application review. These review groups are appropriate when required by legislation or when: 

(1) Sufficient number of applications on a specific topic is received on a regular basis in accordance with a predetermined
review schedule. 

(2) Sufficient number of people is available to accept appointments, serve over reasonably protracted periods of
time, and convene regularly or at the call of the chairperson. 

(3) Legislative authority for particular programs extends for more than 1 year. 

b. persons outside the cognizant program office shall constitute at least one half the reviewers unless a deviation
has been approved under 10 CFR 600.18(g).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940222-2-00020 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940222-2-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

c. Members of TPRGs will independently review applications and will individually present results of their reviews
to the Project Officer. Reviewers will not meet to review and present a general recommendation. Reviewers may be called
together by the Project Officer to receive material, review issues, or share information, but no attempt will be made
to achieve a group consensus. 



2. Field Readers 



a. Field readers may be used for applications that cannot be effectively reviewed by the TPRG. This may include applications
which are outside the scope of TPRGs, when the workload of TPRGs requires augmentation, or when specific expertise
is required. 

b. Field readers will follow the guidance provided by the Project Officer for conducting their review. Field readers
will independently review applications and will individually present results of their reviews to the Project Officer.


c. Field readers may be called together by the Project Officer to reassess material, review issues, or share information
but no attempt will be made to achieve a group consensus. 



F. Review Process 



1. The EM Project Officer will provide reviewers with a copy of the application, programmatic guidance, conflict
of interest disclosures, certificates of confidentiality, and other information needed to conduct the review (such
as site-specific needs and schedules for technologies). The Project Officer may provide instructions to comparatively
evaluate proposals if there are multiple proposals. 

2. Reviewers should sign the certificate of confidentiality and conflict of interest disclosures and return them
before initiating their review. 

3. Based upon his/her review of the application and related documents, the reviewer is expected to provide the EM Project
Officer with a written analysis based on the guidance and/or other program information for each application. 

4. All reviews serve as input for the decision by the selection official and are not binding. Significant adverse evaluations
will be addressed in writing in a selection statement document. 

5. Upon request by applicants, a written summary will be provided to the applicants on the evaluation of their applications.




G. Evaluation Criteria
 


Review criteria include, but are not limited to, the following list. These criteria will be used by reviewers after
the application has been through the initial screening. For unsolicited applications, this review may also address
guidance the Project Officer provides from the initial screening. 

1. Capabilities, experience, and proposed methods for conducting credible risk assessments and proposed methods
for assessing risks to human health and the environment. 

2. Experience in effective and efficient management of the tasks required in support of risk assessments in preparing
and presenting reports, and in working with stakeholders and decisionmakers at all levels. 

3. Quality, availability, and experience of organization, technical and administrative staff and their level of
involvement. 

4. The appropriateness and adequacy of the proposed budget. 



H. Awards 



Approximately one to ten awards may be made during FY 1994. An award will not exceed $5 million in total award value.
If sufficient acceptable applications are submitted available funding may determine the number of awards. Awards,
if any, will be determined through evaluation of applications received against the evaluation criteria and the availability
of funds. Awards for either grants or cooperative agreements will be made only to technically acceptable applicants.
Awards will be on a schedule to be agreed to by DOE and the awardee. Budget and project periods may be negotiated to meet
the needs of particular projects. DOE reserves the right to support or not support any portion, all, or none of the proposals
submitted. 



I. Selection 



Selection of an application for award will be based on the findings of the conformance to elements 1 through 4 of the
Summary, Section IV.A.a-d, adherence to the proposal format as stated under Subsection B and G, and finally,
how well the application serves the EM program objectives. Furthermore, selection of an application for award is
subject to the availability of funds.

Title:

 Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs): Manufacturing, Processing, and Distribution in Commerce Exemptions. (EPA
ICR No.: 0857.06; OMB No.: 2070-0021). This is a request for extension of the expiration date of a currently approved
collection.


Abstract:

 The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) prohibits the manufacture of PCBs, or their processing or distribution in
commerce. However, the statute sets conditions under which EPA may grant exemptions to this prohibition. Companies
wishing to obtain the exemption must petition EPA by submitting certain information to the Agency. The information
includes name and address of the petitioner, and amount and use of PCBs the petitioner wishes to manufacture, process,
or distribute in commerce. The petitioner must provide evidence that the use of PCBs will not result in an unreasonable
risk of injury to human health or the environment. The petitioner must also provide evidence that demonstrates good
faith efforts to develop a chemical substitute for PCBs which does not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to human
health or the environment. 
To renew an existing exemption, a petitioner must submit to the Agency a letter stating that there are no changes in
the original petition for exemption. The letter must be submitted at least six months prior to the date the existing
exemption expires, it must be signed by a designated official, and it must be sent to the EPA by certified mail. 
EPA uses the information to determine whether petitioners have met the exemption requirements prescribed by TSCA.


Burden Statement:

 The burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 8 hours per response for new petitions and 2 hours
per response for renewal petitions. This estimate includes the time needed to review instructions, gather the data
needed, and review the collection of information.
 






Respondents:

 Companies wishing to obtain an exemption from prohibitions against the manufacture, processing or distribution
of PCBs in commerce. 


Estimated No. of Respondents:

 6 respondents for new petitions and 5 respondents for renewal petitions.


Estimated No. of Responses per Respondent:

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

EPA has authorized grantee organizations under the Senior Environmental Employment (SEE) Program, and their enrollees,
for access to information which has been submitted to EPA under several of the environmental statutes administered
by the Agency. Some of this information may be claimed or determined to be confidential business information (CBI).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Senior Environmental Employment (SEE) program is authorized by the Environmental Programs Assistance Act of
1984 (Pub. L. 98-313), which provides that the Administrator may ``make grants or enter into cooperative agreements''
for the purpose of ``providing technical assistance to Federal, State, and local environmental agencies for projects
of pollution prevention, abatement, and control.'' Cooperative agreements under the SEE program provide support
for many functions in the Agency, including clerical support, staffing hot lines, providing support to Agency enforcement
activities, providing library services, compiling data, and support in scientific, engineering, financial, and
other areas.



In performing these tasks, grantees and cooperators under the SEE program and their enrollees may have access to potentially
all documents submitted under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking
Water Act, Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act, to the extent that these statutes allow disclosure of confidential information to authorized
representatives of the United States (or to ``contractors'' under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
Act). Some of these documents may contain information claimed as confidential.

EPA may provide confidential information to enrollees working under the following cooperative agreements:






All organizations are located in Washington, DC, with the exceptions of the National Pacific/Asian Resource Center
on Aging (Seattle, WA) and Asociacion Nacional pro Personas Mayores (Los Angeles, CA).

EPA amended its confidentiality regulations at 40 CFR part 2, subpart B to authorize SEE enrollees for access to confidential
business information (58 FR 7187, February 5, 1993). As discussed in that notice, EPA offices had been giving SEE enrollees
access to confidential information under the impression that Agency confidentiality regulations allowed such
access. The February 5, 1993 

Federal Register

 notice rectified that error by amending these regulations to provide for such access. Among the procedures established
by EPA confidentiality regulations for granting access is notification to the submitters of confidential data that
SEE grantee organizations and their enrollees will have access. 40 CFR 2.301(h)(2)(iii). This notice is intended
to fulfill that requirement.

The grantee organizations are required by the cooperative agreements to protect confidential information. SEE
enrollees are required to sign confidentiality agreements and to adhere to the same security procedures as Federal
employees.

<DOCTITLE>Abandoned and Incomplete Pesticide Petitions; Policy Statement </DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is announcing that it will subject to a final review all pesticide petitions for tolerances, exemptions from the
requirement of a tolerance, and food or feed additive regulations currently pending with the Agency where the petitioner
has failed to respond to a notice of deficiency within 75 days of receipt of the notice. At the time of a final review,
pesticide petitions that do not provide sufficient evidence for the Agency to find that the tolerance or exemption
is protective of the public health will be denied. The policies reflected in this Statement will be applied by the Agency
on a case-by-case basis.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Introduction


In the 

Federal Register

 of September 4, 1991 (56 FR 43759), EPA issued a Policy Statement concerning its procedures for reviewing petitions
for tolerances, exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance, and food or feed additive regulations under section
408 or 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (as amended). In the Statement, EPA said it would subject
certain pesticide petitions to a final review unless, within a specified period, the petitioner submits the necessary
data or a reasonable timetable for supplying data to correct deficiencies. Additionally, EPA announced that it would
subject all other pending and future petitions to such a final review annually. If, at the time of any final review,
there is insufficient scientific data before the Administrator to establish a tolerance, exemption from a tolerance,
or a food or feed additive regulation capable of protecting the public health, the petition will be denied.
EPA received comments from the Mobay Corp. (Mobay) in response to the Policy Statement. This notice clarifies the
intent of the previous policy statement and responds to the comments. Mobay's primary concern appeared to be that
EPA would deny petitions simply for failure to comply with timeframes for responding to notices of deficiency or for
submitting data, but this was not EPA's intent, and the timeframes outlined in the Statement are for etablishing internal
administrative guidelines for final rulings on petitions.


II. Background and Clarification of Policy


EPA is responsible for processing tolerance petitions for residues of pesticides in or on raw agricultural commodities
under section 408 of the FFDCA and petitions for food additive regulations for residues of pesticides in or on processed
food or feed under section 409 of the FFDCA. Under section 408(d) of the act, the Administrator may establish a tolerance
or an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for a raw agricultural commodity upon the request of a person who
has submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
Act (FIFRA). Under FFDCA sec. 408(e), the Administrator may on his or her own initiative or upon the request of an interested
person, establish a tolerance or an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. Under FFDCA sec. 409(c), the Administrator
may establish a food additive regulation for pesticide residues in or on food or feed upon the request of any person,
or the Administrator may deny a petition.

Over the last 20 years, EPA has accumulated a large inventory of pending petitions for pesticide tolerances, exemptions
from the requirement of a tolerance, and food or feed additive regulations (hereafter referred to collectively in
this notice as ``pesticide petitions''). By the end of 1989 the Agency had in its inventory approximately 1,000 pending
petitions. Although the Agency has reviewed 750 of these petitions and notified the petitioners that these petitions
lack sufficient data to establish the requested tolerance, exemption or food or feed additive regulation, petitioners
have failed to respond in the case of 386 petitions. As a matter of course, EPA has treated such deficient petitions
as pending until the petitioner either provides the required information or withdraws the petition.

Until the petitioner provides EPA with the required data, the Agency cannot establish an exemption from the requirement
of a tolerance or establish a tolerance above zero for the use described in the petition. While it may establish zero
tolerances, EPA is reluctant to do so for the uses described in the hundreds of deficient pesticide petitions. Use
of the zero tolerance concept for so many deficient pesticide petitions would cause the Agency to establish hundreds
of unnecessary tolerances and clutter the tolerance regulations.

EPA's former policy, which allowed deficient pesticide petitions to remain extant, and its general reluctance to
establish unnecessary zero tolerances have resulted in a backlog of hundreds of pending petitions. This backlog
has created serious administrative problems for the Agency. (See 56 FR 43759; Sept. 4, 1991.) To alleviate these problems,
EPA has revised its internal administrative procedures for reviewing pesticide petitions.

To restate and clarify the policy announced, the Agency requested that petitioners who had filed petitions that had
been pending with EPA for 5 years or more and for which 4 years had passed since the petitioner has responded to the Agency's
last correspondence to provide the Agency with a reasonable timetable within 75 days of that notice for submitting
the missing information. If the petitioner did not respond to the notice, submitted a response found inadequate,
or requested that the petition be reviewed ``as is,'' the Agency announced that it would generally exercise its discretion
and subject the petition to a final review. EPA may make internal policy decisions, such as when to subject a pesticide
petition to a final review, on a case-by-case basis. In the Policy Statement, EPA identified in a table those petitions
for which it was requesting some response within 75 days.

In addition, for all other pending and future petitions, as soon as the Agency identifies a petition as being deficient,
the Agency will notify the petitioner, either by letter or by notice in the 

Federal Register

, requesting that the petitioner respond within 75 days by providing a reasonable timetable for supplying the Agency
with the needed data. If the petitioner demonstrates in his or her response that it will supply the data to the Agency
within a reasonable period of time, the Agency may in its discretion postpone a final review. However, if the petitioner
does not respond or does not respond adequately, EPA will generally schedule a final review of the petition.

If at the time of any final review there are insufficient scientific data before the Administrator to establish a tolerance,
exemption from a tolerance, or a food or feed additive regulation capable of protecting the public health, the petition
will be denied. 


III. Response to Mobay's Comments 


A. Authority to Deny Petitions Under Section 408 of FFDCA.


Mobay comments that unlike FFDCA sec. 409(c)(1)(B), the FFDCA provides the Agency with no authority to deny petitions
submitted pursuant to section 408(d) or 408(e) of the act.
EPA disagrees with Mobay's conclusion. First, section 408(e) of the FFDCA states that on its own initiative or upon
request by an interested person, ``the Administrator may *** propose the issuance of a regulation establishing a
tolerance'' or an exemption from a tolerance requirement. Proposal of a tolerance under FFDCA sec. 408(e), even one
requested by interested persons, is entirely discretionary to the Administrator. If the Agency is free not to propose
a requested tolerance, it is also permitted to deny such a requested tolerance. According to the Court in 

Nader v. EPA

, ``[s]o deferential is subsection (e) that the Administrator is not only free to deny the requested regulation, she
need not even propose it. See 40 CFR  180.29(a) (1987).'' 859 F.2d 747, 752 (d.c. Cir. 1988).
Further, although the FFDCA does not provide explicit authority for denial of section 408(d) petitions, neither
does it or its legislative history discuss whether EPA may deny pesticide petitions that do not provide sufficient
information to establish a tolerance or exemption capable of protecting the public health. Due to Congress' silence
on this precise issue, any reasonable interpretation that is consistent with the purpose of the statute is valid.


Chevron v. EPA

, 467 U.S. 837, 842-844 (1984). See also 

Young v. Community Nutrition Institute

, 476 U.S. 974, 981-982 (1986). Even while Mobay argues against EPA's denial authority, it admits that denial is a reasonable
means for responding to what it has classified as ``abandoned'' section 408 petitions.


B. Basis for Denial of Section 408 or 409 Petitions


Mobay argues that, even if there is an implicit authority ``to deny petitions for tolerances under section 408(b),
EPA cannot deny a petition on the basis of administrative convenience and to enhance the Agency's revenues.'' Mobay
also maintains that EPA may deny a petition for a food additive regulation under section 409 of the FFDCA only if the
scientific data ``fails to establish that the proposed use of the food additive *** will be safe *** or shows that the
proposed use of the additive would promote deception of the consumer ***.''

Contrary to Mobay's conclusion, EPA does not intend to deny petitions for administrative convenience or to raise
revenues. Rather, EPA is changing its internal procedures for reviewing pesticide petitions due to the large number
of petitions still pending with the Agency. EPA will be reviewing the pending petitions identified in Table 1 of the
Policy Statement (56 FR 43759; Sept. 4, 1991). In addition, it will attempt to make a final review of all other pending
and future petitions after 75 days from the receipt of the notice of deficiency if EPA receives no response or an inadequate
response from the petitioner, or if the petitioner requests that EPA review the petition ``as is.'' Subsequent to
such reviews some petitions will be denied where there is insufficient information for the Agency to find that the
proposed tolerance or exemption is protective of the public health. However, at no time will pesticide petitions
be denied for administrative convenience or to raise revenues.


C. The Impact of Denial of a Petition Versus Setting a Zero Tolerance


Mobay disagrees with the Agency's position that denial of a tolerance petition is equivalent, for practical purposes,
to setting a zero tolerance. Mobay provided no explanation as to how the two actions could have a different impact from
a petitioner's perspective.

EPA believes there is no functional difference between the denial of a petition and establishing a zero tolerance.
A commodity bearing a pesticide residue for which a tolerance has been denied or for which a zero tolerance has been
established would be considered unsafe under section 408 of the FFDCA and adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(B)
of the FFDCA. No rights or burdens would be created, imposed, or removed by denying a petition rather than setting a
zero tolerance. The legal and practical implications of both actions are the same. 


D. Compliance With Rulemaking Procedures Set Forth in the Administrative Procedures Act (APA)


Mobay states that ``EPA's decision to deny petitions under Sections 408 and 409 of the FFDCA if a petitioner either
fails to (1) respond to EPA's notice of deficiency within 75 days, or (2) supplement the data within a 4 year time period
is clearly a rule under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).'' According to Mobay, EPA's intended action is a substantive
rule requiring compliance with the notice and comment opportunities provided in section 553 of the APA because EPA's
intended action is of future effect and of general applicability, and acts as an amendment to 40 CFR 180.7(d) which
``provides a petitioner with an indefinite period of time to supplement a deficient petition after notification
of deficiencies.''

Contrary to Mobay's assertions, EPA's publication of this policy is designed to establish internal guidelines for
identifying ``stale'' petitions that require formal action. It does not affect any rights of petitioners or bind
EPA's discretion. EPA is not under any obligation to publish for comment its internal guidelines for review of petitions
and could at any time, and at its sole discretion, take formal action denying a petition failing to meet statutory criteria.

EPA does not, as Mobay assumed, intend to deny petitions for failure to comply with the 75 day or 4 year timeframes. As
previously mentioned, these timeframes are internal guidance as to when a petition is probably stale and thus should
be considered for formal action removing it from the pending status. Any formal action will be based on the applicable
statutory criteria.

This policy does not amend the EPA regulation which allows petitioners to supplement deficient petitions. While
40 CFR 180.7(d) permits a petitioner to correct a deficiency prior to filing, nothing in that section prescribes when
EPA can or must make a decision on a pesticide petition that has been filed. Neither the statute nor regulations in 40
CFR part 180 give a petitioner the right to maintain a deficient petition before the Agency indefinitely. In fact,
FFDCA sec. 408 anticipates EPA final action on petitions in 180 days, a considerably shorter timeframe than those
outlined in this policy for scheduling a final review. The goal of reviewing petitions within 4 years and the proposed
internal procedure of sending deficiency notices with a request for a response do not affect in any meaningful way
the petitioner's ability to supplement deficient petitions. An adequate response to the Agency's request within
75 days preserves the petitioner's right to provide supplemental data for up to 4 years without the Agency's taking
formal action to review the petition. Given that the statute contemplates an Agency decision within 180 days, the
Agency's policy of allowing a petition to remain extant up to 4 years from the date EPA approves the schedule for generation
of data is reasonable, even generous.


E. Incomplete Petitions and the Potential for Error in EPA's Files


Mobay argues that the Agency has not presented any compelling reason why incomplete versus abandoned petitions should
be denied. Further, Mobay comments that, even should the Agency have some compelling reason to deny incomplete petitions,
the inaccuracy of the Agency's files and records is evidence that the ``potential for erroneous decisions far outweighs
any need the Agency may have to cleanse its records.''
Mobay's comment assumes a distinction between incomplete and abandoned pesticide petitions not made by EPA in this
policy, and Mobay does not explain the distinction. As previously noted, EPA is applying the policy announced in this
Notice to reform its internal procedures for timing the final review of all pesticide petitions. At the point at which
EPA determines that a petition is deficient, it will notify the petitioner. Failing an adequate response, the deficient
petition will be subject to a final review. Upon a final review, EPA will deny those pesticide petitions which do not
provide sufficient data to establish a tolerance, exemption from a tolerance, or food or feed additive regulation
capable of protecting the public health.
Further, the potential inaccuracies in EPA's files argue in favor of instituting this policy rather than against
it. One of the main objectives of the policy is to ensure that EPA has accurate records to determine which pending petitions
are still active and what their deficiencies may be. The accuracy of EPA's files will be increased by regularizing
the Agency's monitoring of the status of pesticide petitions. If EPA has made an error, then the petitioner has the
opportunity to notify EPA of the error well before a final review of the petition.


IV. Implementation


EPA will be subjecting to a final review those pending petitions identified at 56 FR 43759 in Table 1 of the Policy Statement
for which it received no response, an inadequate response, or a request to review the petition ``as is.'' In addition,
EPA will notify all other petitioners of any deficiencies in their petitions and allow 75 days to respond to the notification.
EPA will attempt to make a final review of all other pending and future petitions after 75 days from the receipt of the
notice of deficiency if EPA receives no response or an inadequate response from the petitioner, or if the petitioner
requests that EPA review the petition ``as is.'' If EPA determines, upon a final review, that a petition does not include
sufficient information to find that the requested tolerance or exemption from a tolerance is protective of the public
health, it will notify the petitioner by letter or FR notice that the petition is being denied. 


V. Format of Submissions 


A. Request to Withdraw a Pesticide Petition


All requests to withdraw a pesticide petition should be submitted on company letterhead and specify the pesticide
petition number which the Agency assigned to the petition, the active ingredient of the chemical, and the raw agricultural
commodities and food or feed items involved.


B. Requests to Retain Petitions


All requests to retain a pesticide petition should be submitted on company letterhead and specify the pesticide petition
number which the Agency assigned to the petition, the active ingredient of the chemical, and raw agricultural commodities
and food or feed items involved. The request should contain a timetable listing data deficiencies identified by EPA
letters and the date the company expects to submit these data. This timeframe should not exceed a 4-year period.


C. Where to Send Requests


All requests should be submitted to the following address: Front End Processing Staff, Registration Division (7505C),
401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

Title:

 Transport Rate Structure and Pricing, CC Docket No. 91-213, Second Report and Order.



Action:

 New collection.



Respondents:

 Businesses or other for-profit.



Frequency of Response: 

On occasion reporting requirement and one-time collection.



Estimated Annual Burden:

 55 responses; 2 hours average burden per response; 110 hours total annual burden.



Needs and Uses:

 In the Second Report and Order, CC Docket No. 91-213 (released 1/31/94), the Commission modified certain features
of the price cap regulatory system applicable to local exchange carriers (LECs) to accommodate the recent restructure
of the LECs local transport rates. Transport services, including all the transmission-related elements, the tandem
switching charge, and the interconnection charge, were moved out of the price cap basket for traffic sensitive services
and placed into a combined ``trunking'' basket containing transport and special access services. The Commission
realigned the service categories and subcategories within the trunking basket to reflect the similarities between
certain special access and flat-related transport services, and to accommodate the new density zone pricing system
that were adopted for both special access and transport. The pricing bands applicable to the service categories and
subcategories were also adapted. All LECs subject to the price cap rules are required to file a supplemental tariff
review plan to recalculate their price cap indexes pursuant to the decision in the Order. The recalculated indexes
should be used as the basis of any price cap filing that changes rates of services in the trunking or traffic sensitive
baskets subsequent to the effective date of the initial restructured transport tariffs. Subsequent tariff filings
must be made pursuant to the modified rules. The information will be used to aid in the review of the LECs' transport
service restructure by the Commission and interested parties.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the authorities contained in 12 U.S.C. 1821(c), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
was duly appointed receiver for each of the financial institutions specified in 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

. The FDIC has determined that the proceeds which can be realized from the liquidation of the assets of these receivership
estates are insufficient to satisfy all classes of claims, asserted or unasserted against the receivership estate.
Therefore, upon satisfaction of secured claims, depositor claims and claims which have priority over depositors
under applicable state and federal law, no amount will remain or will be recovered sufficient to allow a dividend,
distribution or payment to any other creditor and therefore the claim of any such creditor is worthless.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that American Cyanamid Co., Lederle-Praxis Biologicals Division,
has filed an application requesting approval for the export of the human biological product Acellular Pertussis
Vaccine Adsorbed to the Federal Republic of Germany.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

 The drug export provisions in section 802 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 382) provide
that FDA may approve applications for the export of human biological products that are not currently approved in the
United States. Section 802(b)(3)(B) of the act sets forth the requirements that must be met in an application for approval.
Section 802(b)(3)(C) of the act requires that the agency review the application within 30 days of its filing to determine
whether the requirements of section 802(b)(3)(B) have been satisfied. Section 802(b)(3)(A) of the act requires
that the agency publish a notice in the Federal Register within 10 days of the filing of an application for export to
facilitate public participation in its review of the application. To meet this requirement, the agency is providing
notice that American Cyanamide Co., Lederle-Praxis Biologicals Division, 401 North Middletown Rd., Pearl River,
NY 10965, has filed an application requesting approval for the export of the human biological product Acellular Pertussis
Vaccine Adsorbed to the Federal Republic of Germany. The Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed is for active immunization
against pertussis (whooping cough) in children from 15 months to 6 years of age. The application was received and filed
in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research on January 24, 1994, which shall be considered the filing date
for purposes of the act. 


 Interested persons may submit relevant information on the application to the Dockets Management Branch (address
above) in two copies (except that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found
in brackets in the heading of this document. These submissions may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between
9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
The agency encourages any person who submits relevant information on the application to do so by March 4, 1994, and
to provide an additional copy of the submission directly to the contact person identified above, to facilitate consideration
of the information during the 30-day review period.
This notice is issued under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 802 (21 U.S.C. 382)) and under authority
delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Center for Biologics Evaluation

<USDEPT>INTERAGENCY FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REVIEW COMMITTEE</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Mississippi River Basin Floodplain Management; Request for Comments </DOCTITLE>



<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Damages resulting from the heavy rainfalls and related flooding of 1993 in the Upper Mississippi and Lower Missouri
River basins were some of the most devastating in the history of the Nation. The magnitude of these floods has raised
serious concerns about this country's ability to provide adequate flood protection and to respond quickly and effectively
during post-flood recovery. Perhaps most significantly, it has forced the Nation to reconsider its best long-term
strategy, not only to prevent a recurrence of the 1993 experience, but to ensure that floodplains and related watersheds
function to the fullest extent possible in ways that achieve environmental, economic, and socio-cultural objectives.



In response to the Flood of 1993, an Interagency Floodplain Management Review Committee was formed by the Administration
to examine what happened and why, to solicit opinions, and to make recommendation as to what changes in current policies
would most effectively achieve the goals of floodplain management; this Review Committee is part of the Administration's
larger Floodplain Management Task Force. A final report of this Review Committee will include: a description of the
flood event, including quantitative assessments of the damages incurred; an assessment of the performance of Federal
flood control measures; a summary of the concerns of affected parties as expressed during the public input phase of
this study; the identification of attributes which could be used to identify areas where alternative flood, floodplain,
and watershed management measures might be taken to yield the highest overall socio-cultural, economic, and environmental
payoff; proposals for administrative or legislative change which would enhance the flexibility and effectiveness
of floodplain and watershed management; and a framework to focus and guide development of comprehensive answers
for improved floodplain and watershed management by describing questions that remain to be addressed and identifying
data and resource needs. 
As part of the Review Committee's outreach efforts, interested parties are invited to submit comments and recommendations
related to floodplain and watershed management policies and programs.

B&M has certified that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) any overhead traffic
on the line has been rerouted over other lines; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or
by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either
is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within
the 2-year period; and (4) that the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (service of environmental report on agencies); 49
CFR 1105.8 (historic reports); 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter); 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication); and

<DOCTITLE>Canadian Pacific Limited_Abandonment_Line Between Skinner and Vanceboro, ME </DOCTITLE>


The Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) hereby notifies all interested parties that SEA will prepare
a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) and conduct scoping meetings in this proceeding. The Canadian Pacific
Limited (CP) filed an application for authority to abandon and discontinue all freight and passenger operations
over 201.2 miles of rail line between Skinner and Vanceboro, in Franklin, Somerset, Piscataquis, Penobscot, Aroostook,
and Washington Counties, Maine. Because of the proposed abandonment's potential for significant environmental
impacts, SEA has determined that preparation of a DEIS is necessary. 
The DEIS will address the environmental impacts associated with this proposed abandonment and will be served on all
the parties to the proceeding and made available to the public. There will be a 45 day comment period from the date the
DEIS is served to allow the public opportunity to comment. After assessing all of the comments to the DEIS and any other
comments filed during the environmental review process, SEA will issue a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS)
that will include SEA's final recommendations to the Commission. The Commission will consider the FEIS and the environmental
record in making its decision.
The purpose of the scoping process is to identify significant environmental issues and determine the scope of issues
to be addressed in the DEIS. Issues typically addressed in DEIS's include alternatives to the proposed action, impacts
on transportation systems, land use, socio-economic impacts, energy resources, air quality, noise quality, public
health and safety, biological resources, water quality, historic resources, coastal zone management consistency
review, and mitigation to reduce or avoid impacts on the environment. Persons that cannot attend the scoping meetings
may submit questions and comments in writing up to 30 days after the scoping meetings. Written comments may be submitted
directly to the Commission no later than April 15, 1994. Public scoping meetings will be held on the following dates.

 March 15, 1994, from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. at The American Legion Hall, Maine Street, Woodland, ME, and 
 March 16, 1994, from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. at City Hall, City Council Chambers, 73 Harlow Street, Bangor, ME.

<USDEPT>NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Records Schedules; Availability and Request for Comments</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Archives and Records Administration, Office of Records Administration.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of proposed records schedules; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) publishes notice at least once monthly of certain Federal
agency requests for records disposition authority (records schedules). Records schedules identify records of
sufficient value to warrant preservation in the National Archives of the United States. Schedules also authorize
agencies after a specified period to dispose of records lacking administrative, legal, research, or other value.
Notice is published for records schedules that (1) propose the destruction of records not previously authorized
for disposal, or (2) reduce the retention period for records already authorized for disposal. NARA invites public
comments on such schedules, as required by 44 USC 3303a(a).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Each year U.S. Government agencies create billions of records on paper, film, magnetic tape, and other media. In order
to control this accumulation, agency records managers prepare records schedules specifying when the agency no longer
needs the records and what happens to the records after this period. Some schedules are comprehensive and cover all
the records of an agency or one of its major subdivisions. These comprehensive schedules provide for the eventual
transfer to the National Archives of historically valuable records and authorize the disposal of all other records.
Most schedules, however, cover records of only one office or program or a few series of records, and many are updates
of previously approved schedules. Such schedules also may include records that are designated for permanent retention.


Destruction of records requires the approval of the Archivist of the United States. This approval is granted after
a thorough study of the records that takes into account their administrative use by the agency of origin, the rights
of the Government and of private persons directly affected by the Government's activities, and historical or other
value.
This public notice identifies the Federal agencies and their subdivisions requesting disposition authority, includes
the control number assigned to each schedule, and briefly describes the records proposed for disposal. The records
schedule contains additional information about the records and their disposition. Further information about the
disposition process will be furnished to each requester.

<DOCTITLE>Indiana Michigan Power Co.; Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2</DOCTITLE>



Exemption



I



Indiana Michigan Power Company (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating Licenses Nos. DPR-58 and
DPR-74 which authorize operation of the Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, at steady-state reactor
power levels not in excess of 3250 and 3411 megawatts thermal, respectively. The Donald C. Cook facilities are pressurized
water reactors located at the licensee's site in Berrien County, Michigan. These licenses provide, among other things,
that they are subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission)
now or hereafter in effect.




II



Pursuant to 10 CFR 55.59(a)(1), ``Each licensee shall_(1) Successfully complete a requalification program developed
by the facility licensee that has been approved by the Commission. This program shall be conducted for a continuous
period not to exceed 24 months in duration.''





III



By letter dated October 4, 1993, the licensee requested an exemption from administering the operating portion of
the annual operator requalification examination in January-February, 1994 due to the installation of modifications
in the control room. The modifications, which include replacing all Foxboro controllers with Taylor model 30 controllers
and a reconfiguration of the control room, have been completed in the simulator but will not be installed in the Unit
1 and Unit 2 control rooms until the refueling outages in February and August, 1994, respectively.

The licensee is requesting the exemption from the operational portion of the requalification examination in order
to provide more simulator training time on the new modifications and to avoid administering a requalification examination
on a simulator which is configured differently from the plant control rooms. The licensee will administer the operating
portion of the requalification examination on the simulator in the May-June, 1994 time frame. The licensee's
24-month requalification cycle ends February 11, 1994; therefore, the exemption from the requirements of the regulation
would be for a period of approximately 4 months.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 55.11, ``The Commission may, upon application by an interested person, or upon its own initiative,
grant such exemptions from the requirements of the regulations in this part as it determines are authorized by law
and will not endanger life or property and are otherwise in the public interest.''



IV



Currently, the Donald C. Cook Licensed Operator Requalification Training Program beings and ends in early February
of even years. This one-time exemption would permit an operating examination from the current 24-month requalification
cycle to be administered approximately 4 months into the next cycle. The next examination will be administered on
schedule in January 1995, which will be consistent with the annual examination requirement cited in 10 CFR 55.59(a)(2).



V



The staff has reviewed the licensee's request and concluded that issuance of this exemption will not endanger life
or property and will have no significant effect on the safety of the public or the plant.

Accordingly, the Commission has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 55.11, that this exemption as described in section
III is authorized by law, will not endanger life or property and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the
Commission hereby grants a one-time exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 55.59(a)(1) for a period of February
1994 to June 1994, with respect to the 24-month requalification program. This exemption applies only to the operational
examination portion of the requalification program. No changes to the written portion of the requalification program
have been requested by the licensee or granted by this exemption.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that granting of this exemption will have no significant impact
on the environment (February 14, 1994, 59 FR 6978).

This exemption is effective upon issuance.

<DOCTITLE>Wisconsin Public Service Corp., et. al.; Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant</DOCTITLE>



Exemption



I



The Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, Wisconsin Power and Light Company, and Madison Gas and Electric Company
(the licensee), are the holders of Facility Operating License No. DPR-43 which authorizes operation of the
Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP). The licensee provides, among other things, that it is subject to all rules, regulations,
and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now and hereafter in effect.

The facility consists of a pressurized water reactor located at the licensee's site in Kewaunee County, Wisconsin.



II



In a letter dated November 16, 1993, the licensee applied for a partial exemption from the Commission's regulations.
The subject exemption is from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J, Section III.D.1.(a). This Section requires,
in part, that ``. . . a set of three Type A tests shall be performed at approximately equal intervals
during each 10-year service period. The third test of each set shall be conducted when the plant is shutdown for the
10-year plant inservice inspection.'' The licensee proposes to perform the three Type A tests at approximately equal
intervals within each 10-year period, with the third test of each set conducted as close as practical to the end of the
10-year period. However, there would be no required connection between the Appendix J 10-year interval and the inservice
inspection 10-year interval. Kewaunee's 10-year Appendix J interval ends in 1994 and the third Type A test is scheduled
for the 1994 refueling outage.

The 10-year plant inservice inspection (ISI) is the series of inspections performed every 10 years in accordance
with Section XI of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and Addenda as required by 10 CFR 50.55a. The licensee performs
the ISI volumetric, surface and visual examinations of components and system pressure tests in accordance with 10
CFR 50.55a(g)(4) throughout the 10-year inspection interval. The major portion of this effort is presently being
performed every 12 months during the refueling outages. Kewaunee's second 10-year ISI interval ends in June 1994.
Kewaunee is scheduled to complete the second 10-year ISI program during the spring of 1995, as allowed by section XI
IWA 2400(c). The reactor vessel inspection during the 1995 refueling outage will complete the second 10-year ISI
program. Kewaunee is also scheduled to begin the third 10-year program during the 1995 refueling outage. As a result,
the completion of the second 10-year ISI program will occur in 1995 and the 10-year Appendix J interval will end in the
spring of 1994. 

There is no benefit to be gained by the coupling requirement cited above in that elements of the ISI program are conducted
throughout each 10-year cycle rather than during a refueling outage at the end of the 10-year cycle. Consequently,
the subject coupling requirement offers no benefit either to safety or to the economical operation of the facility.

Moreover, each of these two surveillance tests (i.e., the Type A tests and the 10-year ISI program) is independent
of the other and provides assurances of different plant characteristics. The Type A test assures the required leak-tightness
to demonstrate compliance with the guidelines of 10 CFR part 100. The 10-year ISI program provides assurance of the
integrity of the structures, systems, and components in compliance with 10 CFR 50.55a. There is no safety-related
concern necessitating their coupling in the same refueling outage. Accordingly, the staff finds that application
of the regulation is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule.

On this basis, the staff finds that the licensee has demonstrated that there are special circumstances present as
required by 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2). Further, the staff also finds that the uncoupling of the Type A tests from the 10-year
ISI program will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety.



III



Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, this exemption as described in Section
II is authorized by law and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and security and is otherwise in
the public interest and hereby grants the exemption with respect to the requirements of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J,
Paragraph III.D.1.(a). Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption
will have no significant impact on the environment (59 FR 1037).

<DOCTITLE>Request for Proposals</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Prospective Payment Assessment Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.







The Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (ProPAC) is seeking a contractor to provide computer programming
support services including data base development/management and empirical analysis. These services will support
ProPAC's evaluation and monitoring of Medicare's Prospective Payment System (PPS) for inpatient care and other
Medicare facility-related payment policies. A single contractor is being sought to provide these services under
a time-and-materials contract for a period of one year with options to extend the contract for up to two additional
years. RFP 02-94-ProPAC will be issued on or about March 7, 1994. Interested sources must submit a written
request to the address below for a copy of this RFP.



Roles and Responsibilities of ProPAC



ProPAC was created in the same legislation that enacted Medicare's prospective payment system for hospital inpatient
care. ProPAC's responsibilities include analyzing payment policies for all facility services furnished to Medicare
beneficiaries. Congress also has asked ProPAC to examine and report on the Medicaid program, and on broader issues
regarding the effectiveness and quality of health care delivery in the Untied States. ProPAC writes reports on various
aspects of health care reform, such as issues relating to expanding the PPS system to all payers, and on issues pertaining
to implementing a global budget for health care service.



Criteria for Proposals



Applicants are requested to submit proposals to provide computer programming support services in support of ProPAC's
intramural research activities (database development and empirical analyses) in the general areas defined above.
Work completed under this contract will be on an as-required basis and shall be performed upon the issuance of task
requests by ProPAC's Project Officer and designated staff of the Commission. The following provides a basic outline
of what should be included in a formal proposal:

1. Proposed personnel available to work on the contract.

2. Corporate qualifications, including documentation of the offeror's experience with the skills and techniques
required to perform the required analyses using large Medicare databases.

3. Management plan, including a description of how the offeror plans to use project staff, together with corporate
resources, to complete task requests. Special attention should be paid to describing how the Contractor will meet
ProPAC's peak work loads.

4. Technical approach, including a description of the offeror's technical approach that is specific, detailed and
complete enough to clearly and fully demonstrate that the offeror thoroughly understands the intent of the Statement
of Work, together with proposed approaches. It is recognized that all the technical factors cannot be detailed in
advance, but the technical proposal must be sufficient as to how it is proposed to comply with the applicable Statement
of Work, including a full explanation of the techniques and procedures you propose to follow. This discussion will
describe the offeror's previous experience with editing and manipulating Medicare Part A and Part B provider-level
and patient-level files, including a discussion of problems encountered and how these problems were dealt with.





ProPAC currently uses the computer facilities of the House Information Systems (HIS), U.S. House of Representatives.
HIS provides ProPAC with on-line and batch processing computer services using an IBM 9021-620, four-way multiprocessor,
operating under Multiple Virtual Storage, Enterprise System (MVS/ES). The Contractor shall be able to carry out
the programming tasks defined in this statement of work using these facilities.


The Contractor shall expect that during the term of the contract there will be special projects that will require the
use of special programs, hardware, and data. These projects will also require that the Contractor transfer data across
hardware platforms. The Contractor will be required to respond to changing priorities as the Commission adjust its
analytic agenda. The types of tasks to be performed by the Contractor under the contract are summarized as follows:



Database development. 

The Contractor shall provide programming services supporting file establishment, testing, and documentation
of new data sets. These data sets include, but are not limited to:

Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) patient record data files_for example, PATBILL, MEDPAR (for hospital,
SNF, and HHA patients), BMAD Beneficiary files, and National Claims History files;


HCFA facility data files_for example, Medicare Cost Reports (for PPS and excluded hospitals, SNFs, HHAs, and dialysis
facilities), BMAD Provider file and Provider of Service (POS) files;

American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual and Panel surveys of hospitals;


Other patient and provider data files_for example, California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development
Disclosure Reports for hospitals or skilled nursing facilities;

Geographic data files_for example, geographic information system spatial databases (including state and county
boundary files and roadway networks) and socio-economic databases (such as the Area Resource File).

Data base development activities include copying tapes and creating HIS (disk or cartridge) files, comparing file
documentation with actual file structure (and updating documentation where necessary), editing files, and preparing
descriptive statistics (on file variables to check variable ranges, etc.). The Contractor will also be required
to key-in data elements not readily available in machine-readable form.



User-file creation. 

The Contractor will create analysis files for statistical applications software (e.g., SAS), other applications
software (e.g. TransCAD geographic information microcomputer software) or programming languages (e.g., PL/I).
The construction of analysis files will involve merging and extracting data elements from multiple sources, such
as the linking of multiple claims files to create episodes of service. In addition to file construction, activities
will include developing documentation and file layouts for analysis files and conducting edit checks of existing
and created variables in analysis files.



Empirical analysis of data files. 

The Contractor shall develop analytical programs using either statistical software packages or programming languages.
ProPAC project analysts will provide written requests for empirical analysis with specifications such as the data
files to use, calculations to perform, procedures to use, tables to generate, and statistical tests to conduct. The
analytical programming will support ProPAC analyses in the project areas including, but not limited to the following:

1. Facility Costs and Payments;

2. Variations in Resource Use;

3. Studies of Medical Technologies, Procedures, and Practice;

4. Beneficiary Access to and Quality of Care;

5. Patterns of Care Across Providers;

6. Outpatient and Post-Acute (SNF and Home Health) Services;

7. End-stage Renal Disease;

8. Other Topic Areas, including analysis of PPS outlier payment policy, hospital productivity, changes in case mix,
rural hospitals and cost-shifting.
The Contractor shall ensure that data are provided accurately and on time. This includes ensuring the programs are
debugged, proper screens are applied to the data, and the final product represents what the analyst requested.

Developing and Updating Simulation Models


The Contractor will develop and update models (programs) that simulate payments to hospitals under PPS and additional
models related to PPS or other Medicare payment systems (for example simulation of alternative payment systems for
payments to hospitals for ambulatory surgery or radiology provided on an outpatient basis). These models will incorporate
policy parameters such as payments for medical education and capital; changes in hospital labor market area definitions
and wage indexes; changes in the DRG classification system; and changing from national to regional limits on allowable
costs for payments to SNFs.


Submission of Proposals


Applicants will be given approximately 30 days to submit a formal proposal.


Review of Proposals


Proposals will be reviewed by a panel of at least four (4) individuals. Reviewers will score applications, basing

Cityfed Financial Corp.; Notice of Application


February 15, 1994.


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').





APPLICANT: 

Cityfed Financial Corp. (``Cityfed'').



RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Exemption requested under sections 6(c) and 6(e) of the Act.


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicant requests an order that would exempt it from all provisions of the Act, except sections 9, 17(a) (modified
as discussed herein), 17(d) (modified as discussed herein), 17(e), 17(f), 36 through 45, and 47 through 51 of the Act
and the rules thereunder. Applicant would be exempt until the earlier of one year from the date of the requested order
or such time as applicant would no longer be required to register as an investment company.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicant's Representations


1. Cityfed was a savings and loan holding company that conducted its savings and loan operations through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, City Federal Savings Bank (``City Federal''). City Federal was the source of substantially all of Cityfed's
revenues and income. As a result of substantial losses in its mortgage banking and real estate operations, City Federal
was unable to meet its regulatory capital requirements. Accordingly, on December 7, 1989, the Office of Thrift Supervision
(the ``OTS'') placed City Federal into receivership and appointed the Resolution Trust Corporation (the ``RTC'')
as City Federal's receiver. City Federal's deposits and substantially all of its assets and liabilities were acquired
by a newly created federal mutual savings bank, City Savings Bank, F.S.B., whose deposits, assets, and liabilities
in turn were acquired by City Savings, F.S.B. (``City Savings''). The OTS appointed the RTC as receiver of City Savings.
2. Once City Federal was placed into receivership, Cityfed no longer conducted savings and loan operations through
any subsidiary and substantially all of its assets consisted of cash that has been invested in money market instruments
with a maturity of one year or less and money market mutual funds. On September 30, 1993, Cityfed held cash and securities
of approximately $9.7 million. Because of Cityfed's asset composition, it may be an investment company under the
Act. Rule 3a-2 under the Act provides a one-year safe harbor to issuers that meet the definition of an investment company
but intend to engage in a business other than investing in securities. Because of various claims against Cityfed and
certain Cityfed officers and directors, Cityfed could not acquire an operating company within the one year safe harbor.
The expiration of the safe harbor period necessitated the filing of an application for exemption from all provisions
of the Act, with certain exceptions.

<TEXT>
 

3. While Cityfed's board of directors has considered from time to time whether to engage in an operating business,
the board has determined not to engage in an operating business at the present time because of the claims filed against
Cityfed, whose liability thereunder cannot be reasonably estimated and may exceed its assets.

4. On December 7, 1992, the RTC filed suit against Cityfed and two former officers of City Federal seeking damages of
$12 million dollars for failure to maintain the net worth of City Federal (the ``First RTC Action''). In connection
with this action, the RTC sought a court order to place Cityfed's assets under the control of the court. On January 5,
1993, the RTC and Cityfed entered into an agreement (the ``Agreement'') whereby the RTC would refrain from seeking
the above order and Cityfed could continue to make payments for ordinary and reasonable business expenses and certain
legal fees. Cityfed, however, must give a monthly accounting of its expenditures to the RTC, and the RTC may apply to
the court for an appropriate order to prohibit an expenditure. In addition, Cityfed must give the RTC written notice
before paying extraordinary expenses of more than $5,000 and before making certain payments for defense costs, attorneys'
fees and other legal disbursements.

5. On September 30, 1993, the OTS staff advised Cityfed that it intended to recommend that the OTS initiate an administrative
enforcement proceeding against Cityfed. Applicant represents that in such a proceeding, the OTS will likely assert
claims similar to the RTC in the First RTC Action and may attempt to freeze Cityfed's assets. Because such a proceeding
may render moot the issues in the First RTC Action, the court entered an order on October 15, 1993 to stay that action
for 60 days. The court subsequently ordered the stay extended to January 28, 1994. The orders do not affect the Agreement,
except to provide that the Agreement will terminate upon the effective date of any order issued by the OTS, or of any
consent order or agreement between the OTS and Cityfed, that addresses the subject matter of the Agreement. As of the
date of filing the last amendment to this application, the OTS has not initiated any administrative enforcement proceeding
against Cityfed.

6. In addition, the RTC filed suit against several former directors and officers of City Federal alleging gross negligence
and breach of fiduciary duty with respect to certain loans (the ``Second RTC Action''). The RTC seeks in excess of $200
million in damages. Under Cityfed's bylaws, Cityfed may be obligated to indemnify these former officers and directors
and advance their legal expenses. Currently, Cityfed is advancing reasonable defense costs to the former directors
and officers named in the First and Second RTC Actions. Furthermore, Cityfed is currently aware of several other legal
actions involving former officers, directors, or employees of Cityfed who have requested that Cityfed advance expenses
and indemnify them. Cityfed generally has agreed to advance expenses in connection with these requests. Cityfed
is unable to determine with any accuracy the extent of its liability with respect to these indemnification claims,
although the amount may be material.

7. Currently, Cityfed's stock is traded sporadically in the over-the-counter market. Cityfed has one employee who
is president, chief executive officer and treasurer. Cityfed's secretary does not receive any compensation for
her service. If Cityfed is unable to resolve the above claims successfully, Cityfed may seek protection from the bankruptcy
courts or liquidate. Cityfed asserts that it probably will not be in a position to determine what course of action to
pursue until most, if not all, of its contingent liabilities are resolved.

8. During the term of the proposed exemption, Cityfed will comply with sections 9, 17(a), 17(d), 17(e), 17(f), 36 through
45, and 47 through 51 of the Act and the rules thereunder, subject to the following modifications. With respect to section
17(d), Cityfed represents that it established a stock option plan when it was an operating company. Although the plan
has been terminated, certain former employees of City Federal have existing rights under the plan. Cityfed asserts
that the plan may be deemed a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan within the meaning
of section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 thereunder. Because the plan was adopted when Cityfed was an operating company
and to the extent there are existing rights under the plan, Cityfed seeks an exemption to the extent necessary from
section 17(d). In addition, Cityfed may become subject to the jurisdiction of a bankruptcy court. With respect to
transactions approved by the bankruptcy court, applicants request an exemption from sections 17(a) and 17(d) as
further described in condition 3 below.



Applicant's Legal Analysis



1. Section 3(a)(1) defines an investment company as any issuer of a security who ``is or holds itself out as being engaged
primarily * * * in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities.'' Section 3(a)(3)
further defines an investment company as an issuer who is engaged in the business of investing in securities that have
a value in excess of 40% of the issuer's total assets (excluding government securities and cash). Cityfed acknowledges
that it may be deemed to fall within one of the Act's definitions of an investment company. Accordingly, applicant
requests an exemption under sections 6(c) and 6(e) from all provisions of the Act, subject to certain exceptions.

2. In determining whether to grant an exemption for a transient investment company, the Commission considers such
factors as whether the failure of the company to become primarily engaged in a non-investment business or excepted
business or liquidate within one year was due to factors beyond its control; whether the company's officers and employees
during that period tried, in good faith, to effect the company's investment of its assets in a non-investment business
or excepted business or to cause the liquidation of the company; and whether the company invested in securities solely
to preserve the value of its assets. Cityfed asserts that it meets these criteria.

3. Cityfed's failure to become primarily engaged in a non-investment business by the end of the one year safe harbor
of rule 3a-2 is due to factors beyond its control. Because of outstanding and potential claims against Cityfed
and certain of its officers and directors, Cityfed cannot acquire an operating company. Cityfed has diligently pursued
its claims against others and has taken steps to determine the extent of its contingent liabilities. Since the filing
of this application on October 19, 1990, Cityfed has invested in money market instruments and money market mutual
funds solely to preserve the value of its assets.

4. Cityfed requests an order that would exempt it from all provisions of the Act, subject to certain exemptions, until
the earlier of one year from the date of any order issued on this application or such time as Cityfed would no longer be
required to register as an investment company under the Act.



Applicant's Conditions



Cityfed agrees that the requested exemption will be subject to the following conditions, each of which will apply
to Cityfed from the date of the order until it no longer meets the definition of an investment company or during the period
of time it is exempt from registration under the Act:

1. Cityfed will not purchase or otherwise acquire any additional securities other than securities that are rated
investment grade or higher by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or, if unrated, deemed to
be of comparable quality under guidelines approved by Cityfed's board of directors, subject to two exceptions:

a. Cityfed may make an equity investment in issuers that are not investment companies as defined in section 3(a) of
the Act (including issuers that are not investment companies because they are covered by a specific exclusion from
the definition of investment company under section 3(c) of the Act other than section 3(c)(1)) in connection with
the possible acquisition of an operating business as evidenced by a resolution approved by Cityfed's board of directors;
and

b. Cityfed may invest in one or more money market mutual funds that limit their investments to ``Eligible Securities''
within the meaning of rule 2a-7(a)(5) promulgated under the Act.

2. Cityfed's Form 10-KSB, Form 10-QSB and annual reports to shareholders will state that an exemptive
order has been granted pursuant to sections 6(c) and 6(e) of the Act and that Cityfed and other persons, in their transactions
and relations with Cityfed, are subject to sections 9, 17(a), 17(d), 17(e), 17(f), 36 through 45, and 47 through 51
of the Act, and the rules thereunder, as if Cityfed were a registered investment company, except insofar as permitted
by the order requested hereby.

3. Notwithstanding sections 17(a) and 17(d) of the Act, an affiliated person (as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the
Act) of Cityfed may engage in a transaction that otherwise would be prohibited by these sections with Cityfed:

(a) if such proposed transaction is first approved by a bankruptcy court on the basis that (i) the terms thereof, including
the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair to Cityfed, and (ii) the participation of Cityfed
in the proposed transaction will not be on a basis less advantageous to Cityfed than that of other participants; and

(b) in connection with each such transaction, Cityfed shall inform the bankruptcy court of (i) the identity of all
of its affiliated persons who are parties to, or have a direct or indirect financial interest in, the transaction;
(ii) the nature of the affiliation; and (iii) the financial interests of such persons in the transaction.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration (Commercial Net Lease Realty,
Inc., Common Stock, $0.01 Par Value) File No. 1-11290</DOCTITLE>



February 15, 1994.



Commercial Net Lease Realty, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission''), pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d)
promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American
Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:

According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on January 7,
1994 and concurrently therewith such stock was suspended from trading on the Amex.

In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and
indirect costs and expenses attendant on maintaining the dual listing of its common stock on the NYSE and on the Amex.
The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its common stock and believes that dual listing
would fragment the market for its common stock.

Any interested person may, on or before March 9, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemption Under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

PFAMCo Funds, Pacific Financial Asset Management Corporation (``PFAMCo''), Pacific Equities Network (the ``Distributor'').




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under section 6(c) for a conditional exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 18(f)(1), 18(g),
18(i), 22(c), and 22(d), and rule 22c-1.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order that would permit certain open-end management investment companies to issue multiple classes
of shares representing interests in the same portfolio of securities, and assess a contingent deferred sales charge
(a ``CDSC'') on certain redemptions of shares, and waive the CDSC under certain circumstances.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.




Applicants' Representations



1. PFAMCo Funds is a Massachusetts business trust that is a registered open-end management investment company. PFAMCo
Funds currently consists of fourteen portfolios. Shares of PFAMCo Funds generally are distributed through the Distributor,
a registered broker-dealer and an indirect subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company.

2. PFAMCo is a registered investment adviser and also an indirect subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company.
PFAMCo serves as investment adviser under an investment advisory agreement, and as administrator under an administration
agreement, to the portfolios of PFAMCo Funds. Under the administration agreement, PFAMCo has overall responsibility,
subject to the supervision of PFAMCo Funds' board of trustees, for providing or procuring, at PFAMCo's expense, the
administrative and other services necessary for the operation of PFAMCo Funds and its portfolios. These services
include custodial, administrative, transfer agency, portfolio accounting, dividend disbursing, auditing, and
ordinary legal services. PFAMCo also acts as a liaison among the various service providers. PFAMCo Funds differs
from most mutual funds in that the services provided under the administration agreement are paid by PFAMCo, as administrator,
whereas most mutual funds pay for these services directly from fund assets.

3. Applicants request an exemption on behalf of themselves, the portfolios of PFAMCo Funds, and any other open-end
investment company, or portfolio thereof, that may be established in the future that is advised or administered by
PFAMCo (or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with PFAMCo) or for which the Distributor
(or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Distributor) serves as principal underwriter
and that becomes part of the same ``group of investment companies,'' as that term is defined in rule 11a-3 (collectively,
the ``Funds''). Pursuant to the requested exemption, each Fund would be able to offer multiple classes of shares that
would be identical in all respects to shares of the other classes of shares of the Fund, except for class designation,
the allocation of certain expenses, voting rights, and exchange privileges. 

4. Applicants propose that each Fund would enter into an agreement (the ``Administration Agreement'') with its administrator,
which may be PFAMCo or another person, for the provision or procurement of the administrative and other services necessary
for the ordinary operation of the Fund. These services would include transfer agency, custodian, recordkeeping,
dividend disbursing, auditing, and ordinary legal services. The administrator would provide or procure such services
for a fee (the ``Administration Fee'') to be agreed upon by the administrator and the Fund. The Administration Agreement
will provide that the services that are rendered to the Fund will be rendered to each class of the Fund, and each such
class will be obligated to pay the applicable Administration Fee. 

5. Any services required for the operation of a class in addition to those provided in the Administration Agreement
would be provided for in a separate agreement or addendum (the ``Class Addendum''). Under the Class Addendum, the
Fund's administrator would provide or procure the services contracted for in the Class Addendum for a specified fee
(the ``Class Addendum Fee''). The services rendered under the Class Addendum will relate only to the class or classes
specified in that Class Addendum, and only such class or classes shall be obligated to pay the Class Addendum Fee. Different
classes may have different Class Addenda, each of which would reflect the different servicing needs of those classes
that require service beyond that provided in the Administration Agreement. If a class is offered in connection with
a 12b-1 plan, the expenses payable for distribution services would not be included in a Class Addendum, but would
be payable under a separate 12b-1 agreement. A class could have a 12b-1 plan and a Class Addendum. 

6. Each Fund could offer one class (the ``Institutional Class'') solely to pension and profit sharing plans, employee
benefit trusts, endowments, foundations, corporations, other institutions, and high net worth individuals. The
Institutional Class would be similar or identical to the shares currently offered by PFAMCo Funds. There would be
no sales charge imposed on the purchase and redemption of shares of the Institutional Class, and no 12b-1 fees.
There would be a significant minimum initial investment, which currently is $200,000 for PFAMCo Funds. Applicants
anticipate that the Institutional Class will be the only class without a Class Addendum; all of the administrative
services for the Institutional Class would be provided under the Administration Agreement.

<TEXT>
 

7. Each Fund could offer one class (the ``Benefit Plan Class'') only to qualified or nonqualified employee benefit
plans. In addition to the services provided under the Administration Agreement, a Fund's administrator would provide
or procure additional administrative and recordkeeping services necessary for the employee benefit plans to invest
in the Funds. The administrator would charge a Class Administration Fee for the services, which fee is expected to
be no more than 35 basis points of the net assets attributable to the Benefit Plan Class. The services are limited to:
furnishing participant sub-accounting; maintaining separate records for each plan; assistance in processing
purchase and redemption transactions; disbursing or crediting to the plans and maintaining records of all proceeds
of redemptions of shares and all other distributions not reinvested in shares; preparing and transmitting to the
plans, plan participants, or the trustees of the plans periodic account statements, and the integration of such statements
with those of other transactions and balances in other accounts of the plan or participant; transmitting to the plans
prospectuses, proxy materials, reports, and other information required to be sent to shareholders under the federal
securities laws; transmitting to the transfer agent purchase orders and redemption requests placed by the plans;
transmitting to a Fund or its agents periodic reports necessary to enable the Fund to comply with state Blue Sky requirements;
transmitting to the plans or the trustees of the plans confirmations of purchase orders and redemption requests placed
by the plans; maintaining all account balance information for the plans and daily and monthly purchase summaries
expressed in shares and dollar amounts; and preparing, filing, and transmitting all federal, state, and local government
reports and returns as required by law with respect to each account maintained on behalf of a plan; providing information
to plans and participants about a Fund and its portfolios; and maintaining account designations and addresses.

8. A Fund may offer Benefit Plan Classes whose shares only are offered to qualified retirement plans for which a trustee
is vested with investment discretion as to plan assets (``Excluded Classes'') by means of a separate prospectus.
The Excluded Classes do not include Benefit Plan Classes whose shares are offered to self-directed plans in which
an individual plan beneficiary can make an investment decision. As a result, there will be no overlap between the investors
eligible to invest on their own behalf in Excluded Classes and any other class of a Fund.

9. Each Fund may offer one class of shares (the ``Administrative Services Class'') to the clients, members, or customers
of banks, broker-dealers, consultants, administrators, and other financial institutions (``Organizations''),
which would provide certain services to their customers who purchase shares of the Administrative Services Class.
Arrangements between the administrator and the Fund relating to such additional services are ``Administrative
Services Arrangements.'' The administrator would either provide these additional services directly or would procure
these services by entering into agreements with the Organizations. The services would be limited to: receiving,
aggregating, and processing shareholder orders; furnishing shareholder sub-accounting; providing and maintaining
elective shareholder services such as check writing and wire transfer services; providing and maintaining pre-authorized
investment plans; communicating periodically with shareholders; acting as the sole shareholder of record and nominee
for shareholders; maintaining account records for shareholders; answering questions and handling correspondence
from shareholders about their accounts; issuing confirmations for transactions by shareholders; and performing
similar account administrative services.

10. Each Fund also could offer classes with a 12b-1 plan (the ``12b-1 Classes''). Under a 12b-1 plan,
a Fund would enter into agreements with certain financial institutions (``Service Agents'') providing for distribution
or distribution assistance of the shares of the 12b-1 Class. A Fund typically would make payments (the ``12b-1
Plan Payments'') to the Distributor or the Service Agent for such services.

11. The Funds may in the future offer classes in addition to those described above, provided the Funds met the conditions
imposed in any order of the SEC granting the requested relief.

12. The net asset value of all shares of a Fund would be computed on the same days and at the same times. The gross income
of a Fund would be allocated to each class on the basis of the relative net assets of each class. Expenses specifically
attributable to the particular class (``Class Expenses'') and 12b-1 Plan Payments would be charged directly
to the particular class to which they are attributable. Class Expenses would consist of fees under a Class Addendum
that relates to the class; litigation and indemnification expenses, if any, relating solely to one class; and fees
of independent directors/trustees (``trustees'') incurred as a result of issues relating to one class. Class Expenses
will be limited to those above, and the fees under a Class Addendum will be limited to fees payable for services set forth
in the description of the Class Addenda for the Benefit Plan Class and the Administrative Services Class. Expenses
incurred by a Fund not attributable to a particular class would be subtracted from the gross income on the basis of the
relative net assets of each class of the Fund. Such expenses include litigation and indemnification expenses, if
any, relating to a Fund, independent trustees' fees, and fees under the applicable Administration Agreement.

13. Because any 12b-1 Plan Payments and any Class Expenses that would be borne by a class of shares may vary for
each class, the net income of (and dividends payable to) each class may vary from that of the other class or classes of
the same Fund. Accordingly, for Funds that do not declare dividends daily (such as non-money market funds), the net
asset value per share attributable to each class would differ between dividend declaration dates.

14. Applicants also request an exemption to permit the Funds to assess a CDSC on redemptions of shares of a 12b-1
Class. The CDSC will not be imposed on redemptions of shares that were purchased after a specified period prior to the
redemption, which is expected to be six years, or on CDSC shares derived from reinvestment of dividends and distributions.
Furthermore, no CDSC will be imposed on an amount that represents an increase in the value of the shareholder's account
resulting from capital appreciation above the amount paid for the shares. In addition, no CDSC will be imposed on shares
purchased prior to any order granting the requested exemption.
15. The amount of the CDSC will be calculated as the lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the
net asset value of the shares at the time of purchase or the time of redemption. In determining the applicability and
rate of any CDSC, it will be assumed that redemption is made first of shares or amounts representing capital appreciation,
or reinvestment of dividends and capital gain distributions. Other shares or amounts then would be considered to
be redeemed in the order purchased, unless the Fund chose to redeem in another order that would result in a lower sales
load. This will result in the charge, if any, being imposed at the lowest possible rate. In all cases, the sum of any front-end
sales charge, asset-based sales charge, shareholder services charge, and CDSC will not exceed the maximum sales
charge provided for in article III, section 26(d) of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc.
16. No CDSC will be imposed in connection with an exchange privilege whereby an investor exchanges CDSC shares of a
Fund for CDSC shares of another Fund. All exchanges would be effected in accordance with rule 11a-3.
17. The Funds request the ability to waive the CDSC in connection with (a) redemptions by officers, directors, trustees,
and employees of Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company, and any of its affiliates, and such persons' immediate families,
(b) involuntary redemptions effected pursuant to the Fund's right to liquidate shareholder accounts having an aggregate
net asset value of less than the minimum account balance set forth in the Fund's then-current prospectus, and (c) total
or partial redemptions made in connection with the following distributions permitted to be made under the Internal
Revenue Code (``Code'') from an IRA or other qualified retirement plan: (i) Any redemption in connection with a lump
sum or other distribution following retirement, or, in the case of an IRA or Keogh Plan or a custodial account pursuant
to section 403(b)(7) of the Code, after attaining age 591/2; and (ii) any redemption that results from a tax-free return
of an excess contribution pursuant to section 408(d)(4) or (5) of the Code, or from the death or disability of the employee
(see sections 72(m)(7) and 408(f)(3) of the Code). As an alternative to waiver category (c), and if the trustees of
the Fund determine to adopt this alternative, the Fund could waive the CDSC with respect to any partial or complete
in connection with a distribution following retirement under a tax-deferred retirement plan or attaining age 701/2
in the case of an IRA or Keogh Plan, or custodial account resulting from the tax-free return of an excess contribution
to an IRA.
18. Applicants also could provide a 

pro rata 

credit paid by the Fund's distributor for any CDSC paid in connection with a redemption of shares followed by a reinvestment
effected within a specified period after the redemption. To effect this credit, the distributor would purchase additional
shares for the account of an investor who reinvests the redemption proceeds on which a CDSC was paid, in an amount equal
to the CDSC charged on the redemption.


Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. Applicants requests an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) to issue multiple
classes of shares representing interests in the same portfolio of securities. Applicants believe that, by implementing
the multiple class distribution system, the Funds would be able to facilitate the distribution of their shares and
provide a broad array of services without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs. Applicants also
believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights is equitable and would not discriminate against
any group of shareholders. The proposed arrangement does not involve borrowings, affect the Funds' existing assets
or reserves, or increase the speculative character of the shares of a Fund.

<TEXT>
 

2. In addition, applicants believe that the establishment of a multi-class distribution system with the proposed
fee structure benefits shareholders by providing predictability of expenses and ease of understanding the expenses
that will be paid. The proposed arrangement provides an additional choice for investors to whom such predictability
is important. The structure makes a party other than the Fund assume the economic risks of paying a Fund's operating
expenses during the start-up phase, and bear the expenses of providing services to the classes.

3. Applicants also request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d), and
rule 22c-1, to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive a CDSC on redemptions of shares. Applicants believe
that their request to permit the CDSC arrangement would place the purchaser in a better position than if a sales load
were imposed at the time of sale, since the shareholder may have to pay only a reduced sales charge, or no sales charge
at all.



Applicant's Conditions



Applicants agree that any order granting the requested exemption shall be subject to the following conditions:

1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund, and be identical in
all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences between the classes of shares of a Fund relate solely
to: (a) The impact of the disproportionate 12b-1 Payments and Class Expenses; (b) voting rights as to matters exclusively
affecting one class of shares; (c) exchange features; and (d) class designation differences. Any additional incremental
expenses not specifically identified above which are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated
to one class of shares shall not be so allocated until approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order or other relief
from the SEC.

2. The trustees of PFAMCo Funds and of any subsequently created Funds, including a majority of the independent trustees,
will approve the offering of multiple classes of shares (the ``Multi-Class System''). The minutes of the meetings
of the trustees regarding the deliberations of the trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement
the Multi-Class System will reflect in detail the reasons for the trustees' determination that the proposed Multi-Class
System is in the best interests of the Funds and their shareholders.

3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of trustees of the relevant Fund, including a majority
of the independent trustees. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable
by a Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to such Fund's trustees, and the trustees shall review, at least quarterly
after such initial determination, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures
were made.

4. The board of trustees of each Fund, including a majority of the independent trustees, will review the services to
be provided and fees to be charged to a class pursuant to a proposed Class Addendum, and will make a determination (i)
that the Class Addendum is in the best interests of the class of the Fund subject to the Class Addendum and the shareholders
of the class; (ii) that the fees charged to the class by the administrator in relation to the services to be provided
to the class under the Class Addendum are fair and reasonable; and (iii) that the services to be provided for the class
and the Class Administration Fee to be charged for such services are reasonably designed so that such services that
benefit only a class, as opposed to the Fund generally, would augment (and not be duplicative of) services rendered
to the Fund pursuant to the Administration Agreement.

1







5. On an ongoing basis, a Fund's trustees, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise,
will monitor the Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares.
The trustees, including a majority of the independent trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. Each Fund's investment adviser, sub-investment adviser (if any),
administrator (if separate), and distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts
to the trustees. If a conflict arises, the adviser and the distributor at their own cost will remedy such conflict up
to and including establishing a new registered management investment company.

6. The Administrative Services Arrangements will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth
in rule 12b-1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b-1, except
that shareholders need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 
12b-1.

7. The trustees of each Fund will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning expenditures of a Fund or class
thereof pursuant to 12b-1 plans and Administrative Services Arrangements complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii)
of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable
to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged
to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the trustees
to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based,
will be subject to the review and approval of the independent trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.

8. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that payments made by a class
under its 12b-1 plan or administrative fees, and any Class Expenses will be borne exclusively by that class.

9. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who
has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology and procedures
are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations would be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing
basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations
are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Fund that the calculations
and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert will be filed as part of the periodic reports filed
with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports,
following request by applicants (which applicants agree to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC
staff upon written request by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an
Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional
Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies
and procedures placed in operation'' and ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation
and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in Statement of Accounting Standards No. 70 of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''), as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar
auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.

10. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for
calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes of shares and the proper allocation
of expenses among the classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial
report referred to in condition 9 above and will be concurred with by the Expert or an appropriate substitute Expert
on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 9 above. Applicants will take
immediate corrective measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert, or appropriate substitute
Expert.

11. The prospectus of each class of a Fund will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson or any other person
entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect
to one particular class of shares over another in that Fund.
12. The distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular
investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to such standards.
Such compliance standards will require that all investors eligible to purchase shares of the Excluded Classes be
sold only shares of the Excluded Classes, rather than any other class of shares offered by the Fund.
13. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the trustees
with respect to the Multi-Class System will be set forth in guidelines to be furnished to the trustees.
14. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
CDSCs, and exchange privileges (if any) applicable to each class of shares in each prospectus, regardless of whether
each class of shares are offered through each prospectus, except that such disclosure need not be made with respect
to any Excluded Classes. Excluded Classes will be offered solely pursuant to a separate prospectus. Each prospectus
for Excluded Classes will disclose the existence of the Fund's other classes, and the prospectuses for the Fund's
other classes will identify the persons eligible to purchase shares of the Excluded Classes. Each Fund will disclose
the respective expenses and performance data applicable to all other classes of shares in every shareholder report.
The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information
related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared
on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent that any advertisement or sales
literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the
respective expenses and/or performance data applicable to all other classes of shares, except the Excluded Classes.
Advertising materials reflecting the expenses or performance data for an Excluded Class will be available only to
those persons eligible to purchase that class. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper
or similar listing of a Fund's net asset value or public offering price will present each class of shares separately,
except for the Excluded Classes.
15. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the requested exemptive order will not imply SEC approval, authorization
of or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that applicants may make pursuant to any Administration Agreement,
Class Addendum, or any 12b-1 plan, in reliance on the exemptive order.
16. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act (see Investment Company
Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988)), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended.

Applicant's Representations

laws by The Travelers Insurance Company (``Travelers''), a life insurance company domiciled in Connecticut. 

2. On July 3, 1975, Applicant filed a Notice of Registration on Form N-8B-1 under section 8(b) of the 1940
Act (File No. 811-2583) and a Registration Statement on Form S-5 under the Securities Act of 1933 (File

Statement became effective on April 30, 1976. The initial public offering commenced on May 1, 1976.

3. On November 19, 1993, the Contracts were exchanged for another Travelers' variable annuity contract (``New Contract'')
pursuant to an offer of exchange extended by Travelers to Contractowners on September 10, 1992. All Contractowners
contacted either consented to the offer to exchange or surrendered their contracts. The New Contract has as an investment
option The Travelers Quality Bond Account for Variable Annuities (``Account QB''). Account QB is an investment company
with identical investment objectives, adviser and management fees as that of the Applicant. All units in Applicant
held under the existing contracts were exchanged for units of equal value in Account QB under the New Contract. The
offer of exchange was made in compliance with Rule 11a-2 under the 1940 Act. All portfolio securities of the Applicant
were transferred to Account QB, valued on the basis of net asset values of the securities as determined in accordance
with the methods set forth in the Statement of Additional Information of the Applicant and Account QB. No brokerage
commissions were paid. The transfer of portfolio securities was made pursuant to a Commission order under section
17(b) granting an exemption from section 17(a) of the 1940 Act. (Release No. IC-19232, File No. 812-8172.)

4. As of November 18, 1993, Applicant had 630,239.9891 units of interest outstanding and net assets of $2,773,229.14,
representing 4.388301 Contracts issued prior to December 23, 1983 and 4.284953 Contracts issued subsequent to that
date.

5. Any expenses connected with the offer of exchange or the liquidation of the Applicant will be paid by Travelers.

6. Applicant has not remaining assets, and no debts or liabilities remain outstanding. No distributions were made
to Applicant's security holders. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceedings. There
are no security holders of Applicant.

7. Applicant is not now engaged nor does it propose to engage in any business activities other than those necessary
for the winding-up of its affairs.

8. Applicant has not, within the last 18 months, transferred any of its assets to a separate trust, the beneficiaries
of which were or are security holders of Applicant.

9. Travelers intends to notify the Connecticut and New York Insurance Departments, each having approved the transfer
of assets, that it no longer intends to utilize the Applicant as a separate account.

10. Applicant has made on a timely basis all filings required on Form N-SAR. Applicant's last filing on Form N-SAR

<USDEPT>OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC); Request for Comments Concerning Foreign Government Discrimination in Procurement</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the United States Trade Representative.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of request for public comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice requests written submissions from the public concerning discrimination against United States products
and services by foreign governments in their procurement practices. This information will be used in compiling the
annual report on foreign discrimination in government procurement specified by section 305 of the Trade Agreements
Act of 1979 (Trade Agreements Act), as amended by Title VII of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (19
U.S.C. 2515).



Section 305 of the Trade Agreements Act requires the President to submit an annual report on the extent to which foreign
countries discriminate against United States products or services in making government procurements. In the annual
report, the President is required to identify any countries that:

(a) Are signatories to the GATT Agreement on Government Procurement (Agreement) and are not in compliance with the
requirements of the Agreement;
(b)(i) Are signatories to the Agreement; (ii) are in compliance with the Agreement, but maintain a significant and
persistent pattern or practice of discrimination in the government procurement of products or services from the
United States not covered by the Agreement, which results in identifiable harm to U.S. business; and (iii) whose products
or services are acquired in significant amounts by the United States Government; or
(c) Are not Signatories to the Agreement and maintain a significant and persistent pattern or practice of discrimination
in government procurement of products or services from the United States, which results in identifiable harm to U.S.
business, and whose products or services are acquired in significant amounts by the United States Government.
The functions vested in the President under Section 305 of the Trade Agreements Act were delegated to the United States
Trade Representative (USTR) pursuant to Section 4-101 of Executive Order 12661 (54 FR 779).






</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 305 of the Trade Agreements Act requires an annual report to be submitted no later than April 30, 1993 to the
appropriate Committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The USTR is required to request consultations
with any countries identified in the report to obtain their compliance with the Agreement or the elimination of their
discriminatory procurement practices.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940222-2-00086 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940222-2-00066 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

USTR invites submissions from interested parties concerning foreign government procurement practices that should
be considered in developing the annual report. Pursuant to section 305(d)(5) of the Trade Agreements Act, submissions
are sought from any interested parties in the United States and in countries that are signatories to the Agreement,
as well as in other foreign countries whose products or services are acquired in significant amounts by the United
States Government.

Each submission should provide, in order, the following general information: (1) The party submitting the information;
(2) the foreign country or countries that are the subject of the submission and the entities of each subject country's
government whose practices are being identified, and (3) the U.S. products or services that are affected by the non-compliance
or discrimination.

Each submission should provide, in order, the following specific information on non-compliance with the Agreement
or discrimination: (1) The circumstances under which discrimination has occurred, including information regarding
the date and nature of procurement(s) where discrimination was encountered; (2) policies or practices which are
deemed to be discriminatory (where possible, include copies of discriminatory laws, policies or regulations),
and (3) the extent to which noncompliance with the Code or discrimination has impeded the ability of U.S. suppliers
to participate in procurements on terms comparable to those available to suppliers of the country in question when
they are seeking to sell goods or services to the United States Government. Wherever possible, submissions should
address the extent to which countries identified: (i) Use sole-sourcing or otherwise noncompetitive procedures
for procurements that could have been conducted using competitive procedures; (ii) conduct what normally would
have been one procurement as two or more procurements, in order to decrease the anticipated contact value below the
Agreement's value threshold or to make the procurement less attractive to U.S. businesses; (iii) announce procurement
opportunities without adequate time for U.S. businesses to submit bids, and (iv) employ specifications in such a
way as to limit the ability of U.S. suppliers to participate in procurements.

Finally, each submission should: (1) Identify requirements of the Agreement which are not being observed by the country
identified or describe how the country identified has maintained a significant and persistent pattern or practice
of discrimination in government procurement of non-Code-Covered goods; (2) identify the specific impact of the
discriminatory policy or practice on United States businesses (including an estimate of the value of market opportunities
lost and, if any, the cost of preparing bids which are rejected during the course of a procurement evaluation for discriminatory
reasons), and (3) describe the extent to which the products or services of the country identified are acquired in significant
amounts by the United States Government.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces that it is reviewing a proposed noise compatibility program
that was submitted for Bishop International Airport under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise
Abatement Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-193) (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act'') and 14 CFR Part 150 by Bishop International
Airport Authority. This program was submitted subsequent to a determination by the FAA that associated noise exposure

of this program for public review and comment.




An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by the FAA to be in compliance with the requirements
of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150, promulgated pursuant to Title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility
program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing
noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses.


The FAA has formally received the noise compatibility program for Bishop International Airport, effective on January
26, 1994. It was requested that the FAA review this material and that the noise mitigation measures, to be implemented
jointly by the airport and surrounding communities, be approved as a noise compatibility program under section 104(b)
of the Act. Preliminary review of the submitted material indicates that it conforms to the requirements for the submittal
of noise compatibility programs, but that further review will be necessary prior to approval or disapproval of the
program. The formal review period, limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will be completed on or before July 25, 1994.


The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR part 150,  150.33. The primary
considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviation safety,
create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing
existing no compatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses. Interested
persons are invited to comment on the proposed program with specific reference to these factors. All comments, other
than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable.
Copies of the noise exposure maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed noise compatibility program
are available for examination at the following locations:








Federal Aviation Administration, Detroit Airports District Office, Willow Run Airport, East, 8820 Beck Road, Belleville,
Michigan 48111,

Evaluation Report on Glass-Plastic Windshield Glazing, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, Motor Vehicle
Glazing Materials



<AGENCY>

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This notice announces the publication by NHTSA of an Evaluation Report concerning Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard
No. 205, ``Glazing Materials.'' This staff report evaluates the safety, durability, and cost of glass-plastic windshield
glazing which was introduced, for a limited time, in selected new passenger car models. The report was developed in
accordance with Executive Order 12866, which requires Federal agencies to carry out periodic reviews of regulations
that they have promulgated. NHTSA seeks public review and comment on this evaluation. Comments will be used to complete
the review as required by the Executive Order. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 205 (49 CFR 571.205), ``Glazing Materials,'' issued by NHTSA in
January 1968, prescribes safety requirements for all glazing materials used in motor vehicles, including the windshield,
the windows, and any interior partitions. The purpose of the standard is to reduce injuries resulting from impact
with glazing surfaces, to ensure a necessary degree of transparency in motor vehicle windows for driver visibility,
and to minimize the possibility of occupants being thrown through the vehicle windshield in collisions. 



In 1985, the agency published an evaluation study (DOT HS 806 693, February 1985) of conventional windshield glazing
which has been standard equipment in American-made vehicles since the mid-1960's. Conventional glazing, often
referred to as ``HPR'' (or High Penetration Resistant) glazing, was found to be a significant safety improvement
over prior glazing designs, and was credited with bringing about a major reduction in the frequency and severity of
head and facial injuries which resulted from occupants being thrown against the windshield in crashes. The primary
benefit of the HPR design was a large reduction in the more severe facial lacerations and fractures, with a more modest
reduction in minor lacerations, the majority of which still remained after HPR glazing was introduced. 

In 1983, NHTSA amended FMVSS No. 205 to permit (but not require) the use of a new type of glazing, known as ``glass-plastic''
glazing. Glass-plastic glazing is similar in construction to the type used in the HPR windshield design except for
the addition of a thin sheet of plastic bonded to the inside surface of the windshield. This feature was believed to
have a high potential for reducing lacerative injuries to occupants who struck the windshield during crashes. At
the same time, there was some concern over the durability of the softer plastic liner of the glass-plastic windshield
relative to the inner glass surface of the standard HPR windshield. 

Following NHTSA's amendment of FMVSS No. 205, two motor vehicle manufacturers equipped a number of their cars with
glass-plastic windshields for field testing in rental fleets. One of the manufacturers also introduced the windshield
to the general public by making it standard equipment on selected make models for a limited period of time. 

NHTSA is conducting an evaluation study of glass-plastic
