Dried Prunes Produced In California; Changes In Producer District Boundaries 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule revises the administrative rules and regulations established under the Federal marketing
order for dried prunes produced in California. This rule realigns the boundaries of seven districts established
for independent producer representation on the Prune Marketing Committee (Committee). The realignment provides
for more equitable representation for those members, and makes provisions of the order consistent with current industry
demographics. This rule is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Committee, which is responsible for local administration
of the order.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 993 (7 CFR part 993), regulating the handling
of dried prunes produced in California. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of
1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 



The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of entry of the ruling. 

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are approximately 20 handlers of dried prunes who are subject to regulation under the dried prune marketing
order and approximately 1,360 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the
Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000, and small
agricultural producers have been defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of handlers
and producers of California dried prunes may be classified as small entities. 

This interim final rule realigns the boundaries of the seven districts established for independent producer representation
on the Committee. To be consistent with current industry demographics, this interim rule ensures that, insofar as
practicable, each district represents an equal number of independent producers and an equal volume of prunes grown
by such producers. The change will not impose any additional regulatory, informational, or cost requirements on
handlers or producers. 

This action revises  993.128 of Subpart_Administrative Rules and Regulations and is based on a unanimous recommendation
of the Committee and other available information. 

Section 993.24 of the order provides that the Committee shall consist of 22 members, of which 14 shall represent producers,
7 shall represent handlers, and 1 shall represent the public. The 14 producer member positions are apportioned between
cooperative producers and independent producers in the same proportion, insofar as is practicable, as the percentage
of the total prune tonnage handled by the cooperative and independent handlers during the year preceding the year
in which nominations are made is to the total handled by all handlers. In recent years and currently, cooperative producers
and independent producers each have been eligible to nominate seven members. 

Section 993.28 of the order provides that, for independent producers, the Committee shall, with the approval of the
Secretary of Agriculture, divide the production area into districts, giving, insofar as practicable, equal representation
throughout the production area by numbers of independent producers and production of prune tonnage by such producers.
When revisions are required, the Committee must make its recommendations to the Secretary of Agriculture to change
the district boundaries prior to January 31 of any year in which nominations are to be made. Nominations are made in
all even-numbered years, including 1994. 

The Committee recommended this change at its December 8, 1993, meeting. Since the last redistricting in 1990, the
number of producers and volume of production in most districts has changed, causing imbalances among some districts.
Thus, redistricting is needed to bring the districts in line with order requirements and current California prune
industry demographics. 

This interim final rule establishes Colusa and Glenn counties as District 1 and adds Tehama and Shasta counties to
District 4. It also moves the boundary between the central Sutter and southern Sutter districts north from Oswald
Road to Bogue Road, and makes the central Sutter County area a part of District 2. This rule also designates the portion
of District 4, which includes the San Joaquin Valley counties, as District 7. This rule also adds northern Sutter County
to Butte County to become a new District 5. District 6 will continue to be Yuba County. 

The Committee calculated the percentage of total independent prune growers and the percentage of total independent
grower prune tonnage for each proposed new district. The two percentages were averaged for each district to determine
a representation factor for each district. The optimal representation factor is determined to be 14.29 percent (100
percent divided by 7 districts). 

The representation factors for the seven old and the seven new districts are shown below, based on the 1992-93
crop year. 






The redistricting recommendation is desirable because it allows each district to approximate the optimal representation
factor, while maintaining a continuous geographic boundary for each district. In addition, several of the districts
whose representation factors are below the optimum are expected to experience production increases in the next few
years which are likely to be above the industry average. 

Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this interim final rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant information presented, including the Committee's unanimous recommendation
and other available information, it is found that this regulation, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act. 

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that, upon good cause, it is impracticable, unnecessary,
and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good
cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The order requires that independent producer nomination meetings be held for each of the seven districts
prior to March 8, 1994, for the term of office beginning June 1, 1994 and this action should be in place before those meetings;
(2) this action does not impose additional regulatory requirements on handlers or producers and, therefore, neither
handlers nor producers need additional time to comply; (3) the industry is aware of this action, which was unanimously
recommended by the Committee at an open meeting; and (4) this rule provides a 30-day comment period and any comments
received will be considered prior to finalization of this rule.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) amends its regulation with regard to the annual review of borrowers with limited
resource Farm Ownership (FO), Soil and Water (SW), and Operating (OL) loans. The amendments are necessary to clarify
annual review procedures for limited resource loan borrowers. The intended effect is to reduce the number of borrowers
who are past due for limited resource loan reviews.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This rule is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12866 because it has no impact on FmHA borrowers or other
members of the public. It is the policy of this Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits,
or contracts shall be published for comments, notwithstanding the exemption in 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules.
This action, however, is not published for proposed rulemaking because it involves only internal Agency management
and publication for comment is unnecessary.



Paperwork Reduction Act



The information collection requirements contained in this regulation have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB control number 0575-0061
in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). This final rule does not revise or impose any
new information collection or recordkeeping requirement from those approved by OMB.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; correction.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action makes a correction to Airworthiness Directive (AD) 94-02-02 concerning Rockwell International/Collins
Air Transport Division (Collins) DME-700 distance measuring equipment (DME) installed on aircraft, which
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 18, 1994 (59 FR 2519). That publication inadvertently referenced Collins Service Bulletin (SB) 25, DME-700-34-25,
as Collins SB 25, DME-600-34-25, in paragraph (f) of the AD. All other reference to this service bulletin
is correct. This action changes the AD to correctly identify this service bulletin in paragraph (f) of the AD.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On January 11, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued AD 94-02-02, Amendment 39-8799
(59 FR 2519), which applies to certain Collins DME-700 distance measuring equipment installed on aircraft.
This AD requires modifying these DME units to ensure that they are functioning properly.


The AD inadvertently referenced Collins Service Bulletin (SB) 25, DME-700-34-25, as Collins SB
25, DME-600-34-25, in paragraph (f) of the AD. All other reference to this service bulletin is correct.
This action changes the AD to correctly identify this service bulletin in paragraph (f) of the AD.


Need for Correction


As published, the final regulations have incorrectly referenced Collins SB 25, DME-700-34-25,
as SB 25, DME-600-34-25, in paragraph (f) of AD 94-02-02. This could cause confusion
when obtaining the proper procedures to follow in accomplishing the required modifications.


Correction of Publication


Accordingly, the publication of January 18, 1994 (59 FR 2519) of Amendment 39-8799; AD 94-02-02,
which was the subject of FR Doc. 94-1088, is corrected as follows:

Airworthiness Directives: Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., MU-2B Series Airplanes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that applies to certain Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.
(Mitsubishi), MU-2B series airplanes. This action requires reducing the maximum deflection of the elevator
nose-down trim to a 1-degree to 3-degree range. Analysis of service history on the affected airplanes has revealed
one accident and two incidents where the existing elevator nose-down trim deflection caused excessive control wheel
force. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent excessive control wheel force caused by extreme elevator
nose-down trim deflection, which could result in loss of control of the airplane.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that would apply to certain Mitsubishi
MU-2B series airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 14, 1992 (57 FR 58999). The action proposed to require reducing the maximum deflection of the elevator
nose-down trim to a 1-degree to 3-degree range. The proposed action would be accomplished in accordance with Mitsubishi
Service Bulletin No. 216, dated September 11, 1992.





Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the one comment received. 


The commenter supports the proposed action, but recommends that, to eliminate any applicability questions from
the field, the FAA issue one AD to cover the Mitsubishi MU-2B series airplanes covered under two FAA Type Certificates:
A2PC and A10SW. The FAA concurs that one AD may eliminate applicability questions from the field; however, ADs are
issued against airplanes of the same type design. Since these airplanes are certificated under two separate type
designs, the FAA is issuing an AD on each type design. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment. 


No comments were received on the FAA's determination of the cost impact on the public. 


After careful review, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule
as proposed except for minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these minor corrections will not
change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed. 


The FAA estimates that 252 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
6 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an
hour. Parts cost approximately $300 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $158,760. This figure is based on the assumption that none of the affected airplane operators have
accomplished the required action.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, in a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action
is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action establishes Class E airspace near Appleton, MN, to accommodate a new Nondirectional Beacon (NDB) runway
13 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) to Appleton Municipal Airport, Appleton, MN. Controlled airspace
extending upward from 700 to 1200 feet above ground level (AGL) is needed to contain aircraft executing the approach.
The intended effect of this action is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures in
instrument conditions from other aircraft operating in visual weather conditions.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

History


On Tuesday, November 30, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71)
to accommodate a new Nondirectional Beacon (NDB) runway 13 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) to Appleton
Municipal Airport, Appleton, MN (58 FR 63127). The proposal was to add controlled airspace extending from 700 feet
to 1200 feet AGL to contain Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations in controlled airspace during portions of the
terminal operation and while transiting between the enroute and terminal environments. Interested parties were
invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No
comments objecting to the proposal were received.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will
be published subsequently in the Order.



The Rule


This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Appleton, MN, to accommodate
a new Nondirectional Beacon (NDB) runway 13 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) to Appleton Municipal
Airport, Appleton, MN. Controlled airspace extending from 700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed to contain aircraft executing
the approach.
Aeronautical maps and charts will reflect the defined area which will enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in
order to comply with applicable visual flight rules requirements.
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Amendment of Class E Airspace; West Yellowstone, MT



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action amends the West Yellowstone, Montana, Class E airspace. This action corrects an error in the airspace
description inadvertently omitted during the airspace reclassification process. This action amends the West Yellowstone,
Montana Class E airspace from full-time back to part-time. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September
16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition area,'' replacing it with the designation ``Class E airspace.''





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



History



On December 3, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) by amending
the West Yellowstone, Montana, Class E airspace (58 FR 63905). Interested parties were invited to participate in
this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the
proposal were received.

Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition
area,'' and airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth is now Class E airspace. Class
E airspace designations for airspace areas extending 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will
be published subsequently in the Order.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the Class E airspace at West Yellowstone, Montana,
to correct an error in the airspace description inadvertently omitted during the airspace reclassification process.
This action amends the West Yellowstone Class E airspace from full-time back to part-time.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Establishment of Class E Airspace; Port Huron, MI


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action establishes Class E airspace at Port Huron, MI. A standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has been
developed at St. Clair County International Airport. Controlled airspace to the surface is needed to contain instrument
flight rules (IFR) operations at the airport. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace
for IFR operators executing the recently established SIAP.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
History


On December 9, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class E airspace at Port Huron, MI (58 FR 64710). An Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS) has been installed
at the St. Clair County International Airport that will continuously provide weather data, and a non-federal ILS
SIAP has been established. Controlled airspace to the surface is needed to contain IFR operations at the airport.

Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received.
Minor changes have been made to the legal description to add an exclusion for the portion overlying Canadian airspace,
to eliminate specification of dates and times of operation since this Class E airspace will operate continuously,
and to correct the latitude coordinates. Other than these editorial changes, this amendment is the same as that proposed
in the notice. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E2 airspace designations
are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is
incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this
document will be published subsequently in the Order.


The Rule


This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Port Huron, MI, to provide
controlled airspace to the surface for aircraft executing the ILS SIAP into the St. Clair County International Airport.
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 16, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Standard Instrument Approach Procedures; Miscellaneous Amendments



<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and  97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Forms
8260-3, 8260-4, and 8260-5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above.




The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 

Federal Register

 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.

This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. Some
SIAP amendments may have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for some SIAP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining
SIAPs, and effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided.

Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions
existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these
SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary,
impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``major
rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and  97.20 of the Federal
Aviations Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as
stated above.


The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication

Federal Register

The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.


The Rule


This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been cancelled. The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained
in the U.S. Standard for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs
by FDC/P NOTAMs, the TERPs criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports.
This amendment to part 97 contains separate SIAPs which have compliance dates stated as effective dates based on related
changes in the National Airspace System or the application of new or revised criteria. All SIAP amendments in this
rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice Airmen (NOTAM) as an emergency
action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances which
created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days.
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the US Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). Because of the close and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and
safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable,
and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective
in less than 30 days.


Conclusion


The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``major

Industry Guide: Guides for the Greeting Card Industry Relating to Discriminatory Practices



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Trade Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rules; Notice of repeal of industry guide.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Trade Commission announces the repeal of the guides concerning discriminatory practices in the greeting
card industry, hereinafter referred to as the ``Greeting Card Guides'' or the ``Guides.'' The Commission has reviewed
the provisions of the Guides, and has concluded that due to substantial duplication by later-adopted statements
of policy of general application, the Guides are no longer in the public interest and should be withdrawn. Accordingly,
the Greeting Card Guides are rescinded.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



The ``Guides for the Greeting Card Industry Relating to Discriminatory Practices'' were published in 1968. They
discuss the ways in which the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. 13, will apply to that industry. The primary purpose of
the Guides was to describe the principles that the Federal Trade Commission would follow in applying sections 2 (d)
and (e) of the Act, which require that promotional allowances and services be made available on nondiscriminatory
terms.






The same year that the Guides were issued, the Supreme Court decided the case of 

FTC 

v. 

Fred Meyer, Inc., 

390 U.S. 341 (1968). In that opinion the Court suggested that the Commission might wish to expand on earlier guidance
and issue detailed guidelines to promotional allowances under sections 2 (d) and (e). The Commission accepted this
invitation the following year by publishing the so-called ``Fred Meyer Guides.'' See 16 CFR part 240. These set out
general standards for promotional allowances, applicable to all industries. The Fred Meyer Guides have since been
amended as necessary to keep them current, most recently in 1990.

With the Fred Meyer Guides in place, the Commission grew concerned that earlier, industry-specific guidelines had
become redundant and a potential source of confusion. In July of 1993 it therefore requested public comment on a proposal
to repeal the Greeting Card Guides. Only one comment was received.



Analysis



The Commission believes that the Greeting Card Guides are duplicated and made redundant by the Fred Meyer Guides.
Although the Greeting Card Guides are tailored for the industry (e.g., ```supplier' means any greeting card publisher
or distributor,'' 16 CFR 240.0(d)), the legal principles reflected in the Guides are not specific to that industry.
The applicable law is set out in the Robinson-Patman Act, as interpreted and applied in Commission and judicial precedent.
The same principles are reflected in the Fred Meyer Guides. The retention of the separate Greeting Card Guides therefore
serves no purpose.

No members of the greeting card industry have requested that the Guides be retained, suggesting that industry members
do not perceive a need to continue the Guides. The Commission has received a letter from the Executive Vice President
of the Greeting Card Association, reporting that the Association ``has no objection'' to repeal of the Guides, the
some retailer members of the Association are already familiar with the Fred Meyer Guides, and that ``it seems superfluous
to have two sets of the same guidelines.''






In view of these facts the Commission has concluded that the Greeting Card Guides serve no present function and, therefore,
has determined to withdraw those Guides.

<DOCTITLE>Trade Regulation Rule: Discriminatory Practices in Men's and Boys' Tailored Clothing Industry</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Trade Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; Notice of repeal of rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Trade Commission announces the rescission of the rule concerning the need for a written plan to guide a
seller's promotional allowances in the men's and boys' tailored clothing industry (hereinafter the ``Tailored
Clothing Rule'' or the ``Rule''). The Commission has reviewed the provisions of the Rule, and has concluded that due
to inconsistencies with and duplication by later-adopted statements of policy of general application, the Tailored
Clothing Rule is no longer in the public interest and should be repealed. This notice contains a Statement of Basis
and Purpose for the repeal of the Rule, and incorporates a regulatory analysis.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Statement of Basis and Purpose


Background


The Tailored Clothing Rule, promulgated in 1967, was intended to clarify the way in which the Robinson-Patman Act,
15 U.S.C. 13, applies to that industry. Section 2(d) and (e) of the Act require that promotional allowances and services
be made available to competing sellers on proportionately equal terms. The Rule established a presumption that allowances
in the tailored clothing industry that were not provided in accordance with a written plan were not available on proportionately
equal terms. 
The year after the Rule was promulgated, the Supreme Court decided the case of 

FTC 

v. 

Fred Meyer, Inc., 

390 U.S. 341 (1968). In that option the Court suggested that the Commission might wish to expand on earlier guidance
and issue detailed guidelines to promotional allowances under sections 2(d) and (e). The Commission accepted this
invitation the following year by publishing the so-called ``Fred Meyer Guides.'' See 16 CFR part 240. These set out
general standards for promotional allowances, applicable to all industries. The Fred Meyer Guides suggest that
sellers ``would be well advised'' to put complex plans in writing, but they do not penalize the failure to have a written
plan. The Fred Meyer Guides have been revised as needed to keep them current, most recently in 1990. 
With the Fred Meyer Guides in place, the Commission was concerned that the earlier, industry-specific Rule was unnecessary,
and that its different substantive provisions could be a source of potential confusion. In July of 1993 the Commission
therefore requested public comment on a proposal to repeal the Tailored Clothing Rule. No comments were received
in response to this request. 


The Rulemaking Record 


The rulemaking record in this proceeding consists of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Request for Comment dated
July 2, 1993 (58 FR 35907), and a memorandum from the Office of the Secretary reporting that no comments were received
in response to that request. In addition, the Commission takes notice of published court and agency decisions, and
of the existence and provisions of the Fred Meyer Guides.

<TEXT>
 

Analysis of the Rulemaking Record



The rulemaking record indicated that the Tailored Clothing Rule no longer appears to be useful or justified. Since
the Rule was promulgated, it does not appear that the agency has ever relied on the Rule in a law enforcement matter,
or that any litigant has ever made use of it in a reported private action. Moreover, no industry members responded to
the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to urge retention of the Rule.

Repeal would also resolve the inconsistency between the Rule and the Fred Meyer Guides. The Fred Meyer Guides encourage
but do not require sellers to have a written plan for promotional allowances.
 The Robinson-Patman Act also does not require sellers to have a written plan. The Tailored Clothing Rule, on the other
hand, states that promotional payments ``will be presumed not to have been made available on proportionately equal
terms'' unless they are made available under a written plan.







Although this dichotomy creates no inconsistent legal obligations, there is a significant policy discrepancy in
that the tailored clothing industry is treated differently from other industries. Since the Commission's post-enactment
experience has not confirmed the relevance or utility of treating this industry differently, this is an additional
reason for repeal of the Rule.



Final Regulatory Analysis



The following discussion constitutes the Commission's Final Regulatory Analysis of the proposed repeal of the Rule,
as called for by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq., 

and by section 22 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 57b-3.

A description of the reasons why action is being considered and the objectives of and legal basis for the repeal of the
Rule have been explained in prior parts of this Statement of Basis and Purpose.

Repeal of the Rule would appear to have little or no effect on small business. Because it does not appear that the Rule
is currently relied upon, its repeal should not have significant effects on business in general, and therefore should
not have any significant effects on small businesses in particular.

The Tailored Clothing Rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements as defined by the Paperwork
Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501-18. Repeal of the Rule would remove any other compliance requirements that are
associated with the Rule, such as the costs associated with becoming familiar with its provisions.

The only significant alternative to repeal of the Rule is to take no action and preserve the Rule in its present form.
Due to the subsequent publication of the Fred Meyer Guides, however, the Rule no longer serves a meaningful purpose.
Under these circumstances, retaining the Rule would run counter to the goal of achieving efficiencies by repealing
rules that are no longer useful.

The benefits of repealing this Rule include removal of an unnecessary provision from the Code of Federal Regulations,
the increased efficiency of law enforcement when uniform standards are applicable, and the increased respect for
the law that may be anticipated when regulations are current and relevant.

The Commission believes that the above benefits are sufficient to support its determination to rescind this Rule.



List of Subjects in 16 CFR Part 412



Advertising, Clothing, Promotional allowances, Trade practices, Unfair methods of competition.



PART 412_[REMOVED]



Accordingly, under the authority of 15 U.S.C. 41

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On November 24, 1993, the Department of Labor published proposed revisions to the rules establishing a fee schedule
and procedures for submitting bills for reimbursement for medical procedures and services provided to injured federal
employees under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) (58 FR 62063). The Office of Workers' Compensation
Programs (OWCP) proposed to: Adopt where applicable the relative value units (RVUs) devised by the Department of
Health and Human Services, Health Care Finance Administration (HCFA), published most recently on December 2, 1993,
58 FR 63626; eliminate the requirement to use the Washington State conversion factors; and allow the use of Geographic
Practice Cost Indices (GPCIs) developed by the Urban Institute for HCFA to determine geographic adjustment factors.
The rules also climate the requirement for original signatures on the bills. 


The comment period closed January 24, 1994, and no comments were received; the rules are now published in final in the
same form as they were proposed. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The preamble to the proposed rule explained in detail the background of the schedule of maximum allowable charges
for most medical services provided to injured workers under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA), 5 U.S.C.
8101 

et seq.

 See 51 FR 8276, for a complete explanation of the background and purpose of the schedule.


Under the fee schedule and billing system individual procedures are assigned a descriptor code using the Physicians'
Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) scheme developed by the American Medical Association. Each code is then assigned
a relative value unit (RVU) reflecting the relative skill, effort, risk, and time required to perform the procedure.
The maximum allowable amount payable for a given service is calculated by multiplying the RVU by a conversion factor
(CF). This product is in turn multiplied by a geographic index (GI) which allows for regional variations in medical
costs. 
The components of the fee schedule served OWCP well until recently, when the State of Washington (the system on which
several factors of the fee schedule were based), announced that it was adopting a new fee schedule based on the newly
published Health Care Financing Administrations (HCFA) RVUs for physicians' services, with modifications peculiar
to Washington State. 
Rather than continue to use the Washington State system, the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) proposed
to adopt elements of the HCFA fee schedule directly. OWCP will continue to use geographic localities (using Metropolitan
Statistical Areas) designed by the Urban Institute for application of Geographic Practice Cost Indices (GPCIs),
since Medicare pricing localities are carrier specific. Finally, the conversion factors (see 57 FR 5186) will be
changed to accommodate the change in scale of the relative unit values. 
The proposed rules also change the provision requiring that the medical provider sign the billing form, in order to
accommodate the practice of electronic transmission of medical bills and other similar practices. 
No comments at all were received on the proposed rules. Accordingly, the proposed changes are being implemented in
final unchanged, except for minor changes to correct grammatical and typographical errors.

Statutory Authority


5 U.S.C. 8149 provides the general statutory authority for the Secretary to prescribe rules and regulations necessary
for administration and enforcement of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.
5 U.S.C. 8145 provides that the Secretary of Labor shall administer the Act, may appoint employees to administer it,
and may delegate powers conferred by the Act to any employee of the Department of Labor.
5 U.S.C. 8103 (a) and (b) specifies that the Secretary may approve or authorize ``necessary and reasonable'' expenses
to be paid from the Employees' Compensation Fund; may issue regulations governing the provision of services, appliances
and supplies; and may prescribe the form and content of the authorization certificate.


Classification


The Department of Labor has concluded that the regulatory proposal is not a significant regulatory action under the
criteria of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866.


Paperwork Reduction Act


The information collection requirements entailed by the proposed regulations have previously been approved by
OMB.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Department believes that the rule will have ``no significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small
entities'' within the meaning of section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Pub. L. 96-354, 91 Stat. 1164
(5 U.S.C. 605(b)). Although this rule will be applicable to small entities it should not result in or cause any significant
economic impact, since the changes in the method of calculating the maximum allowable payments will not result in
a significant difference in the outcome from that in the present method. The Secretary has so certified to the Chief
Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration. Accordingly, no regulatory impact analysis is required.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Social Security Administration, HHS.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rules.


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending our regulations concerning payment of certain travel expenses to implement section 5106(c) of the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 1990). Section 5106(c) amends certain sections of the Social Security
Act (the Act) to limit the amount available for payment under those sections for travel expenses of individuals who
represent claimants at certain administrative proceedings.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 We published proposed rules to implement section 5106(c) of OBRA 1990, Public Law 101-508, in a Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1993 (58 FR 4950). We provided interested individuals and organizations 60 days within which to submit
comments on the proposed rules. The comment period closed March 22, 1993. We did not receive any comments on the proposed
rules. Therefore, except for a technical correction discussed below and some editorial changes, these final rules
are the same as the proposed rules.



These final rules amend our regulations on the payment of travel expenses of individuals who represent claimants
at certain administrative proceedings to implement the amendments to sections 201(j), 1631(h) and 1817(i) of the
Act made by section 5106(c) of OBRA 1990. In general, sections 201(j), 1631(h) and 1817(i) of the Act provide authority
to reimburse certain persons for certain travel expenses which they incur in connection with the Social Security,
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Medicare program under titles II, XVI and XVIII of the Act, respectively. Among
other things, these sections of the Act authorize the payment of certain travel expenses to a claimant's representative
for travel to attend a reconsideration interview or a proceeding before an administrative law judge (ALJ).

Section 5106(c) of OBRA 1990 amends sections 201(j), 1631(h) and 1817(i) of the Act to limit the amount available for
payment under these sections of the Act for travel by a representative to attend an administrative proceeding before
an ALJ or other adjudicator. The amendments under section 5106(c) specify that the amount available for such payment
shall not exceed the maximum amount allowable under these sections of the Act for a representative's travel originating
within the geographic area of the office having jurisdiction over the proceeding. The Conference Committee Report
on OBRA 1990 states that under the amendments the reimbursement for travel by a representative ``could not exceed
the maximum amount that would be payable for travel to the site of the reconsideration interview or proceeding before
an ALJ from a point within the geographical area served by the office having jurisdiction over the interview or proceeding.''
H.R. Rep. No. 964, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 934 (1990).

The final regulations amend our regulations relating to the payment of travel expenses of a claimant's representative
for travel to attend a disability hearing or hearing before an ALJ under the Social Security or SSI programs to implement
the amendments made by section 5106(c) of OBRA 1990. The title II regulations on travel reimbursement, like the rules
in subpart J of 20 CFR part 404 generally, are made applicable to certain proceedings under the Medicare program pursuant
to 42 CFR 405.701(c). Therefore, the changes to the title II regulations on travel reimbursement also affect reimbursement
of travel expenses of a representative in connection with those Medicare proceedings under the Medicare program
and, thus, implement the amendment to section 1817(i) of the Act made by section 5106(c) of OBRA 1990.

Our existing regulations on the payment of certain travel expenses,   404.999a 

et seq.

 and   416.1495 

et seq

., implement the pertinent provisions of the Act regarding travel reimbursement that were in effect prior to April
1, 1991, the effective date of section 5106(c) of OBRA 1990. With respect to travel expenses incurred prior to that
date, we reimbursed a representative for allowable expenses for travel to a disability hearing or ALJ hearing site
from the representative's residence or office (depending upon whether the representative's travel originated
from his or her residence or from the office) regardless of its geographic location. Based on travel distance between
the hearing site and the representative's travel origination point (residence or office) and subject to the limitations
in   404.999c(d) and 416.1498(d), we determined the amount allowable for reimbursement for the ordinary
expenses of transportation (  404.999c(a) and 416.1498(a)) and for unusual travel costs (  404.999c(b)
and 416.1498(b)) pursuant to the applicable rules governing rates and conditions of payment (  404.999c(c)
and 416.1498(c)).

Effective with travel expenses incurred by a representative on or after April 1, 1991, however, section 5106(c) of
OBRA 1990 provides that the amount of reimbursement for such expenses shall not exceed the allowable amount that we
could reimburse the representative for travel originating within the geographic area of the office having jurisdiction
over the proceeding. Accordingly, the final regulations amend our regulations to provide that the amount available
to reimburse a representative for travel to attend a disability hearing or a hearing before an ALJ shall not exceed
the maximum amount allowable for travel to the hearing site from any point within the geographic area of the office
having jurisdiction over the hearing.

The final rules explain that the geographic area of the office having jurisdiction over the hearing means, as appropriate_





_The designated georgraphic service area of the State agency adjudicatory unit having responsibility for providing
the disability hearing;

_If a Federal disability hearing officer holds the disability hearing, the geographic area of the State in which the
claimant resides or, if the claimant is not a resident of a State, in which the hearing officer holds the disability
hearing; or 
_The designated geographic service area of the Office of Hearings and Appeals hearing office having responsibility
for providing the hearing before an ALJ.

 

In cases in which a Federal disability hearing officer holds the disability hearing, the hearing officer travels
to the State in which the claimant resides to hold the hearing. In those infrequent cases in which the claimant is not
a resident of a State, the Federal disability hearing officer holds the disability hearing in a location in a State
that is convenient for the claimant and the hearing officer. With respect to these cases, the final regulations define
the geographic area of the office having jurisdiction over the hearing to mean the geographic area of the State in which
the claimant resides or, if the claimant is not a resident of a State, in which the hearing officer holds the disability
hearing. This definition is consistent with the congressional intent underlying section 5106(c) of OBRA 1990 in
that it treats the claimant and his or her representative in the same manner as if a State agency hearing officer held
the disability hearing. In the final title II regulations relating to cases in which a Federal disability hearing
officer holds the disability hearing, the term ``State'' has the meaning assigned to it in current  404.2(c)(5),
except that the term also includes the Northern Mariana Islands. In the final title XVI regulations relating to such
cases, the term ``State'' means a State as defined in current  416.120(c)(9). This definition of ``State''
in the final title XVI regulations  416.1498(d)(3)(i)(B), was omitted from the text of the proposed rules,
although it was discussed in the preamble to those rules (58 FR 4950, 4951). Its inclusion in the final rules represents
a technical correction.

We are basing the maximum amount allowable on the distance to the hearing site from the farthest point within the appropriate
geographic area. We will determine the maximum amount allowable for travel between these two points under the existing
regulations, i.e., subject to the existing limitations in paragraph (d)(1) and paragraph (d)(3) (herein to be redesignated
as paragraph (d)(4)) of   404.999c and 416.1498 (relating to travel within the United States and a claimant's
request for a change to a more distant hearing site) and pursuant to the applicable rules governing rates and conditions
of payment under paragraphs (a) through (c) of   404.999c and 416.1498. Under our existing regulations,
we will not reimburse a representative's travel expenses unless the distance he or she travels, i.e., the distance
to the hearing site from the representative's residence or office (whichever he or she travels from), exceeds 75 miles
(  404.999c(d)(2) and 416.1498(d)(2)). The final regulations provide a similar limitation. Under
the final rules, we will use the point within the appropriate geographic area that is the farthest point from the hearing
site as the representative's travel origination point (equivalent to residence or office under the existing regulations)
for purposes of determining the maximum amount allowable for reimbursement. The final rules provide that if the distance
to the hearing site from the farthest point within the appropriate geographic area does not exceed 75 miles, we will
not reimburse a representative for any travel expenses. This is consistent with the 75-mile rule in the current regulations.

Under the final regulations, actual reimbursement for a representative's travel expenses is limited to the lesser
of: (1) Actual travel expenses incurred and allowable under the regulations (whether travel actually originates
within the designated geographic area or outside that area); or (2) the maximum amount allowable for travel to the
hearing site from the farthest point within the geographic area of the office having jurisdiction over the hearing.

In practice, the final rules will not affect reimbursement of travel expenses of a representative whose travel originates
within the geographic area of the office having jurisdiction over the hearing. This is because the expenses incurred
and allowable under the regulations for such travel would be less than, or equal to, the maximum amount allowable for
travel to the hearing site from the farthest point within the appropriate geographic area. 
We are amending   404.999c and 416.1498 by redesignating paragraph (d)(3) as (d)(4) and adding a new paragraph
(d)(3) to state and define the limit on the amount of reimbursement for a representative's travel expenses mandated
by section 5106(c) of OBRA 1990. The final regulations state that the amount of reimbursement for travel expenses
for a representative shall not exceed the maximum amount allowable for travel to the hearing site from any point within
the geographic area of the office having jurisdiction over the hearing; define the geographic area of the office having
jurisdiction over the hearing; and explain how we determine the maximum amount allowable for travel by a representative
based on the distance to the hearing site from the farthest point within the appropriate geographic area. 
We also are amending   404.999c(c) and 416.1498(c) to change the reference from 41 CFR Part 101-7
to 41 CFR chapter 301, where the Federal Travel Regulations are now codified.

Reopening Determinations and Decisions 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Social Security Administration, HHS.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rules.







</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 These final rules revise our regulations to clarify the longstanding policy of the Social Security Administration
(SSA) that the Agency on its own initiative, as well as at the request of any person claiming a right under the Social
Security or supplemental security income (SSI) programs, may reopen and revise a final administrative determination
or decision.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 We are revising   404.987 and 416.1487 of our regulations to clarify that we may reopen and revise a final
administrative determination or decision either on our own initiative or at the request of a person who was a party
to the determination or decision. 




Prior to August 5, 1980, our regulations expressly provided that we had the discretion to reopen and revise a final
determination or decision, including a final revised determination or decision, either on our own motion or upon
the request of any party to the determination or decision. See 20 CFR 404.956, 404.957, 416.1475 and 416.1477 (1980).
On August 5, 1980, however, we published, pursuant to the notice of proposed rulemaking procedures, final regulations
which reorganized and restated in simpler language our rules on the administrative review process, including our
rules for reopening and revising final determinations and decisions. This recodification was undertaken as part
of a Department-wide effort to make the rules clearer and easier for the public to use and understand (45 FR 52078, August
5, 1980). 


Our existing regulations on the procedures for reopening and revising a determination or decision were a part of the
recodification that was published and became effective on August 5, 1980. Although no substantive changes were intended
with regard to the authority to reopen on our own initiative, the regulations, as recodified, have been read by some
to permit reopening and revision of a final determination or decision only when the beneficiary or claimant requests
reopening. 


With respect to the reopening and the revising of a final determination or decision,   404.987 and 416.1487
of our existing regulations state that ``[y]ou may ask that a determination or a decision to which you were a party be
revised.'' These sections have created some confusion and have been read by some courts to mean that we may not reopen
and revise a final determination or decision on our own initiative. 


The final rules eliminate the ambiguity that exists in our regulations regarding our authority to reopen and revise
a final determination or decision on our own initiative. The final rules revise   404.987 and 416.1487
to state explicitly that we may reopen a determination or decision that has become final on our own initiative or at
the request of an individual who was a party to the determination or decision.

Public Comments 




We published the proposed rules with a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in the 

Federal Register

 on October 28, 1991 (56 FR 55477). Interested persons and organizations were given 60 days to comment. The comment
period closed on December 27, 1991. We received comments from six commenters: Two State agencies which make disability
determinations, and three legal services organizations and one private attorney who represent claimants and beneficiaries.



One commenter supported the proposed rules without modification. This commenter agreed with our view that the proposed
rules clarified our longstanding policy regarding our authority to reopen a final determination or decision on our
own initiative. 


The other commenters either opposed the proposed changes to the regulations or conditioned their support for the
proposed rules upon our making additional changes to our regulations. Most of these commenters generally perceived
the proposed rules to be a policy change that would confer upon SSA a new or expanded authority to reopen and revise determinations
or decisions on its own initiative. Many of the comments which were provided by these commenters also reflected a misunderstanding
of the requirements and procedures for reopening a determination or decision. Some of these commenters recommended
that the proposed rules be modified or withdrawn. Some recommended that they be expanded to clarify or further limit
the specific conditions, which are stated elsewhere in our regulations, under which a final determination or decision
may be reopened. 


We considered carefully all of the comments which we received on the proposed rules. However, for the reasons stated
below, we did not adopt the recommendation to withdraw the proposed rules or any of the recommendations to modify or
expand the changes to the regulations. The changes to the regulations do not represent a substantive change in policy.
The sole purpose of the changes is to clarify in the regulations our longstanding policy that we may reopen and revise
a final determination or decision on our own initiative as well as upon the request of a party to the determination or
decision. Accordingly, the final rules are the same as the proposed rules. 


A summary of the comments that raised issues concerning the proposed rules and our responses to the comments are provided
below. For ease of comprehension, we have consolidated the comments and organized them according to the general issues
raised in the comments. 




Comment

: Three commenters thought that the proposed rules would be inconsistent with a decision of a circuit court which had
concluded that our regulations should be interpreted to allow the Appeals Council to reopen a final decision of an
administrative law judge (ALJ) only on the basis of a request by a claimant or beneficiary. One commenter stated that
the proposed rules would circumvent judicial decisions, but did not mention any specific court decisions. 




Response

: As discussed earlier in this preamble and in the preamble to the NPRM, the regulations which we are revising,   404.987
and 416.1487, were a part of the regulations that were published on August 5, 1980, which reorganized and restated
in simpler language all of our rules on the administrative review process. Although no substantive changes were intended
with regard to our authority to reopen final determinations or decisions on our own initiative, this authority was
not stated as clearly in the recodified rules as it had been in the longer, more detailed prior rules. As a result, several
lawsuits were brought challenging our authority under the recodified regulations to continue our longstanding
policy to reopen and revise final determinations or decisions on our own initiative. All but one of the circuit courts
that have directly addressed this issue have concluded, however, that our regulations on reopening do provide authority
for us to reopen and revise final determinations or decisions on our own initiative, including authority for the Appeals
Council to reopen and revise a final decision of an ALJ on its own initiative. Only the circuit court mentioned by the
three commenters above and some Federal district courts have concluded that our existing regulations should be interpreted
to allow the reopening and revision of a final determination or decision only when a claimant or beneficiary requests
reopening. These final rules revise the regulations to eliminate the ambiguity which led these courts to interpret
the regulations to mean that only a claimant or beneficiary may initiate reopening. We are revising   404.987
and 416.1487 to state explicitly that we may reopen a final determination or decision either on our own initiative
or at the request of a party to the determination or decision. 




Comment

: Several commenters thought that the time periods within which a final decision of an ALJ may be reopened under current
 404.988 (a) or (b) or  416.1488 (a) or (b), which we did not propose to change, are measured from the date
of the ALJ decision. Some commenters opposed the proposed revisions of   404.987 and 416.1487 because
they believed that the Appeals Council would have the discretion under  404.988(b) or  416.1488(b) to
reopen a final decision of an ALJ on its own initiative within 4 years of the date of the ALJ decision if the Council finds
good cause to reopen. One commenter stated that the proposed rules would render meaningless the 60-day time limit
within which the Appeals Council may decide to review a decision by an ALJ on its own initiative under   404.969
and 416.1469. This statement was based on the commenter's belief that   404.988(a) and 416.1488(a),
when read together with the proposed rules, give the Appeals Council the discretion to reopen a final decision of an
ALJ on its own initiative within 1 year of the date of the ALJ decision for any reason. 




Response

: Sections 404.988 and 416.1488 state the conditions under which we may reopen final determinations or decisions
under the Social Security and SSI programs, respectively. We are not making any changes to these sections of our regulations.
Sections 404.988(a) and 416.1488(a) provide that a determination or decision may be reopened within 12 months of
the date of the notice of the initial determination for any reason. Sections 404.988(b) and 416.1488(b) provide that
a determination or decision may be reopened within 4 years (2 years for SSI cases) of the date of the notice of the initial
determination if we find good cause, as defined in   404.989 and 416.1489, to reopen the case. The time
periods within which a final decision of an ALJ may be reopened under these sections, therefore, are measured from
the date of the notice of the initial determination, not from the date of the ALJ decision. Under these sections, the
Appeals Council may reopen a final decision of an ALJ within 12 months of the date of the notice of the initial determination
for any reason, or within 4 years (only 2 years for SSI cases) of the date of the notice of the initial determination if
the Council finds good cause to reopen.

These final rules, like the proposed rules, revise   404.987 and 416.1487 to clarify that we may reopen
and revise a final determination or decision either on our own initiative or upon the request of a person who was a party
to the determination or decision. While the final rules clarify that the Appeals Council has the discretion to reopen
a final decision of an ALJ on its own initiative, as well as at the request of a party to the decision, under the conditions
specified in   404.988 and 416.1488, they do not make the reopening authority under   404.988(a)
and 416.1488(a) inconsistent with the authority provided under   404.969 and 416.1469 for Appeals Council
own-motion review of an ALJ decision. Sections 404.988 and 416.1488 state the conditions under which a determination
or decision that has become final may be reopened. Sections 404.969 and 416.1469, on the other hand, authorize the
Appeals Council to initiate review of an ALJ decision that has not become final. A decision by an ALJ becomes final unless
a person who was a party to the decision requests Appeals Council review of the decision within the stated time period,
see   404.968 and 416.1468, or the Council itself decides to review the decision within the time period
provided in   404.969 and 416.1469. The latter sections provide that any time within 60 days after the
date of an ALJ decision or dismissal of a hearing request, the Appeals Council may decide on its own initiative to review
the decision or dismissal. By contrast,   404.988(a) and 416.1488(a) allow the Appeals Council to reopen
a final decision of an ALJ for any reason only within 12 months of the date of the notice of the initial determination
made in the case. In almost all cases in which an ALJ decision becomes final, this 12-month period for reopening for
any reason will have expired due to the normal processing time required for the disposition of the case through the
reconsideration and ALJ hearing steps of the administrative review process. Therefore, a final decision of an ALJ
seldom can be reopened under the conditions specified in   404.988(a) and 416.1488(a). 




Comment:

 Some commenters expressed the view that the proposed rules were unfair to claimants and beneficiaries because they
permitted SSA to reopen on its own initiative a final determination or decision that was favorable to the individual
and make a revised determination or decision that could be unfavorable to the individual. One commenter stated that
fairness requires that only claimants and beneficiaries be permitted to initiate the reopening and revision of a
final determination or decision. 




Response:

 Our authority to initiate reopening gives us the discretion to reopen and revise a final determination or decision
on our own initiative under the conditions described in   404.988 and 416.1488 whether such final determination
or decision was favorable or unfavorable to the individual. The revised determination or decision which we make may
be less favorable or more favorable to the individual than the prior determination or decision, or it may involve merely
a technical revision that does not affect the ultimate conclusion regarding the individual's rights under the Social
Security or SSI program. 


The policy that we may reopen and revise final determinations or decisions on our own initiative is advantageous to
many claimants and beneficiaries. While an individual may request that a final determination or decision that was
unfavorable to the individual be reopened and revised, it is often SSA, and not the individual, that discovers that
an error was made, or that new and material evidence exists, that provides a basis to reopen and revise a final determination
or decision that was unfavorable to the individual. The authority to reopen on our own initiative allows us to reopen
and revise the determination or decision in these cases even though the individual has not requested reopening. Indeed,
in many, if not most, cases in which we reopen and revise a final determination or decision on our own initiative, we
do so for the sole purpose of making a revised determination or decision that would be more favorable to the individual
than the prior determination or decision. 


Our longstanding policy regarding the authority to reopen on our own initiative is intended to ensure that the final
determinations and decisions which we make about the rights of individuals under the Social Security and SSI programs
are fair and proper. It enables us to protect the integrity of these programs by allowing us to reopen and revise final
determinations or decisions on our own initiative, as well as at the request of a party to the determination or decision,
in cases where, for example, the determination or decision was obtained by fraud, the evidence that was considered
in making the determination or decision clearly shows on its face that an error was made in the determination or decision,
or new and material evidence shows that the determination or decision is incorrect. See   404.988, 404.989,
416.1488 and 416.1489. In addition, if we reopen and revise a final determination or decision on our own initiative,
any person who was a party to the revised determination or decision has the opportunity under   404.994
and 416.1494 to request that the revision be reviewed. Under these sections, if an individual is dissatisfied with
a revised determination or decision made in his or her case, he or she may request further administrative or judicial
review, as appropriate, of our revised determination or decision. 




Comment: 

Two commenters believed that some of the conditions for reopening determinations and decisions provided in   404.988
and 416.1488 are too broad. One of the commenters stated that the criteria in   404.989 and 416.1489 for
determining whether good cause exists to reopen under   404.988(b) and 416.1488(b) should be clarified
to provide more precise standards for determining good cause to reopen. The other commenter urged that the criteria
for determining good cause be modified to limit further the conditions under which a determination or decision may
be reopened. This commenter also recommended the elimination of the provisions of   404.988(a) and 416.1488(a)
which permit the reopening of a determination or decision within 12 months of the date of the notice of the initial determination
for any reason. 




Response: 

We do not believe that there is any need at this time to modify or clarify the specific criteria in   404.989
and 416.1489 for determining whether good cause exists to reopen a determination or decision under   404.988(b)
and 416.1488(b). In addition, we believe that the conditions for reopening provided in   404.988 and
416.1488, including the provisions of   404.988(a) and 416.1488(a), are sufficiently restrictive.
These sections of the regulations provide that a determination or decision may be reopened only within limited time
periods and/or under limited circumstances. They limit the conditions under which we may reopen a final determination
or decision either on our own initiative or on the request of a person who was a party to the determination or decision.



The final rules, like the proposed rules, only revise   404.987 and 416.1487. The sole purpose of the revisions
is to clarify our longstanding policy that we may reopen and revise final determinations or decisions on our own initiative
as well as at the request of a party to the determination or decision. These final rules, therefore, do not make any changes
to 
 404.988,  404.989,  416.1488 or  416.1489. For the foregoing reasons, the proposed rules
are being adopted as final regulations. 




Regulatory Procedures 




Paperwork Reduction Act 




These regulations impose no new reporting or recordkeeping requirements necessitating clearance by the Office
of Management and Budget. 




Regulatory Flexibility Act 




We certify that these final regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities because they affect determinations or decisions about the rights of individuals under the Social Security
and SSI programs. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Pub. L. 96-354, the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, is not required.

Supplemental Security Income For the Aged, Blind, and 
Disabled; Indian Judgment Funds and Per Capita Distributions 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY : 

Social Security Administration, HHS.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION : 

Final rules.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 These final regulations update the lists of types of income and resources that are excluded under the supplemental
security income (SSI) program by Federal laws other than the Social Security Act (the Act) by reflecting the provisions
of Public Law 97-458, enacted January 12, 1983, Public Law 98-64, enacted August 2, 1983, and Public Law
100-241, enacted February 3, 1988. In addition, we are making two minor technical changes. The effects of these
final regulations are, in certain cases, to provide additional exclusions from income and resources permitting
eligibility for, or increases in the payment of, SSI benefits.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background: 

Public Law 97-458 



Public Law 97-458 was enacted January 12, 1983. Section 4 of this legislation provides that certain Indian judgment
funds held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior or distributed per capita pursuant to a plan prepared by the Secretary
of the Interior and not disapproved by a joint resolution of the Congress are excluded from income and resources under
the SSI program. Indian judgment funds include interest and investment income accrued while the funds are held in
trust. The exclusion extends to initial purchases made with Indian judgment funds. The exclusion does not apply to
the proceeds from sales or conversions of initial purchases or to subsequent purchases made with funds derived from
sales or conversions of originally excluded purchases, because Congress sought to protect only the distributions
made by the Secretary of the Interior. 

Section 4 of Public Law 97-458 also excludes from resources any interests of Indians in trust or restricted Indian
lands. Our current regulations address only those lands that such individuals may possess. These final regulations
now also exclude from resources nonpossessory interests in such lands. 



Public Law 98-64 


Public Law 98-64 was enacted August 2, 1983. This legislation excludes all funds held in trust by the Secretary
of the Interior for an Indian tribe and distributed on a per capita basis from income and resources for SSI purposes.


The Social Security Administration (SSA) sought advice from the Department of the Interior on the issue of whether
Alaska Native Regional and Village Corporation (ANRVC) dividends not excluded under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement
Act (ANCSA) could be excluded under Public Law 98-64. SSA issued interim instructions directing that ANRVC
dividend distributions paid on or after August 2, 1983, whether or not excluded under ANCSA, would be excluded for
SSI purposes pending resolution of the issue. 

The Department of the Interior has since advised SSA that funds held by ANRVCs are not ``funds held in trust by the Secretary
of the Interior'' within the purview of Public Law 98-64. We therefore concluded that these ANRVC dividend distributions
could not qualify for exclusion for SSI purposes under that law. 



Public Law 100-241 


A new law, Public Law 100-241, was enacted on February 3, 1988. Under this law, none of the following, received
from a Native Corporation, is considered income or resources of an individual Alaska Native or a descendant of an Alaska
Native: cash (including cash dividends on stock received from a Native Corporation) to the extent that it does not,
in the aggregate, exceed $2,000 per individual per year (the exclusions are applied each year to the amount received
in such year); stock (including stock issued or distributed by a Native Corporation as a dividend or distribution
on stock); a partnership interest; land or an interest in land (including land or an interest in land received from
a Native Corporation as a dividend or distribution on stock); and an interest in a settlement trust. 

Public Law 100-241 specifically provides that cash received from a Native Corporation (including cash dividends
on stock received from a Native Corporation), to the extent that it does not, in the aggregate, exceed $2,000 per individual
per year, shall not be considered or taken into account as an asset or resource. Although this statutory provision
does not explicitly mention ``income,'' the legislative history clearly shows that such cash should not be considered
a resource or ``otherwise utilized in determining eligibility.'' H.R. Rep. No. 31, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 20 (1987).
This language seems to require the exclusion of the distributions from income as well as resources, to the extent that
they do not, in the aggregate, exceed $2,000 per individual per year in determining eligibility and payment amount.
To exclude a portion of the distributions only from resources would result in benefit reductions or ineligibility
in months in which the distributions are received and would be contrary to congressional intent. Therefore, we have
changed the income provisions of the appendix to subpart K to reflect the exclusion. 

In accordance with Public Law 100-241, we exclude ANRVC cash (including cash dividends on stock received from
a Native Corporation) to the extent that this ANRVC cash does not, in the aggregate, exceed $2,000 per individual per
year. With respect to resources, we apply the exclusion to each calendar year without regard to the prior year, so that
retained cash not exceeding $2,000 which an individual received from a Native Corporation in a prior year will not
be counted in a subsequent year. This interpretation is consistent with the policy of the Aid to Families with Dependent
Children program. Any retained cash exceeding $2,000 per year will be counted toward the SSI resource limit. 



Regulations Changes 



The appendix to subpart K lists the types of income that are excluded under the SSI program by Federal laws other than
the Act and explains how exclusions provided by other Federal statutes apply to income deemed from a sponsor to an alien.
We are amending the appendix to subpart K, 

IV. Native Americans, 

on the basis of the legislation discussed above by revising paragraph (a), deleting paragraph (b)(4), redesignating
paragraphs (b)(5) through (b)(13) as (b)(4) through (b)(12), and adding new paragraphs (g) and (h). In addition,
paragraphs (g) and (h) provide that the exclusion applies to the sponsor's income only if the alien lives with the sponsor,
because the statute authorizing the exclusions applies only to benefits to which the household or member of the household
would be eligible.

Similarly, we are amending subpart L of the regulations, which deals with resources and exclusion of resources under
the SSI program, to reflect the above legislation. Specifically, we are amending  416.1234 regarding exclusion
of Indian lands and,  416.1236, which encompasses resource exclusions provided by other statutes. 


Public Comment 


A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) was published on July 27, 1992 (57 FR 33137). A 60-day comment period was provided.
The comment period ended September 25, 1992. We received 9 comments. The comments generally supported the NPRM. We
have summarized and responded to the issues raised in the comments below. 


Comment: 

Seven commenters expressed concern that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) might begin to
apply a $2,000 annual limit to all exclusions of Indian judgment funds and per capita distributions. They stated that
the proposed regulations were unclear as to whether ANCSA, as amended by Public Law 100-241, might adversely
affect the SSI benefits of Native Americans other than Alaska natives.



Response: 

ANCSA provides for the exclusion of ANRVC cash to the extent that it does not, in the aggregate, exceed $2,000 per individual
per year. The provisions of ANCSA apply only to ANRVC distributions to Alaska Natives. We believe this is clearly explained
in the amended regulations at paragraph IV(a) of the appendix to subpart K and at  416.1236(a)(10). In accordance
with Public Law 97-458 and Public Law 98-64, the Secretary totally excludes all judgment fund and per capita
distributions made pursuant to those public laws.



Comment: 

One commenter asked why the proposed regulations did not refer to a $2,000 limit for per capita distributions to Indian
tribal members other than Alaska Natives, because Public Law 97-458 appears to include such a limit. Five commenters
suggested that instead of applying a $2,000 annual limit on Indian judgment fund and per capita distributions, the
Secretary should apply a $2,000 per payment limit, in accordance with Public Law 97-458 and Public Law 98-64.
Consequently, only Indian judgment funds or per capita distributions in excess of $2,000 per payment would be countable
for SSI purposes.



Response: 

There appears to be some confusion over whether, as a result of the proposed regulations, SSA would or could begin to
apply a $2,000 exclusion limit to other than ANSCA distributions. SSA never intended to apply a $2,000 limit to such
other distributions and these final regulations clearly do not do so.

Public Law 97-458 provides that any Federal or federally assisted program, other than Social Security Act programs,
shall not consider Indian judgment funds except for per capita shares in excess of $2,000, as income or resources.
However, the statute does not limit the amount of payments that can be excluded under the Social Security Act programs.
Public Law 98-64 does not provide a $2,000 limit on exclusion of funds covered by that statute.

Accordingly, for SSI purposes the Secretary excludes from income and resources all judgment fund and per capita distributions
made under Public Law 97-458 and Public Law 98-64.



Comment: 

One commenter proposed that foster care payments paid to tribal members to help defray the costs of basic needs, and
that General Assistance payments from the Bureau of Indian Affairs be excluded from income and resources under the
SSI program.

<PARENT> FR940223-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response:

 We believe that the exclusions proposed by the commenter would require the enactment of new legislation. Accordingly,
in the absence of such authority, we have not revised the regulations to incorporate such exclusions.



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that the proposed regulations not limit the exclusion of purchases contained in Pub. L. 97-458
to initial purchases made with Indian judgment funds and per capita distributions, because that law refers to ``* * *
any purchases made with such funds * * *''



Response:

 The exclusion of purchases in Pub. L. 97-458 does not apply to proceeds from the sales or conversions of initial
purchases or to purchases made with the money derived from the sales or conversions of initial purchases. As indicated
earlier in this preamble, this policy reflects Congressional intent to protect only the distributions made by the
Secretary of the Interior. Any purchases made subsequent to initial purchases would not be made from distributions
made by the Secretary of the Interior. Furthermore, tracking the funds beyond the initial purchase would be administratively
difficult, if not impossible.



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that the Secretary correct a conflict between  416.1210(i) and  416.1234 as
proposed. Section 416.1210 provides a list of resource exclusions with corresponding regulatory citations. Specifically,
 416.1210(i), states that the resource exclusion of restricted allotted land applies to ``an enrolled member
of an Indian tribe as provided in  416.1234.'' Section 416.1234 states that the exclusion applies to ``an individual
* * * who is of Indian descent from a federally recognized Indian tribe,'' and does not limit its exclusion
to an enrolled member of an Indian tribe.



Response:

 We agree that  416.1210(i) may appear to be in conflict with  416.1234. Although a change to correct this
possible inconsistency was not included in the NPRM, we believe a technical change to correct our oversight and make
our intent clear is appropriate. Therefore, we are making a technical change to the regulations at  416.1210(i)
to read, ``Restricted allotted Indian lands as provided in  416.1234;'' to provide a simplified and more accurate
cross-reference.



Other Regulations Changes



The provisions of Public Law 98-64 regarding the exclusion of certain funds from income are reflected in the
appendix to Subpart K, 

IV. Native Americans,

 by the addition of paragraph (h) to these final regulations. This obviates the need for continuance of paragraph (c)(3)
which only partially reflects the income exclusion provisions of Public Law 98-64. Paragraph (c)(3) is duplicative
and no longer needed. Therefore, we are making a technical change to the regulations by deleting paragraph (c)(3).

Except for the technical change in response to an issue raised by a public comment and the technical change to remove
a duplicative provision, we are adopting these regulations as proposed.

These regulations impose no additional reporting and recordkeeping requirements necessitating clearance by the

(a) Distributions received by an individual Alaska Native or descendant of an Alaska Native from an Alaska Native
Regional and Village Corporation pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, as follows: cash, including
cash dividends on stock received from a Native Corporation, to the extent that it does not, in the aggregate, exceed
$2,000 per individual each year; stock, including stock issued or distributed by a Native Corporation as a dividend

Note

_This exclusion applies to the income of sponsors of aliens only if the alien lives in the sponsor's household.

distributions are not excluded from countable income under this exclusion. For ANRVC dividend distributions, see
paragraph IV(a) of this Appendix.

<USDEPT>PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION</USDEPT>





Restoration of Terminating and Terminated Plans


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is amending its regulations regarding plan restoration obligations and
procedures to reflect a change in the Treasury regulations that are referenced therein and to make several corrections.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') administers the pension plan termination insurance program
under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA'') (29 U.S.C. 1301 

et seq.

). Part 2625 of its regulations (29 CFR part 2625), along with Treasury regulations under section 412 of the Internal
Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 412, minimum funding standards), describes certain legal obligations that arise incidental
to a plan restoration under section 4047 of ERISA (29 U.S.C. 1347) and establishes procedures with respect to these
obligations.


Provisions of part 2625 currently reference temporary Treasury regulations for applying the minimum funding requirements
to terminating or terminated single-employer plans restored by the PBGC (26 CFR 1.412(c)(1)-3T). The Internal
Revenue Service (``IRS'') has now issued final regulations (26 CFR 1.412(c)(1)-3, TD 8494, 58 FR 54489, October
22, 1993). (The provisions of the final regulations on the restoration funding method differ from those referenced
in part 2625 only in minor clarifications made by the IRS in response to comments.) The PBGC is amending   2625.1(a)
and 2625.2 (b) through (d) to reflect that action by substituting the final Treasury regulations for the temporary
regulations. 
This rule also corrects the spelling of two words in  2625.2(b) (``amortization'' and ``restoration'') and
adds language erroneously omitted from  2625.3(c) (``following a plan year''). (As worded,  2625.3(c)
states that a restored plan may not use the alternative calculation method in  2610.23(c) of the premium regulation
for any plan year for which Form 5500, Schedule B was not filed because the plan was terminated. However, as indicated
in the premium regulation, the alternative calculation method requires use of a plan's Schedule B for the preceding
plan year. Hence, this method is not available for a plan year that follows a plan year for which Schedule B was not filed,
rather than for that plan year.) 
Because these amendments only reflect a change in the pertinent Treasury regulations (which were the subject of notice
and comment rulemaking) and make corrections, the PBGC has for good cause found advance notice and public procedure
thereon and a delayed effective date to be unnecessary (5 U.S.C. 553 (b)(B) and (d)(3)), and it is issuing these amendments
as a final rule, effective immediately. 


E.O. 12866


The PBGC has determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth in
Executive Order 12866 because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect
in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public
health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; create a serious inconsistency or otherwise
interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements,
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order
12866. 


List of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 2625


Employee pension plans, Pension insurance, Pensions.



For the reasons set forth above, the PBGC is amending 29 CFR part 2625 as follows: 


PART 2625_RESTORATION OF TERMINATING AND TERMINATED PLANS 


1. The authority citation for part 2625 is revised to read as follows:

 2625.2 

[Amended]


3. Paragraph (b) of  2625.2 is amended by removing ``amoratization'' and adding, in its place, ``amortization''
in the first sentence and by removing ``restorative'' and adding, in its place, ``restoration'' in the second sentence.

 In order to expedite litigation of revenue-related issues presented by Postal Service rate change requests, the
Commission amends its rules governing the Postal Service's rate filings to require that they include complete descriptions
of the data, procedures, and assumptions that underlie the Postal Service's estimate of domestic mail revenues.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Commission published its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this docket on November 2, 1993 [58 FR 58519]. In our
Notice we proposed amendments to 39 CFR 3001.54(j), which governs Postal Service presentations concerning estimated
volumes and revenues in our proceedings. As discussed in our Notice, during the post-hearing phase of Docket No. R90-1
an issue emerged as to whether the assumptions underlying the billing determinants that the Postal Service used to
project revenues were compatible with those underlying the billing determinants that were implicit in the indexed
prices that the Postal Service used to project volumes. This caused us to review our rules governing the Postal Service's
volume and revenue presentations to see if more complete initial documentation would expedite hearings on these
issues in future rate filings. 


As part of that review, we noticed that our current rules do not require the Postal Service's revenue presentation
to be disaggregated to the billing determinant level, although the Postal Service has done so in recent rate filings.
Nor do our current rules specifically require the Postal Service to source the data underlying its revenue presentation.
We therefore proposed amendments to Rule  3001.54(j) designed to bring it into conformity with current practice
in these respects. 
The amendments that we initially proposed in this docket had three basic objectives: (1) To require that revenue presentations
be disaggregated to the billing determinant level [proposed rule  3001.54(j)(3)], (2) to require that the
method of calculating revenues be explained in detail, especially where the calculation involved redesigned rates
[proposed rule  3001.54(j)(4)], and (3) where the assumptions underlying the billing determinants used to
calculate revenue differ from those underlying the billing determinants implicit in the corresponding volume estimate
that the Postal Service provide an explanation for the difference [proposed rules  3001.54(j)(5)(iv),(v),
and (vi)]. 
As a result of comments received in response to our Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we have simplified our proposed
amendments in ways that still accomplish the objectives described above. Final rules  3001.54(j)(3) and  3001.54(j)(4),
as we adopt them here, accomplish the first and second objectives, respectively, with simpler and more concrete language.
To accomplish the third objective, we have deleted proposed rules  3001.54(j)(5)(iv) through (vi) in favor
of a simpler provision that we have incorporated in the preamble of rule  3001.54(j)(6). 

As a result, our final rules largely eliminate the basis for the Postal Service's generalized complaint in its Comments
of December 2, 1993, and Reply Comments of December 13, 1993, that our proposed amendments are needlessly burdensome.
Final rules  3001.54(j)(3) and (4) bring our rules into conformity with what is essentially the Postal Service's
current practice. Proposed rules  3001.54(j)(5)(iv) and (v) had asked for revenue presentations for interim
years, and the year following the test year. These proposals might have added moderately to the Postal Service's documentation
burden. They have been deleted from our final rules. 
Only a minor addition to the Postal Service's documentation burden remains in our final rules. That is the simplified
requirement, incorporated in final rule  3001.54(j)(6), that the Postal Service provide supporting rationale
where its revenue estimate is based upon billing determinants that differ from those that are implicit in its volume
forecast.

Final Rule  3001.54(j)(3) 


The purpose of proposed rule  3001.54(j)(3) was to require that the Postal Service's revenue presentation
be disaggregated to the billing determinant level, consistent with rule  3001.54(l), which requires the Postal
Service to provide class and subclass billing determinants for each ``rate element'' that it uses to determine revenues.
The Office of the Consumer Advocate (OCA) observes that the wording of proposed rule  3001.54(j)(3) could have
been interpreted as applying to elements other than those covered by rule  3001.54(l). OCA Comments of November
24, 1993, at 3-4. Final rule  3001.54(j)(3), therefore, adopts the alternate language proposed by the
OCA, which requires that the Postal Service's revenue presentation be disaggregated to ``each unique rate element.''




Final Rule  3001.54(j)(4) 



The purpose of proposed rule  3001.54(j)(4) was to require that the method of calculating revenues be described
in detail, especially where the calculation involved restructured rates. The OCA's comments propose alternative
language that is more concrete and less susceptible to subjective interpretation. Instead of requiring an ``identification''
or ``specific description'' of its methods of calculating revenue, the OCA's proposed language would require the
Postal Service to document its revenue calculations in such a way that they can be replicated from ``primary data sources.''
OCA Comments of November 24, 1993, at 4-5. 
Final Rule  3001.54(j)(4) adopts the essence of the OCA's proposed alternative. Appropriate sourcing of revenue
presentations, however, is most often to companion volume testimony and supporting documents, rather than to ``primary
data sources.'' We have modified the OCA's proposed language accordingly. The OCA incorrectly inferred from our
Notice an intent to limit rule  3001.54(j)(4) to estimates of ``per piece'' revenue. Final rule  3001.54(j)(4)
applies to revenue estimates generally, not just to estimates of ``per piece'' revenue. 



Proposed Rules  3001.54(j)(5)(iv)-(v) 



Proposed rules  3001.54(5)(j)(iv) and (v) would have required that the Postal Service's revenue presentations
include fully disaggregated revenue estimates for interim years (years between the base year and the test year),
and for the year following the test year. Interim year estimates would have facilitated tracking of the Postal Service's
revenue estimate against actual revenues as a rate hearing progresses. Post-test year estimates would have assisted
in evaluating any proposed changes. 
Since the added value of either exercise is relatively minor, we have decided to drop these proposed rules. They were
the focus of the generalized complaints expressed in the Postal Service's Comments of December 2, 1993, and Reply
Comments of December 13, 1993, that the amendments to rule  3001.54(j) that we propose in this docket are burdensome
and unnecessary. 


Proposed Rule  3001.54(j)(5)(vi) and Final Rule  3001.54(j)(6) 


As we discussed in our Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Postal Service uses average, or indexed, subclass prices
as key variables in its volume forecasting models. Billing determinants are implicit in an indexed price. 
The broad purpose of proposed rule  3001.54(j)(5)(vi) was to ensure that the Postal Service's volume presentation
includes a detailed description of how the indexed prices were constructed, especially where they reflected restructured
rates. The specific purpose of the proposed rule was to require that the Postal Service identify instances where the
billing determinants implicit in the price indices used to forecast subclass volumes differ from those used to estimate
subclass revenues, and that it explain such differences. 
Partly in response to the Postal Service's general plea that we not add to the complexity of rule  3001.54(j)
unless it is clearly necessary, we have decided to delete proposed rule  3001.54(j)(5)(vi) from our final rules.
The broad purpose of the proposed rule was to ensure that the Postal Service provides full narrative explanations
of how its price indices are constructed. Having focused attention on that purpose with this rulemaking, we believe
that current rule  3001.54(j)(6)(i) and (ii) will be adequate to achieve it. 
As noted, the specific purpose of proposed rule  3001.54(j)(5)(vi) was to require the Postal Service to explain
why it sometimes bases its revenue estimates on billing determinants that differ from those implicit in its volume
forecasts. We believe that this purpose can be accomplished more economically by adding the following sentence at
the end of the current preamble to rule  3001.54(j)(6): Supporting rationale shall be provided for using billing
determinants to estimate revenues for any class, subclass, or rate category of mail that differ from the billing determinants
implicit in the estimate of volumes for that class, subclass, or rate category.

We simplified this requirement in response to comments from the Postal Service. The Postal Service interpreted proposed
rule  3001.54(j)(5)(vi) to require it to (1) Multiply the after-rate fixed weight price index by the after-rate
volume forecast for each subclass, (2) compare the result with the after-rate revenue forecast for that subclass,
(3) determine if the difference exceeded specified thresholds, and (4) explain differences that exceeded the thresholds.




The Postal Service asserts that ``comparisons to the suggested thresholds (three percent of subclass revenue or
$20 million) add nothing to the ultimate answer.'' It characterizes steps ``1'' through ``3,'' above, as a ``wasteful
and burdensome exercise.'' Postal Service Comments of December 2, 1993, at 5. Although the added burden would have
been slight, in our view, we have nevertheless decided to delete the requirement that the Postal Service inventory
instances in which such differences exceed a threshold. 


The Postal Service also asserts that explanations of the difference between estimated and implied subclass revenues
would not be ``meaningful because, in every instance, the explanation would be the same: any difference between the
two numbers will be attributable to the different billing determinants (before rate and after rates) used in their
calculation.'' Id. at 4. 


Apparently because proposed rule  3001.54(j)(5)(vi)(e) asked the Postal Service to ``explain'' differences
between its estimated revenues and those implied by its volume forecasts, the Postal Service interpreted that rule
merely to require a recitation that different billing determinants give rise to different revenue results. We agree
that such a recitation would not be meaningful. The ``explanation'' intended by the proposed rule was not the perfunctory
one assumed by the Postal Service. The intent of the proposed rule was to elicit from the Postal Service a theoretical
or conceptual justification for using different billing determinants to forecast volume than it does to estimate
revenue for the same period. If the Postal Service based volume and revenue forecasts on different assumptions as
to, for example, the portion of the mailstream impacted by a proposed new rate category, or its implementation date,
the proposed rule contemplated that the Postal Service would provide supporting reasons. To clarify this intent,
final rule  3001.54(j)(6) asks for ``supporting rationale'' rather than an ``explanation.'' 


The Postal Service's comments appear to recognize that the Commission's concern is that the Postal Service articulate
a rationale for basing volume and revenue forecasts on different assumptions. It argues, however, that it would be
more efficient if the desired rationale were asked for and provided after a general rate hearing begins. Id. at 5. We
disagree. Where it is foreseeable that an aspect of an analytical method will routinely be placed in issue during the
hearing, it expedites the hearing if supporting rationale for that method is elicited ``up front,'' through standard
filing requirements. 




Other Proposals and Comments 




The OCA proposes that this docket include rules that would identify a minimum level of sampling error that the Commission
will tolerate in the Postal Service's volume estimates. The premise of the OCA's proposal is that the amendments proposed
in this docket might require further disaggregation of the volume and revenue estimates presented by the Postal Service,
potentially reducing their reliability. OCA Comments of November 24, 1993, at 1. 


Although the OCA's objective has merit, it is only indirectly related to the initial proposals in this docket. The
focus of the rules that we adopt in this docket is on documentation of the Postal Service's revenue estimates. Their
effect is not to further disaggregate those estimates, but merely to bring our rules into conformity with the Postal
Service's recent practice. They do not satisfy the premise of the OCA's proposal. The OCA's proposal should be the
focus of a separate rulemaking where its ramifications could be explored in depth. 


The Council of Public Utility Mailers (CPUM) proposes that current rule 54 be amended throughout to add ``rate categories''
to each reference to ``all classes and subclasses of mail and service.'' The objective of CPUM's proposal is to require
the Postal Service to present data ``at the most discrete, disaggregated level that is feasible.'' CPUM Comments
of November 29, 1993, at 3. 


We agree with the objective of CPUM's proposal, but do not think that requiring rate category data throughout rule
54 is feasible or wise. The final rules adopted in this docket require that revenue estimates be disaggregated further
than the rate category level. Consequently, the primary impact of CPUM's proposal would be on volumes. Current rules
 3001.54(j) (5) and (6) require that volume forecasts at the class and subclass level be derived from an econometric
demand study. It would not be appropriate to extend that requirement indiscriminately to rate categories as well.
For small rate categories, sample data are too thin to allow reliable econometric modelling. In this respect, CPUM's
proposed language could require data disaggregated beyond the maximum feasible level.

Final rule  3001.54(j)(6), which applies to both volumes and revenues, moves in the direction of CPUM's proposal,
since some of the requirements contained in its preamble now apply at the rate category level. The amended preamble
reiterates that estimates required by rules  3001.54(j) (2), (3), and (5), must be derived from econometric
demand studies at the class and subclass level. It is not required that estimates at the rate category level be derived
from econometric studies. If they are derived from econometric studies, however, the amended preamble language
applies to them the requirement that supporting rationale be provided if the assumptions underlying the estimate
depart from those underlying the econometrics. As discussed above, the amended preamble language also requires
supporting rationale where the billing determinants underlying a rate category revenue estimate differ from those
implicit in the corresponding volume forecast. 


McGraw-Hill, Inc. proposed two refinements to the language of proposed rule  3001.54(j)(5)(vi). One would
have refined the language of paragraph (a) of the proposed rule, which would have required the Postal Service to identify
its methods for deriving its price indices. McGraw-Hill's proposed refinement would have specifically required
the Postal Service to identify the time period and the rate schedule applicable to the billing determinants reflected
in the price indices. Comments of McGraw-Hill, Inc., of December 2, 1993, at 3. 

Where price indices reflect billing determinants of a specific time period and rate schedule, the Postal Service
should, of course, identify them. But McGraw-Hill's refined language might have been too restrictive to accommodate
price indices based on median, composite, or other adjusted billing determinant values. As noted above, we have deleted
specific references to price indices in our final rules, with the understanding that full documentation of the manner
in which they are derived is required by current rules  3001.54(j)(6). McGraw-Hill's proposed refinement
is therefore moot. 


McGraw-Hill also proposed refined language for paragraph (e) of proposed rule  3001.54(j)(5)(vi), which
proposed thresholds that would have triggered the requirement that the Postal Service explain differences between
estimated and implied subclass revenue. McGraw-Hill's refinement, though well considered, is moot, since we have
deleted threshold tests from our final rules. 


McGraw-Hill also proposed that we make the following additions to the Postal Service's ongoing data reporting requirements:
(i) the Postal Service shall furnish annually a pro forma Cost and Revenue Analysis (``CRA'') report that tracks the
determinations made in the preceding omnibus rate case decision; (ii) the CRA report shall identify any change in
attribution assumptions from the previous year's report; (iii) if the attribution assumptions employed in a CRA
report differ from those used in the Commission's decision in the preceding rate case, the Postal Service shall file
a pro forma report that uses the assumptions employed in the Commission's decision; and (iv) billing determinants
shall be reported on a quarterly rather than annual basis. [Comments of McGraw-Hill, Inc., of December 2, 1993, at
4-5.] 


As McGraw-Hill notes, these requirements were first proposed in Docket No. RM91-1 [57 FR 39160, 39163-39164],
but were not actively considered because of subsequent changes in the focus of that docket. Id. at 5. We will defer their
consideration. The proposals relating to the CRA are well considered, but are more appropriately dealt with after
the impending omnibus rate case has been processed. The proposals regarding billing determinant reports may also
be taken up at that time. 




Regulatory Evaluation 




It has been determined pursuant to 5 U.S.C.  605(b) that these rules will only affect informational requirements
applicable to the United States Postal Service, and it is certified that these rules will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities under the terms of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.  501 

et seq. 

Since these rules apply only to the Postal Service, it has also been determined that these rules do not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment pursuant to Executive Order 12612.
The rules, which would apply only to the Postal Service in postal rate proceedings, do not contain any information
collection requirements as defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U.S.C.  3502(4)(B), and consequently
the review provisions of 44 U.S.C.  3507 and the implementing regulations in 5 CFR part 1320 do not apply.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans 
Florida: Title V, Section 507, Small Business Stationary 
Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Florida through the Florida
Department of Environmental Regulation (FDER) for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source
Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), which will be fully implemented by November
1994. This implementation plan was submitted by FDER on February 24, 1993, to satisfy the federal mandate, found in
section 507 of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA), to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical
assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply with the CAA. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Implementation of the CAA will require small businesses to comply with specific regulations in order for areas to
attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. In anticipation
of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that states adopt a PROGRAM, and submit this
PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the EPA to oversee the small business
assistance program and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM
are set out in section 507 of Ttitle V of the CAA and the EPA guidance document Guidelines for the Implementation of section
507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. In order to gain full approval, the state submittal must provide for each of
the following PROGRAM elements: 



(1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance
to small businesses; 

(2) The establishment of a state Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory
process; and 

(3) The creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP.


FDER has met the following requirements of section 507 of Title V of the CAA by submitting a SIP revision that implements
the following required PROGRAM elements and implementation schedules. The PROGRAM will be fully implemented by
November 15, 1994. 



1. Small Business Assistance Program 



FDER has established a Small Business Section (SBS) which will incorporate the following six requirements set forth
in section 507 of Title V of the CAA: 

A. The establishment of adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting and coordinating information concerning
compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation
among such sources and other persons to further comply with the CAA; 

B. The establishment of adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with pollution prevention
and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning alternative technologies,
process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution; 

C. The development of a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary sources which
assists small businesses in determining applicable permit requirements under the CAA in a timely and efficient manner;


D. The development of adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive notice of their
rights under the CAA in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to evaluate compliance
methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under the CAA;

E. The development of adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their obligations
under the CAA, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors, or at the option of the state,
for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the CAA; and 
F. The development of procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source for modification
of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance; or (B) the schedule of milestones for implementing
such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the technological
and financial capability of any such small business stationary source. 


2. Ombudsman 


FDER has appointed a Small Business Ombudsman and established a Small Business Ombudsman's office which will act
as the small business community's representative as required by section 507(a)(3) of Title V of the CAA. 


3. Compliance Advisory Panel 


FDER established a Small Business Air Pollution Compliance Advisory Council (SBAP CAP) effective on July 7, 1993,
to meet the required November 1994 deadline of section 507(e) of title V of the CAA. The SBAP CAP is composed of seven
members as follows: 
Two members selected by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members
selected by the state legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected
by the head of the agency in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. 
The SBAP CAP has the following four responsibilities: 
(1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered and the degree
and severity of enforcement actions; 
(2) To periodically report to EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction Act,
the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act;





(3) To review and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable; and 
(4) To develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP. 


4. Eligibility 


FDER has incorporated section 507(c)(1) and defined a Small Business Stationary Source as a source that: 



(A) Operates in Florida; 
(B) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals, 
(C) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; 
(D) Is not a major stationary source; 
(E) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and 
(F) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. 



FDER has established the following mechanisms as required by section 507: 
(1) A process for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation
of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the CAA; 
(2) A process for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources that do not meet the provisions of Sections
507(c)(1) (C), (D), and (E) of the CAA, but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated pollutants; and (3) A process
for exclusion from the small business stationary source definition, after consultation with the EPA and the Small
Business Administration Administrator and after providing notice and opportunity for public comment, of any category
or 
subcategory of sources that the FDER determines to have 
sufficient technical and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the CAA. 


Final Action 


In this action, EPA is approving the PROGRAM SIP revision submitted by the State of Florida through the FDER. This action
is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial and EPA anticipates no significant
comments on them. The public should be advised that this action will be effective April 25, 1994. However, if notice
is received within 30 days that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments, this action will be withdrawn
and two subsequent notices will be published before the effective date. One notice will withdraw the final action
and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. Approval
of this action relieves EPA of any obligation to promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan for the SBA PROGRAM. 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed
in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by April 25, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration
by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2).)

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. EPA has submitted
a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such
time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive
Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 
Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall
be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to
relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.,

 EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
By this action, EPA is approving a state program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved does not impose any new regulatory
burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance
provided by the state. Therefore, because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements
on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected.

Missouri; Interim Authorization of State Hazardous Waste Management Program; Revisions




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Immediate final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Missouri has applied for interim authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Missouri's application and has
made a decision, subject to public review and comment, that Missouri's hazardous waste program revision satisfies
all of the requirements necessary to qualify for interim authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve Missouri's
hazardous waste program revisions. Missouri's application for program revision is available for public review
and comment.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



A. Background



States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or
``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6929(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure,
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98-616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'')
allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements
promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the
HSWA requirements under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the
HSWA requirements.
 
Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority
is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes
to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 266, 268 and 270.



B. Missouri



On November 20, 1985, EPA published a 

Federal Register

 notice announcing its decision to grant final authorization for the RCRA base program to the State of Missouri (50
FR 47740). Authorization revisions to the Missouri hazardous waste program were published on February 27, 1989 (54
FR 8190) and January 11, 1993 (58 FR 3497). Today, Missouri is seeking interim authorization of its program revision
in accordance with 40 CFR 271.24.

EPA has reviewed Missouri's application, and has made an immediate final decision that Missouri's hazardous waste
program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for interim authorization. Consequently,
EPA intends to grant interim authorization for the additional program modifications to Missouri. The public may
submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until March 25, 1994. Copies of Missouri's application
for program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations identified in the ``

Addresses

'' section of this action.

Approval of Missouri's program revision shall become effective April 25, 1994, unless an adverse comment pertaining
to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment
is received EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision, or (2) a notice containing a
response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision.

The State has adopted and applied for interim authorization for the corrective action portion of the HSWA Codification
Rule (July 15, 1985, 50 FR 28702). For a full discussion of the HSWA Codification Rule, the reader is referred to the


Federal Register

 cited above.

The State will assume lead responsibility for issuing permits for those program areas authorized today. For those
permits which will now change to State lead from EPA, EPA will transfer copies of any pertinent file information to
the State. EPA will be responsible for enforcing the terms and conditions of federally issued permits while they remain
in force. When the State reissues federally issued permits as State permits, EPA will rely on the State to enforce them.



C. Decision



I conclude that Missouri's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, Missouri is granted interim authorization to operate its hazardous waste program
as revised. Missouri now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within
its borders and carrying out the aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program application, subject
to the limitations of the HSWA. Missouri also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the
right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under sections 3008, 3013
and 7003 of RCRA.



Compliance With Executive Order 12866 


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.



Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act


Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of Missouri's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for
handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.





Authority:

 This action is issued under the authority of sections 2002(a), 3006 and 7004(b) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended
42 U.S.C. 6912(a), 6926, 6974(b).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (``CERCLA'' or ``the Act''),
as amended, requires that the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (``NCP'') include
a list of national priorities among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants,
or contaminants throughout the United States. The National Priorities List (``NPL'') constitutes this list. 



This rule adds 1 new site, ALCOA (Point Comfort)/Lavaca Bay in Point Comfort, Texas, to the General Superfund Section.
The identification of a site for the NPL is intended primarily to guide the Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA''
or ``the Agency'') in determining which sites warrant further investigation to assess the nature and extent of public
health and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine what CERCLA-financed remedial action(s),
if any, may be appropriate. This action results in an NPL of 1,191 sites, 1,068 of them in the General Superfund Section
and 123 of them in the Federal Facilities Section. An additional 96 sites are proposed, 66 in the General Superfund
Section and 30 in the Federal Facilities Section. Final and proposed sites now total 1,288.

V. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 



I. Introduction 



Background 



In 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C.
9601-9675 (``CERCLA'' or ``the Act''), in response to the dangers of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. CERCLA
was amended on October 17, 1986, by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (``SARA''), Public Law 99-499,
stat. 1613 

et seq.

 To implement CERCLA, EPA promulgated the revised National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan
(``NCP''), 40 CFR Part 300, on July 16, 1982 (47 FR 31180), pursuant to CERCLA section 105 and Executive Order 12316
(46 FR 42237, August 20, 1981). The NCP sets forth the guidelines and procedures needed to respond under CERCLA to releases
and threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. EPA has revised the NCP on several
occasions, most recently on March 8, 1990 (55 FR 8666). 

Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA requires that the NCP include ``criteria for determining priorities among releases
or threatened releases throughout the United States for the purpose of taking remedial action * * *
and, to the extent practicable taking into account the potential urgency of such action, for the purpose of taking
removal action.'' Removal action involves cleanup or other actions that are taken in response to releases or threats
of releases on a short-term or temporary basis (CERCLA section 101(23)). Remedial action tends to be long-term in
nature and involves response actions that are consistent with a permanent remedy for a release (CERCLA section 101(24)).


Pursuant to section 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, EPA has promulgated a list of national priorities
among the known or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throughout the United
States. That list, which is appendix B of 40 CFR part 300, is the National Priorities List (``NPL''). 

CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) defines the NPL as a list of ``releases'' and as a list of the highest priority ``facilities.''
The discussion below may refer to the ``releases or threatened releases'' that are included on the NPL interchangeably
as ``releases,'' ``facilities,'' or ``sites.'' 

CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) also requires that the NPL be revised at least annually. A site may undergo remedial action
financed by the Trust Fund established under CERCLA (commonly referred to as the ``Superfund'') only after it is placed
on the NPL, as provided in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(b)(1). However, under 40 CFR 300.425(b)(2) placing a site on the
NPL ``does not imply that monies will be expended.'' EPA may pursue other appropriate authorities to remedy the releases,
including enforcement action under CERCLA and other laws. 

Three mechanisms for placing sites on the NPL for possible remedial action are included in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(c)
(55 FR 8845, March 8, 1990). Under 40 CFR 300.425(c)(1), a site may be included on the NPL if it scores sufficiently high
on the Hazard Ranking System (``HRS''), which EPA promulgated as Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 300. On December 14, 1990
(55 FR 51532), EPA promulgated revisions to the HRS partly in response to CERCLA section 105(c), added by SARA. The
revised HRS evaluates four pathways: ground water, surface water, soil exposure, and air. The HRS serves as a screening
device to evaluate the relative potential of uncontrolled hazardous substances to pose a threat to human health or
the environment. Those sites that score 28.50 or greater on the HRS are eligible for the NPL. 

Under a second mechanism for adding sites to the NPL, each State may designate a single site as its top priority, regardless
of the HRS score. This mechanism, provided by the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(c)(2), requires that, to the extent practicable,
the NPL include within the 100 highest priorities, one facility designated by each State representing the greatest
danger to public health, welfare, or the environment among known facilities in the State. 
The third mechanism for listing, included in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(c)(3), allows certain sites to be listed whether
or not they score above 28.50, if all of the following conditions are met: 

 The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) of the U.S. Public Health Service has issued a
health advisory that recommends dissociation of individuals from the release. 

EPA determines that the release poses a significant threat to public health. 

 EPA anticipates that it will be more cost-effective to use its remedial authority (available only at NPL sites)
than to use its removal authority to respond to the release. 

EPA promulgated an original NPL of 406 sites on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40658). The NPL has been expanded since then,
most recently on October 14, 1992 (57 FR 47180). 

The NPL includes two sections, one of sites that are evaluated and cleaned up by EPA (the ``General Superfund Section''),
and one of sites being addressed by other Federal agencies (the ``Federal Facilities Section''). Under Executive
Order 12580 (52 FR 2923, January 29, 1987) and CERCLA section 120, each Federal agency is responsible for carrying
out most response actions at facilities under its own jurisdiction, custody, or control, although EPA is responsible
for preparing an HRS score and determining whether the facility is placed on the NPL. EPA is not the lead agency at these
sites, and its role at such sites is accordingly less extensive than at other sites. The Federal Facilities Section
includes those facilities at which EPA is not the lead agency. 



Deletions/Cleanups 



EPA may delete sites from the NPL where no further response is appropriate under Superfund, as explained in the NCP
at 40 CFR 300.425(e) (55 FR 8845, March 8, 1990). To date, the Agency has deleted 58 sites from the General Superfund
Section of the NPL, most recently Charlevoix Municipal Well, Charlevoix, Michigan (58 FR 63531, December 2, 1993)
and Mowbray Engineering Company, Greenville, Alabama (58 FR 69238, December 30, 1993).

EPA also has developed an NPL construction completion list (``CCL'') to simplify its system of categorizing sites
and to better communicate the successful completion of cleanup activities (58 FR 12142, March 2, 1993). Sites qualify
for the CCL when: 
(1) Any necessary physical construction is complete, whether or not final cleanup levels or other requirements have
been achieved; 
(2) EPA has determined that the response action should be limited to measures that do not involve construction (e.g.,
institutional controls); or 
(3) The site qualifies for deletion from the NPL. 
Inclusion of a site on the CCL has no legal significance. 
In addition to the 57 sites that have been deleted from the NPL because they have been cleaned up (the Waste Research
and Reclamation site was deleted based on deferral to another program and is not considered cleaned up), an additional
167 sites are also in the NPL CCL, all but one from the General Superfund Section. Thus, as of January 1994, the CCL consists
of 224 sites. 
Cleanups at sites on the NPL do not reflect the total picture of Superfund accomplishments. As of January 1994, EPA
had conducted 603 removal actions at NPL sites, and 1,755 removal actions at non-NPL sites. Information on removals
is available from the Superfund hotline. 


Correction 


EPA inadvertently left one site off of the appendix B list in the previous final rule (57 FR 47180, October 14, 1992).
This site is Foote Mineral Co., East Whiteland Township, PA, which belongs in the General Superfund Section of the
NPL. Alternately, one site was included in the previous appendix B list which did not belong. This site is Broward County_21st
Manor Dump in Fort Lauderdale, FL, which has been proposed to the NPL but a final decision has not yet been made. 


Action In This Rule 


This final rule adds 1 site, ALCOA (Point Comfort)/Lavaca Bay in Point Comfort, Texas, to the General Superfund Section,
for a total of 1,068 sites in that section. The Federal Facility Section includes 123 sites. Therefore, there are now
1,191 sites on the NPL. An additional 96 sites have been proposed, 66 in the General Superfund Section and 30 in the Federal
Facilities Section, and are awaiting final Agency action. Final and proposed sites now total 1,288. These numbers
reflect that two sites have been voluntarily withdrawn from the NPL by EPA: 



Hevi-Duty Electric Co., Goldsboro, NC 
Hexcel Corporation, Livermore, CA 



These numbers also reflect the removal of one site from the NPL by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals: 



Tex-Tin Corp., Texas City, TX 


Information Available to the Public 


The Headquarters and Region 6 public dockets for the NPL contain documents relating to the evaluation and scoring
of sites in this final rule. The dockets are available for viewing, by appointment only, after the appearance of this
notice. The hours of operation for the Headquarters docket are from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday,
excluding Federal holidays. Please contact the Region 6 Docket for hours.

II.  Purpose  and  Implementation  
of the NPL 



Purpose 



The legislative history of CERCLA (Report of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, Senate Report No. 96-848,
96th Cong., 2d Sess. 60 (1980)) states the primary purpose of the NPL:





The priority lists serve primarily informational purposes, identifying for the States and the public those facilities
and sites or other releases which appear to warrant remedial actions. Inclusion of a facility or site on the list does
not in itself reflect a judgment of the activities of its owner or operator, it does not require those persons to undertake
any action, nor does it assign liability to any person. Subsequent government action in the form of remedial actions
or enforcement actions will be necessary in order to do so, and these actions will be attended by all appropriate procedural
safeguards.




The purpose of the NPL, therefore, is primarily to serve as an informational and management tool. The identification
of a site for the NPL is intended to guide EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigation to assess the
nature and extent of the public health and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine what CERCLA-financed
remedial action(s), if any, may be appropriate. The NPL also serves to notify the public of sites that EPA believes
warrant further investigation. Finally, listing a site may, to the extent potentially responsible parties are identifiable
at the time of listing, serve as notice to such parties that the Agency may initiate CERCLA-financed remedial action.



Implementation 


After initial discovery of a site at which a release or threatened release may exist, EPA begins a series of increasingly
complex evaluations. The first step, the Preliminary Assessment (PA), is a low-cost review of existing information
to determine if the site poses a threat to the public health or the environment. If the site presents a serious imminent
threat, EPA may take immediate removal action. If the PA shows that the site presents a threat but not an imminent threat,
EPA generally will perform a more extensive study called the Site Inspection (SI). The SI involves collecting additional
information to better understand the extent of the problem at the site, screen out sites that will not qualify for the
NPL, and obtain data necessary to calculate an HRS score for sites that warrant placement on the NPL and further study.
To date EPA has completed approximately 35,000 PAs and approximately 17,000 SIs. 

The NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(b)(1) (55 FR 8845, March 8, 1990) limits expenditure of the Trust Fund for remedial actions
to sites on the NPL. However, EPA may take enforcement actions under CERCLA or other applicable statutes against responsible
parties regardless of whether the site is on the NPL; although, as a practical matter, the focus of EPA's CERCLA enforcement
actions has been and will continue to be on NPL sites. 

Similarly, in the case of CERCLA removal actions, EPA has the authority to act at any site, whether listed or not, that
meets the criteria of the NCP at 40 CFR 300.415(b)(2) (55 FR 8842, March 8, 1990). 

EPA's policy is to pursue cleanup of NPL sites using all the appropriate response and/or enforcement actions available
to the Agency, including authorities other than CERCLA. The Agency will decide on a site-by-site basis whether to
take enforcement or other action under CERCLA or other authorities prior to undertaking response action, to proceed
directly with Trust Fund-financed response actions and seek to recover response costs after cleanup, or do both.
To the extent feasible, once sites are on the NPL, EPA will determine high-priority candidates for CERCLA-financed
response action and/or enforcement action through both State and Federal initiatives. EPA will take into account
which approach is more likely to accomplish cleanup of the site most expeditiously while using CERCLA's limited resources
as efficiently as possible. 

Although it is a factor that is considered, the ranking of sites by HRS scores does not by itself determine the sequence
in which EPA funds remedial response actions, since the information collected to develop HRS scores is not sufficient
to determine either the extent of contamination or the appropriate response for a particular site (40 CFR 300.425(a)(2),
55 FR 8845). Additionally, resource constraints may preclude EPA from evaluating all HRS pathways; only those presenting
significant environmental risk and sufficient to make a site eligible for the NPL may be evaluated. Moreover, the
sites with the highest scores do not necessarily come to the Agency's attention first, so that addressing sites strictly
on the basis of ranking would in some cases require stopping work at sites where it already was underway. In addition,
certain sites are based on other criteria. 

More detailed studies of a site are undertaken in the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (``RI/FS'') that
typically follows listing. The purpose of the RI/FS is to assess site conditions and evaluate alternatives to the
extent necessary to select a remedy (40 CFR 300.430(a)(2) (55 FR 8846, March 8, 1990). The RI/FS takes into account
the amount of contaminants released into the environment, the risk to affected populations and environment, the
cost to remediate contamination at the site, and the response actions that have been taken by potentially responsible
parties or others. Decisions on the type and extent of response action to be taken at these sites are made in accordance
with 40 CFR 300.415 (55 FR 8842, March 8, 1990) and 40 CFR 300.430 (55 FR 8846, March 8, 1990).

<TEXT>
 

After conducting these additional studies, EPA may conclude that initiating a CERCLA remedial action using the Trust
Fund at some sites on the NPL is not appropriate because of more pressing needs at other sites, or because a private party
cleanup already is underway pursuant to an enforcement action. Given the limited resources available in the Trust
Fund, the Agency must carefully balance the relative needs for response at the numerous sites it has studied. It is
also possible that EPA will conclude after further analysis that the site does not warrant remedial action. 


RI/FS at Proposed Sites 


An RI/FS may be performed at sites proposed in the 

Federal Register

 for placement on the NPL (or even sites that have not been proposed for placement on the NPL) pursuant to the Agency's
removal authority under CERCLA, as outlined in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.415. Although an RI/FS generally is conducted
at a site after it has been placed on the NPL, in a number of circumstances the Agency elects to conduct an RI/FS at a site
proposed for placement on the NPL in preparation for a possible Trust Fund-financed response action, such as when
the Agency believes that a delay may create unnecessary risks to public health or the environment. In addition, the
Agency may conduct an RI/FS to assist in determining whether to conduct a removal or enforcement action at a site. 


Facility (Site) Boundaries 


The Agency's position is that the NPL does not describe releases in precise geographical terms, and that it would be
neither feasible nor consistent with the limited purpose of the NPL (as the mere identification of releases), for
it to do so. 
CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) directs EPA to list national priorities among the known ``releases or threatened releases''
of hazardous substances. Thus, the purpose of the NPL is merely to identify releases of hazardous substances that
are priorities for further evaluation. Although a CERCLA ``facility'' is broadly defined to include any area where
a hazardous substance release has ``come to be located'' (CERCLA section 101(9)), the listing process itself is not
intended to define or reflect the boundaries of such facilities or releases. Of course, HRS data upon which the NPL
placement was based will, to some extent, describe which release is at issue; that is, the NPL site would include all
releases evaluated as part of that HRS analysis (including noncontiguous releases evaluated under the NPL aggregation
policy, see 48 FR 40663 (September 8, 1983)). 
EPA regulations provide that the ``nature and extent of the threat presented by a release'' will be determined by an
RI/FS as more information is developed on site contamination (40 CFR 300.68(d)). During the RI/FS process, the release
may be found to be larger or smaller than was originally known, as more is learned about the source and the migration
of the contamination. However, this inquiry focuses on an evaluation of the threat posed; the boundaries of the release
need not be defined, and in any event are independent of the NPL listing. Moreover, it generally is impossible to discover
the full extent of where the contamination ``has come to be located'' before all necessary studies and remedial work
are completed at a site. Indeed, the boundaries of the contamination can be expected to change over time. Thus, in most
cases, it will be impossible to describe the boundaries of a release with certainty. 
For these reasons, the NPL need not be amended if further research into the extent of the contamination expands the
apparent boundaries of the release. Further, the NPL is only of limited significance, as it does not assign liability
to any party or to the owner of any specific property. See Report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works,
Senate Rep. No. 96-848, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 60 (1980), quoted at 48 FR 40659 (September 8, 1983). If a party contests
liability for releases on discrete parcels of property, it may do so if and when the Agency brings an action against
that party to recover costs or to compel a response action at that property. 
At the same time, however, the RI/FS or the Record of Decision (which defines the remedy selected) may offer a useful
indication to the public of the areas of contamination at which the Agency is considering taking a response action,
based on information known at that time. For example, EPA may evaluate (and list) a release over a 400-acre area, but
the Record of Decision may select a remedy over 100 acres only. This information may be useful to a landowner seeking
to sell the other 300 acres, but it would result in no formal change in the fact that a release is included on the NPL. The
landowner (and the public) also should note in such a case that if further study (or the remedial construction itself)
reveals that the contamination is located on or has spread to other areas, the Agency may address those areas as well.

This view of the NPL as an initial identification of a release that is not subject to constant re-evaluation is consistent
with the Agency's policy of not rescoring NPL sites: 



EPA recognizes that the NPL process cannot be perfect, and it is possible that errors exist or that new data will alter
previous assumptions. Once the initial scoring effort is complete, however, the focus of EPA activity must be on investigating
sites in detail and determining the appropriate response. New data or errors can be considered in that process * * *.
[T]he NPL serves as a guide to EPA and does not determine liability or the need for response. (49 FR 37081 (September
21, 1984).

III. Contents of This Final Rule 


This final rule adds 1 site to the General Superfund Section of the NPL. This site is ALCOA (Point Comfort)/Lavaca Bay
in Point Comfort, Texas, which was proposed to the NPL in Proposal 

#

15 (58 FR 34018, June 23, 1993) based on an HRS score of 28.50 or greater. The group number identified for this site based
on its score is 4/5. Group numbers are determined by arranging the NPL by rank and dividing it into groups of 50 sites.
For example, a site in Group 4 has a score that falls within the range of scores covered by the fourth group of 50 sites
on the NPL. 


Public Comments 


EPA reviewed all comments received on this site. The formal comment period ended on August 23, 1993. 
EPA has carefully considered public comments submitted and has made certain modifications in response to those comments.
EPA's response to site-specific public comments and explanations of any score changes made as a result of such comments
are addressed in the ``Support Document for the Revised National Priorities List Final Rule_February 1994.'' 


Statutory Requirements 


CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) directs EPA to list priority sites ``among'' the known releases or threatened releases
of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, and section 105(a)(8)(A) directs EPA to consider certain
enumerated and ``other appropriate'' factors in doing so. Thus, as a matter of policy, EPA has the discretion not to
use CERCLA to respond to certain types of releases. Where other authorities exist, placing sites on the NPL for possible
remedial action under CERCLA may not be appropriate. Therefore, EPA has chosen not to place certain types of sites
on the NPL even though CERCLA does not exclude such action. If, however, the Agency later determines that sites not
listed as a matter of policy are not being properly responded to, the Agency may place them on the NPL. 


Economic Impacts 


The costs of cleanup actions that may be taken at any site are not directly attributable to placement on the NPL. EPA
has conducted a preliminary analysis of economic implications of today's amendment to the NPL. EPA believes that
the kinds of economic effects associated with this revision generally are similar to those effects identified in
the regulatory impact analysis (RIA) prepared in 1982 for the revisions to the NCP pursuant to section 105 of CERCLA
and the economic analysis prepared when amendments to the NCP were proposed (50 FR 5882, February 12, 1985). The Agency
believes the anticipated economic effects related to adding 1 site to the NPL can be characterized in terms of the conclusions
of the earlier RIA and the most recent economic analysis. 
Inclusion of a site on the NPL does not itself impose any costs. It does not establish that EPA necessarily will undertake
remedial action, nor does it require any action by a private party or determine its liability for site response costs.
Costs that arise out of site responses result from site-by-site decisions about what actions to take, not directly
from the act of listing itself. Nonetheless, it is useful to consider the costs associated with responding to the site
included in this rulemaking. 
The major events that follow the proposed listing of a site on the NPL are a search for potentially responsible parties
and a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine if remedial actions will be undertaken at a
site. Design and construction of the selected remedial alternative follow completion of the RI/FS, and operation
and maintenance (O&M) activities may continue after construction has been completed.

EPA initially bears costs associated with responsible party searches. Responsible parties may bear some or all the
costs of the RI/FS, remedial design and construction, and O&M, or EPA and the States may share costs. 

The State cost share for site cleanup activities has been amended by Section 104 of SARA. For privately-owned sites,
as well as at publicly-owned but not publicly-operated sites, EPA will pay for 100% of the costs of the RI/FS and remedial
planning, and 90% of the costs associated with remedial action. The State will be responsible for 10% of the remedial
action. For publicly-operated sites, the State cost share is at least 50% of all response costs at the site, including
the RI/FS and remedial design and construction of the remedial action selected. After the remedy is built, costs fall
into two categories: 

 


_For restoration of ground water and surface water, EPA will share in startup costs according to the criteria in the
previous paragraph for 10 years or until a sufficient level of protectiveness is achieved before the end of 10 years.


_For other cleanups, EPA will share for up to 1 year the cost of that portion of response needed to assure that a remedy
is operational and functional. After that, the State assumes full responsibilities for O&M. 

 


In previous NPL rulemakings, the Agency estimated the costs associated with these activities (RI/FS, remedial design,
remedial action, and O&M) on an average per site and total cost basis. EPA will continue with this approach, using
the most recent (1993) cost estimates available; the estimates are presented below. However, there is wide variation
in costs for individual sites, depending on the amount, type, and extent of contamination. Additionally, EPA is unable
to predict what portions of the total costs responsible parties will bear, since the distribution of costs depends
on the extent of voluntary and negotiated response and the success of any cost-recovery actions. 







Costs to the State of Texas associated with today's final rule arise from the required State cost-share of: (1) 10%
of remedial actions and 10% of first-year O&M costs at privately-owned sites and sites that are publicly-owned
but not publicly-operated; and (2) at least 50% of the remedial planning (RI/FS and remedial design), remedial action,
and first-year O&M costs at publicly-operated sites. States will assume the cost for O&M after EPA's period
of participation. Using the budget projections presented above, the cost to Texas of undertaking Federal remedial
planning and actions, but excluding O&M costs, would be approximately $2.78 million. State O&M costs cannot
be accurately determined because EPA, as noted above, will share O&M costs for up to 10 years for restoration of
ground water and surface water, and it is not known if the ALCOA (Point Comfort/Lavaca Bay) site will require this treatment
and for how long. Assuming EPA involvement for 10 years is needed, State O&M costs would be approximately $2.3
million. 

Placing a hazardous waste site on the final NPL does not itself cause firms responsible for the site to bear costs. Nonetheless,
a listing may induce firms to clean up the sites voluntarily, or it may act as a potential trigger for subsequent enforcement
or cost-recovery actions. Such actions may impose costs on firms, but the decisions to take such actions are discretionary
and made on a case-by-case basis. Consequently, precise estimates of these effects cannot be made. EPA does not believe
that every site will be cleaned up by a responsible party. EPA cannot project at this time which firms or industry sectors
will bear specific portions of the response costs, but the Agency considers: the volume and nature of the waste at the
sites; the strength of the evidence linking the wastes at the site to the parties; the parties' ability to pay; and other
factors when deciding whether and how to proceed against the parties. 

Economy-wide effects of this amendment to the NPL are aggregations of efforts on firms and State and local governments.
Although effects could be felt by some individual firms and States, the total impact of this amendment on output, prices,
and employment is expected to be negligible at the national level, as was the case in the 1982 RIA. 



Benefits 



The real benefits associated with today's amendment are increased health and environmental protection as a result
of increased public awareness of potential hazards. In addition to the potential for more Federally-financed remedial
actions, expansion of the NPL could accelerate privately-financed, voluntary cleanup efforts. Listing sites as
national priority targets also may give States increased support for funding responses at particular sites. 

As a result of the additional CERCLA remedies, there will be lower human exposure to high-risk chemicals, and higher-quality
surface water, ground water, soil, and air. These benefits are expected to be significant, although difficult to
estimate in advance of completing the RI/FS at these sites. 



IV. Executive Order 12866 



This action was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR
51735, October 4, 1993) and Executive Order 12316 (46 FR 42237, August 20, 1981). No changes were made in response to
OMB. 



V. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires EPA to review the impacts of this action on small entities, or certify
that the action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. By small entities, the
Act refers to small businesses, small government jurisdictions, and nonprofit organizations. 

While this rule revises the NCP, it is not a typical regulatory change since it does not automatically impose costs.
As stated above, adding sites to the NPL does not in itself require any action by any party, nor does it determine the
liability of any party for the cost of cleanup at the site. Further, no identifiable groups are affected as a whole.
As a consequence, impacts on any group are hard to predict. A site's inclusion on the NPL could increase the likelihood
of adverse impacts on responsible parties (in the form of cleanup costs), but at this time EPA cannot identify the potentially
affected businesses or estimate the number of small businesses that might also be affected. 

The Agency does expect that the listing of the sites in this NPL rule could significantly affect certain industries,
or firms within industries, that have caused a proportionately high percentage of waste site problems. However,
EPA does not expect the listing of these sites to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
businesses.

In any case, economic impacts would occur only through enforcement and cost-recovery actions, which EPA takes at
its discretion on a site-by-site basis. EPA considers many factors when determining enforcement actions, including
not only the firm's contribution to the problem, but also its ability to pay. 

The impacts (from cost recovery) on small governments and nonprofit organizations would be determined on a similar
case-by-case basis. 

For the foregoing reasons, I hereby certify that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Therefore, this regulation does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with changes in the definitions of interstate commerce and commercial motor vehicle contained in the
Motor Carrier Act of 1984, the FHWA is amending the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) to make private
motor carriers of passengers involved in interstate transportation subject to them with certain exceptions. Implementation
of the final rule is being delayed to allow the new class of regulatees an opportunity to comment on the type and scope
of educational and technical assistance necessary and to provide ample time to come into compliance with the FMCSRs.

 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Statutory Authority 



Since 1935, the Federal government has been regulating, for safety purposes, interstate transportation performed
by for-hire carriers of property and passengers and private carriers of property. Prior to the passage of the Motor
Carrier Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-554, 98 Stat. 2832, 49 U.S.C. app. 2501 

et. seq.

), the Federal government's jurisdiction did not extend to private motor carriers of passengers (PMCPs). 

With the enactment of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984, Congress defined the FHWA's jurisdiction on the basis of
vehicles operating in interstate commerce. The stated purposes of the 1984 Act were to (1) promote the safe operation
of commercial motor vehicles; (2) minimize dangers to the health of operators of commercial motor vehicles; and (3)
assure increased compliance with traffic laws and with the commercial motor vehicle safety rules. 

Congress expanded the definition of commercial motor vehicle (CMV) in section 204 of that Act (49 U.S.C. app. 2503)
to include any self-propelled or towed vehicle used on highways in interstate commerce to transport passengers or
property if (a) such vehicle has a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,001 or more pounds; (b) such vehicle is designed
to transport 16 or more passengers, including the driver; or (c) such vehicle is used in the transportation of hazardous
materials which require a placard. 

Interstate commerce was defined in the same section of the Act as ``trade, traffic, or transportation in the United
States which is between a place in a State and a place outside of such State (including a place outside of the United States)
or is between two places in a State through another State or a place outside of the United States.'' Therefore, anyone
operating or causing to be operated vehicles as defined in the Act in interstate commerce became subject to regulation
by the Secretary of Transportation. 



Current Regulations 


The FMCSRs are contained in title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, parts 350 through 399. These regulations set minimum
safety standards for motor carriers, vehicles and drivers involved in interstate commerce. The areas covered include
driver qualification, licensing, hours of driving and on duty time, vehicle safety equipment, operating condition,
inspection and maintenance. Consistent with the pre-1984 authority, PMCPs are currently exempt from the FMCSRs
(parts 390-399) pursuant to 49 CFR 390.3(f)(6). 

The Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 (CMVSA)(Title XII, Pub. L. 99-570, 49 U.S.C. app. 2701-2718)
established requirements for testing and licensing of all drivers of commercial motor vehicles as defined in that
Act. Under the implementing regulations in 49 CFR part 383, all drivers subject to that part must successfully complete
a knowledge test and skills examination, as applicable, both of which are administered by the driver's State of residence.
The State then issues a Commercial Driver's License (CDL), which is the only license that may be possessed by an operator
of a commercial motor vehicle. The operative definitions in the CMVSA of 1986 extend jurisdiction to any driver of
a defined vehicle, whether in interstate or intrastate commerce, and whether or not otherwise subject to DOT jurisdiction.
The current rulemaking does not alter the provisions of Part 383 for any CMV driver, nor does it affect other regulatory
exemptions, e.g., the transportation of school children and government operations. 

The FHWA issued a Notice of Interpretation (58 FR 27328, May 7, 1993) to clarify its policy relating to for-hire transportation
of passengers. That notice clarifies the FHWA's policy that businesses operating passenger-carrying commercial
motor vehicles in interstate commerce, and receiving direct or indirect compensation for their transportation
services, are for-hire motor carriers subject to the minimum levels of financial responsibility requirements.
If the passenger-carrying capacity of the vehicle is 16 or more, including the driver, they are also subject to the
remainder of the FMCSRs. 



Rulemaking History 



In 1985, the FHWA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) in the 

Federal Register

 (50 FR 2998, Docket No. MC-114) to obtain comments on the merits of regulating PMCPs. Recognizing the wide diversity
of operating practices, the FHWA (shortly after the 1984 Act) contracted for a study to gain greater insight into the
operating practices of these carriers. (ASW Associates, Silver Spring, Md., June 10, 1987.) Although there is little
definitive accident data, the study concluded that highway safety would be enhanced by regulating PMCPs. After comments
to the ANPRM were received and analyzed, the FHWA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on February 17, 1989
(MC-88-15), proposing to assert jurisdiction over these carriers with respect to certain requirements
of the FMCSRs (see 54 FR 7362). 

In the NPRM, the FHWA acknowledged that all buses should be in safe operating condition and driven by qualified drivers.
However, it would be overly burdensome and counterproductive to attempt to require every entity transporting people
by bus, regardless of purpose, to comply with the whole range of regulations, including recordkeeping requirements.


In the NPRM, the FHWA divided PMCPs into two groups based on the relationship of the driver to the motor carrier. Group
I consisted of all employees hired to perform primarily as drivers. Group II consisted of volunteer drivers (who may
also be employees) who received little or no remuneration for their driving and drove for less than 10 percent of their
work time. The division of the two groups was intended to recognize the distinction between business and nonbusiness
operations. 

Under the proposal advanced in the NPRM, Group I would have been treated the same as for-hire motor carriers of passengers
and would have been subject to all of the FMCSRs. Group II would have been subject to CDL and the vehicle and maintenance
requirements, but would not have been required to keep driver qualification files. 

The FHWA was also aware that some buses currently in use may not have been subject to the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration's (NHTSA) fuel system requirements at the time of manufacture. The NPRM proposed to ``grandfather''
this equipment and, therefore, would not require retrofitting of the fuel systems if the vehicle has been maintained
and meets the original manufacturer's standards.

Discussion of Comments to the Docket 



The FHWA received 28 comments to this docket: 14 from organizations and groups potentially affected by the rulemaking,
5 from national associations, 3 from for-hire bus companies, 2 from State enforcement agencies, 1 from a Federal advisory
board, 1 from a union, and 2 from individuals. Only three commenters, two of which were churches, opposed the rule as
an unnecessary regulatory burden. 

The American Bus Association (ABA) supported the NPRM, expressing the opinion that PMCPs are less safe than for-hire
carriers because they operate older, inferior equipment, with less experienced drivers, and in its opinion, are
involved in a disproportionate number of fatal accidents. The ABA also stated that these drivers should be subject
to the same driver qualification and hours of service requirements, including recordkeeping, because they are usually
less experienced and qualified. The ABA raised questions about the enforceability of the definition in the NPRM for
limited PMCPs, specifically the 10 percent driving time factor. It felt these carriers would reduce driving time
below 10 percent to avoid the paperwork requirements. The ABA also recommended that all PMCPs get a U.S. DOT number
to facilitate enforcement. 

The United Bus Owners of America and the National School Transportation Association supported the rule, maintaining
that anyone transporting passengers should comply fully with the FMCSRs, including recordkeeping, in the interest
of safety for the passengers on board a vehicle and the motoring public at large. The International Brotherhood of
Teamsters supported the rule and favored the division of PMCPs into groups for the purpose of paperwork burden relief.


Those commenters opposed to the NPRM were concerned that the rule placed an unnecessary burden on churches, with little
accident or safety data to support the rule. They contended that many churches will terminate interstate travel rather
than attempt to comply with the requirements. 

Two States wrote to the docket_one supporting and one opposing the proposal. The Transportation Cabinet of the Commonwealth
of Kentucky supported the rule. The Cabinet believed that school bus operations also should be subject to the FMCSRs,
but did not provide data to support its position. The Department of Motor Vehicles in North Carolina opposed the rule
as an unnecessary burden, claiming private buses are usually not used in commerce. The Department instead recommended
that FHWA staff focus on truck safety problems. 



FHWA's Response 



In consideration of the comments to the NPRM, the FHWA concluded that the use of volunteer driver status, coupled with
the 10 percent driving factor, would not be a workable criterion for separation of the two groups because of the uncertainty
in defining ``volunteer status'' 

and 

measuring the 10 percent driving time factor. Instead, the FHWA will base its distinction on whether the motor carrier
is providing the transportation of passengers in furtherance of a commercial purpose other than transportation.


Those PMCPs involved in a business activity which provides transportation, in the furtherance of a commercial purpose
other than for-hire transportation, will be subject to all of the FMCSRs, including recordkeeping. Those PMCPs engaged
in nonbusiness activities, but providing transportation of some kind, must have safe drivers and vehicles and will
be subject to many of the FMCSRs. These PMCPs will not be required to comply with the current recordkeeping requirements.
The FHWA also agrees with, and has incorporated into the final rule, comments that all PMCPs should obtain a U.S. DOT
number, which should facilitate the proper collection of accurate roadside inspection and enforcement information.
The ``grandfather'' provision for fuel system requirements, as proposed in the NPRM, also has been retained. 

Although interstate commerce is historically defined to include trade, traffic, or transportation across State
boundaries and is not limited to business entities in profit-making ventures, the FHWA believes most churches will
fall within the definition of nonbusiness PMCPs. As such, these carriers will not be subject to the current recordkeeping
requirements. Under this final rule, once a driver obtains a CDL, no additional files, such as driver qualification
records including the medical examination certificate, or drivers' record of duty status, are required to be maintained.




Requirements of the Final Rule 



The final rule is very similar to the NPRM except that (1) the definition of PMCP has been consolidated with the definition
of private motor carrier of property, (2) the definitions of ``nonbusiness PMCPs'' and ``business PMCPs'' have been
added, (3) nonbusiness PMCPs will be exempt from subpart H of part 391 and all current recordkeeping requirements,
(4) PMCPs will not be subject to the road and written test requirements of part 391, and (5) all passenger carriers will
be required to obtain a US DOT number to identify their buses for enforcement by Federal and State officials. 

Many operations which are classified as PMCPs are companies that transport their workers to and from job sites. PMCPs
also include nonbusiness-type organizations, including scout, church and civic groups, that characteristically
use volunteers to transport members by bus and charge no fee, or only a nominal fee to cover expenses of the transportation
service provided.

Definitions 



Business PMCPs 



A business PMCPs is defined as any entity involved in the interstate transportation of passengers; the transportation
provided is in the furtherance of the entity's commercial purpose, which is not for-hire transportation; and the
transportation is not available to the general public. The FHWA believes that any business entity transporting people
should meet the same minimum safety requirements as those businesses involved in the private transportation of property.
Therefore, these carriers must comply with the entire body of the FMCSRs, including recordkeeping. These carriers
need not comply with the road and written test requirements of part 391, since these requirements are essentially
met by acquiring a CDL with proper bus endorsements. In addition, these carriers need not comply with the fuel system
requirements of  393.67, provided the carrier's commercial motor vehicle fuel systems have been maintained
and meet the original manufacturer's standards. 



Nonbusiness PMCPs 



A nonbusiness PMCPs is any entity involved in the interstate transportation of passengers, other than for-hire,
and does not meet the definition of a business PMCPs. These carriers will be subject to parts 383, 385 (requiring a Motor
Carrier Identification Report), 390, 391 (excluding subpart H and recordkeeping requirements), 392, 393 (excluding
fuel systems that have been maintained and meet the original manufacturer's standards), 395 (excluding the recordkeeping
requirements), and 396 (excluding the recordkeeping requirements). Churches, civic associations, scouts, and
other charitable institutions that may purchase or lease buses for sponsored activities are included in this category.


The special treatment afforded nonbusiness carriers is not to relieve churches or civic associations from compliance
with any of the safety regulations when these carriers arrange tours for the public at large and charge a fee with the
intent to make a profit. In this instance, nonbusiness carriers are in fact performing transportation services as
for-hire carriers. When engaged in chartering operations, the transportation service is the primary activity of
the organization and such charter service is not incidental to the non-transportation purposes of the organization.
Such activities are and will continue to be treated as for-hire transportation of passengers, subject to all the FMCSRs.




Driver and Carrier Requirements 



Business PMCPs 



These carriers must meet all of the driver recordkeeping requirements in part 391, except for the road and written
test requirements, which are essentially met by acquiring a CDL with proper bus endorsements. This recordkeeping
requirement includes maintaining all documents required in a driver qualification file and drug testing documentation.
These carriers must also comply with the recordkeeping requirements in part 395 regarding drivers' records of duty
status. 

Consistent with past FHWA practice, a one-time exemption for currently employed drivers is provided in this rulemaking.
The recordkeeping requirements, including application for employment ( 391.21), investigation and inquiries
( 391.23), and notifications of previous employment ( 383.35), will not apply to those drivers regularly
employed by a motor carrier prior to July 1, 1994 and for as long as the person continues to be regularly employed as a
driver for that motor carrier. 



Nonbusiness PMCPs 



Nonbusiness PMCPs must comply with the driving and on-duty hours limitation contained in part 395. The costs associated
with requiring record retention by these motor carriers, who operate sporadically, would outweigh the benefits
and, accordingly, the FHWA will not impose the recordkeeping requirements of part 395 on these carriers. It is recognized
that some individuals who volunteer to drive for their church or civic organization may also drive for other motor
carriers and in that capacity are required to maintain a record of duty status (driver logs). All on-duty and driving
time, performed in a volunteer capacity by an individual who is otherwise regularly employed as a commercial driver,
for a nonbusiness PMCP must be recorded on the records of duty-status submitted to that driver's regularly employing
motor carrier. On duty and driving time for those drivers regularly employed must be considered in determining whether
the driver has adequate time to drive as a volunteer, and vice-versa. The FHWA believes this requirement is necessary
to ensure that a fatigued driver is not permitted or required to drive beyond the hours of service limits. 

These carriers are not required to have their drivers medically examined and do not have to maintain the records required
in parts 391, 395 and 396. 



Drug and Alcohol Testing 



Nonbusiness PMCPs are not subject to the current drug testing requirements found in 49 CFR part 391. However, business
PMCPs are subject to those regulations. 

Under a final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 15, 1994, the FHWA announced new drug and alcohol testing rules. These rules were issued in response to
the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 and will require that all operators of CMVs subject to the
CDL requirements, be tested for controlled substances and alcohol. Both business and nonbusiness PMCPs will be subject
to these rules.

<TEXT>
 

Due to the broad scope of these rules, business and nonbusiness PMCPs with 50 or more drivers will have until January
1, 1995 to comply with the new drug and alcohol testing regulations. Business and nonbusiness PMCPs with less than
50 drivers will be required to comply with the new drug and alcohol testing regulations beginning January 1, 1996.


To further the purpose of the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act, no waiver or exemption from any provision
of the new rules, including the recordkeeping requirements, is provided. Consequently, all nonbusiness PMCPs will
be required to meet certain recordkeeping requirements when the final rule is fully implemented. 



Vehicle Requirements



Business PMCPs 



Part 393, Parts and Accessories Necessary for Safe Operation, and Part 396, Inspection, Repair and Maintenance,
provide detailed safety requirements for commercial motor vehicle components and inspection thereof. Business
PMCPs are required to comply with the vehicle equipment requirements contained in part 393 (excluding fuel systems
that have been maintained and meet original manufacturer's standards) and the maintenance and recordkeeping requirements
in part 396. A few carriers may need to perform minor retrofitting to bring their vehicles into compliance with the
requirements of part 393. 


Nonbusiness PMCPs 



Nonbusiness PMCPs must comply with the vehicle equipment requirements in part 393 (excluding fuel systems that have
been maintained and meet original manufacturer's standards) and the maintenance requirements of part 396. These
carriers will not have to comply with the recordkeeping requirements contained in part 396. 



Insurance Requirements 



Section 18 (a) through (g) of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-261, 96 Stat. 1102, 1120, as amended)
established minimum levels of financial responsibility for for-hire motor carriers of passengers. The Act did not
extend coverage to motor carriers involved in private transportation of passengers. Therefore, for purposes of
this final rule, PMCPs are not required to comply with part 387. 



Enforcement




PMCPs will be subject to the FHWA and State motor carrier safety enforcement activities. The FHWA has a field staff
which monitors compliance and enforces the regulations primarily by reviews of company records. Also, the FHWA administers
a formula grant program, the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP), to reimburse States for uniform enforcement
of commercial motor vehicle safety and hazardous materials compliance through roadside driver/vehicle inspections
and review of motor carrier safety practices. 



Business PMCPs 




The primary enforcement activity will be unannounced terminal and roadside driver/vehicle inspections conducted
by State personnel. Roadside driver/vehicle inspections may include inspections performed at origin or destination
points such as parking lots, amusement parks, sporting complexes, and convention centers as well as on the road. A
terminal inspection is a comprehensive vehicle inspection conducted at the carrier's terminal facility, garage
or at a bus station. The vehicle standards for these inspections are reflected in the current periodic inspection
requirements (part 396, Appendix G). Business PMCP drivers will have CDLs, medical cards, and records of duty status
reviewed. 

Federal and State investigators will also conduct safety and compliance reviews of these carriers at their principal
places of business. The investigators will review motor carriers' safety management practices and regulatory compliance
as evidenced by records maintained. These carriers will also be subject to FHWA's rating process and the provisions
of the Motor Carrier Act of 1990 regarding the consequences of unsatisfactory safety ratings, i.e., an unsatisfactory
rating will prohibit the operation of buses effective 45 days after receipt of the rating. Unsafe carriers will be
subject to the same civil and criminal penalties as all other carriers currently under the jurisdiction of the FHWA.
Carriers identified in FHWA's information system as having unsafe operations will be scheduled for safety and compliance
reviews. 



Nonbusiness PMCPs 



Nonbusiness PMCPs will be subject to the same terminal and roadside driver/vehicle inspections as business PMCPs,
except the drivers will only be subject to having their CDL reviewed and hours of service verified from evidence gathered
at the scene. Compliance reviews will not be performed on these carriers nor will they be subject to FHWA's safety rating
process, unless the information systems reveal that the carrier has been identified as having ongoing roadside safety
inspection problems. 



Marking 



To facilitate State inspections of these vehicles and drivers, the FHWA is requiring each PMCP to have its name, city
and State, and U.S. DOT number marked on the side of the bus to the extent presently required of all motor carriers.

Implementation 



Marketing and Educational Program 



Because PMCPs have not been regulated in the past, the FHWA and state personnel will be providing educational and technical
assistance for these carriers prior to the effective date. The FHWA is seeking comments on the type and scope of educational
and technical assistance that should be provided to assist PMCPs in complying with the FMCSRs. Comments must be received
on or before October 1, 1994. The FHWA will make the materials available to National and State organizations which
represent PMCPs or anyone who requests assistance directly from the FHWA. The FHWA also has Division offices in every
State that can answer questions and provide technical assistance to these carriers upon request. The addresses for
the FHWA Division Offices are listed in appendix D to 49 CFR part 7. 



Effective Date 



PMCPs (business and nonbusiness) will have until January 1, 1995, to meet these requirements. 


Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 



Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 



Because this rulemaking has been the subject of substantial congressional and public interest, the FHWA has determined
that this final rule is a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 and a significant
regulation under the DOT regulatory policies and procedures. In the Motor Carrier Act of 1984, Congress expanded
the definitions of ``interstate commerce'' and ``commercial motor vehicle'' which expanded the Department of Transportation's
regulatory jurisdiction to include private motor carriers of passengers. Both Congress and the bus industry have
shown a keen interest in the progress of this rulemaking. The safety benefits and opportunities for benefits from
this rule will offset any cost. A regulatory evaluation has been prepared and is available for review in the public
docket. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 



In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the FHWA has evaluated
the effects of this rule on small entities. Many small entities will be economically impacted by this rulemaking and
some may decide to cease transportation of passengers rather than comply with the safety rules and regulations. However,
the overall impact on small entities will be minimal. The FHWA is exempting the majority of small entities_those defined
as nonbusiness_from the paperwork and recording requirements of this rule. The vast majority of PMCPs are small entities,
especially the non-business carriers. Some of the smallest entities may find it preferable to discontinue their
operations in interstate commerce, and to charter buses for their interstate trips. Private carriers which pay their
drivers are even more likely to consider chartering as an option because of their increased costs for driver salaries
or other compensation. Chartering does not reduce the cost of complying with this rule, but does place an effective
ceiling on how much this rule might cost small entities. Thus, under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act,
the FHWA hereby certifies that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. 



Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment) 



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a federalism assessment. This regulation amends certain parts of the FMCSRs pertaining to the scope and applicability
of the FMCSRs to interstate transportation by PMCPs as authorized by the Motor Carrier Act of 1984. The FMCSRs establish
minimum safety regulations which may be supplemented by the States, provided the State safety laws and regulations
are compatible with the Federal requirements. (See 57 FR 40946, September 8, 1992, which includes the Tolerance Guidelines
for Adopting Compatible State Rules and Regulations.) The statutory basis for Federal regulation of interstate
commerce has been outlined above. Accordingly, it is certified that the policies contained in this document have
been assessed in light of the principles, criteria, and requirements of the Federalism Executive Order. 



Executive Order 12372 (Intergovernmental Review) 



Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Numbers 20.217, Motor Carrier Safety, and 20.218, Motor Carrier
Safety Assistance Program. The regulations implementing Executive Order 12372 regarding intergovernmental consultation
on Federal programs and activities apply to this program.
