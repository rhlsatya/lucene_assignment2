<DOCTITLE>Loan Guarantees to Israel; Notice of Investment Opportunity</DOCTITLE>


The Government of Israel (the ``GOI'') wishes to select managing underwriters for the structuring and sale of U.S.
Agency for International Development (``USAID'')-guaranteed loans. The USAID-guaranteed loans have been authorized
by Public Law 102-391, and are being provided in connection with Israel's extraordinary humanitarian effort
to resettle and absorb immigrants into Israel from the republics of the former Soviet Union, Ethiopia and other countries.
The legislation authorizes the guaranty by USAID of up to $10 billion principal amount of loans over the next five years,
with a maximum of $2 billion in loans, offered in one or more tranches, to be guaranteed in each of the five fiscal years.
This Notice is in connection with the GOI's selection of managing underwriters for an offering of up to $1.563 billion
contemplated to be made under the authorization for the current fiscal year.
The GOI would like to receive proposals from interested underwriters on an expedited basis. A Request for Proposals
(``RFP'') will be available from the GOI on or about February 21, 1994. Proposals must be submitted, in accordance
with RFP, by 4:00 p.m. on March 1, 1994. For information regarding the submission of proposals, please contact Mr.
Eliahu Ziv-Zitouk, Chief Fiscal Officer, Ministry of Finance of the Government of Israel, 350 Fifth Avenue, New York,
NY 10118 (fax: 212/736-2759).
To accomplish the GOI's objectives, the GOI's lead manager must at a minimum:
1. Perform and discuss with the GOI and its financial advisor a complete quantitative analysis of the cash flows generated
by the proposed structures and proposed pricing of securities;
2. Complete the underwriting of all securities offered for sale;
3. Establish and maintain a post-sale trading market for the securities; and
4. Coordinate all activities relating to the proposed financing plan with the GOI and its financial advisor.
Selection of underwriters and the terms of the loans are initially subject to the individual discretion of the GOI
and thereafter subject to approval by USAID. In order to be eligible for selection as a managing underwriter, an institution
must be a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, and otherwise meet legal requirements for serving
in such role.
The full repayment of the loans will be guaranteed by USAID. To be eligible for an USAID guaranty, the loans must be repayable
in full no later than the thirtieth anniversary of the disbursement of the principal amount thereof. The USAID guaranty
will be backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America and will be issued pursuant to authority in
Section 226 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended. Disbursements under the loans will be subject to certain
conditions required of the GOI by USAID as set forth in agreements between USAID and the GOI.
Additional information regarding USAID's responsibilities in this guaranty program can be obtained from the undersigned:
Room 3328, New State, Washington, DC 20523-0030, Telephone: 202/647-6504.

Notice of decisions.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On February 3, 1994, James R. Lyons, Assistant Secretary for Natural Resources and the Environment, decided to offer
for sale, pending modification of the injunction in SAS v. Lyons, No. C92-179 (W.D. Washington), 30.861 million
board feet of timber from 24 timber sales in Oregon, Washington and California. These decisions resulted from an agreement
between Secretaries Espy and Babbit and the plaintiffs to review for possible release from the Court's injunction
certain Forest Service timber sales in Pacific Southwest (Region 5) and Pacific Northwest (Region 6) Regions. All
24 sales have been modified to meet the stipulations of the agreement. The plaintiffs agreed not to oppose a motion
to release 54 timber sales identified in the agreement. These 24 sales represent a portion of the 54 identified timber
sales.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A final environmental impact statement (FEIS) on Management for the Northern Spotted Owl in the National Forests
was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on January 31, 1992 and the Record of Decision (ROD) for this
FEIS was signed on March 3, 1992. A lawsuit was filed by Seattle Audubon Society on March 25, 1992, 

(Seattle Audubon Society, et al. 

v. 

James R. Moseley, et al.)

 which challenged the legality of the FEIS and ROD alleging violations of both National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
and National Forest Management Act. On May 28, 1992 Judge Dwyer found that the Forest Service had not fully complied
with NEPA and that it must take further action under that statute. On May 29, 1992, Judge Dwyer enjoined the Forest Service
from auctioning and awarding additional timber sales in suitable spotted owl habitat. On October 6, 1993 an agreement
was reached between plaintiffs and Secretaries Espy and Babbit to review for possible release from the Court's injunction
certain Forest Service timber sales in Forest Service Regions 5 and 6. All or portions of 54 timber sales were identified
in the agreement. The plaintiffs agreed not to oppose a motion to release the 54 timber sales. Environmental analysis
and consultation with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have been completed for 24 of the 54 sales. In addition, each of
the 24 sales has been adjusted to meet the stipulations found in the October 6 agreement with the plaintiffs.




Following is a list of the 24 timber sales, national forests, states, and their approximate volumes:





These decisions are final agency actions and are not subject to administrative appeal.

Notice of Amended Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Ferrosilicon From Brazil

Finally, CBCC alleges that we failed to make proper adjustments to a U.S. price (USP) converted to cruzeiros because
USP is compared to costs which are expressed in cruzeiros at a later date. CBCC claims the CV should be adjusted for the
lag between the cost calculation and the conversion of the sales price into cruzeiros. We note that we did not convert
USP into cruzeiros. Moreover, we followed our normal methodology for hyperinflationary economies of using the CV
in the month of shipment of the U.S. sale. Accordingly, we find that this is not a ministerial error. 
Therefore, pursuant to section 735(e) of the Act, we are correcting the above ministerial errors made in our final
determination of sales at less than fair value. 
See memorandum to Barbara R. Stafford from David L. Binder, February 8, 1994, for a detailed explanation of the decisions
noted above. 


Inclusion of Minasligas 


In the final determination, the Department found that Minasligas had a zero dumping margin. In consequence, the Department
excluded Minasligas from the results of the investigation, and instructed the Customs Service to terminate suspension
of liquidation for all entries of FeSi from Minasligas and to release any bond or other security and to refund any cash
deposits with respect to these entries in accordance with section 735(c)(2) of the statute. 
However, as noted above, the Department has determined that ministerial errors exist with respect to the calculation
of Minasligas' dumping margin. The recalculation of Minasligas' margin results in the finding of sales at less than
fair value. Accordingly, we are directing the Customs Service to reinstitute suspension of liquidation of all remaining
entries of FeSi from Minasligas, entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after August 16, 1993,
which is the date of the publication of our affirmative preliminary determination in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 43323) and before January 6, 1994, which is the date of publication of our final determination in the 

Federal Register

. For all unliquidated entries made during the period from August 16, 1993, to January 6, 1994, the Customs Service
shall retain the cash deposits collected, or bonds posted, as a result of the preliminary determination. 
In addition, as a result of the amended final determination, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation
of all entries of FeSi from Minasligas, entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of
the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated margin amount by which
the FMV of the subject merchandise exceeds the USP as shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section below. 


Suspension of Liquidation 


In accordance with section 735(c)(4)(A) of the Act, we are directing the U.S. Customs Service to continue to retroactively
suspend liquidation of all entries of FeSi from Italmagnesio S.A. Industria e Comercio. Retroactive suspension
applies to entries of FeSi, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after May 18, 1993,
which is the date 90 days prior to the date of the publication of our preliminary determination in the 

Federal Register

. For CBCC and ``All Other Exporters,'' we are directing the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation of
all entries of FeSi from Brazil, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after August
16, 1993. 
The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated margin amount by which the
FMV of the subject merchandise exceeds the USP as shown below. 




ITC Notification 


In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. 
This amended final determination is published pursuant to section 735(d) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673d(d)) and 19 CFR
353.28(c).

<DOCTITLE>Solid Urea From Estonia; Joint Notice of Initiation of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and Notice of Preliminary
Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

International Trade Administration/Import Administration, Department of Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Joint notice of initiation of antidumping duty administrative review and preliminary results of antidumping duty
administrative review.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Commerce (the Department) received a request from the Government of Estonia to conduct an administrative
review of the antidumping duty order on solid urea from Estonia. In response to this request, and in accordance with
the Commerce Regulations, the Department is initiating this administrative review and is concurrently issuing
these preliminary results. The review covers the period July 1, 1991, through June 30, 1992. There were no known shipments
of this merchandise to the United States from Estonia by any party during the period and there are no known unliquidated
entries.


Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


On July 14, 1987, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (52 FR 26367) an antidumping duty order on solid urea from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) (52 FR 19557
(May 26, 1987)). On June 29, 1992, following dissolution of the USSR, the Department transferred the order to the Commonwealth
of Independent States and the Baltic States, including Estonia. The substance of each new order remained the same
and the estimated cash deposit rate of 68.26 percent was applied to exports from each independent state (57 FR 28828
(June 29, 1992)). This was the highest rate established in the LTFV investigation.
On July 31, 1992, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a), the Department received a timely request from the government
of Estonia for an administrative review of the order for the time period July 1, 1991, through June 30, 1992. On August
10, 1992, the Department requested the U.S. Customs Service (Customs) to determine whether there was any record of
entries of subject merchandise from the former USSR or any of the 15 independent republics during the review period.
On August 13, 1992, Customs advised the Department that there was no record of any entries of the subject merchandise
under HTS item 3102.10.00 during the period July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992, from the former USSR or any of the 15 independent
republics.


Initiation of Review


In accordance with  353.22(c) of the Department's regulations, we are initiating an administrative review
of the antidumping duty order on solid urea from Estonia (case number A-447-801) and are concurrently
issuing these preliminary results. This review covers all manufacturers and exporters, of solid urea from Estonia
for the period July 1, 1991 through June 30, 1992, and its results will be applied to all manufacturers and exporters
of solid urea from Estonia.

Interested parties must submit requests for disclosure under administrative protective order in accordance with
 353.34(b) of the Department's regulations. 


Scope of Review 


Imports covered by this review are all shipments of solid urea from Estonia. During the original investigation such
merchandise was provided for under item number 480.30 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS). This merchandise
is currently classifiable under item number 3102.10.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) of the United States.
HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive
as to the scope of the product coverage. 
The period of review is July 1, 1991 through June 30, 1992. 


Preliminary Results of Review 


As stated in the background section of this notice, Customs has advised the Department that there were no entries of
the subject merchandise into the United States during the period of review. Therefore, the cash deposit rate for all
firms will be maintained at the present rate of 68.26 percent. This rate is the applicable rate transferred to the Republic
of Estonia on 
June 29, 1992. This rate was the highest calculated rate from the original LTFV investigation. 
Case briefs and/or written comments from interested parties may be submitted no later than 30 days after the date of
publication of this notice. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttals to written comments, limited to issues raised in the case
briefs and comments, may be filed no later than 37 days after the date of publication of this notice. 
Within 10 days of the date of publication of this notice, interested parties to this proceeding may request a disclosure
and/or a hearing. The hearing, if requested, will take place no later than 44 days after publication of this notice.
Persons interested in attending the hearing should contact the Department for the date and time of the hearing. 
The Department will subsequently publish the final results of this administrative review, including the results
of its analysis of issues raised in any such written comments or a hearing. 
The following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn
from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this administrative review,
as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: the cash deposit rate for all firms shall be 68.26 percent. 
These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review. 
This initiation, this review, and this notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as
amended (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)) and 19 CFR 353.22(c) (1993).

ACTION: 

Notice of issuance of Letters of Authorization.




Notice is given that on February 8, 1994, NMFS issued a Letter of Authorization for a take of ringed seals incidental
to on-ice seismic activities in the Beaufort Sea. This letter was issued under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection
Act (MMPA) and 50 CFR part 228, subparts A and B.
A letter was issued to Western Geophysical, 351 E. International Airport Road, Anchorage, Alaska 99518. The letter
is valid only for activities conducted in 1994, and is subject to the provisions of the MMPA, regulations governing
small takes of marine mammals incidental to specified activities, and regulations governing the taking of ringed
seals incidental to on-ice seismic activities in the Beaufort Sea (50 CFR part 228, subparts A and B and 58 FR 4091, January
13, 1993).
Issuances of letters are based on findings that the total takings will have a negligible impact on the ringed seal species
or stock and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species for subsistence uses.

agency: 

National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), NOAA, Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Issuance of extensions to four permits.




On April 13, 1993, as authorized by the provisions of the Endangered Species Act, NMFS issued incidental take Permit
829 (P507F) to the Washington Department of Fisheries (WDF), Permit 830 (P250E) to the Washington Department of Wildlife
(WDW), Permit 831 (P211G) to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW), and Permit 832 (P503D) to the Idaho
Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) to incidentally take listed Snake River sockeye salmon (

Oncorhynchus nerka

) and Snake River spring/summer and fall chinook salmon (

O. tshawytscha

) during the operation of artificial propagation hatcheries, subject to certain conditions set forth therein, to
be valid through February 15, 1994. 
The above permit holders have submitted applications (P507G, P250F, P211H, and P503L, respectively) in due form
for new permits to authorize the continued operation of their hatchery programs. NMFS is currently analyzing the
activities proposed in those applications in accordance with the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental
Policy Act; however, this process is not yet complete. 
Notice is hereby given that on February 14, 1994, NMFS issued extensions to the above permits, authorizing the permit
holders to continue the activities therein until July 1, 1994, or until the authorization is superseded by a new permit.
All other conditions associated with the permit remain in full force and effect. No release of hatchery fish are authorized
at this time. 
Issuance of these extensions, as required by the ESA, was based on a finding that: (1) The taking would be incidental;
(2) the applicant would, to the maximum extent practicable, monitor, minimize and mitigate the impacts of such taking;
(3) the taking would not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the survival and recovery of the species in the wild;
and (4) there were adequate assurances that the conservation plan would be funded and implemented, including any
measures required by the Assistant Administrator. These permits were also issued in accordance with and are subject
to Parts 217-222 of Title 50 CFR, the NMFS regulations governing listed species permits. 
The applications, permits, and supporting documentation are available for review by interested persons in the following
offices by appointment: 
Office of Protected Resources, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland
20910 (301-713-2322); and

 Notice is hereby given that the Southwest Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, P.O. Box
271, La Jolla, California 92038-0271, has applied in due form for a permit to take Hawaiian monk seals (

Monachus schauinslandi

) for purposes of scientific research and to enhance the survival of the species. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The subject permit is requested under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C.
1361 

et seq

.), the Regulations Governing the Taking and Importing of Marine Mammals (50 CFR part 216), the Endangered Species
Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531

 Notice of availability.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice of availability is for a Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (FSEIS) to the Environmental
Impact Statement prepared for the United States Army Kwajalein Atoll (USAKA) (United States Army Strategic Defense
Command, 1989). The FSEIS has assessed potential environmental impacts for two proposed actions: To increase the
level of missile defense test and evaluation activities to support the development for deployment of missile defense
systems; and to adopt new environmental standards for USAKA.



Lead Agency: U.S. Army Space and Strategic Defense Command (USASSDC).

Cooperating Agency: Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO).

Proposed Action: The first Proposed Action involves a substantial increase in USAKA activities required to support
the development in missile defense systems. These activities would consist of a substantial increase in flight test
activities with a corresponding increase in the USAKA infrastructure and support capabilities. USAKA is a national
range at which the performance of component, sub-system, and integrated system testing has occurred. The second
Proposed Action involves the adoption of new environmental standards for USAKA, which are derived from existing
United States and Republic of the Marshall Islands regulations and statutes, and are tailored to protect the specific
environmental conditions of the Kwajalein Atoll. The development of these new standards is provided for in the Compact
of Free Association between the United States and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.

AGENCY: 

Department of Education.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of dates for submission of State revenue and expenditure reports for fiscal year 1993 and of revisions to those
reports.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Secretary of Education announces a date for the 
submission by State educational agencies (SEAs) of preliminary expenditure and revenue data and average daily attendance
statistics for fiscal year (FY) 1993 and establishes a deadline for any revisions to that information. The Secretary
sets these dates to ensure that data are available for timely distribution of Federal funds. The data will be published
by the Department's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and will be used by the Secretary in the calculation
of allocations for FY 1995 appropriated funds.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under the authority of section 406(g) of the General Education Provisions Act, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1221e-1(g)),
which authorizes NCES to gather data from States on the financing of elementary and secondary education, NCES collects
data annually from SEAs through ED Form 2447. The report from SEAs includes attendance, revenue, and expenditure
data from which NCES determines the average State per pupil expenditure (SPPE) for elementary and secondary education.



In addition to using SPPE data as useful statistics on the financing of elementary and secondary education, the Secretary
uses them directly in calculating allocations for certain formula grant programs, including chapter 1 of title I
of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (chapter 1), Impact Aid, and Indian Education. Other programs
such as title VII of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, the Eisenhower Mathematics and Science Education
program, and the Drug-Free Schools and Community Act make use of SPPE data indirectly because their formulas are based,
in whole or in part, on State chapter 1 allocations.




In December 1993, NCES mailed to SEAs ED Form 2447 with instructions and requested that SEAs submit initial data to
the Department by March 15, 1994. If an SEA does not submit initial FY 1993 data on ED Form 2447 on or about March 15, 1994,
it should inform NCES, in writing, of the delay and the date by which it will submit FY 1993 data. Submissions by SEAs
to NCES are edited by NCES and returned to each SEA for verification. NCES acknowledges that data submitted prior to
September 6, 1994, may be preliminary and are subject to revision by an SEA not later than September 6, 1994.

To ensure timely distribution of Federal education funds based on the best, most accurate data available, NCES establishes,
for allocation purposes, a final date by which ED Form 2447 must be submitted. However, if an SEA submits revised data
after the final deadline that results in a lower SPPE figure, its allocations may be adjusted downward or the Department
may request the SEA to return funds. SEAs should be aware that all of these data are subject to audit and that, if any inaccuracies
are discovered in the audit process, the Department may seek recovery of overpayments for the applicable programs.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action:

 Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 The Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office, announces that pursuant to Paragraph B of 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i),
it intends to issue a noncompetitive grant award to The Nature Conservancy. The award is planned for a three (3) year
project cycle, consisting of three (3) separately funded one (1) year budget periods. The initial budget is estimated
at $250,000.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 Grant Award Number: DE-FG06-94RL12858. Scope of Project: The proposed financial assistance award is
a grant to The Nature Conservancy to fund a Biodiversity Inventory and Analysis Program on the Hanford Site. The activities
will include inventorying plants, animals, and ecologically significant areas. In addition, the inventory work
will assist DOE in identifying the location of threatened and endangered species on the Hanford Site and thereby afford
the proper protection and/or mitigation required per the Threatened and Endangered Species Act.



The Nature Conservancy is currently performing activities related to those proposed at the Hanford Site utilizing
their own resources. The public benefit derived from these activities could be greatly enhanced with Department
of Energy financial support. It has been determined that a grant instrument is appropriate since the Department of
Energy anticipates limited direct involvement with the program.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to make an award based on an unsolicited application.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy (DOE), Chicago Field Office, through the Dallas Support Office, announces, pursuant to
the DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.14(f), that DOE intends to award a grant to the Texas Engineering Experiment
Station at Prairie View A&M University (PVAM), for the implementation of a collaborative program with the Energy
Analysis and Diagnostic Center (EADC) at Texas A&M University to provide the necessary training and support
for development of an EADC at PVAM.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

DOE announces further that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(2), this discretionary financial assistance award to the
Texas Engineering Experiment Station at PVAM, would be based on the acceptance of an unsolicited application meeting
the criteria of 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1). There are currently no Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)
participating in the EADC program. Texas A&M University (TAMU) is one of only six EADC program participants that
have IAC qualifications to conduct the combined industrial assessment activities of energy efficiency improvement,
waste reduction/pollution prevention and productivity improvement. Of the six IACs, TAMU is the only institution
in close proximity to an Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) accredited HBCU. The proposed
project is deemed meritorious based on the general evaluation in accordance with DOE 600.14(d) and represents a unique
approach that would not be eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current, or planned solicitation.



The project period for the grant award is 12 months. DOE plans to provide funding in the amount of $62,000.00.

<DOCTITLE>Floodplain Statement of Findings for Proposed Sampling at Solid Waste Management Units 94 and 95 at the Paducah Gaseous

 Department of Energy (DOE).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Floodplain Statement of Findings.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This is a Floodplain Statement of Findings for the proposed 
sampling at solid waste management units (SWMUs) 94 and 95. 
DOE proposes to conduct a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Facility Investigation (RFI) at SWMUs 94 and 95 at
the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) that would involve the collection of surface water, ground water, sediment,
and soil samples at these SWMUs. Some sampling is proposed to occur in the floodplains of two creeks near PGDP in McCracken
County, Kentucky. DOE prepared a floodplain assessment describing the effects, alternatives, and measures designed
to avoid or minimize potential harm to or within the affected floodplains. DOE will endeavor to allow 15 days of public
review after publication of the statement of findings before implementing the proposed action.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This is a Floodplain Statement of Findings for the proposed RFI sampling at SWMUs 94 and 95 prepared in accordance with
10 CFR part 1022. A Notice of Floodplain/Wetland Involvement for Environmental Restoration and Waste Management
Activities at PGDP was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 5, 1993, at 58 FR 51812, and a floodplain assessment has been prepared; no wetland will be involved in the
proposed action. DOE is proposing to collect surface water, ground water, sediment, and soil samples to define the
nature and extent of contamination in these media at two SWMUs on the site of the former Kentucky Ordnance Works near
PGDP in McCracken County, Kentucky.


Ground-water wells and deep soil borings would be placed within the 100-year floodplain of an unnamed tributary to
Big Bayou Creek at SWMU 94 and within the 100-year floodplain of Big Bayou Creek at SWMU 95 to determine if the floodplains
have been contaminated from past releases from the two SWMUs. Sampling would allow DOE to define the nature and extent
of potential contamination in floodplain media. Two alternatives were considered_the no action alternative and
an alternative that included performing the activities outside of the floodplain. Neither of these alternatives
would provide the necessary characterization information and, therefore, are unacceptable alternatives. The
proposed action does conform to applicable State floodplain protection standards.
Minor temporary impacts would occur from construction of temporary access roads and drilling pads for heavy equipment
used to install deep soil borings and wells. Some trees would have to be cut at SWMU 95 to clear new access routes. Existing
roadways and clearings would be used to the greatest extent possible to minimize new road construction. New temporary
roadways and drilling pads would require small amounts of gravel and rock fill for drilling equipment.
All drilling pads and most access roadways would be reclaimed and revegetated at the conclusion of the project. Some
roadways would be left in place for continued access to monitoring wells. The number of trees to be cut would be kept
to the minimum needed to clear access routes. Standard engineering practices would control potential soil erosion
from the sites. Access road and drilling pad construction and clearing vegetation for site access would not reduce
the flood storage capacity of the floodplain, interfere with stream flow, or produce hazardous flood velocities.
DOE will endeavor to allow 15 days of public review after publication of the statement of findings prior to implementing
the proposed action.

Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products: Granting of the Application for Interim Waiver and Publishing
of the Petition for Waiver of DOE Furnace Test Procedures From Goodman Manufacturing Company


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, DOE.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Today's notice publishes a letter granting an Interim Waiver to Goodman Manufacturing Company (Goodman) from the
existing Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for the company's GMN series central
furnaces.


Today's notice also publishes a ``Petition for Waiver'' from Goodman. Goodman's Petition for Waiver requests DOE
to grant relief from the DOE furnace test procedure relating to the blower time delay specification. Goodman seeks
to test using a blower delay time of 40 seconds for its GMN series central furnaces instead of the specified 1.5-minute
delay between on-time and blower on-time. The Department is soliciting comments, data, and information respecting
the Petition for Waiver.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94-163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95-619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation
Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 100-12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA
1988), Public Law 100-357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102-486, 106 Stat. 2776,
which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer
products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption
that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, Subpart
B.


The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 on September 26, 1980, creating the
waiver process. 45 FR 64108. Thereafter, DOE further amended the appliance test procedure waiver process to allow
the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver
from test procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures.
51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986.
The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive, temporarily, test procedures for a particular basic
model when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing
according to the prescribed test procedures, or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model
in a manner so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data.
Waivers generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem
that is the subject of the waiver.
The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver when it is
determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver is denied,
if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines that
it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition
for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the
Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary.
On November 29, 1993, Goodman filed an Application for Interim Waiver regarding blower time delay. Goodman's Application
seeks an Interim Waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition of the
burner and starting of the circulating air blower. Instead, Goodman requests the allowance to test using a 40-second
blower time delay when testing its GMN series central furnaces. Goodman states that the 40-second delay is indicative
of how these furnaces actually operate. Such a delay results in an energy savings of 0.6 to 1.0 percent. Since current
DOE test procedures do not address this variable blower time delay, Goodman asks that the Interim Waiver be granted.

The Department has published a notice of Proposed Rulemaking on August 23, 1993, (58 FR 44583) to amend the furnace
test procedure, which addresses the above issue. 

Previous waivers for this type of time blower delay control have been granted by DOE to Coleman Company, 50 FR 2710,
January 18, 1985; Magic Chef Company, 50 FR 41553, October 11, 1985; Rheem Manufacturing Company, 53 FR 48574, December

55 FR 50224, December 5, 1990, and 57 FR 49700, November 3, 1992; Inter-City Products Corporation, 55 FR 51487, December
14, 1990, and 56 FR 63945, December 6, 1991; DMO Industries, 56 FR 4622, February 5, 1991; Heil-Quaker Corporation,
56 FR 6019, February 14, 1991; Carrier Corporation, 56 FR 6018, February 14, 1991, and 57 FR 38830, August 27, 1992;
Amana Refrigeration Inc., 56 FR 27958, June 18, 1991, 56 FR 63940, December 6, 1991, and 57 FR 23392, June 3, 1992; Snyder
General Corporation, 56 FR 54960, September 9, 1991; Goodman Manufacturing Corporation, 56 FR 51713, October 15,
1991, and 57 FR 27970, June 23, 1992; The Ducane Company Inc., 56 FR 63943, December 6, 1991, and 57 FR 10163, March 24,
1992; Armstrong Air Conditioning, Inc., 57 FR 899, January 9, 1992, 57 FR 10160, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 10161, March 24,
1992, 57 FR 39193, August 28, 1992, and 57 FR 54230, November 17, 1992; Thermo Products, Inc., 57 FR 903, January 9, 1992;
Consolidated Industries Corporation, 57 FR 22220, May 27, 1992; Evcon Industries, Inc., 57 FR 47847, October 20,
1992; and Bard Manufacturing Company, 57 FR 53733, November 12, 1992. Thus, it appears likely that the Petition for
Waiver will be granted for blower time delay. 

In those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated based upon DOE having
granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested and rated
for energy consumption on a comparable basis. 

Therefore, based on the above, DOE is granting Goodman an Interim Waiver for its GMN series central furnaces. Pursuant
to paragraph (e) of Section 430.27 of the Code of Federal Regulations part 430, the following letter granting the Application
for Interim Waiver to Goodman was issued. 

Pursuant to paragraph (b) of 10 CFR part 430.27, DOE is hereby publishing the ``Petition for Waiver'' in its entirety.
The petition contains no confidential information. The Department solicits comments, data, and information respecting
the petition.

Mr. Peter H. Alexander, 



Vice President of Engineering, Goodman Manufacturing Company, 1501 Seamist, Houston, Texas 77008. 




Dear Mr. Alexander: This is in response to your November 29, 1993, Application for Interim Waiver and Petition for
Waiver from the Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for Goodman Manufacturing
Company (Goodman) GMN series central furnaces. 

Previous waivers for this type of timed blower delay control have been granted by DOE to Coleman Company, 50 FR 2710,
January 18, 1985; Magic Chef Company, 50 FR 41553, October 11, 1985; Rheem Manufacturing Company, 53 FR 48574, December
1, 1988, 56 FR 2920, January 25, 1991, 57 FR 10166, March 24, 1992, and 57 FR 34560, August 5, 1992; Trane Company, 54 FR
19226, May 4, 1989, 56 FR 6021, February 14, 1991, 57 FR 10167, March 24, 1992, and 57 FR 22222, May 27, 1992; Lennox Industries,
55 FR 50224, December 5, 1990, and 57 FR 49700, November 3, 1992; Inter-City Products Corporation, 55 FR 51487, December
14, 1990, and 56 FR 63945, December 6, 1991; DMO Industries, 56 FR 4622, February 5, 1991; Heil-Quaker Corporation,
56 FR 6019, February 14, 1991; Carrier Corporation, 56 FR 6018, February 14, 1991, and 57 FR 38830, August 27, 1992;
Amana Refrigeration Inc., 56 FR 27958, June 18, 1991, 56 FR 63940, December 6, 1991, and 57 FR 23392, June 3, 1992; Snyder
General Corporation, 56 FR 54960, September 9, 1991; Goodman Manufacturing Corporation, 56 FR 51713, October 15,
1991, and 57 FR 27970, June 23, 1992; The Ducane Company Inc., 56 FR 63943, December 6, 1991, and 57 FR 10163, March 24,
1992; Armstrong Air Conditioning, Inc., 57 FR 899, January 9, 1992, 57 FR 10160, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 10161, March 24,
1992, 57 FR 39193, August 28, 1992, and 57 FR 54230, November 17, 1992; Thermo Products, Inc., 57 FR 903, January 9, 1992;
Consolidated Industries Corporation, 57 FR 22220, May 27, 1992; Evcon Industries, Inc., 57 FR 47847, October 20,
1992; and Bard Manufacturing Company, 57 FR 53733, November 12, 1992. Thus, it appears likely that the Petition for
Waiver will be granted for blower time delay. 

Goodman's Application for Interim Waiver does not provide sufficient information to evaluate what, if any, economic
impact or competitive disadvantage Goodman will likely experience absent a favorable determination on its application.
However, in those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated, based upon
DOE having granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested
and rated for energy consumption on a comparable basis. 

Goodman shall be permitted to test its GMN series central furnaces on the basis of the test procedures specified in
10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, Appendix N, with the modification set forth below: 

(i) Section 3.0 in Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph: 

3.0 Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in Section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82 with the
exception of Sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures: 

(ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 in Appendix N as follows: 

3.10 Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the cool-down test
and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the thermocouple
grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up, delay the
blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t-) unless: (1) The furnace employs a single motor to drive the power burner and the
indoor air circulation blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together; or (2) the furnace is
designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case the fan control shall
be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device which
shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the
fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control is permitted to
start the blower, measure time delay (t-) using a stop watch. Record the measured temperatures. During the heat-up
test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within 

#

0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft. 

This Interim Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements and all allegations submitted by the company.
This Interim Waiver may be removed or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying the
application is incorrect. 

The Interim Waiver shall remain in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE acts on the Petition for Waiver, whichever
is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180-day period, if necessary. 
  Sincerely,

Re: Petition for Waiver and Application for Interim Waiver.



Gentlemen: This is a Petition for Waiver and Application for interim Waiver submitted pursuant to Title 10 CFR 430.27.
Waiver is requested from the test procedure for measuring Furnace Energy Consumption as found in Appendix H to Subpart
B of part 430.
The current test procedure requires a 1.5 minute delay between burner ignition and the start of the circulating air
blower. Goodman Manufacturing Co., L.P. is requesting waiver and authorization to use a 40 second delay instead of
the specified 1.5 minutes for the blower to start after main burner ignition. Goodman Manufacturing intends to use
a fixed timing control on our GMN series central furnaces to gain additional energy savings that are achieved with
the use of shorter blower on times.
Test data for these furnaces with a 40 second delay indicated an increase in AFUE of 0.6 to 1.0 percentage points. The
use of a 40 second delay reduces the appliance flue losses and therefore increases the furnace efficiency. Copies
of confidential test data confirming this energy savings will be provided to you at your request.
The current test procedure does not give Goodman Manufacturing credit for energy savings that can be obtained using
fixed blower timings. The proposed ASRAE 103-1988 that is under consideration by DOE address the use of timed
blower operation.
Goodman Manufacturing is confident that this Waiver will be granted, and therefore we request an Interim Waiver be
granted until a final ruling is made. Goodman, as well as other manufacturers of domestic furnaces, have been granted
similar waivers.
Manufacturers that domestically market similar products have been sent a copy of this Petition for Waiver and Application
for Interim Waiver.
  Sincerely,


<SIGNER>

<DOCTITLE>Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products: Granting of the Application for Interim Waiver and Publishing
of the Petition for Waiver of DOE Furnace Test Procedures From Goodman Manufacturing Company</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, DOE.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Today's notice publishes a letter granting an Interim Waiver to Goodman Manufacturing Company (Goodman) from the
existing Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for the company's GMPV series central
furnaces.



Today's notice also publishes a ``Petition for Waiver'' from Goodman. Goodman's Petition for Waiver requests DOE
to grant relief from the DOE furnace test procedure relating to the blower time delay specification. Goodman seeks
to test using a blower delay time of 30 seconds for its GMPV series central furnaces instead of the specified 1.5-minute
delay between burner on-time and blower on-time. The Department is soliciting comments, data, and information respecting
the Petition for Waiver.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94-163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95-619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation
Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 100-12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA
1988), Public Law 100-357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102-486, 106 Stat. 2776,
which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer
products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption
that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, Subpart
B.




The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 on September 26, 1980, creating the
waiver process. 45 FR 64108. Thereafter, DOE further amended the appliance test procedure waiver process to allow
the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver
from test procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures.
51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986.

The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily, test procedures for a particular basic model
when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according
to the prescribed test procedures, or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner
so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers
generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is
the subject of the waiver.

The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver when it is
determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver is denied,
if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines that
it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition
for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the
Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary.


On November 29, 1993, Goodman filed an Application for Interim Waiver regarding blower time delay. Goodman's Application
seeks an Interim Waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition of the
burner and starting of the circulating air blower. Instead, Goodman requests the allowance to test using a 30-second
blower time delay when testing its GMPV series central furnaces. Goodman states that the 30-second delay is indicative
of how these furnaces actually operate. Such a delay results in an energy savings of approximately 1.0 percent. Since
current DOE test procedures do not address this variable blower time delay, Goodman asks that the Interim Waiver be
granted.

1992; and Bard Manufacturing Company, 57 FR 53733, November 12, 1992. Thus, it appears likely that the Petition for
Waiver will be granted for blower time delay.
In those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated based upon DOE having
granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested and rated

Therefore, based on the above, DOE is granting Goodman an Interim Waiver for its GMPV series central furnaces. Pursuant
to paragraph (e) of Section 430.27 of the Code of Federal Regulations part 430, the following letter granting the Application
for Interim Waiver to Goodman was issued.
Pursuant to paragraph (b) of 10 CFR part 430.27, DOE is hereby publishing the ``Petition for Waiver'' in its entirety.
The petition contains no confidential information. The Department solicits comments, data, and information respecting
the petition.

Mr. Peter H. Alexander,

Vice President of Engineering,

Goodman Manufacturing Company,

1501 Seamist,

Houston, TX 77008.




Dear Mr. Alexander: This is in response to your November 29, 1993, Application for Interim Waiver and Petition for
Waiver from the Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for Goodman Manufacturing
Company (Goodman) GMPV series central furnaces.

Previous waivers for this type of timed blower delay control have been granted by DOE to Coleman Company, 50 FR 2710,
January 18, 1985; Magic Chef Company, 50 FR 41553, October 11, 1985; Rheem Manufacturing Company, 53 FR 48574, December
1, 1988, 56 FR 2920, January 25, 1991, 57 FR 10166, March 24, 1992, and 57 FR 34560, August 5, 1992; Trane Company, 54 FR
19226, May 4, 1989, 56 FR 6021, February 14, 1991, 57 FR 10167, March 24, 1992, and 57 FR 22222, May 27, 1992; Lennox Industries,
55 FR 50224, December 5, 1990, and 57 FR 49700, November 3, 1992; Inter-City Products Corporation, 55 FR 51487, December
14, 1990, and 56 FR 63945, December 6, 1991; DMO Industries, 56 FR 4622, February 5, 1991; Heil-Quaker Corporation,
56 FR 6019, February 14, 1991; Carrier Corporation, 56 FR 6018, February 14, 1991, and 57 FR 38830, August 27, 1992;
Amana Refrigeration Inc., 56 FR 27958, June 18, 1991, 56 FR 63940, December 6, 1991, and 57 FR 23392, June 3, 1992; Snyder
General Corporation, 56 FR 54960, September 9, 1991; Goodman Manufacturing Corporation, 56 FR 51713, October 15,
1991, and 57 FR 27970, June 23, 1992; The Ducane Company Inc., 56 FR 63943, December 6, 1991, and 57 FR 10163, March 24,
1992; Armstrong Air Conditioning, Inc., 57 FR 899, January 9, 1992, 57 FR 10160, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 10161, March 24,
1992, 57 FR 39193, August 28, 1992, and 57 FR 54230, November 17, 1992; Thermo Products, Inc., 57 FR 903, January 9, 1992;
Consolidated Industries Corporation, 57 FR 22220, May 27, 1992; Evcon Industries, Inc., 57 FR 47847, October 20,
1992; and Bard Manufacturing Company, 57 FR 53733, November 12, 1992. Thus, it appears likely that the Petition for
Waiver will be granted for blower time delay.

Goodman's Application for Interim Waiver does not provide sufficient information to evaluate what, if any, economic
impact or competitive disadvantage Goodman will likely experience absent a favorable determination on its application.
However, in those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated, based upon
DOE having granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested
and rated for energy consumption on a comparable basis.

Therefore, Goodman's Application for an Interim Waiver from the DOE test procedure for its GMPV series central furnaces
regarding blower time delay is granted.

Goodman shall be permitted to test its GMPV series central furnaces on the basis of the test procedures specified in
10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, Appendix N, with the modification set forth below:

(i) Section 3.0 in Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph:

3.0 Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in Section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82 with the
exception of Sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures:

(ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 in Appendix N as follows:

3.10 Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the cool-down test
and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the thermocouple
grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up, delay the
blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t-) unless: (1) The furnace employs a single motor to drive the power burner and the
indoor air circulation blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together; or (2) the furnace is
designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case the fan control shall
be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device which
shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the
fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control is permitted to
start the blower, measure time delay (t-) using a stop watch. Record the measured temperatures. During the heat-up
test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within 

#

 0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft.

This Interim Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements and all allegations submitted by the company.
This Interim Waiver may be removed or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying the
application is incorrect.

The Interim Waiver shall remain in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE acts on the Petition for Waiver, whichever
is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180-day period, if necessary.

Re: Petition for Waiver and Application for Interim Waiver.




Gentlemen: This is a Petition for Waiver and Application for Interim Waiver submitted pursuant to Title 10 CFR 430.27.
Waiver is requested from the test procedure for measuring Furnace Energy Consumption as found in Appendix H to Subpart
B of part 430.

The current test procedure requires a 1.5 minute delay between burner ignition and the start of the circulating air
blower. Goodman Manufacturing Co., L.P. is requesting waiver and authorization to use a 30 second delay instead of
the specified 1.5 minutes for the blower to start after main burner ignition. Goodman Manufacturing intends to use
a fixed timing control on our GMPV series central furnaces to gain additional energy savings that are achieved with
the use of shorter blower on times.

Test data for these furnaces with a 30 second delay indicated an increase in AFUE of 1.0 percentage point. The use of
a 30 second delay reduces the appliance flue losses and therefore increases the furnace efficiency. Copies of confidential
test data confirming this energy savings will be provided to you at your request.

The current test procedure does not give Goodman Manufacturing credit for energy savings that can be obtained using
fixed blower timings. The proposed ASRAE 103-1988 that is under consideration by DOE address the use of timed
blower operation.

Goodman Manufacturing is confident that this Waiver will be granted, and therefore we request an Interim Waiver be
granted until a final ruling is made. Goodman, as well as other manufacturers of domestic furnaces, have been granted
similar waivers.

Manufacturers that domestically market similar products have been sent a copy of this Petition for Waiver and Application
for Interim Waiver.

Notice of Availability of Pollution Prevention Grants and Announcement of Financial Assistance Programs Eligible
for Review 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability of Pollution Prevention Grants.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is announcing the availability of approximately $6 million in FY 94 grant/cooperative agreement funds under
the Pollution Prevention Incentives for States (PPIS) grant program. The purpose of this program is to support State,
Tribal, and regional-based programs that address the reduction or elimination of pollution across all environmental
media: Air, land, and water. Grants/cooperative agreements will be awarded under the authority of the Pollution
Prevention Act of 1990. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background


Since its inception in 1989, approximately $30 million has been awarded to over 100 State, Tribal, and regional organizations
under EPA's multimedia pollution prevention grant program.
In November 1990, the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (the Act) (Pub. L. 101-508) was enacted, establishing as national
policy that pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenever feasible. Section 6603 of the Act defines
source reduction as any practice that:
(i) reduces the amount of any hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant entering any waste stream or otherwise
released into the environment (including fugitive emissions) prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal; and
(ii) reduces the hazards to public health and the environment associated with the release of such substances, pollutants,
or contaminants.
EPA further defines pollution prevention as the use of other practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants
through: increased efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water or other resources, or protection of natural
resources by conservation.
Section 6605 of the Act authorizes EPA to make matching grants to States to promote the use of source reduction techniques
by businesses. In evaluating grant applications, the Act directs EPA to consider whether the proposed State programs
will: 
(1) Make technical assistance available to businesses seeking information about source reduction opportunities,
including funding for experts to provide on-site technical advice and to assist in the development of source reduction
plans. 
(2) Target assistance to businesses for whom lack of information is an impediment to source reduction.
(3) Provide training in source reduction techniques.
In addition to this grant making authority, the Act authorizes EPA to establish a national source reduction clearinghouse,
expands EPA's authority to collect data to better track source reduction activities, and requires EPA to report periodically
to Congress on EPA's progress in implementing the Act. 

II. Availability of FY 94 Funds


With this publication, EPA is announcing the availability of approximately $6 million in grant/cooperative agreement
funds for FY 1994. The Agency has delegated grant authority to the EPA Regional offices which formally transfers the
decisionmaking and awarding process for the PPIS grants to the Regions. Regional offices now assume responsibility
for the solicitation of interest, screening of proposals, and the actual selection of awards. This sixth round of
awards represents a more direct and active Regional role in determining FY '94 awardees. PPIS grant guidance will
be developed separately by each Regional program and will be provided to all applicants along with any supplemental
information the Regions may wish to provide. Interested applicants should contact their Regional Pollution Prevention
Coordinator for more information. 


III. Eligibility


In accordance with the Act, eligible applicants for purposes of funding under this grant program include the 50 States,
the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of
the United States, any agency or instrumentality of a State including State universities and all Federally-recognized
Indian tribes. For convenience, the term ``State'' in this notice refers to all eligible applicants. Local governments,
private universities, private non-profit entities, private businesses, and individuals are not eligible. These
organizations excluded from applying directly are encouraged to work with eligible applicants in developing proposals
that include them as participants in the projects. EPA strongly encourages this type of cooperative arrangement.
1. 

The Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance.

 The number assigned to the PPIS program is 66.900. Organizations receiving pollution prevention grant funds are
required to match Federal funds by at least 50 percent. For example, the Federal government will provide half of the
total allowable cost of the project, the State half of the total allowable cost of the project. A grant request for $100,000
would support a total allowable project cost of $200,000, with the State also providing $100,000. State contributions
may include dollars, in-kind goods and services and/or third party contributions.
2. 

Eligible activities

. In general, the purpose of the PPIS grant program is to support the establishment and expansion of State-, Regional-,
Tribal-, or local-based multimedia pollution prevention programs. EPA specifically seeks to build State pollution
prevention capabilities or to test, at the State level, innovative pollution prevention approaches and methodologies.
Funds awarded under the PPIS grant program must be used to support pollution prevention programs that address the
transfer of potentially harmful pollutants across all environmental media: Air, water, and land. Programs should
reflect comprehensive and coordinated pollution prevention planning and implementation efforts State- or Region-wide
and where approporiate, seek to address State environmental equity issues. States might focus on, for example:
a. Developing other multi-media pollution prevention activities, including but not limited to: Providing direct
technical assistance to businesses; collecting and analyzing data to target outreach and technical assistance
opportunities; conducting outreach activities; developing measures to determine progress in pollution prevention;
and identifying regulatory and non-regulatory barriers and incentives to pollution prevention and developing
plans to implement solutions, where possible.
b. Institutionalizing multi-media pollution prevention as an environmental management priority, establishing
prevention goals, developing strategies to meet those goals, and integrating the pollution prevention ethic within
both governmental and non-governmental institutions of the State or region.
c. Initiating demonstration projects that test and support innovative pollution prevention approaches and methodologies.
Proposals accepted for review under this program must qualify as pollution prevention as defined by section 6603
of the Act. In May of 1992, EPA released a ``Statement of Definition'' as the formal embodiment of the Agency's working
definition of pollution prevention, consistent with the Act. (See ``EPA Statement of Definition'' under unit VI
of this notice.)

V. Media State Grants


Though the PPIS grant program is an instrumental component for building and maintaining State pollution prevention
programs, EPA is seeking to further integrate pollution prevention into the Agency's existing media-specific grant
programs. To this end, States are encouraged to access, where appropriate, media grant dollars to support state pollution
prevention activities. This new Agency policy provides State programs with the opportunity to utilize grant funds,
traditionally targeted for end-of-pipe activities, to support source reduction efforts. In November of 1992, in
support of the Act and to further integrate pollution prevention into the Agency's existing regulatory programs,
EPA released a Guidance for the Integration of Pollution Prevention into Media State Grants. The Agency-wide pollution
prevention Guidance, beginning with the FY 1994 State grants cycle has four goals:
1. Promoting pollution prevention in State programs supported through Federal grants by establishing national
principles to guide workplans negotiated between Regional Offices and States.
2. Ensuring that grant requirements as interpreted by EPA/State workplans are flexible enough to support innovative
State pollution prevention activities.
3. Establishing a simple accounting process to share information on successful State projects, and identify statutory
or other barriers to funding State proposals.
4. Building sustained State capacity in pollution prevention to the extent consistent with statutory grant requirements.
The new Guidance is designed to help integrate pollution prevention into the Agency's activities as required by the
Act. In other words, it will now be possible, as a result of this guidance to use these traditional media State grants
to support pollution prevention purposes. By emphasizing flexibility, the Guidance complements other Agency efforts
to build a productive environmental management system in partnership with the States, and improve coordination
with existing State pollution prevention programs.
EPA's FY 1994 grant programs, in conjunction with the States, should build on the Agency's many successful pollution
prevention efforts to explicitly promote pollution prevention in State workplans (also called agreements). This
Guidance will be incorporated into the annual Agency Operating Guidance as well as program-specific Guidance developed
in conjunction with the State/EPA Operations Committee. Program Guidance, intended to tailor the Agency-wide commitment
to each grant program, will be applied by EPA Regional offices and States in the development of grant-assisted work.
In general, the Guidance applies to all of the Agency's media-specific State grant programs.
For further information, or for a copy of the Guidance, contact Tom McCully, Acting Director, Pollution Prevention
Policy Staff in the Office of the Administrator, at (202) 260-8621, or Lena Hann, Pollution Prevention Division,
at (202) 260-2237. 


VI. Definition of Pollution Prevention


EPA's ``Statement of Definition'' as defined in May of 1992 follows: 


The following EPA ``Statement of Definition'' is a formal embodiment of what has been the Agency's working definition
of pollution prevention, and is consistent with the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990. It makes clear that prevention
is our first priority within an environmental management hierarchy that includes: 1) prevention, 2) recycling,
3) treatment, and 4) disposal or release.
While it is subject to further refinement, this definition should provide a common reference point for all of us. As
you review and apply the definition in your work, please keep the following points in mind:
  As always, whether the pollution prevention option is selected in any given situation will depend on the requirements
of applicable law, the level of risk reduction that can be achieved, and the cost-effectiveness of that option.
 Accordingly, the hierarchy should be viewed as establishing a set of preferences, rather than an absolute
judgment that prevention is always the most desirable option. The hierarchy is applied to many different kinds of
circumstances that will require judgment calls.
 Drawing an absolute line between prevention and recycling can be difficult. ``Prevention'' includes what
is commonly called ``in-process recycling,'' but not ``out-of-process recycling.'' Recycling conducted in an
environmentally sound manner shares many of the advantages of prevention, e.g. energy and resource conservation,
and reducing the need for end-of-pipe treatment or waste containment.
As EPA looks at the ``big picture'' in setting strategic directions for the decade ahead, it is clear that prevention
is key to solving the problems that all our media programs face, including the increasing cost of treatment and cleanup.
In the common-sense words of Benjamin Franklin, ``an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.''
Please keep EPA's definition of pollution prevention in mind as you perform your environmental work. 


POLLUTION PREVENTION: EPA STATEMENT OF DEFINITION 
(pursuant to the Pollution Prevention Act)


Under the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, Congress established a national policy that:
  pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenever feasible;
  pollution that cannot be prevented should be recycled in an environmentally safe manner whenever feasible;
  pollution that cannot be prevented or recycled should be treated in an environmentally safe manner whenever
feasible; and
  disposal or other release into the environment should be employed only as a last resort and should be conducted
in an environmentally safe manner.
Pollution prevention means ``source reduction'', as defined under the Pollution Prevention Act, and other practices
that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants through: 
- increased efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water or other resources, or 
- protection of natural resources by conservation.
The Pollution Prevention Act defines ``source reduction'' to mean any practice which:
- reduces the amount of any hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant entering any waste stream or otherwise
released into the environment (including fugitive emissions) prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal; and
- reduces the hazards to public health and the environment associated with the release of such substances, pollutants
or contaminants.
The term includes: equipment or technology modifications, process or procedure modifications, reformulation
or redesign of products, substitution of raw materials, and improvements in housekeeping, maintenance, training,
or inventory control.
Under the Pollution Prevention Act, recycling, energy recovery, treatment, and disposal are not included within
the definition of pollution prevention. Some practices commonly described as ``in process recycling'' may qualify
as pollution prevention. Recycling that is conducted in an environmentally sound manner shares many of the advantages
of prevention _ it can reduce the need for treatment or disposal, and conserve energy and resources.
Pollution prevention approaches can be applied to all pollution-generating activity: including energy, agriculture,
Federal, consumer as well as industrial sectors. The impairment of wetlands, ground water sources, and other critical
resources constitutes pollution, and prevention practices may be essential for preserving these resources. These
practices may include conservation techniques and changes in management practices to prevent harm to sensitive
ecosystems. Pollution prevention does not include practices that create new risks of concern.
In the agricultural sector, pollution prevention approaches include:
- reducing the use of water and chemical inputs;
- adoption of less environmentally harmful pesticides or cultivation of crop strains with natural resistance
to pests; and
- protection of sensitive areas.
In the energy sector, pollution prevention can reduce environmental damages from extraction, processing, transport
and combustion of fuels. Pollution prevention approaches include:
- increasing efficiency in energy use;
- substituting environmentally benign fuel sources; and
- design changes that reduce the demand for energy.

<DOCTITLE>Receipt of an Application for an Experimental Use Permit for a Transgenic Plant Pesticide </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On October 21, 1993, EPA received an application from Monsanto Company for an Experimental Use Permit (EUP) for a transgenic
plant pesticide. This is the fourth EUP application under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act
for testing with a pesticidal substance that is produced in a plant. The Agency has determined that this application
may be of regional and national significance. Therefore in accordance with 40 CFR 172.11(a), the Agency is soliciting
public comments on this application. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 21, 1993, EPA received an application for an EUP from Monsanto Company, 700 Chesterfield Village Parkway,
St. Louis, Missouri 63198. The application was assigned EPA File Symbol 524-EUP-IE. Monsanto proposes
to test the cryIA(b) 

d

-endotoxin (derived from the soil microbe 

Bacillus thuringiensis

) as expressed in a series of corn lines from March 1, 1994, to February 28, 1995. The amino acid sequence of the 

d

-endotoxin in corn was maintained to be identical to the amino acid sequence produced in 

Bacillus thuringiensis

. However, the nucleotide sequence of the cryIA(b) gene was modified to enhance expression in corn. In addition to
expressing the cryIA(b) 

d

-endotoxin, the majority of the corn lines being evaluated also express the 5-enol-pyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate
(CP4, ESPS) and/or glyphosate oxidoreductase (GOX) proteins which are used as selectable markers and bestow glyphosate
resistance. A minimal number of the cryIA(b) 

d

-endotoxin expressing corn lines expressed neomycin phosphotranferase II (NPTII) as the selectable marker. NPTII
bestows resistance to the common aminoglycoside antibiotics kanamycin, G418, or panomomycin. 


Several small-scale field experiments have been conducted under permits granted by the United States Department
of Agriculture. Larger scale testing is now required in order to further evaluate the performance of the expressed
protein against the European Corn Borer in various geographical areas in which corn is commercially produced. These
experiments include: Isopopulation yield trials, gene efficacy, ECB ecological studies, and various evaluations
of the Bt 

d

-endotoxin corn lines in combination with glyphosate. In addition to experiments related to efficacy, breeding
nursery and seed increase trials are planned. 
Up to 605 acres are proposed for planting with approximately 17,274 pounds of transgenic seed. This amount of seed
will contain approximately 205 grams (dry weight) of the cryIA(b) 

d

-endotoxin. The following States are included in the program: Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana,
Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin, and Puerto Rico. 
No temporary tolerances are being requested relative to the proposed experimental use permit since any reserved
transgenic plant material will be used only for research or future plantings. All other materials will be destroyed.
Professionally qualified Monsanto employees will supervise the program, which will be carried out by public and
private cooperators in addition to professionals at Monsanto test facilities. 
Upon review of the Monsanto application, any comments received in response to this notice and any other relevant information,
EPA will set conditions under which the experiments will be conducted. Any issuance of an EUP will be announced in the


Federal Register

.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Receipt of Requests to Voluntarily Cancel Certain Pesticide Registrations </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with section 6(f)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended,
EPA is issuing a notice of receipt of requests by registrants to voluntarily cancel certain pesticide registrations.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



I. Introduction 



Section 6(f)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended, provides that a
pesticide registrant may, at any time, request that any of its pesticide registrations be cancelled. The Act further
provides that EPA must publish a notice of receipt of any such request in the 

Federal Register

 before acting on the request. 



II. Intent to Cancel 



This notice announces receipt by the Agency of requests to cancel some 21 pesticide products registered under section
3 or 24(c) of FIFRA. These registrations are listed in sequence by registration number (or company number and 24(c)
number) in the following Table 1. 










Unless a request is withdrawn by the registrant within 90 days of publication of this notice, orders will be issued
cancelling all of these registrations. Users of these pesticides or anyone else desiring the retention of a registration
should contact the applicable registrant directly during this 90-day period. The following Table 2 includes
the names and addresses of record for all registrants of the products in Table 1, in sequence by EPA Company Number.









III. Procedures for Withdrawal of Request 



Registrants who choose to withdraw a request for cancellation must submit such withdrawal in writing to James A. Hollins,
at the address given above, postmarked before May 24, 1994. This written withdrawal of the request for cancellation
will apply only to the applicable 6(f)(1) request listed in this notice. If the product(s) have been subject to a previous
cancellation action, the effective date of cancellation and all other provisions of any earlier cancellation action
are controlling. The withdrawal request must also include a commitment to pay any reregistration fees due, and to
fulfill any applicable unsatisfied data requirements. 



IV. Provisions for Disposition of Existing Stocks 



The effective date of cancellation will be the date of the cancellation order. The orders effecting these requested
cancellations will generally permit a registrant to sell or distribute existing stocks for 1-year after the
date the cancellation request was received. This policy is in accordance with the Agency's statement of policy as
prescribed in Federal Register

 No. 123, Vol. 56, dated June 26, 1991. Exceptions to this general rule will be made if a product poses a risk concern,
or is in noncompliance with reregistration requirements, or is subject to a data call-in. In all cases, product-specific
disposition dates will be given in the cancellation orders. Existing stocks are those stocks of registered pesticide
products which are currently in the United States and which have been packaged, labeled, and released for shipment
prior to the effective date of the cancellation action. Unless the provisions of an earlier order apply, existing
stocks already in the hands of dealers or users can be distributed, sold or used legally until they are exhausted, provided
that such further sale and use comply with the EPA-approved label and labeling of the affected product(s). Exceptions
to these general rules will be made in specific cases when more stringent restrictions on sale, distribution, or use
of the products or their ingredients have already been imposed, as in Special Review actions, or where the Agency has
identified significant potential risk concerns associated with a particular chemical.

Closely Related to Banking Standard


Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
``which the Board after due notice and opportunity for hearing has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.'' In determining whether a
proposed activity is closely related to banking for purposes of the BHC Act, the Board considers, 

inter alia

, the matters set forth in 

National Courier Association v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

, 516 F.2d 1229 (D.C. Cir. 1975). These considerations are
(1) Whether banks generally have in fact provided the proposed services,
(2) Whether banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally so similar to the proposed services
as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed services, and
(3) Whether banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed services as to require
their provision in a specialized form. 

See

 516 F.2d at 1237. In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable
or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. 

Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y

, 49 FR 806 (1984).
Applicant states that the Board previously has determined by regulation that certain of the proposed activities,
when conducted within the limitations established by the Board in its regulations and in related interpretations
and orders, are closely related to banking for purposes of section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act.

 12 CFR 225.25(b)(1) (making, acquiring, and servicing loans and other extensions of credit); 12 CFR 225.25(b)(4)
and (15) (certain investment and financial advisory services and discount and full-service brokerage activities);
and 12 CFR 225.25(b)(18) and (19) (certain FCM services and related advisory activities).
Applicant also maintains that the Board previously has determined by order that several of the other proposed activities,
when conducted within the limitations established by the Board in its previous orders, are closely related to banking,
and, where applicable, consistent with section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act (12 U.S.C. 377).

See also

 SR Letter No. 93-27 (FIS) (May 21, 1993) (listing various futures, options, and options on futures contracts previously
approved by order or regulation for FCM services and related advisory activities). 
Applicant maintains that Company will conduct the foregoing, previously approved activities in conformity with
the conditions and limitations established by the Board in prior cases.
Applicant further states that the Board has not previously approved, as closely related to banking within the meaning
of the BHC Act, some or all of the activities described in paragraphs 7, 8, 9(D), 9(E), 9(F), 12, 13, and 15, above. Applicant
maintains, however, that all of these proposed activities are closely related to banking. 
With respect to the proposal for Company to trade for its own account in various futures, options, and options on futures
transactions based on certificates of deposit and other money market instruments eligible for investment by national
banks, Applicant maintains that the Board has previously determined that trading in derivative instruments which
represent the right to purchase or sell bank-eligible securities is closely related to banking. See Swiss Bank Corporation,
77 Federal Reserve Bulletin 759 (1991) (approving such trading for instruments based on U.S. government securities
and certain money market instruments). 
Applicant also proposes that Company trade for its own account, for purposes other than hedging, in futures, options,
and options on futures contracts based on commodity prices and stock, bond, and commodity indexes. With respect to
this aspect of the proposal, Applicant maintains that the New York State Banking Department (NYSBD) and the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) have permitted banks under their respective jurisdictions to engage in these
activities, subject to certain limitations. In this regard, Applicant also states that 
over-the-counter options contracts entered into by Company would represent a form of financial intermediation
of the type in which banks have traditionally engaged. Applicant also maintains that Company's portfolio-wide hedging
methodology is consistent with the limitations the NYSBD and the OCC have placed upon trading in exchange-traded
derivative instruments. Applicant also argues, 

inter alia

, that Company needs to be able to trade in these contracts in order to manage commodity-based risks that may arise from
its dealing in securities of issuers with commodity price exposure.
With respect to the swap-related activities that have not previously been determined to be closely related to banking,
Applicant states that the NYSBD and the OCC have permitted banks under their respective jurisdictions to engage in
commodity-based swap activities, and that the NYSBD has permitted banks to offer swaps linked to financial or economic
indexes. Applicant also states that the Board has recognized, in an interpretation of the Board's Regulation H, that
banks are engaged as principal or broker in swap transactions based on commodity prices, stock and bond indexes, and
hybrids of such indexes and interest rates. 

See

 12 CFR 208.128. In addition, Applicant maintains that these types of swap transactions, like interest rate and currency
swaps, are a form of the financial intermediation services traditionally offered by banks. 
Applicant also proposes that Company and SBC Derivatives engage in FCM activities and provide related advisory services
with respect to futures contracts and options on futures contracts based on commodity prices, bonds, and stock and
bond indexes. Applicant states that the Board has previously determined by order that offering FCM and related advisory
services with respect to certain futures contracts and options on futures contracts based on bonds and stock and bond
indexes is an activity closely related to banking. See generally SR Letter No. 93-27 (FIS) (May 21, 1993) (listing
various futures, options, and options on futures contracts previously approved by order or regulation for FCM services
and related advisory activities). Applicant maintains that the bond- and index-based futures contracts and options
on futures contracts in this proposal which have not previously been approved by the Board are substantially similar
to those which have been so approved. With respect to the proposed instruments based on commodity prices, Applicant
states that the OCC has permitted national banks to execute and clear such contracts. Applicant also maintains that
the reasons justifying Company's trading in such contracts for its own account should apply equally to Company's
and SBC Derivatives' engaging in execution, clearance, and advisory activities with respect to such contracts.
Applicant further states that providing these services with respect to commodity-based contracts is functionally
equivalent to providing such services with respect to financial futures and options on futures contracts. Applicant
also notes that the clearing function of an FCM is a form of extending credit, a primary banking function. 
With respect to its proposal that Company trade for its own account in platinum coin and bullion, Applicant states
that the NYSBD and the OCC have approved this activity for banks under their respective jurisdictions. Applicant
also maintains that the Board has approved under section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act the purchase and sale of platinum coins,
under limited circumstances. 

See Standard Chartered PLC

, 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 681 (1990). Applicant also states that the Board has approved, under Regulation K (12
CFR part 211), trading in platinum by bank holding company subsidiaries located outside the United States. 

See J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated

, 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 552 (1990). 


Proper Incident to Banking Standard


In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by Company
``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition,
or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased
or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8).
Applicant believes that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects.
In particular, Applicant maintains that the proposal will enhance competition and enable Company to offer its customers
a broader range of products. In addition, Applicant states that the proposed activities will not result in adverse
effects such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or
unsound banking practices. In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised
by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues
presented by the application, and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets or is likely
to meet the standards of the BHC Act.
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than March 14, 1994. Any request for
a hearing on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be
accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying
specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing,
and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal. This application may be inspected
at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

<DOCTITLE>Cardinal Bancshares, Inc., Lexington, Kentucky; Application to Engage in Nonbanking Activities</DOCTITLE>


Cardinal Bancshares, Inc., Lexington, Kentucky (Applicant), has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank
Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and section 225.23(a)(3) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR

in securities brokerage activities pursuant to section 225.25(b)(15) of Regulation Y, and to act as riskless principal
in buying and selling in secondary market trading all types of securities on the order of investors. Applicant proposes
that Company enter into an arrangement with Compulife Investor Services, Inc., Richmond, Virginia (Compulife),
whereby joint employees of Company and Compulife will conduct the proposed activities at branches of Applicant's
thrift subsidiary, Mutual Federal Savings Bank, Somerset, Kentucky. These activities will be conducted throughout
the United States.
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
``which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.'' The Board previously has
approved the proposed riskless principal activities, and Applicant has stated that it will conduct these activities
using the same methods and procedures and subject to the prudential limitations established by the Board in its previous
orders.

Agreement Containing Consent Order To Cease and Desist 


In the matter of American Society of Interpreters, a corporation. 



The Federal Trade Commission having initiated an investigation of certain acts and practices of the American Society
of Interpreters, a corporation, and it now appearing that the American Society of Interpreters, hereinafter sometimes
referred to as ``ASI'' or ``proposed respondent,'' is willing to enter into an agreement containing an order to cease
and desist from engaging in certain acts and practices being investigated, 



It is hereby agreed 

by and between ASI, by its duly authorized officer, and its attorney, and counsel for the Federal Trade Commission
that: 

1. ASI is a corporation organized, existing and doing business under and by virtue of the laws of the District of Columbia,
with its offices and principal place of business located at Washington, DC. 

2. ASI admits all the jurisdictional facts set forth in the draft of complaint here attached. 

3. ASI waives: 
(a) Any further procedural steps; 
(b) The requirement that the Commission's decision contain a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law;

(c) All rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity of the order entered pursuant
to this agreement; and 
(d) Any claim under the Equal Access to Justice Act. 
4. This agreement shall not become part of the public record of the proceeding unless and until it is accepted by the
Commission. If this agreement is accepted by the Commission, it, together with the draft of complaint contemplated
thereby, will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days and information in respect thereto publicly
released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify proposed
respondent, in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint
(in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision in disposition of the proceeding. 

5. This agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by ASI that the law has been violated
as alleged in the draft of complaint here attached. 

6. This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such acceptance is not subsequently
withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of  2.34 of the Commission's Rules, the Commission may,
without further notice to proposed respondent, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance with
the draft of complaint here attached and its decision containing the following order to cease and desist in disposition
of the proceeding, and (2) make information public in respect thereto. When so entered, the order to cease and desist
shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified or set aside in the same manner and within the same time
provided by statute for other orders. The order shall become final upon service. Delivery by the U.S. Postal Service
of the complaint and decision containing the agreed-to order to proposed respondent's address as stated in this agreement
shall constitute service. Proposed respondent waives any right it may have to any other manner of service. The complaint
may be used in construing the terms of the order, and no agreement, understanding, representation, or interpretation
not contained in the order or the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the terms of the order. 

7. Proposed respondent has read the proposed complaint and order contemplated hereby. It understands that once the
order has been issued, it will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing that it has fully complied
with the order. Proposed respondent further understands that it may be liable for civil penalties in the amount provided
by law for each violation of the order after the order becomes final.

[Date]



Announcement



The American Society of Interpreters (``ASI'') has entered into a consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission.
Pursuant to this consent agreement, the Commission issued an order on [Date] that prohibits ASI, including its chapters,
committees, or organizational subdivisions, from:

(1) Creating, distributing, authorizing, or endorsing any list or schedule of fees or other charges for interpretation,
translation, or other language services;

or otherwise interfere with the fees or other charges for interpretation, translation, or other language services;

(3) Suggesting, recommending, or encouraging, in any way, interpreters, translators, or other language specialists
that charge, adhere to, or refrain from charging any existing or proposed fee;

(4) For a period of ten (10) years after the date this order becomes final, continuing a meeting after (a) Any person

makes two such statements and ASI fails to eject him or her from the meeting, or (c) two people make such statements;

(5) Prohibiting, restricting, regulating, or advising against any form of price competition among its members or

(6) Discouraging, restricting, or prohibiting interpreters, translators, or other language specialists from

In addition, the order prohibits ASI from maintaining any agreement, understanding, plan or program to:

work in a given period, or for which they are paid for preparation or study; or

(2) Limit, restrict, or mandate the number of interpreters, translators, or other language specialists hired for
a job or type of job.

Under the order, ``fees'' are defined to include all cash or non-cash charges, rates, benefits, or other compensation
for interpretation, translation or other language services, including but not limited to, lodging, meals, subsistence
and travel allowances, reimbursements for expenses, cancellation fees, and compensation for time not worked, travel
time or briefing time. ``Language specialist'' means one who performs ``other language services,'' which are defined
to refer to any services that involve the conversion of any form of expression from one language into another or any
services incident to or related to interpretation and translation. Consequently, when the order mentions ``language
specialists,'' it includes anyone who rents equipment, organizes conferences, performs teleconferencing or pr&eacute;cis
writing, supervises or coordinates interpreters, reviews or revises translations, or provides recordings of interpretations.

Further, under the order, ASI must amend its Code of Professional Standards, Professional Guidelines, and Yearbook
Professional Guidelines to conform to the requirements of Paragraphs II and IV of the attached order, which are summarized
above. ASI must also amend its bylaws to require each member, chapter, and organizational subdivision to observe
the requirements of the order. In addition, the order requires ASI to provide to its members and affiliates and to the
Federal Trade Commission the text of each amendment to the ASI Bylaws, the ASI Code of Professional Standards, and
all ASI Professional Guidelines, including those found in the ASI Membership Lists, and the texts of any new rules,
regulations or guidelines. The order also requires that, within thirty days after obtaining them, ASI must provide
to the Federal Trade Commission copies of all lists of fees that have been produced by any associations and come into
ASI's possession.

We note, however, that ASI will be permitted to compile and distribute accurate aggregate historical market information
concerning past fees that were actually charged no earlier than three years after this order becomes final, if presented
in an unbiased and nondeceptive manner that maintains the anonymity of the parties to the transactions underlying
such reports. Similarly, the order does not prohibit ASI from collecting and publishing accurate publicly available
information on fees paid by governmental and intergovernmental agencies if such publication states the qualifications
and requirements for such fees. With any publication of fees permitted by the order, ASI must include a statement that
it is prohibited from recommending fees and that interpreters must independently determine their own fees. In addition,
the order states that it does not prohibit ASI from providing information or its nonbinding and non-coercive views
concerning the hours of work or preparation or the number of language specialists used for a type of job.

For more specific information, members should refer to the FTC order itself, which is enclosed.

Agreement Containing Consent Order To Cease and Desist



In the Matter of the American Association of Language Specialists, a corporation.




The Federal Trade Commission having initiated an investigation of certain acts and practices of The American Association
of Language Specialists, a corporation, and it now appearing that The American Association of Language Specialists,
hereinafter sometimes referred to as ``TAALS'' or ``proposed respondent,'' is willing to enter into an agreement
containing an order to cease and desist from engaging in certain acts and practices being investigated,



It is hereby agreed

 by and between TAALS, by its duly authorized officer, and its attorney, and counsel for the Federal Trade Commission
that:

1. TAALS is a corporation organized, existing and doing business under and by virtue of the laws of the District of Columbia,
with its offices and principal place of business located at 1000 Connecticut Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20036.

2. TAALS admits all the jurisdictional facts set forth in the draft of complaint here attached.

3. TAALS waives:

(a) Any further procedural steps;

(b) The requirement that the Commission's decision contain a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law;

(c) All rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity of the order entered pursuant
to this agreement; and

(d) Any claim under the Equal Access to Justice Act.

4. This agreement shall not become part of the public record of the proceeding unless and until it is accepted by the
Commission. If this agreement is accepted by the Commission, it, together with the draft of complaint contemplated
thereby, will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days and information in respect thereto publicly
released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify proposed
respondent, in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint
(in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision in disposition of the proceeding.

5. This agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by TAALS that the law has been
violated as alleged in the draft of complaint here attached.

6. This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such acceptance is not subsequently
withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of  2.34 of the Commission's Rules, the Commission may,
without further notice to proposed respondent, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance with
the draft of complaint here attached and its decision containing the following order to cease and desist in disposition
of the proceeding, and (2) make information public in respect thereto. When so entered, the order to cease and desist
shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified or set aside in the same manner and within the same time
provided by statute for other orders. The order shall become final upon service. Delivery by the U.S. Postal Service
of the complaint and decision containing the agreed-to order to proposed respondent's address as stated in this agreement
shall constitute service. Proposed respondent waives any right it may have to any other manner of service. The complaint
may be used in construing the terms of the order, and no agreement, understanding, representation, or interpretation
not contained in the order or the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the terms of the order.

7. Proposed respondent has read the proposed complaint and order contemplated hereby. It understands that once the
order has been issued, it will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing that it has fully complied
with the order. Proposed respondent further understands that it may be liable for civil penalties in the amount provided
by law for each violation of the order after the order becomes final.

Trade Commission. Pursuant to this consent agreement, the Commission issued an order on [Date] that prohibits TAALS,
including its chapters, committees, or organizational subdivisions, from:

(1) Creating, distributing, authorizing, or endorsing any list or schedule of fees or other charges for interpretation,
translation, or other language services;

(2) Entering into, or maintaining any agreement, plan, or program, to construct, fix, stabilize, raise, maintain,
or otherwise interfere with fees or other charges for interpretation, translation, or other language services;

(3) Suggesting, recommending, or encouraging, in any way, that interpreters, translators, or other language specialists
charge, adhere to, or refrain from charging any existing or proposed fee;

(4) For a period of ten (10) years after this order becomes final, continuing a meeting after (1) Any person makes any
statement to the body of the meeting concerning the fees charged or proposed to be charged for interpretation, translation,
or any other language service and TAALS fails to declare such statement to be out of order, (2) any person makes two such
statements and TAALS fails to eject him or her from the meeting, or (3) two people make such statements;

(5) Prohibiting, restricting, regulating, or advising against any form of price competition among its members or
other interpreters, translators, or other language specialists, including undercutting a competitor's actual
fee or a customer's announced fee, advertising discounted rates, or accepting any particular lodging or travel arrangements;

(6) Advising against, restricting, or prohibiting interpreters, translators, or other language specialists from
accepting hourly fees, weekly fees, or fees calculated or payable on other than a full-day basis;

(7) Advising against, restricting, or prohibiting interpreters, translators, or other language specialists from
performing services free of charge or from paying their own travel, lodging, meals, or other expenses; or

(8) Prohibiting, restricting, impeding, declaring unethical, or advising against any forms of personal publicity,
including but not limited to advertising by interpreters, translators, or other language specialists.

In addition, the order prohibits TAALS from maintaining any agreement, understanding, plan or program to:

(1) Limit, restrict, or mandate the length of time that interpreters, translators, or other language specialists
work in a given period, or for which they are paid for preparation or study;

(2) Limit, restrict, or mandate the number of interpreters, translators, or other language specialists used for
a job or type of job;

(3) Limit, restrict, or mandate the payment or reimbursement for travel or the travel time of interpreters, translators,
or other language specialists, or otherwise prevent consumers from receiving any advantages, based on travel arrangements
or geographic location, by regulating domiciles of members or by other means; or

(4) Limit, restrict, or mandate the equipment used in performing interpretation, translation, or other language
services.

Under the order, ``fees'' are defined to include all cash or non-cash charges, rates, benefits, or other compensation
for interpretation, translation or other language services, including but not limited to, lodging, meals, subsistence
and travel allowances, reimbursements for expenses, cancellation fees, and compensation for time not worked, travel
time or briefing time. ``Language specialist'' means one who performs ``other language services,'' which are defined
to refer to any services that involve the conversion of any form of expression from one language into another or any
services incident to or related to interpretation and translation. Consequently, when the order mentions ``language
specialists,'' it includes anyone who rents equipment, organizes conferences, performs teleconferencing or pr&eacute;cis
writing, supervises or coordinates interpreters, reviews or revises translations, or provides recordings of interpretations.

Further, under the order, TAALS must amend its professional code to conform to the requirements of paragraphs II and
IV of the attached order, which are summarized above. TAALS must also amend its bylaws to require each member, chapter,
and organizational subdivision to observe the requirements of the order. In addition, the order requires TAALS to
provide to the Federal Trade Commission the text of each amendment to the TAALS Bylaws, Professional Code or Working
Conditions, and the text of any new rules, regulations or guidelines.

We note, however, that the order does not prevent TAALS from adopting and enforcing reasonable ethical guidelines
prohibiting advertising that would be false or deceptive within the meaning of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission
Act. In addition, TAALS will be permitted to compile and distribute accurate aggregate historical market information
concerning past fees that were actually charged no earlier than three years after this order becomes final, if presented
in an unbiased and nondeceptive manner that maintains the anonymity of the parties to the transactions underlying
such reports. Similarly, the order does not profit TAALS from collecting and publishing accurate publicly available
information on fees paid by governmental and intergovernmental agencies if such publication states the qualifications
and requirements for such fees. With any publication of fees permitted by the order, TAALS must include a statement
that it is prohibited from recommending fees applicable in the United States and that interpreters must independently
determine their own fees. In addition, the order states that it does not prohibit TAALS from providing information
or its nonbinding and noncoercive views concerning interpretation equipment, the hours of work or preparation,
or the number of language specialists used for a type of job.

For some specific information, members should refer to the order itself, which is enclosed.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Orders To Aid Public Comment 



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted separate agreements to proposed consent orders from the American Society
of Interpreters (ASI) and The American Association of Language Specialists (TAALS). 

The proposed consent orders have been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreements and comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreements
or make final the agreements' proposed orders. 

ASI and TAALS are professional associations of conference interpreters. The accompanying complaints allege that
both TAALS and ASI have been and are acting as combinations or conspiracies of their members to restrain price and other
forms of competition in the sale of interpretation services. In particular, the complaint against ASI charges that
from as early as 1967, that association annually created and distributed a list of minimum daily fees that members
were required to charge. The complaint against TAALS alleges that since 1973, TAALS required its members to refrain
from accepting private sector fees below those adopted by vote of the association and then specified in the Fee Reports
sent to members. In addition, the complaints allege that both ASI and TAALS have maintained a set of work rules binding
on all of their members requiring, among other things, that all interpreters on a team be paid the same rate; that fees
be paid in day-long increments; and that members charge for travel, rest, and study days. The complaints further allege
that the binding work rules required, among other things, that interpreters work no more than six hours per day and
that teams be staffed with a specified number of interpreters. The TAALS complaint also alleges that TAALS established
rules limiting its members' use of portable electronic simultaneous interpretation equipment and prohibited its
members from engaging in all forms of personal publicity and advertising. The TAALS complaint further alleges that
TAALS required members to declare a single professional domicile and charge for travel expenses from that location
even if no travel was actually involved. The complaints allege that TAALS' and ASI's lists of fees and work rules restrained
competition in violation of section 5 of the FTC Act, and that absent the proposed consent orders, injury to the public
will continue. 

The proposed consent orders prohibit ASI and TAALS, including their chapters, committees, and any other subdivision,
from creating, distributing, or endorsing any list of fees for interpretation, translation, or other language services.
They also forbid each of the associations from entering into or maintaining any agreement, plan, or program, to fix
or otherwise interfere with fees. In addition, TAALS and ASI are barred from recommending or encouraging, in any way,
interpreters, translators, or other language specialists to charge, adhere to, or refrain from charging any existing
or proposed fee. 

Under the orders, for a period of ten years ASI and TAALS are required to declare out-of-order any person who makes a
statement at a meeting concerning fees to be charged. If any person makes two such statements, the association must
eject him or her from the meeting. If two people make statements concerning fees, TAALS or ASI must end the meeting.


Under the orders, ASI and TAALS are further barred from prohibiting, regulating, or advising against any form of price
competition, including undercutting a competitor's actual fee, advertising discounted fees, or accepting any
particular lodging or travel arrangements. The orders also bar TAALS and ASI from advising against or prohibiting
hourly fees, weekly fees, or fees calculated on other than a full-day basis. Furthermore, under the orders, the associations
cannot prohibit interpreters, translators, or other language specialists from performing services free of charge
or from paying their own travel, lodging, meals, or other expenses.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940223-2-00058 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940223-2-00035 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, the orders prohibit both ASI and TAALS from maintaining any agreement, understanding, plan or program
to limit, restrict, or mandate the length of time that interpreters, translators, or other language specialists
work in a given period, or for which they are paid for preparation or study. Further, under the orders the associations
cannot maintain any agreement, understanding, or program to limit, restrict, or mandate the number of interpreters,
translators, or other language specialists hired for a job or type of job. 

In addition to the restrictions they both share, the TAALS order prohibits further activities not addressed in the
ASI order. TAALS may not limit or mandate the equipment used for performing interpretation, translation, or other
language services. TAALS is also barred from restricting, regulating, or declaring unethical any form of personal
publicity, including advertising. Finally, TAALS may not deprive consumers of any advantages, based on travel arrangements
or geographic location, by regulating domiciles of members or by other means. 

Under both orders, ``fees'' are defined to include all cash or non-cash charges, rates, benefits, or other compensation.
Thus, the term ``fees'' includes (but is not limited to): Lodging, meals, subsistence and travel allowances, reimbursements
for expenses, cancellation charges, and compensation for time not worked, travel time or briefing time. ``Language
specialist'' means one who performs ``other language services,'' which are defined as any services that involve
the conversion of any form of expression from one language into another or any services incident to or related to interpretation
and translation. Consequently, when the orders mention ``language specialists,'' they include, among others,
anyone who rents equipment, organizes conferences, performs teleconferencing or precis writing, supervises or
coordinates interpreters, reviews or revises translations, or provides recordings of interpretations. 

Further, ASI must amend its Code of Professional Standards, Professional Guidelines, and Yearbook Professional
Guidelines to conform to the requirements of the order, which are summarized above. TAALS must amend its Professional
Code for Language Specialists and all appendices to conform to the requirements of its order. Both associations must
also amend their bylaws to require each member, chapter, and organizational subdivision to observe the requirements
of the respective orders. In addition, the orders require the associations to provide to their members and affiliates
and to the Federal Trade Commission the text of each amendment to their bylaws, and the taxes of any new or amended rules,
regulations or guidelines. The ASI order also requires that, within thirty days after obtaining them, ASI must provide
to the Federal Trade Commission copies of all lists of fees produced by any association that come into ASI's possession.


We note, however, that TAALS and ASI will be permitted to compile and distribute accurate aggregate historical market
information concerning past fees that were actually charged in transactions completed no earlier than three years
after the orders become final. Such information must be presented in an unbiased and nondeceptive manner that maintains
the anonymity of the parties to the transactions. Similarly, the orders permit the associations to collect and publish
accurate publicly available information on fees paid by governmental and intergovernmental agencies, if the publication
states the qualifications and requirements to receive such fees. Whenever they publish the fees that are permitted
by the orders, ASI and TAALS must include a statement that they are prohibited from recommending fees and that interpreters
must independently determine their own fees. In addition, the orders authorize the associations to provide information
or their nonbinding and noncoercive views concerning the hours of work or preparation or the number of language specialists
used for a type of job. 

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed orders, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreements and proposed orders or to modify in any way their terms.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment



Columbia Hospital Corp. (Docket No. 9256) 



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted, subject to final approval, an agreement to a proposed consent order from
Columbia Healthcare Corporation, successor to respondent Columbia Hospital Corporation (hereinafter collectively
``Columbia''). The agreement would settle charges by the Federal Trade Commission that Columbia's proposed acquisition
of Medical Center Hospital, in Punta Gorda, Florida, violated section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and would
also have violated section 7 of the Clayton Act if it had been carried out.

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or issue and serve the agreement's proposed order.



The Complaint



The Commission issued an administrative complaint against Columbia Hospital Corp. on February 18, 1993. According
to the complaint, Columbia operates Fawcett Memorial Hospital, a general acute care hospital in Port Charlotte,
Florida, and related health care facilities. Columbia agreed to acquire Medical Center Hospital, a general acute
care hospital in Punta Gorda, Florida, about five miles south of Port Charlotte. The complaint alleges that Fawcett
and Medical Center were competitors in the market for acute care inpatient hospital services in an area including
all but the westernmost portions of Charlotte County, Florida, plus adjacent portions of DeSoto and Sarasota Counties
in Florida. That market, according to the complaint, was already highly concentrated, and entry by new competitors
would be difficult. The complaint charged that if Columbia carried out its agreement to acquire Medical Center, the
effect of that acquisition would be substantially to lessen competition in the Charlotte County area hospital market,
in violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and section 7 of the Clayton Act.

The proposed acquisition challenged in the administrative complaint was never completed. After the Commission
issued the complaint, the proposed acquisition was preliminarily enjoined by a Federal court, pursuant to section
13(b) of the FTC Act. 

Federal Trade Commission 

v.

 Columbia Hospital Corp., 

93-30-Civ-FTM-23D (M.D. Fla., injunction issued May 21, 1993). The court's injunction prohibiting
the acquisition will remain in effect until the Commission gives final approval to the proposed consent order, or
until the Commission's administrative proceeding against Columbia is otherwise concluded.

The Proposed Consent Order



The first paragraph of the proposed order defines certain other terms used in the order.

Paragraph II would prohibit Columbia from acquiring, without the prior approval of the Federal Trade Commission,
all or any significant part of a general acute care hospital in the ``Charlotte Country area'' (an area including most
of Charlotte County, Florida, and some adjacent portions of DeSoto and Sarasota Counties in Florida). It would also
prohibit Columbia from transferring, without prior Commission approval, any general hospital or significant part
thereof it operates in that area to another person operating (or simultaneously acquiring) a general hospital in
the area. These provisions would give the Commission authority to prohibit any substantial combination of the general
acute care hospital operations of Columbia with those of any non-Columbia general hospital in the Charlotte County
area, unless Columbia convinced the Commission that a particular transaction would not endanger competition in
the Charlotte County area hospital market.

Paragraph III would require Columbia to provide advance notice to the Commission of joint ventures with non-Columbia
hospitals for the establishment of new hospital facilities or services in the Charlotte County area. This Paragraph
would not apply to transactions subject to the prior approval requirement of Paragraph II, or to the Clayton Act's
premerger notification requirements.

Both Paragraph II and Paragraph III would not cover acquisitions and joint ventures where the value of the acquired
assets, or the assets contributed to a joint venture by participants other than Columbia, is $1 million or less. Nor
would Paragraph III apply to joint ventures between Columbia and non-Columbia hospitals that are limited to the provision
of certain specified hospital support services (such as laundry or laboratory testing) or the establishment of new
health plans (such as health maintenance organizations). In addition, Paragraphs II and III would both expire ten
years after the order becomes final.

Paragraph IV of the proposed order would prohibit, for ten years, Columbia from transferring any hospital in the Charlotte
County area to any other person without first filing with the Commission an agreement by the transferee to be bound
by the order. Paragraphs V and VI of the proposed order would require Columbia to make annual reports to the Federal
Trade Commission, and to make certain documents and personnel available to the Commission upon request, so the Commission
may verify compliance with the order. Finally, Paragraph VII of the proposed order would require Columbia to notify
the Commission at least thirty days before any proposed change in corporate structure that may affect compliance
with the order.

The purpose of this analysis is to invite public comment concerning the proposed order, in order to assist the Commission
in its determination whether to make the order final. This analysis is not intended to constitute an official interpretation
of the agreement and order or to modify their terms in any way.

The agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by the respondent that its proposed
acquisition violated or would have violated the law, as alleged in the Commission's complaint.

Separate Statement of Commissioner Mary L. Azcuenaga Concurring in Part and Dissenting in Part in Columbia Hospital
Corporation, Docket 9256



I concur in the decision to publish the proposed consent agreement for comment, but I would have preferred that the
proposed order require Columbia to provide notice of acquisitions outside the relevant market. Prior notice can
be useful, the Commission has required such relief in other litigated hospital merger cases, see, 

e.g., Hospital Corporation of America, 

106 F.T.C. 361, 524 (1985), 

aff'd, 

807 F.2d 1381 (7th Cir. 1986), 

cert. denied, 

107 S. Ct. 1975 (1987), and there is no apparent reason for granting more favorable treatment to this respondent.

Proposed consent agreement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would prohibit, among other things, a Pennsylvania
company from misrepresenting the amount of nutrients or other ingredients in its eggs or foods containing egg yolks,
and would require the respondent to have competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate future health-benefit
claims for such foods and, for one year, to label certain egg packages with a corrective notice stating that no studies
show Eggland's eggs are different from other eggs in their effect on serum cholesterol.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment


The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Eggland's Best, Inc. (``Eggland's'').
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed order.
This matter concerns claims made by Eggland's in its advertising and promotional materials for eggs.
The Commission's complaint in this matter charges Eggland's with engaging in unfair or deceptive practices in connection
with the advertising of its eggs. According to the complaint, Eggland's falsely represented that it had a reasonable
basis for claims that eating its eggs will not increase serum cholesterol in an absolute sense and that eating its eggs
will not increase serum cholesterol as much as eating ordinary eggs.
The complaint also alleges that Eggland's falsely represented that clinical studies have proven that adding twelve
Eggland's eggs per week to a low-fat diet does not cause an increase in serum cholesterol.
Finally, the complaint alleges that Eggland's falsely represented that its eggs are both low in saturated fat in an
absolute sense, and are lower in saturated fat than ordinary eggs.
The consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent Eggland's from engaging
in similar deceptive and unfair acts and practices in the future.
Part I of the order prohibits Eggland's from misrepresenting the absolute or comparative amount of cholesterol,
total fat, saturated fat or any other nutrient or ingredient in eggs or in any food containing egg yolk.
Part II of the order prohibits Eggland's from making any claims about the absolute or comparative effect on serum cholesterol
of eggs or any food containing egg yolk unless, prior to making such claims. Eggland's has competent and reliable scientific
evidence to substantiate the claims. This requirement applies to claims about the effect of such foods on serum cholesterol
when consumed either as part of a regular, unrestricted diet or as part of a specific dietary regimen, for instance,
a low-fat diet. Part II of the order also provides that representations that would be specifically permitted in food
labeling, under regulations issued by the Food and Drug Administration (``FDA'') pursuant to the Nutrition and Labeling
Education Act of 1990 (``NLEA''), will be deemed to be adequately substantiated.
Part III of the order prohibits Eggland's from making any claims about the health benefits, including the effect on
heart disease, of eggs or food containing egg yolk unless, prior to making such claims, England's has competent and
reliable scientific evidence to substantiate the claims. This requirement applies to claims about both the absolute
and comparative health benefits associated with consuming such foods. Like Part II, this Part provides that claims
specifically permitted in food labeling, under regulations issued by FDA pursuant to the NLEA, will be deemed to be
adequately substantiated.
Part IV of the order prohibits Eggland's from misrepresenting the existence, contents, validity, results, conclusions
or interpretations of any test or study.
Part V.A of the order requires a clear and prominent disclosure of the cholesterol content of eggs or any food containing
egg yolk, in any advertisement or promotional material that references the absolute or comparative amount of cholesterol,
fat or saturated fat in such food. This disclosure of cholesterol content must be expressed both in terms of the number
of milligrams and as a percentage of the ``Maximum Daily Value'' for cholesterol intake as established by FDA or other
specified organizations. Part V.A exempts from this disclosure requirement any representation that is specifically
permitted in food labeling under regulations issued by FDA pursuant to the NLEA.
Part V.B of the Order requires Eggland's to include a clear and prominent notice on the package label for its eggs that
``There are no studies showing that these eggs are different from other eggs in their effect on serum cholesterol.''
This corrective notice requirement applies for a period of one year beginning forty-five (45) days from the date the
order becomes final in those geographic areas where Eggland's disseminated advertising or promotional materials
discussing the effect of its eggs on serum cholesterol either for a period of twelve (12) weeks or more, or at any time
between January 1, 1993 and to the date of the acceptance of this order by the Commission for public comment.
Part V also includes various specific provisions as to what constitutes a clear and prominent disclosure and corrective
notice for purposes of this order.

Separate Statement of Commissioner Mary L. Azcuenaga, Concurring in Part and Dissenting in Part, in Eggland's Best,
Inc., File No. 932-3000



The Commission today accepts for public comment a consent agreement settling charges that Eggland's Best made deceptive
advertising claims about its eggs. I agree that there is reason to believe that these claims were deceptive and join
in approving the order except for  V.B. I do not agree that the corrective advertising provision contained in
 V.B. is warranted, and I dissent from the order to that extent.

In imposing a corrective advertising remedy, the Commission must consider whether an advertisement has played a
substantial role in creating in the public's mind a false belief about a product that will linger on after the false
advertisement ceases. 

Warner-Lambert Co. 

v. 

FTC, 

562 F.2d 749, 762 (D.C. Cir. 1977), 

cert. denied, 

435 U.S. 950 (1978). Corrective advertising is intended to dissipate the lingering effects of a deceptive advertisement
so that future advertisements do not become part of a continuing deception of the public. 

Id. 

at 769.

Here, there is no direct evidence, such as the consumer surveys and expert testimony in 

Warner Lambert Co., 

that Eggland's Best's advertisements created a lingering false impression about the effects on serum cholesterol
of its eggs. Given the relatively short period of time during which Eggland's Best's advertisements were run, it seems
unlikely that any such lingering false impression has been created. Without a stronger showing of the need for corrective
advertising under the 

Warner-Lambert 

test, I cannot support including a corrective advertising provision in the proposed order.

Statement of Commissioner Deborah K. Owen, Concurring in Part and Dissenting in Part, in Eggland's Best Inc., File
No. 932-3000 



I concur in the Commission's decision to issue a complaint, and to provisionally accept a consent agreement in this
matter, except as to section V.B. of the Order. With respect to that Section, which requires corrective advertising,
I dissent. 

The seminal case on corrective advertising is the Listerine case, 

Warner-Lambert Company,

 86 F.T.C. 1398 (1975), where the Commission opined: 

 


[I]f a deceptive advertisement has played a substantial role in creating or reinforcing in the public's mind a false
and material belief which lives on after the false advertising ceases, there is clear and continuing injury to competition
and to the consuming public as consumers continue to make purchasing decisions based on the false belief. Since this
injury cannot be avoided by merely requiring respondent to cease disseminating the advertisement, we may appropriately
order respondent to take affirmative action designed to terminate the otherwise continuing ill effects of the advertisement.


 


86 F.T.C. at 1499-1500. 



As the complaint alleges, Eggland's ads, in my judgment, certainly create a false impression that its eggs will not
increase serum cholesterol, or, comparatively, increase cholesterol as much as ordinary eggs. However, we must
also find that the beliefs created by the challenged ads are likely to linger after the deceptive advertising ceases.
As to that likelihood, it seems to me important to compare and contrast the facts in 

Warner-Lambert

 to the situation here. 

In 

Warner-Lambert,

 decided in 1975, the Commission noted that the challenged advertising claims had been made directly to the consuming
public since 1921, and involved expenditures of large sums in print and television media. 86 F.T.C. at 1501. The Commission
cited to the ALJ's Findings of Fact, which noted that Listerine had made the contested representations since the product
went on the market almost a century before; that cold and sore throat claims had been made continuously on its labelling
since prior to 1938; and that over the ten years preceding the decision, Listerine had spent several million dollars
on its colds advertising, the vast majority occurring on network and spot television, covering all parts of the day
and evening and particularly in network prime time. 

Id.

 at 1468 (IDFF 219-220); see also 

id.

 at 1407-1408 (IDFF 5-8). The Commission pointed to record testimony indicating the high percentage of
consumers taking such claims that would remain as long as five years after the ads ended. It concluded: ``The record
demonstrates that 

long

 after Listerine cold efficacy advertising ceased, a 

substantial

 proportion of the public would continue to believe in Listerine's efficacy for the treatment and prevention of colds
and sore throats.'' 

Id.

 at 1503 (emphasis supplied). 

If we contrast the length in time, and the magnitude of Listerine's advertising to the instant case, Eggland's advertising
would hardly appear to rise to even a two-digit percentage thereof. We have no evidence that Eggland's campaign was
so similarly saturated and extended that 

long

 after it ceases, a 

substantial

 portion of the public will continue to believe the challenged claims in the absence of the corrective advertising
that the Commission has provisionally accepted. Moreover, one significant factor is in evidence here that was not
present in the Listerine case: the barrage of contrary information to which the public is exposed. 

While the public received little, if any, information from sources other than the advertiser about the true effect
of Listerine on colds and sore throats, the vast majority of information available to consumers challenges the Eggland
claims, and links egg consumption with increased serum cholesterol. Articles in the popular press, television and
radio programs, and many cookbooks recommend that consumers lower their consumption of eggs. Doctors and the American
Heart Association advise people to limit their egg consumption for health reasons. The general ambient information
and perception is that eggs are unhealthy, and this climate is highly relevant in determining whether the false beliefs
created by Eggland's Best advertisements will likely linger. Eggland's Best advertisements attempted to counteract
the common wisdom, but ran for only a short time. Because the information that eating eggs is likely to increase serum
cholesterol will continue to be widely disseminated to consumers through media sources, it is unlikely that the false
beliefs regarding the effects of Eggland's Best eggs on serum cholesterol, or their comparative benefits to other
eggs, will be maintained. In sum, the half-life of Eggland's advertising campaign is probably very short. 

This is not to suggest, however, that corrective advertising is only appropriate where the ad campaign is decades-old
and swamps the public. A classic opportunity for appropriately imposing the remedy was the 

Sun Company

 case two years ago. File No. 902-3268. There, the Commission challenged claims linking octane and automobile
engine performance made by a company that was previously under a Commission order for earlier false performance and
uniqueness claims for its gasoline. 

Sun Oil Co.,

 84 F.T.C. 247 (1974). Nonetheless, the Commission agreed to merely a cease-and-desist order, despite the fact that
the challenged claims took advantage of, and further contributed to, widespread consumer misperception about the
relationship between octane and performance. The contrast between the Commission's decision there, and here, suggests
that the Commission's current posture on corrective advertising may be more a function of respondents' willingness
to agree to the remedy, rather than of a well defined and implemented policy.

<TEXT>
 

Finally, a comment on the remedy itself. The corrective advertising is ordered to be placed on Eggland's Best carton
label. Due to other legal limitations, Eggland's Best has not made serum cholesterol or heart health claims on the
carton. Thus, while the attempt to limit the breadth of the remedy may be well-intentioned, I find it highly ironic
that corrective advertising has been mandated in a medium where the original deceptive claims were never made. 



Statement of Roscoe B. Starek, III, in Eggland's Best, Matter No. 932-3000 



After very careful deliberation, I have decided to support the corrective advertising provision in this order. I
arrived at this decision somewhat reluctantly, since I think this remedy should be used sparingly. The appeals court
decision in 

Warner-Lambert

 accords the Commission substantial discretion in applying such a remedy.
 The Commission must take great care, however, to exercise such broad discretion judiciously. Thus, the question
I had to answer was whether corrective advertising is appropriate in the absence of an extended period of deceptive
advertising or extrinsic evidence demonstrating that the false impressions will persist in consumers' minds after
the ads cease.
 






I have determined that a limited corrective advertising requirement is an appropriate remedy here. First, I have
reason to believe that the Eggland's ads have created in consumers' minds enduring false impressions about these
eggs. Because Eggland's is able to charge for its eggs about 200% of the typical price per dozen, we have strong evidence
that the company's ads have been successful in creating in the minds of their consumers a belief that their eggs are
meaningfully superior to other eggs. Second, the superiority touted by Eggland's ads_ads disseminated as recently
as two months ago_pertains to their effect on serum cholesterol. Common sense tells me that this belief is not going
to disappear overnight, simply because advertising making that claim ceases. Third, consumers who continued to
believe that Eggland's had a demonstrated superiority over typical eggs would suffer an identifiable injury, again
due to the price differential. Corrective advertising placed on the egg package would enable consumers to avoid further
injury. 


Finally, I am persuaded by the careful crafting of the corrective remedy. In my view, corrective advertising should
educate, not punish. The instant notice is designed to reach the Eggland's target (those who are preparing to purchase
the product) rather than the population at large. It has a limited dissemination schedule and will not be unreasonably
costly. Moreover, the notice itself is a statement of fact that is neither derogatory of Eggland's eggs nor implies
criticism of other companies' products. 

Although I support the very narrow corrective advertising provision in this case, I am not an advocate of this type
of remedy. 



Statement of Commissioner Dennis A. Yao, in Eggland's Best, Inc. 



I voted to accept the proposed consent agreement for public comment. Although I support the terms of the consent agreement,
I would have preferred that the complaint include an implied heart disease allegation. 

The Commission alleges in its complaint that, among other things, Eggland's Best falsely represented that it had
a reasonable basis for claims that eating its eggs will not increase serum cholesterol in an absolute sense and that
eating its eggs will not increase serum cholesterol as much as eating ordinary eggs. I believe that reasonable consumers
would interpret the express claim that Eggland's eggs will not increase serum cholesterol to imply that those eggs
would therefore not increase the risk of heart disease_especially when the express claim was made for eggs, a product
notoriously well known for its negative impact on heart health. Although the proposed order does include a requirement
that health claims, including claims about heart disease, be substantiated by competent and reliable scientific
evidence, I believe that industry and the public would best be served if the Commission communicated its belief that
an implied health claim has been made here.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment


The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Jockey International, Inc.
(``Jockey'').
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed order.
Jockey is a large, privately owned corporation headquartered in Kenosha, Wisconsin, that uses the mail to sell clothing
and other textile products. The complaint alleges that Jockey, in selling textile clothing products through mail
order catalogs, did not tell customers whether the products were made in the United States or imported. Further, the
complaint alleges that Jockey did not use the generic name ``spandex'' with the trademark ``Lycra'' to describe the
type of textile fibers used in goods it sold, but instead only used the trademark ``Lycra.'' The complaint alleges
that these actions by Jockey violated the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act (``Textile Act'') and the Commission's
implementing rules, and constituted unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive acts and practices in
violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.
The Textile Act and the Commission's rules, among other things, require companies that sell textile products by mail
order catalogs or mail order promotional materials, such as coupons, to state clearly and conspicuously whether
the textile products are made in the United States, or imported, or both. If fiber content is mentioned or implied in
a written advertisement, the Textile Act requires disclosure of the generic name of the fiber. Additionally, if a
fiber trademark is used in advertising textile products, the Textile Act requires that the generic name of the fiber
appear next to the trademark.
The proposed order requires Jockey, in compliance with the Textile Act and the Commission's rules, to inform its customers
whether the textile products it sells by mail are made in the United States, or imported, or both, and to use the generic
fiber names of such textile products if it mentions or implies fiber content. Jockey does not admit that it violated
the law, but agrees to provide the information in the future.
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment


The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Thomas L. Fenton.
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action or make final the agreement's proposed order.
This matter concerns advertising and promotional practices related to the sale of the Omexin System for Hair (``Omexin''),
which was advertised on the ``Can You Beat Baldness?'' infomercial.
The Commission's Amended Complaint, issued on October 13, 1993, charges that respondent Fenton falsely represented
that Omexin will curtail hair loss, will promote hair growth, is scientifically proven to curtail hair loss and promote
hair growth, and has successfully curtailed hair loss and promoted hair growth for thousands of balding men and women.
According to the allegations of the Amended Complaint, the infomercial was falsely represented to be independent
programming, rather than a paid advertisement. The Amended Complaint further charges that consumer testimonials
on the infomercial were falsely represented to reflect the typical experience of members of the public who used the
product.
The proposed consent order contains provisions which are designed to remedy the advertising violations charged
and to prevent the respondent from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future. Part I of the proposed order
prohibits respondent from disseminating the ``Can You Beat Baldness?'' infomercial.
With regard to Omexin or any substantially similar product, Part II.A prohibits Fenton from making the claims alleged
in the Complaint to be false. Part II.B prohibits him from representing that any product or service will prevent or
reduce hair loss, will promote hair growth, is an effective remedy for hair loss, or is proven through any test or study
to relieve hair loss unless the claim is true and substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence. Part
II.C forbids this respondent from advertising or promoting any hair loss product unless it is the subject of an approved
New Drug Application by the Food and Drug Administration.
Part III of the proposed order prohibits respondent from misrepresenting the validity, results, conclusions, or
interpretations of any test or study. Part IV prohibits him from making any representation about the performance,
benefits, efficacy, or safety of any food, drug, or device unless he possesses competent and reliable scientific
evidence that substantiates the representation.
Part V.A of the proposed order prohibits Fenton from disseminating any advertisement that misrepresents that it
is not a paid advertisement. Part V.B requires that any advertisement fifteen minutes or longer display visually,
in a clear and prominent manner and for a length of time sufficient for an ordinary consumer to read, within the first
thirty seconds of the commercial and immediately before each presentation of ordering instructions, the following
disclosure: ``The program you are watching is a paid advertisement for [the product or service].'' Part V.B specifies
that an oral or visual presentation of an ordering address or telephone number shall also require the display of this
disclosure.
Under the terms of Part VI, Fenton may not represent that any endorsement of a product or service represents the typical
or ordinary experience of members of the public, unless such is the fact.
Parts VII, VIII, and IX relate to respondent's obligation to maintain records, notify the Commission of changes in
business or employment status, and file compliance reports with the Commission.
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of public meeting.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing a public workshop on the progress of activities associated with
the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for the Registration of Pharmaceuticals
for Human Use (ICH). The agency will present summary information on guidelines developed as a result of ICH harmonization
initiatives and will respond to questions.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In recent years, many important initiatives have been undertaken by regulatory authorities and industry associations
to promote international harmonization of regulatory requirements. FDA has participated in many meetings designed
to enhance harmonization and is committed to seeking scientifically based harmonized technical procedures for
pharmaceutical development. One of the goals of harmonization is to identify and then reduce differences in technical
requirements for drug development.


ICH is concerned with harmonization of technical requirements for the registration of pharmaceutical products
among three regions: The European Union, Japan, and the United States. The six ICH sponsors are the European Union,
the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry Associations, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare,
the Japanese Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, FDA, and the U.S. Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.
The ICH Steering Committee includes representatives from each of the organizing bodies and the International Federation
of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations (IFPMA), as well as observers from the World Health Organization,
the Canadian Health Protection Branch, and the European Free Trade Area. The ICH Secretariat, which coordinates
the preparation of documentation, is provided by IFPMA.
ICH was organized to provide an opportunity for tripartite harmonization initiatives to be developed with input
from regulatory and industry representatives and other interested parties. FDA is committed to ensuring that there
is an opportunity for public comment through 

Federal Register

 notices on all of the guidelines developed as a result of the ICH harmonization initiatives. A number of ICH draft guidelines
will be published soon in the 

Federal Register

 for public comment. 
The purpose of this public workshop is to provide an opportunity for the agency to present summary information about
these documents and to respond to questions. In addition, general background information on ICH will be provided.

This public workshop should be of interest to professional and consumer organizations and to the pharmaceutical
industry. 
The status of the topics under consideration by ICH is as follows:



ICH Consensus Draft Guidelines (will be published in the 

Federal Register

 soon for public comment)



1. Guideline for the Validation of Analytical Procedures
2. Toxicokinetics: A Guidance for Assessing Systemic Exposure in Toxicology Studies

Expanded Community Health Center Activities, and 
Integrated Service Network Development Activities for CHCs 



Agency: 

Health Resources and Services Administration, PHS. 




Action: 

Advance Notice of Application Deadlines for New Community 
Health Centers, Expanded Community Health Center Activities, and Integrated Service Network Development Activities
for CHCs. 




Summary: 

The Health Resources and Services Administration's Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) expects to provide discretionary
grant funds of approximately $17 million in fiscal year (FY) 1994 under section 330 of the Public Health Service (PHS)
Act to establish new community health centers (CHCs), to expand existing CHCs, and to develop integrated service
networks for CHCs. The purpose of this announcement is to give early notice of funding amounts and application deadlines
for CHC new start/expansion applicants, as well as to announce the availability of supplemental funds for existing
CHCs involved in integrated service network activities. 


Approximately $12.5 million will be available to support the establishment of new CHCs and the expansion of capacity
in existing CHCs. For applicants seeking to establish new CHCs and for applicants seeking to expand existing CHCs,
the following application deadlines are provided: (1) The application for designation as a medically underserved
area (MUA) or medically underserved population (MUP) is March 15, 1994; and (2) the application deadline for grants
is June 1, 1994. Applicants are also encouraged to submit Letters of Interest by March 15, 1994, to the PHS Regional
Grants Management Officers (RGMOs) whose names and addresses are provided in the appendix to this document. This
will enable the RGMOs to provide additional assistance and instructions. 
Approximately $4.5 million will be available under Section 330 (d)(1) to support existing CHCs in the development
of integrated service networks. As part of their ongoing operational activities, CHCs are permitted to expend a reasonable
amount of their grant funds or other revenues for corporate planning activities, including efforts to define their
roles within the provider community. This special funding initiative earmarks an additional $4.5 million for grant
support of these activities. 
Integrated Service Networks are defined as: the collaboration of a Section 330 health center and at least one other
health care provider or health care entity (e.g., community health center, migrant health center, health care for
the homeless center, center for residents of public housing, other primary care provider, specialty group, hospitals,
academic medical center, mental health provider, laboratory, pharmacy, insurance company, managed care organization
and others) to form a horizontally and/or vertically integrated delivery system for managed purposes that will ensure
access for the medically underserved. 
For applicants interested in Integrated Service Network Development projects, a pre-application is required and
may be submitted after the publication of this notice with a final deadline of May 1, 1994. The final deadline for Integrated
Service Network Development applications is June 1, 1994. Interested applicants should contact their RGMOs for
additional assistance and instructions.

AGENCY:

 Social Security Administration, HHS. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Rescission of Social Security Acquiescence Ruling 88-5(1)_

McCuin 

v. 

Secretary of Health and Human Services, 

817 F.2d 161 (1st Cir. 1987).

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with 20 CFR 404.985(e), 416.1485(e) and 422.406(b)(2), published January 11, 1990 (55 FR 1012), the
Principal Deputy Commissioner of Social Security gives notice of the rescission of Social Security Acquiescence
Ruling 88-5(1). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A Social Security Acquiescence Ruling explains how we will apply a holding in a decision of a United States Court of
Appeals that we determine conflicts with our interpretation of a provision of the Social Security Act or regulations
when the Government has decided not to seek further review of the case or is unsuccessful on further review. 


As provided by 20 CFR 404.985(e)(4) and 416.1485(e)(4), a Social Security Acquiescence Ruling may be rescinded as
obsolete if we subsequently clarify, modify or revoke the regulation or ruling that was the subject of the circuit
court holding for which the Acquiescence Ruling was issued. 
On October 27, 1988, we issued Acquiescence Ruling (AR) 
88-5(1) to reflect the holding in 

McCuin 

v. 

Secretary of Health and Human Services, 

817 F.2d 161 (1st Cir. 1987), that, once the 60-day period for the Appeals Council's own-motion review had expired,
the Secretary's reopening regulations (20 CFR 404.987, 404.988, 416.1487 and 416.1488)

1

 allowed reopening of an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) decision only on the claimant's motion. Accordingly, under
the McCuin AR, where an ALJ's decision had become final, (

i.e., 

the time for requesting Appeals Council review of the decision had expired and no request for such review had been filed
by the claimant and the Appeals Council had not taken own-motion review within the 60-day time limit), the Appeals
Council could not reopen and revise the decision on its own initiative under the Secretary's regulations on reopening.
The AR applied to cases in which the claimant resided in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island or, for
title II claims only, in Puerto Rico at the time of the ALJ decision. 




We indicated in the McCuin AR that the Social Security Administration (SSA) intended to clarify the reopening regulations
at issue in the McCuin case through the rulemaking process, and that the AR would continue to apply until such clarification
was made. On October 28, 1991, we published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and proposed rules (56 FR 55477) that would
clarify these regulations. In this issue of the

 Notice of extension of time period for public comment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), is extending the comment period for review of the Draft Pacific Coastal
Barriers Study and accompanying maps, prepared pursuant to the Coastal Barriers Improvement Act of 1990 (Act). The
notice of availability for the Draft Study and maps was published on December 17, 1993. Public information meetings
were held in the four affected States. Based on requests received from the public and the Governors of California,
Oregon, and Washington during the initial public comment period, the Service determined an extended review period
is necessary to allow interested parties additional time to submit written comments on the proposal.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Reference December 17, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice of availability of the Draft Pacific Coastal Barriers Study and Accompanying Maps of Areas Under consideration
for Inclusion in the Coastal Barriers Resources System. 



On October 18, 1982, President Reagan signed the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) into law (Pub. L. 97-348).
Section 4 of CBRA establishes the Coastal Barrier Resources System (System) as referred to and adopted by Congress,
and sections 5 and 6 prohibit all new Federal expenditures and financial assistance within the units of that System
unless specifically excepted by the Act. Coastal barrier units were designated along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico
coasts. 

On November 16, 1990, President Bush signed the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1990 (CBIA) into law (Pub. L. 101-591).
The CBIA greatly expanded the size of the System by adding coastal barriers of the Great Lakes, as well as additional
areas along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts. The CBIA amended section 1321 of the National Flood Insurance Act
of 1968 to prohibit the issuance of new Federal flood insurance within ``otherwise protected areas'' identified
on the maps referred to in the CBIA. 

Section 6 of the CBIA directed the Secretary of the Interior to prepare a study which examines the need for protecting
undeveloped coastal barriers along the Pacific coast of the United States and to prepare maps identifying undeveloped
coastal barriers bordering the Pacific Ocean south of 49 degrees north latitude (approximately the Canada-Washington
State boundary) which the Secretary and the appropriate Governor consider to be appropriate for inclusion in the
System. Furthermore, the study is to examine:




(A) The potential for loss of human life and damage to fish, wildlife, and other natural resources, and the potential
for the wasteful expenditure of Federal revenues given the geologic differences of the coastal barriers along the
Pacific coast as opposed to those found along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts; and

<TEXT>
 

(B) The differences in extreme weather conditions which exist along the 
Pacific coast as opposed to those found along the Atlantic and Gulf 
coasts. 




In 1992, The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) identified and mapped all 
undeveloped coastal barriers of the Pacific coast which meet the definition 
of undeveloped coastal barriers as defined by section 2 of the CBIA and 
defined in the revised criteria published in the 

Federal Register

, March 4, 
1985 (50 FR 8698). The Service prepared draft maps for the states of 
Washington, Oregon, California, and Hawaii. The draft maps were released 
for a 90 day public review and comment period. Separate notices of 
Availability for each state were published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 
23, 1992 (57 FR 14846) for Oregon; May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22821) for 
Washington; July 7, 1992 (57 FR 29883) for California; and August 14, 1992 
(57 FR 36668) for Hawaii. Following the 90 day public comment periods, the 
draft maps were subsequently revised to address any technical errors noted 
during the comment period. The revised draft maps and all comments 
received were forwarded to the appropriate Governors for their review and 
use in eventual formulation of their recommendations as to which areas the 
Governors felt should be included in the System. 
With publication of the December 17, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice, the 
Service announced the availability of the Draft Pacific Coastal Barriers 
Study and the accompanying maps for public review and comment. This notice 
announces the continued availability for public review. All written 
comments received during the public comment period will be forwarded to the 
appropriate State Governors. By the end of the Governor's review period, 
the Service is soliciting the recommendations of the appropriate Governors 
for which areas should be included in the System. The recommendations of 
the Governors will be forwarded to Congress in their entirety along with 
the recommendations of the Secretary in the final Pacific Costal Barriers 
Study and accompanying maps.

<DOCTITLE>Availability of a Draft Recovery Plan for the Snake River Aquatic Species for Review and Comment</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of document availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces the availability for public review of a draft recovery plan for the Snake
River aquatic species. The Snake River species include five Snake River molluscs listed as threatened (Bliss Rapids
Snail) or endangered (the Snake River Physa, Banbury Springs lanx or limpet, Utah Valvata Snail and Idaho Springsnail)
(57 FR 59244), three additional molluscs and one fish taxa currently listed as Federal candidate species, and two
State of Idaho Sensitive fish taxa. The aquatic habitats essential to all these species throughout the Snake River
are similar and cannot be isolated for recovery purposes. The primary and immediate recovery objectives of this Plan
include implementing the conservation measures to prevent the extinction and/or further decline of existing colonies
of the listed snails by eliminating or reducing known threats. Basic information necessary to establish recovery
criteria so that the listed species can be reclassified or delisted will also be collected. Long term objectives are
to reverse declining habitat trends and restore the Snake River ecosystem so that self-reproducing colonies of the
four endangered and one threatened snails are protected to the point that they are delisted. The Service solicits
review and comment from the public on this draft plan.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

 

Background



Restoring an endangered or threatened animal or plant to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish criteria
for the recovery levels for downlisting and delisting species, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery
measures needed.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised Recovery Plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approving recovery plans.



The Snake River sub-basin above C.J. Strike dam provides habitat for a minimum 16 native fish taxa and 42 native molluscs.
This includes five Snake River snails listed as threatened or endangered, three additional molluscs and one fish
taxa currently listed as Federal candidate species, and two State of Idaho Sensitive fish taxa. With the advent of
exploration and development, the Snake River ecosystem has undergone significant transformation from a primarily
cold-water lotic system towards a slow-moving warm-water system when compared with its historic fauna. The human-induced
environmental stressors to the formerly fast-and cold-water Snake River environment include numerous point and
non-point pollution sources, diversion of water for irrigation or hydropower, and construction of several mainstem
dams. The draft recovery plan specifically addresses the five Federally listed Snake River snails (December 24,
1992; 57 FR 59244). However, the aquatic habitats essential to these species and other candidate fish and mollusc
endemic throughout the Snake River are similar and cannot be isolated for recovery purposes. Therefore, the draft
recovery plan and the entire recovery effort is designed to recover the entire Snake River ecosystem from C.J. Strke
Dam to the confluence of the Blackfoot River rather than individual species.



Public Comments Solicited



The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to approval of the plan.



Authority



The authority for this action is Section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f).

F_Exempt Abandonments to abandon its 0.5 mile of line of railroad between milepost 12.94 and milepost 13.44, in Bellwood,
Cook County, IL.


CNW has certified that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) the line is not used for movement
of overhead traffic; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a state or local government

resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by February

Investigations Regarding Certifications of Eligibility To Apply for NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance



Petitions for transitional adjustment assistance under the North American Free Trade Agreement-Transitional
Adjustment Assistance Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103-182), hereinafter called (NAFTA-TAA), have

and (e) of section 250 of the Trade Act.

The purpose of the Governor's actions and the Labor Department's investigations are to determine whether the workers
separated from employment after December 8, 1993 (date of enactment of Public Law 103-182) are eligible to apply
for NAFTA-TAA under Subchapter D of the Trade Act because of increased imports from or the shift in production
to Mexico or Canada.

The petitioners or any other persons showing a substantial interest in the subject matter of the investigations may
request a public hearing with the Director of OTAA at the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) in Washington, DC, provided
such request is filed in writing with the Director of OTAA not later than March 7, 1994.

Also, interested persons are invited to submit written comments regarding the subject matter of the petitions to
the Director of OTAA at the address shown below not later than March 7, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Determinations Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA Transitional Adjustment
Assistance </DOCTITLE>



In accordance with section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Labor herein presents summaries
of determinations regarding eligibility to apply for trade adjustment assistance for workers (TA-W) issued
during the period of February, 1994. 

In order for an affirmative determination to be made and a certification of eligibility to apply for worker adjustment
assistance to be issued, each of the group eligibility requirements of section 222 of the Act must be met. 

(1) That a significant number or proportion of the workers in the workers' firm, or an appropriate subdivision thereof,
have become totally or partially separated, 

(2) That sales or production, or both, of the firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely, and 

(3) That increases of imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by the firm or appropriate
subdivision have contributed importantly to the separations, or threat thereof, and to the absolute decline in sales
or production. 



Negative Determinations for Workers Adjustment Assistance 



In each of the following cases the investigation revealed that criterion (3) has not been met. A survey of customers
indicated that increased imports did not contribute importantly to worker separations at the firm. 



TA-W-29,222; Mann Industries, Inc., Williamsburg, VA 


TA-W-29,247; Greenbrier Industries, Clinton, TN 


TA-W-29,098, TA-W-29,099; Northrop Corp., Hawthorn, CA and Anaheim, CA

In the following cases, the investigation revealed that the criteria for eligibility have not been met for the reasons
specified. 




TA-W-29,305; Decision Data Service, Inc., Horsham, PA 



The workers' firm does not produce an article as required for certification under section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974.





TA-W-29,300; Lake Stevens Timber, Lake Stevens, VA 



The preponderant portion of production at the subject firm is exported; therefore, imports could not have contributed
importantly to the absolute decline in sales or production of the subject firm. 



TA-W-29,294; Praxair, Inc., Tonawanda, NY 



U.S. imports of gas separators decreased in the twelve month period from November 1992 through October 1993 compared
to the previous twelve month period from November 1991 through October 1992.

U.S. imports of tug boats and pushers declined absolutely in the twelve month period of October 1992 through September
1993 as compared to the same period of a year earlier. 



TA-W-29,270; Leviton Manufacturing Co., Inc., Brooklyn, NY 



Predominate reason for the layoff of workers was a corporate decision to transfer certain product lines from the subject
firm to more modern facilities in U.S. affiliates. 




TA-W-29,242; B-5 Welding Special Services, Seminole, TX 



The workers' firm does not produce an article as required for certification under section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974.

period for certification. 




TA-W-29,252; Neste Oil, Inc., Houston, TX 



The investigation revealed that the subject firm's parent company, Neste Oy, made the decision to divest itself of
all United States oil and gas assets. These assets were managed by workers at the subject firm; when the sale of the assets
was completed in mid-1993, the employees of Neste Oil, Inc., were severed from employment. 



TA-W-29,240; The ARO Corp, Life Support Products Div., Buffalo, NY 



The investigation revealed that criterion (2) has not been met. Sales or production did not decline during the relevant

Abstract:

 NRC regulation, 10 CFR part 34, specifies the information and data to be provided by applicants and licensees using
byproduct material for industrial radiography. The 10 CFR part 34 is being revised in its entirety. The revision will
add or modify the requirements to include mandatory certification of radiographers, additional training of radiographers'
assistants, leak tests of ``S'' tubes, and specifies records to be kept at field stations, permanent installations,
temporary jobsites and use or storage location exceeding 180 days. The proposed revision will require the following
additional information to be reported on NRC Form 313, Application for Materials License: locations and descriptions
of all field stations and permanent radiographic installations, the designation of a Radiation Safety Officer,
and additional information on training and testing. This information is reviewed by NRC to ensure that the safety
of radiographers and the public is protected.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is transferring the emergency response functions and responsibilities
of the current Region V office in Walnut Creek, California, to the Region IV office in Arlington, Texas. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The purpose of this notice is to announce that the NRC is consolidating its Region V office in Walnut Creek, California,
with the Region IV office in Arlington, Texas. Transition planning for this consolidation has established that,
effective March 1, 1994, the emergency response functions and responsibilities of the current Region V office will
transfer to the Region IV office. 


The NRC Incident Response Plan, as stated in NUREG-0728, Rev. 2, will remain unchanged and all response functions
and responsibilities currently in place in the Region V office will be transferred to the RIV office in Arlington,
Texas. Licensee notifications for emergency response purposes will be unchanged and will be sent to the NRC Headquarters
Operations Officer at 301-951-0550. 
Sometime shortly after March 1, 1994, the actual realignment of organizational structure will occur eliminating
Region V and establishing an NRC Field Office in Walnut Creek, California, as an integral part of the Region IV office
in Arlington, Texas. Until the formal realignment, the lead for inspection program responsibility remains with
Region V. Separate notification will be provided when Region V is abolished and the Region IV Field Office is established
in Walnut Creek, California.

<DOCTITLE>Cameo Diagnostic Centre, Inc., Springfield Massachusetts; Order Modifying Order Imposing Civil Monetary Penalty</DOCTITLE>


I




Cameo Diagnostic Centre, Inc. (Licensee) is the holder of a Byproduct Material License No. 20-27908-01
(License) originally issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) on January 30, 1987. The License
authorizes the Licensee to perform diagnostic procedures with radioactive byproduct material and to store Promethium-147,
in accordance with the conditions specified therein.


II



An inspection of the Licensee's activities was conducted on December 29, 1992. During the inspection, nine violations
of NRC requirements were identified. A Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty (Notice) was
served upon the Licensee by letter dated April 16, 1993. The Notice stated the nature of the violations, the provisions
of the NRC's requirements that the Licensee had violated, and the amount of the civil penalty proposed for the violations.
The Licensee responded to the Notice on June 11 and July 23, 1993. In its response, the Licensee objected to the characterization
of Violations I.A and I.B as ``willful'', and to the classification of these violations at Severity Level III; protested
the civil penalty assessed for Violations I.A and I.B; and requested remission of that penalty.

After consideration of the Licensee's response and the statements of fact, explanation, and argument contained
therein, the NRC staff determined that the violations occurred as stated in the Notice, the Severity Level classification
was appropriate, and the penalty proposed for Violations I.A and I.B should be imposed. Accordingly, the NRC issued
an Order Imposing A Civil Monetary Penalty_$1,750 on November 24, 1993. The Licensee responded in a letter dated December
17, 1993 and requested a hearing. On February 1, 1994, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) designated to preside
in this proceeding held a prehearing conference.

Violation I.B., as set forth in the Notice, cited the Licensee against 10 CFR 30.9(a) for a failure to provide to the
Commission information that was complete and accurate in all material respects. During the February 1, 1994 prehearing
conference, the ASLB ordered the Staff, among other things, to prepare a brief addressing whether a total failure
to provide material information to the Commission can, as a matter of law, constitute a violation of 10 CFR 30.9(a).



III



The NRC staff has reconsidered whether Violation I.B. as stated in the Notice fully reflected the facts of this case.
The original citation for Violation I.B. did not assert that a statement of the Licensee was inaccurate or incomplete,
but rather, that the Licensee's omission constituted a violation of 10 CFR 30.9(a). After reevaluating the facts
of this case, and statements made by the inspector and the Licensee, the staff is modifying Violation I.B based on an
inaccurate statement made by the Licensee in answer to a question asked during a telephone call on November 12, 1992.
This statement was confirmed in a letter issued the next day on November 13, 1992. Thereafter, during calls on November
19 and 25, 1992 the staff reiterated the need to obtain a license amendment before possessing material at the new location.
However, the licensee did not correct the staff's understanding after receipt of the letter or during the November
19 and 25, 1992 telephone calls.


IV



In view of the foregoing and pursuant to section 234 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, (Act), 42 U.S.C. 2282,
and 10 CFR 2.205, 

it is hereby ordered that,

 Violation I.B of the notice and order be modified to read: 10 CFR 30.9(a) requires, in part, that information provided
to the Commission by a licensee be complete and accurate in all material respects.


Contrary to the above, the Licensee did not provide to the Commission information that was complete and accurate in
all material respects. Specifically, during a November 12, 1992 telephone conversation in response to a question
from Region I as to whether the Licensee had licensed materials at its new address (155 Maple Street, Springfield,
MA), the Licensee responded negatively. The licensee response was confirmed in a letter from NRC to the licensee dated
November 13, 1992 which stated that it was the NRC ``understanding that: * * * 2. You [licensee] do not
as yet possess any licensed radioactive material at this new facility.'' Therefore, the Licensee provided inaccurate
information to the Commission in that it had possessed licensed materials at its new address. This information was
material because, had the correct information been known, it would have resulted in action by the NRC to prohibit licensed
activity at the new address until a license amendment had been granted.


V



The Licensee shall respond to this modified Order within 20 days of the date of this Order by requesting that the NRC
proceed with the Licensee's December 17, 1993 request for a hearing or by withdrawing its hearing request. The response
to this Order shall be addressed to Mr. James Lieberman, Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, Washington, DC 20555, with a copy to the Commission's Document Control Desk, Washington, DC 20555. Copies
also shall be sent to the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board presiding over the proceeding on the December 13, 1993 hearing
request and Counsel for the NRC staff in that proceeding at the same address and to the Regional Administrator, NRC
Region I, 475 Allendale Road, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406.

If the Licensee withdraws its request for a hearing, payment of the civil penalty shall be made within 30 days of the
date of this Order. If full payment of the civil penalty has not been made by that time, the matter may be referred to the
Attorney General for collection.

In the event that the Licensee requests proceeding with a hearing as provided above, the issues to be considered at
such hearing shall be:

(a) Whether the Licensee was in violation of the Commission's requirements as set forth in Violation I.A. of the Notice
referenced in Section II above and Violation I.B. as modified in Section IV above, and

(b) Whether, on the basis of such violations, this Order should be sustained.

<DOCTITLE>North Atlantic Energy Service Corporation (Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1); Order for Modification of Order Approving
Transfer of License</DOCTITLE>



I.



Great Bay Power Corporation, formerly EUA Power Corporation, is the holder of a 12.1324 percent ownership share in
Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1. Great Bay Power Corporation's interest in Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, is governed
by License No. NPF-86 issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), pursuant to part 50 of title 10
of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), on March 15, 1990, in Docket No. 50-443. Under this license, only
North Atlantic Energy Service Corporation, acting as agent and representative of the 11 joint owners listed in the
license, has the authority to operate Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1. Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, is located in Rockingham
County, New Hampshire.



II.



The transfer of any right under License No. NPF-86 is subject to the NRC's approval pursuant to 10 CFR 50.80(a).
By letter of May 14, 1993, from its counsel, Ropes & Grey, North Atlantic Energy Service Corporation filed two
requests with the NRC. One requested NRC approval of the indirect transfer of control of EUA Power Corporation's 12.1324
percent ownership share in Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1. The other requested an amendment to the Operating License
to reflect EUA Power Corporation's change of name to Great Bay Power Corporation. The name of EUA Power Corporation
was formally changed to Great Bay Power Corporation in February 1993. The name change was filed with the Secretary
of State of New Hampshire following the redemption of all outstanding stock in EUA Power Corporation from its corporate
patent, Eastern Utility Associates. The stock redemption was one of several interrelated steps in the Plan of Reorganization
(of EUA Power Corporation) filed with the Bankruptcy Court. Following the redemption of its outstanding stock, EUA
Power Corporation was no longer a subsidiary of Eastern Utility Associates, and the name was changed to remove any
implication of a continuing relationship with its former corporate parent. The name change did not affect the corporate
entity of the debtor in bankruptcy.

Indirect transfer of control, in this case, results from the elimination of the existing stock of the debtor (now known
as Great Bay Power Corporation) and the issuance of new stock to the holders of the debtor's bonds and to others.

On August 16, 1993, the NRC issued Amendment 23 to License No. NPF-86 that incorporated the name change of EUA
Power Corporation to Great Bay Power Corporation in the footnote to page 1 of the operating license and issued an order
approving the indirect transfer of the ownership interest of EUA Power Corporation. The order was contingent on the
transfer of control being completed no later than February 15, 1994, and included the provision that upon application
and showing of good cause, the order may be extended for a short period beyond February 15, 1994.

On February 3, 1994, North Atlantic Energy Service Corporation, through their counsel Ropes & Grey, filed an
application requesting extension of the order until June 30, 1994, and identified the reasons why the transfer of
control can not be completed by February 15, 1994. In that application, North Atlantic Energy Service Corporation
asserts that the sole obstacle to final implementation of the Plan of Reorganization has been the difficulty with
completing the contemplated $45 million credit facility for the source of funds to cover Great Bay Power Corporation's
cash requirements. As an alternative to this credit facility, the bondholders have reached an agreement in principle
with Omega Advisors that provides for an investment of $35 million by Omega Advisors in exchange for 60 percent equity
of Great Bay Power Corporation. This agreement, reached on February 2, 1994, is a modification to the Plan of Reorganization
and requires supplemental disclosure to the creditors and reconfirmation by the Bankruptcy Court.

On the basis of the information provided in North Atlantic Energy Service Corporation's application (Ropes and Grey
letter dated February 3, 1994), I find that there is good cause to extend the expiration date of the Order Approving
Transfer of License dated August 16, 1993.

Accordingly, pursuant to sections 161b, 161i, and 184 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 42 USC 2201 et seq.,
and 10 CFR 50.80, 

it is hereby ordered that:

 The Order Approving Transfer of License dated August 16, 1993, is modified to change the latest date for completion
of the transfer, as specified in section III of the August 16, 1993, Order, to June 30, 1994. The Order of August 16, 1993,
except as modified herein, remains in effect.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be prepared
for a proposed highway construction project on Forest Highway 7 between Darrington and Silverton, otherwise known
as Mountain Loop, in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, Snohomish County, Washington.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the U.S. Forest Service, the Washington State Department of Transportation, and Snohomish
County, will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement on a proposal to construct the Mountain Loop Highway, Forest
Highway 7, in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest between White Chuck River, east of Darrington to Barlow
Pass, which is east of Silverton. The proposed highway would connect State Route 530 with State Route 92, completing
a recreational and scenic highway loop along the South Fork and the Sauk Rivers in the Cascade Range. The proposal would
involve reconstruction of an existing unimproved road to two lane paved surface. The total length is about 22.5 km
(14 miles). The highway is considered necessary to accommodate recreational traffic and a developing tourism industry.
The recreational loop is access to three wilderness areas, a Wild and Scenic river, a National Scenic Byway, hiking
trails, camping facilities, and fishing opportunities. The road is seasonally open. Heavy snows close the road during
most winters.




Alternatives under construction include: No action; road closure; build on existing alignment; construct an Elliott
Creek bypass; and construct a single lane couplet around the Elliot Creek slide. Various lane widths will be analyzed
with the build alternatives.

Announcements describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State,
and local agencies. These will also be sent to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed,
or are known to have interest in this proposal. Public scoping meetings will be held in Granite Falls, Darrington,
and a location between Lynwood and Everett. Public notices will be given on the dates, times, and places of all the meetings.

It is important that the full range of issues related to this proposed action be identified, all reasonable alternatives
be considered, and significant impacts be thoroughly analyzed. To ensure this, comments and suggestions are invited
from all interested parties. Comments, suggestions, and/or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS
should be directed to the FHWA at the address and phone number provided above.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement (EIS) will be prepared
for proposed transportation improvements in Pitkin County, Colorado.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the Colorado Department of Transportation, Pitkin County, the City of Aspen, and Town
of Snowmass Village, will prepare draft and final environmental impact statements for transportation improvements
for the area of S.H. 82 known locally as the ``Entrance To Aspen'', including potential transit improvements to Snowmass
Village. The proposed improvements involve the S.H. 82 corridor from about MP 38.80 (Tiehack Ski area) to MP 42.00
(7th and Main Street), a distance of approximately 3.20 miles.



Transportation improvements to the area are considered necessary to provide for the existing and future travel demand.
Also, included in this proposal is a transit/multi-modal center located between Brush Creek and Aspen and fixed guideway
alternatives. Alternatives under consideration include: The Do-Nothing alternative; Improving the existing
highway; Upgrading the highway with additional lanes in either the existing location or new alignments; fixed guideway;
transit enhancements and/or a combination of several modes/types.

Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local
agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have interest in
this proposal. A series of public meetings will be held during the development of the draft and final EIS. In addition,
a public hearing will be held after the draft EIS is issued for public comment. Public notices will give the time and
place of the scheduled meetings and hearings. A formal scoping meeting will also be held to ensure that the full range
of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues are identified. Comments and suggestions
are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed action should be directed
to FHWA at the address provided above.

<DOCTITLE>Annual List of Nonconforming Vehicles Determined To Be Eligible for Importation</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Annual list of nonconforming vehicles determined to be eligible for importation.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice lists all vehicles not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards that have been determined, as of December 31, 1993, to be eligible for importation into the United States.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, (15 U.S.C. 1381 

et seq.

) (the Act), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle
safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless the Secretary
of Transportation has determined that the motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured
for importation into and sale in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year
as the model of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable
Federal motor vehicle safety standards. Where there is no substantially similar U.S.-certified vehicle, a vehicle
that does not conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards may be admitted into the United States
if the Secretary determines that the safety features of the vehicle comply with, or are capable of being modified to
comply with, those standards based on destructive test data or such other evidence that the Secretary determines
to be adequate.



Section 108(c)(3)(C)(i) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(C)(i), authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to
make import eligibility determinations ``(I) on the petition of any registered importer or any manufacturer, or
(II) on the Secretary's own initiative.'' The Secretary's authority to make these determinations has been delegated
to the Administrator of NHTSA under 49 CFR 1.50(a). The Administrator redelegated to the Associate Administrator
for Enforcement the authority to grant or deny petitions for import eligibility determinations submitted by motor
vehicle manufacturers and registered importers (49 CFR 501.8(g)(3)). Thus far, a number of import eligibility determinations
have been made on the Administrator's own initiative, and the Associate Administrator has granted many petitions
for such determinations submitted by registered importers.

Section 108(c)(3)(C)(iv) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(C)(iv), requires the annual publication in the 

Federal Register

 of a list of all such determinations. That list is set forth in Annex A and is current as of December 31, 1993.

Each vehicle on the list is preceded by a vehicle eligibility number. The importer of a vehicle admissible under any
eligibility determination must write that number on the Form HS-7 accompanying entry to indicate that the vehicle
is eligible for importation. ``VSA'' eligibility numbers are assigned to all vehicles that are determined to be eligible
for importation on the initiative of the Administrator. ``VSP'' eligibility numbers are assigned to vehicles that
are determined to be eligible under section 108(c)(3)(C)(i)(I) of the Act, based on a petition from a manufacturer
or registered importer which establishes that a substantially similar U.S.-certified vehicle exists. ``VCP''
eligibility numbers are assigned to vehicles that are determined to be eligible under section 108(c)(3)(C)(i)(II)
of the Act, based on a petition from a manufacturer or registered importer which establishes that the vehicle has safety
features that comply with, or are capable of being modified to comply with, all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards. Vehicles for which eligibility determinations have been made are listed in Annex A alphabetically by
make. Eligible models within each make are listed numerically by ``VSA,'' ``VSP,'' or ``VCP'' number.

Section 108(i) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1397(i), provides that ``any motor vehicle that is 25 or more years old'' is not
subject to the Act's importation restrictions. Such vehicles may therefore be imported into the United States without
regard to their compliance with applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. Since the importation of a vehicle
more than 25 years old is not conditioned on the existence of an eligibility determination, NHTSA has amended its eligibility
determinations so that they no longer apply to such vehicles.






Authority:

 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(C)(iv); 49 CFR 593.8; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501.8.

<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974; System of Records_Means Test Verification Records_VA (89VA161)</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Veterans Affairs.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of new system of records.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)) requires that all agencies publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of the existence and character of the systems of records. Accordingly, the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) published a notice of its inventory of personal records on September 27, 1977 (42 FR 49726). Notice is hereby given
that VA is adding a new system of records entitled ``Means Test Verification Records'' (89VA161).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Public Law 99-272, the Veterans Health Care Amendments of 1986, as amended by Public Law 100-322, established
two categories of eligibility for VA health care: ``mandatory and discretionary.'' In order to determine the category
assignment of nonservice-connected veterans, new eligibility assessment procedures, including the means test,
were developed. The means tested is based on income information provided by the nonservice-connected veteran. It
was developed to ensure that the most needy nonservice-connected veterans would be placed in the mandatory care category
based on limited family income. The law provided VA no legislative authority to verify the self-reported income.


In November 1990, Public Law 101-508, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA), provided VA the authority
to verify income data reported to VA by nonservice-connected veterans with income records obtained from the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) and the Social Security Administration (SSA). Section 602, Public Law 102-568 extended
VA's matching authority through September 1997. The law has three requirements for VA: (1) Notification to veterans
that means test financial information report to VA is subject to verification with IRS and SSA records; (2) No steps
may be taken to terminate, deny, suspend, or reduce any benefit or service until appropriate steps have been taken
to independently verify the information received; and (3) Development and implementation of a VA income verification
matching program be funded from the VA Compensation and Pension appropriation.
The Income Verification Match (IVM) Center was developed to conduct and administer the computer matching of Veterans
Health Administration income data with IRS and SSA income records. Due to stringent IRS security regulations and
codes, the process of matching the income of the veteran will be accomplished through a stand-alone automated data
processing program with verification activities centralized at the IVM Center. The IVM Center is located in Decatur,
Georgia.
Matching agreements have been established between the Veterans Health Administration and the IRS and SSA for verifying
income of nonservice-connected veterans for appropriate years. The IVM Program will adhere to require VA security
and reporting requirements in accordance with Title 38, Code of Federal Regulations, and other Federal regulations,
as well as 5 U.S.C. 552a, the Privacy Act, and 26 U.S.C. 6103, the Internal Revenue Code. This new system of records is
being established for IVM records to identify the types of information being extracted and utilized for IVM and means
tested verification, how the data will be used and to describe he limited access to this data.



Approved: February 8, 1994.

policies and practices for storing, retrieving, accessing, retaining, and disposing of records in the system:
storage:


Records (or information contained in records) are maintained on paper documents, and/or in an automated imaging
system database at the Income Verification Match (IVM) Center, 1842 Clairmont Road, Decatur, Georgia 30033.


retrievability:


IVM records are retrieved by the names and social security numbers or other assigned identifiers of the individuals
on whom they are maintained.


safeguards:


1. Access to working spaces and record storage areas at the Income Verification Match (IVM) Center is restricted to
IVM employees on a ``need-to-know'' basis. Strict control measures are enforced to ensure that disclosure to these
individuals is also based on this same principle.

2. All means test data downloaded from DHCP (Decentralized Hospital Computer Program) files as well as all incoming
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Social Security Administration (SSA) tapes are received directly by the IVM ADP
Division. The IRS and SSA tapes are placed into the IVM vault until the data is required for matching, at which time it
is loaded on the IVM Computer System. Once the tapes are read-in, they are returned to the vault. Federal tax data is
not co-mingled with or transcribed into data maintained on the IVM Computer System. The data will reside within its
own area of the computer system. Federal tax data must be protected according to the provisions of section 6103(p)
of the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26, U.S.C.). It is mandatory that IVM employees review the IRS security awareness
tapes and VA computer security tapes on a yearly basis.
3. The IVM Computer System supplies security access levels for all areas within the IVM Software Module. Security
access levels are maintained not only on the IRS and SSA data elements themselves, but on initial access to the system
(log-on procedures), menu options available, automatic shut-down when the system has not had a response in a predetermined
period of time, etc. Access to the computer system is controlled by access and verify codes assigned by the IVM ADP Security
Officer. The entire procedure is outlined in the IVM ADP Security Policy.
4. The office space occupied by the IVM ADP Division is in a secured area with only one access door. The door has been equipped
with a punch-combination lock and an electronic card entry system. The card entry system logs every entrance and exit
to the IVM space. The entry system log is programmed to provide a screen display of employees located in the IVM space
as well as capturing entry and exit activity in a report format for any given period of time.
5. There are no field offices that will be receiving tax return information from IVM.


Retention and Disposal:


Paper records and information stored on electronic storage media are maintained and disposed of in accordance with
records disposition authority approved by the Archivist of the United States. After the data on each IRS and SSA tape

North American Free Trade Agreement: Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Extraordinary Challenge Committees

Department of Commerce. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Rules of Procedure for NAFTA Article 1904 Extraordinary Challenge Committees. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Canada, Mexico, and the United States have negotiated the rules of procedure for Article 1904 extraordinary challenge
committee proceedings. These rules apply to extraordinary challenges conducted pursuant to Article 1904 of the
North American Free Trade Agreement. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Chapter Nineteen of the North American Free Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism for replacing
judicial review of final antidumping and countervailing duty determinations involving imports from Canada, Mexico,
or the United States with review by independent binational panels. If requested, these panels will expeditiously
review final determinations to determine whether they are consistent with the antidumping or countervailing duty
law of the importing country. 




In instances in which one of the Parties to the Agreement alleges, pursuant to Article 1904.13 of the Agreement, that
(a)(i) a member of a panel materially violated the rules of conduct, (ii) the panel seriously departed from a fundamental
rule of procedure, or (iii) the panel manifestly exceeded its powers, authority or jurisdiction, and that (b) any
of the actions set out in (a) has materially affected the panel's decision and threatens the integrity of the binational
panel review process, that Party may request formation of an extraordinary challenge committee (``ECC''). Extraordinary
challenge committee review is therefore not a routine appeal. Rather, as the name suggests, Canada, Mexico, or the
United States may have recourse to an ECC only in extraordinary cases. 




Title IV of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1993, Public Law No. 103-182, 107 Stat.
2057, amends United States law to implement Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement. 



The 

NAFTA Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules 

are intended to give effect to the ECC provisions of Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement by setting forth the procedures
for commencing, conducting, and completing extraordinary challenge proceedings. These rules are the result of
negotiations among Canada, Mexico, and the United States in compliance with the terms of the Agreement, and are derived
in large part from the 

Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules 

under the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Rules of Procedure for NAFTA Article 1905 Special Committees. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Canada, Mexico, and the United States have negotiated the rules of procedure for Article 1905 Special Committees.
These rules apply to special committee proceedings conducted pursuant to Article 1905 of the Agreement, unless the
involved Parties otherwise agree. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Chapter Nineteen of the North American Free Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism for replacing
judicial review of final antidumping and countervailing duty determinations involving imports from Canada, Mexico,
or the United States with review by independent binational panels. If requested, these panels will expeditiously
review final determinations to determine whether they are consistent with the antidumping or countervailing duty
law of the importing country. 
In instances in which one of the Parties to the Agreement alleges, pursuant to Article 1905.1 of the Agreement, that
the application of another Party's domestic law (a) has prevented the establishment of a panel; (b) has prevented
a panel from rendering a final decision; (c) has prevented the implementation of a panel's decision or denied it binding
force and effect; or (d) has resulted in a failure to provide opportunity for proper review of a final determination
by a panel or a court of competent jurisdiction, that Party may request the establishment of a special committee. 
Title IV of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1993, Public Law No. 103-182, 107 Stat.
2057, amends United States law to implement Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement. 
The 

Article 1905 Special Committee Rules

 are intended to give effect to the special committee provisions of Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement by setting forth
the procedures for commencing, conducting, and completing special committee proceedings. These rules are the result
of negotiations among Canada, Mexico, and the United States in compliance with the terms of the Agreement.

I. Responsibilities to the Process



Every candidate, member and former member shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety and shall observe
high standards of conduct so that the integrity and impartiality of the dispute settlement process is preserved.



II. Disclosure Obligations



[

Introductory Note:



The governing principle of this Code of Conduct is that a candidate or member must disclose the existence of any interest,
relationship or matter that is likely to affect the candidate's or member's independence or impartiality or that
might reasonably create an appearance of impropriety or an apprehension of bias. An appearance of impropriety or
an apprehension of bias is created where a reasonable person, with knowledge of all the relevant circumstances that
a reasonable inquiry would disclose, would conclude that a candidate's or member's ability to carry out the duties
with integrity, impartiality and competence is impaired.

These disclosure obligations, however, should not be interpreted so that the burden of detailed disclosure makes
it impractical for persons in the legal or business community to serve as members, thereby depriving the Parties and
participants of the services of those who might be best qualified to serve as members. Thus, candidates and members
should not be called upon to disclose interests, relationships or matters whose bearing on their role in the proceeding
would be trivial.

Throughout the proceeding, candidates and members have a continuing obligation to disclose interests, relationships
and matters that may bear on the integrity or impartiality of the dispute settlement process.

This Code of Conduct does not determine whether or under what circumstances the Parties will disqualify a candidate
or member from being appointed to, or serving as a member of, a panel or committee on the basis of disclosures made.

]

A. A candidate shall disclose any interest, relationship or matter that is likely to affect the candidate's independence
or impartiality or that might reasonably create an appearance of impropriety or an apprehension of bias in the proceeding.
To this end, a candidate shall make all reasonable efforts to become aware of any such interests, relationships and
matters.

The candidate shall disclose such interests, relationships and matters by completing an Initial Disclosure Statement
provided by the Secretariat and sending it to the Secretariat.

<DOCNO> FR940223-2-00200 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940223-2-00100 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, candidates shall disclose the following interests, relationships
and matters:

(1) any financial interest of the candidate

(a) in the proceeding or in its outcome, and

(b) in an administrative proceeding, a domestic court proceeding or another panel or committee proceeding that involves
issues that may be decided in the proceeding for which the candidate is under consideration;

(2) any financial interest of the candidate's employer, partner, business associate or family member

(a) in the proceeding or in its outcome, and

(b) in an administrative proceeding, a domestic court proceeding or another panel or committee proceeding that involves
issues that may be decided in the proceeding for which the candidate is under consideration;

(3) any past or existing financial, business, professional, family or social relationship with any interested parties
in the proceeding, or their counsel, or any such relationship involving a candidate's employer, partner, business
associate or family member; and

(4) public advocacy or legal or other representation concerning an issue in dispute in the proceeding or involving
the same goods.

B. A member in an Article 1904 proceeding shall, after receiving the complaint, disclose any interests, advocacy
or representation referred to in paragraph A (1)(b) or (2)(b) or subsection (4) by completing a Supplementary Disclosure
Statement provided by the Secretariat and sending it to the Secretariat for consideration by the appropriate Parties.

C. Once appointed, a member shall continue to make all reasonable efforts to become aware of any interests, relationships
or matters referred to in section A and shall disclose them. The obligation to disclose is a continuing duty which requires
a member to disclose any such interests, relationships and matters that may arise during any stage of the proceeding.

The member shall disclose such interests, relationships and matters by communicating them in writing to the Secretariat
for consideration by the appropriate Parties.



III. The Performance of Duties By Candidates and Members



A. A candidate who accepts an appointment as a member shall be available to perform, and shall perform, a member's duties
thoroughly and expeditiously throughout the course of the proceeding.

B. A member shall ensure that the Secretariat can, at all reasonable times, contact the member in order to conduct panel
or committee business.

C. A member shall carry out all duties fairly and diligently.

D. A member shall comply with the provisions of Chapter 19 or 20 and the applicable rules.

E. A member shall not deny other members the opportunity to participate in all aspects of the proceeding.

F. A member shall consider only those issues raised in the proceeding and necessary to a decision and shall not delegate
the duty to decide to any other person, except as provided in the applicable rules.

G. A member shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that the member's assistant and staff comply with Parts I, II and
VI of this Code of Conduct.

H. A member shall not engage in 

ex parte 

contacts concerning the proceeding.

I. A candidate or member shall not communicate matters concerning actual or potential violations of this Code of Conduct
unless the communication is to the Secretariat or is necessary to ascertain whether that candidate or member has violated
or may violate the Code.

responsibilities to influence the member's conduct or judgment. 
F. A member shall avoid entering into any relationship, or acquiring any financial interest, that is likely to affect

A. For a period of one year after the completion of an Article 1904 proceeding, a former member shall not personally
advise or represent any participant in the proceeding with regard to antidumping or countervailing duty matters.

member's duties or would benefit from the decision of the panel or committee. 


VI. Maintenance of Confidentiality 


A. A member or former member shall not at any time disclose or use any non-public information concerning the proceeding
or acquired during the proceeding except for the purposes of the proceeding and shall not, in any case, disclose or
use any such information to gain personal advantage or advantage for others or to affect adversely the interest of

Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; Notice

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final policy guidance.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary of Education issues final policy guidance on Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its implementing
regulations. The final policy guidance discusses the applicability of the statute's and regulations' nondiscrimination
requirement to student financial aid that is awarded, at least in part, on the basis of race or national origin. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On December 10, 1991, the Department published a notice of proposed policy guidance and request for public comment
in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 64548). The purpose of the proposed guidance and of this final guidance is to help clarify how colleges can use
financial aid to promote campus diversity and access of minority students to postsecondary education without violating
Federal anti-discrimination laws. The Secretary of Education encourages continued use of financial aid as a means
to provide equal educational opportunity and to provide a diverse educational environment for all students. The
Secretary also encourages the use by postsecondary institutions of other efforts to recruit and retain minority
students, which are not affected by this policy guidance. 


This guidance is designed to promote these purposes in light of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI), which
states that no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from
participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving
Federal financial assistance. 
The Department has completed its review of this issue, taking into account the results of a recent study by the General
Accounting Office (GAO) and public comments submitted in response to the proposed policy guidance. The Secretary
has determined that the proposed policy guidance interpreted the requirements of Title VI too narrowly in light of
existing regulations and case law. While Title VI requires that strong justifications exist before race or national
origin is used as a basis for awarding financial aid, many of the rationales for existing race-based financial aid
programs described by commenters appear to meet this standard.

The recent report by GAO on current financial aid programs does not indicate the existence of serious problems of noncompliance
with the law in postsecondary institutions. That report found that race-targeted scholarships constitute a very
small percentage of the scholarships awarded to students at postsecondary institutions. The Secretary anticipates
that most existing programs will be able to satisfy the principles set out in this final guidance. 

The Department will use the principles described in this final policy guidance in making determinations concerning
discrimination based on race or national origin in the award of financial aid. These principles describe the circumstances
in which the Department, based on its interpretation of Title VI and relevant case law, believes consideration of
race or national origin in the award of financial aid to be permissible. A financial aid program that falls within one
or more of these principles will be, in the Department's view, in compliance with Title VI.

1

 This guidance is intended to assist colleges in fashioning legally defensible affirmative action programs to promote
the access of minority students to postsecondary education. The Department will offer technical assistance to colleges
in reexamining their financial aid programs based on this guidance. 





This notice consists of five simply stated principles and a section containing a legal analysis for each principle.
The legal analysis addresses the major comments received in response to the notice of proposed policy guidance. 



Summary of Changes in the Final Policy Guidance 



Almost 600 written responses were received by the Department in response to the proposed policy guidance, many with
detailed suggestions and analysis. Many additional suggestions and concerns were raised in meetings between Department
officials and representatives of postsecondary institutions and civil rights groups. The vast majority of comments
expressed support for the objective of clarifying the options colleges have to use financial aid to promote student
diversity and access of minorities to postsecondary education without violating Title VI. Many comments, however,
took issue with specific principles in the proposed policy guidance and questioned whether those principles would
be effective in accomplishing this purpose. 

As more fully explained in the legal analysis section of this document, after reviewing the public comments and reexamining
the legal precedents in light of those comments, the Department has revised the policy guidance in the following respects:


(1) Principle 3_``Financial Aid to Remedy Past Discrimination''_has been amended to permit a college to award financial
aid based on race or national origin as part of affirmative action to remedy the effects of its past discrimination
without waiting for a finding to be made by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), a court, or a legislative body, if the college
has a strong basis in evidence of discrimination justifying the use of race-targeted scholarships. 

(2) Principle 4_``Financial Aid to Create Diversity''_has been amended to permit the award of financial aid on the
basis of race or national origin if the aid is a necessary and narrowly tailored means to accomplish a college's goal
to have a diverse student body that will enrich its academic environment. 

(3) Principle 5_``Private Gifts Restricted by Race or National Origin''_has been amended to clarify that a college
can administer financial aid from private donors that is restricted on the basis of race or national origin only if
that aid is consistent with the other principles in this policy guidance. 

(4) A provision has been added to permit historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to participate in race-targeted
programs for black students established by third parties if the programs are not limited to students at HBCUs. 

(5) Provisions in the proposed policy guidance for a transition period have been revised to provide that, as far as
the Department's enforcement efforts are concerned_

(a) Colleges and other recipients of federal financial assistance will have a reasonable period of time_up to two
years_to review their financial aid programs and to make any adjustments necessary to come into compliance with the
principles in this final policy guidance; 

(b) No student who has received or applied for financial aid at the time this guidance becomes effective will lose aid
as a result of this guidance. Thus, if an award of financial aid is inconsistent with the principles in this guidance,
a college or other recipient of Federal financial assistance may continue to provide the aid to a student during the
course of his or her enrollment in the academic program for which the aid was awarded, if the student had either applied
for or received the aid prior to the effective date of this policy guidance. 



Principles
 


Definitions 



For purposes of these principles_



College

Financial aid

 includes scholarships, grants, loans, work-study, and fellowships that are made available to assist a student to
pay for his or her education at a college.
 


Race-neutral

 means not based, in whole or in part, on race or national origin. 



Race-targeted, race-based,

 and 

awarded on the basis of race or national origin

 mean limited to individuals of a particular race or races or national origin or origins.

<TEXT>
 

Principle 1: Financial Aid for Disadvantaged Students 



A college may make awards of financial aid to disadvantaged students, without regard to race or national origin, even
if that means that these awards go disproportionately to minority students. 

Financial aid may be earmarked for students from low-income families. Financial aid also may be earmarked for students
from school districts with high dropout rates, or students from single-parent families, or students from families
in which few or no members have attended college. None of these or other race-neutral ways of identifying and providing
aid to disadvantaged students present Title VI problems. A college may use funds from any source to provide financial
aid to disadvantaged students. 



Principle 2: Financial Aid Authorized by Congress 



A college may award financial aid on the basis of race or national origin if the aid is awarded under a Federal statute
that authorizes the use of race or national origin. 



Principle 3: Financial Aid To Remedy Past Discrimination 



A college may award financial aid on the basis of race or national origin if the aid is necessary to overcome the effects
of past discrimination. A finding of discrimination may be made by a court or by an administrative agency_such as the
Department's Office for Civil Rights. Such a finding may also be made by a State or local legislative body, as long as
the legislature has a strong basis in evidence identifying discrimination within its jurisdiction for which that
remedial action is necessary. 

In addition, a college may award financial aid on the basis of race or national origin to remedy its past discrimination
without a formal finding of discrimination by a court or by an administrative or legislative body. The college must
be prepared to demonstrate to a court or administrative agency that there is a strong basis in evidence for concluding
that the college's action was necessary to remedy the effects of its past discrimination. If the award of financial
aid based on race or national origin is justified as a remedy for past discrimination, the college may use funds from
any source, including unrestricted institutional funds and privately donated funds restricted by the donor for
aid based on race or national origin. 

A State may award financial aid on the basis of race or 
national origin, under the preceding standards, if the aid is necessary to overcome its own past discrimination or
discrimination at colleges in the State. 



Principle 4: Financial Aid To Create Diversity 



America is unique because it has forged one Nation from many people of a remarkable number of different backgrounds.
Many colleges seek to create on campus an intellectual environment that reflects that diversity. A college should
have substantial discretion to weigh many factors_including race and national origin_in its efforts to attract
and retain a student population of many different experiences, opinions, backgrounds, and cultures_provided that
the use of race or national origin is consistent with the constitutional standards reflected in Title VI, 

i.e.,

 that it is a narrowly tailored means to achieve the goal of a diverse student body. 

There are several possible options for a college to promote its First Amendment interest in diversity. First, a college
may, of course, use its financial aid program to promote diversity by considering factors other than race or national
origin, such as geographic origin, diverse experiences, or socioeconomic background. Second, a college may consider
race or national origin with other factors in awarding financial aid if the aid is necessary to further the college's
interest in diversity. Third, a college may use race or national origin as a condition of eligibility in awarding financial
aid if this use is narrowly tailored, or, in other words, if it is necessary to further its interest in diversity and
does not unduly restrict access to financial aid for students who do not meet the race-based eligibility criteria.


Among the considerations that affect a determination of whether awarding race-targeted financial aid is narrowly
tailored to the goal of diversity are (1) whether race-neutral means of achieving that goal have been or would be ineffective;
(2) whether a less extensive or intrusive use of race or national origin in awarding financial aid as a means of achieving
that goal has been or would be ineffective; (3) whether the use of race or national origin is of limited extent and duration
and is applied in a flexible manner; (4) whether the institution regularly reexamines its use of race or national origin
in awarding financial aid to determine whether it is still necessary to achieve its goal; and (5) whether the effect
of the use of race or national origin on students who are not beneficiaries of that use is sufficiently small and diffuse
so as not to create an undue burden on their opportunity to receive financial aid. 

If the use of race or national origin in awarding financial aid is justified under this principle, the college may use
funds from any source. 



Principle 5: Private Gifts Restricted by Race or National Origin 



Title VI does not prohibit an individual or an organization that is not a recipient of Federal financial assistance
from directly giving scholarships or other forms of financial aid to students based on their race or national origin.
Title VI simply does not apply. 

The provisions of Principles 3 and 4 apply to the use of race-targeted privately donated funds by a college and may justify
awarding these funds on the basis of race or national origin if the college is remedying its past discrimination pursuant
to Principle 3 or attempting to achieve a diverse student body pursuant to Principle 4. In addition, a college may use
privately donated funds that are not restricted by their donor on the basis of race or national origin to make awards
to disadvantaged students as described in Principle 1.

Additional Guidance 



Financial Aid at Historically Black Colleges and Universities 



Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), as defined in Title III of the Higher Education Act (Title
III), 
20 U.S.C. 1061, are unique among institutions of higher education in America because of their role in serving students
who were denied access to postsecondary education based on their race.

2

 Congress has made numerous findings reflecting the special role and needs of these institutions in light of the history
of discrimination by States and the Federal Government against both the institutions and their students and has required
enhancement of these institutions as a remedy for this history of discrimination. 





Based upon the extensive congressional findings concerning HBCUs, and consistent with congressional and Executive
Branch efforts to enhance and strengthen HBCUs, the Department interprets Title VI to permit these institutions
to participate in student aid programs established by third parties that target financial aid to black students,
if those programs are not limited to students at the HBCUs. These would include programs to which HBCUs contribute
their own institutional funds if necessary for participation in the programs. Precluding HBCUs from these programs
would have an unintended negative effect on their ability to recruit talented student bodies and would undermine
congressional actions aimed at enhancing these institutions. HBCUs may not create their own race-targeted programs
using institutional funds, nor may they accept privately donated race-targeted aid limited to students at the HBCUs,
unless they satisfy the requirements of any of the other principles in this guidance.

3

 





Transition Period 



Although the Department anticipates that most financial aid programs that consider race or national origin in awarding
assistance will be found to be consistent with one or more of the principles in this final policy guidance, there will
be some programs that require adjustment to comply with Title VI. In order to permit colleges time to assess their programs
and to make any necessary adjustments in an orderly manner_and to ensure that students who already have either applied
for or received financial aid do not lose their student aid as a result of the issuance of this policy guidance_there
will be a transition period during which the Department will work with colleges that require assistance to bring them
into compliance.

4

 





The Department will afford colleges up to two academic years to adjust their programs for new students. However, to
the extent that a college does not need the full two years to make adjustments to its financial aid programs, the Department
expects that the adjustments will be made as soon as practicable. 

No student who is currently receiving financial aid, or who has applied for aid prior to the effective date of this policy
guidance, should lose aid as a result of this guidance. Thus, if a college determines that a financial aid program is
not permissible under this policy guidance, the college may continue to provide assistance awarded on the basis of
race or national origin to students during the entire course of their academic program at the college, even if that
period extends beyond the two-year transition period, if the students had either applied for or received that assistance
prior to the effective date of this policy. 



Legal Analysis 



Introduction 



The Department of Education is responsible for enforcing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d 

et seq.

, at institutions receiving Federal education funds. Section 601 of Title VI provides that no person in the United
States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits
of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. 42 U.S.C.
2000d.

<PARENT> FR940223-2-00101 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Department has issued regulations implementing Title VI that are applicable to all recipients of financial assistance
from the Department. 34 CFR part 100. The regulations prohibit discrimination in the administration of financial
aid programs. Specifically, they prohibit a recipient, on the basis of race, color, or national origin, from denying
financial aid; providing different aid; subjecting anyone to separate or different treatment in any matter related
to financial aid; restricting the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving financial
aid; and treating anyone differently in determining eligibility or other requirements for financial aid. 34 CFR
100.3(b)(1); see also 34 CFR 100.3(b)(2). 

In addition to prohibiting discrimination, the Title VI regulations require that a recipient that has previously
discriminated ``must take affirmative action to overcome the effects of prior discrimination.'' 34 CFR 100.3(b)(6)(i).
The regulations also permit recipients to take voluntary affirmative action ``[e]ven in the absence of such prior
discrimination * * * to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation
by persons of a particular race, color, or national origin'' in the recipient's programs. 34 CFR 100.3(b)(6)(ii);
see 34 CFR 100.5(i). 

The permissibility of awarding student financial aid based, in whole or in part, on a student's race or national origin
involves an interpretation of the preceding provisions concerning affirmative action. The Supreme Court has made
clear that Title VI prohibits intentional classifications based on race or national origin for the purpose of affirmative
action to the same extent and under the same standards as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Guardians Ass'n

 v. 

Civil Service Commission of the City of New York,

 463 U.S. 582 (1983); 

Regents of the University of California

 v. 

Bakke,

 438 U.S. 265 (1978). Thus, the Department's interpretation of the general language of the Title VI regulations concerning
permissible affirmative action is based on case law under both Title VI and the Fourteenth Amendment. 





The following discussion addresses the legal basis for each of the five principles set out in the Department's policy
guidance. 



1. Financial Aid for Disadvantaged Students 



The first principle provides that colleges may award financial aid to disadvantaged students. Colleges are free
to define the circumstances under which students will be considered to be disadvantaged, as long as that determination
is not based on race or national origin. 

As some commenters noted, the Title VI regulations prohibit actions that, while not intentionally discriminatory,
have the effect of discriminating on the basis of race or national origin. 34 CFR 100.3(b)(2); see 

Guardians Ass'n

 v. 

Civil Service Commission of the City of New York, supra; Lau

 v. 

Nichols,

 414 U.S. 563 (1974). However, actions that have a disproportionate effect on students of a particular race or national
origin are permissible under Title VI if they bear a ``manifest demonstrable relationship'' to the recipient's educational
mission. 

Georgia State Conference of Branches of NAACP

 v. 

State of Georgia,

 775 F.2d 1403, 1418 11th Cir. (1985). It is the Department's view that awarding financial aid to disadvantaged students
provides a sufficiently strong educational purpose to justify any racially disproportionate effect the use of this
criterion may entail. In particular, the Department believes that an applicant's character, motivation, and ability
to overcome economic and educational disadvantage are educationally justified considerations in both admission
and financial aid decisions. Therefore, the award of financial assistance to disadvantaged students does not violate
Title VI. 



2. Financial Aid Authorized by Congress 



This principle states that a college may award financial aid on the basis of race or national origin if the use of race
or national origin in awarding that aid is authorized by Federal statute. This is because financial aid programs for
minority students that are authorized by a specific Federal law cannot be considered to violate another Federal law,


i.e.

, Title VI. In the case of the establishment of federally funded financial aid programs, such as the Patricia Roberts
Harris Fellowship, the authorization of specific minority scholarships by that legislation prevails over the general
prohibition of discrimination in Title VI.

6

 This result also is consistent with the canon of construction under which the specific provisions of a statute prevail
over the general provisions of the same or a different statute. See 2A N. Singer 

Sutherland Statutory Construction

 section 46.05 (5th ed. 1992); 

Radzanower

 v. 

Touche Ross and Co.

, 426 U.S. 148, 153 (1976); 

Morton

 v. 

Mancari,

 417 U.S. 535, 550-51 (1974); 

Fourco Glass Co.

 v. 

Transmira Products Corp.,

 353 U.S. 225, 228-29 (1957). 





Some commenters argued that the existence of congressionally authorized race-targeted financial aid programs
supports the position that all race-targeted financial aid programs are permissible under Title VI. However, the
fact that Congress has enacted specific Federal programs for race-targeted financial aid does not serve as an authorization
for States or colleges to create their own programs for awarding student financial aid based on race or national origin.




3. Financial Aid To Remedy Past Discrimination 



Classifications based on race or national origin, including affirmative action measures, are ``suspect'' classifications
that are subject to strict scrutiny by the courts. 

Regents of the University of California

 v. 

Bakke,

 438 U.S. at 292. The use of those classifications must be based on a compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly
tailored to serve that interest. 

Richmond

 v. 

J.A. Croson Co.

, 488 U.S. 469 (1989); 

Wygant

 v. 

Jackson Board of Education

, 476 U.S. 267 (1986). 

The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring the elimination of
discrimination on the basis of race or national origin. To further this governmental interest, the Supreme Court
has sanctioned the use of race-conscious measures to eliminate discrimination.

United States

 v. 

Fordice, supra

, the Court found that States that operated 

de jure

 systems of higher education have an affirmative obligation to ensure that no vestiges of the de jure system continue
to have a discriminatory effect on the basis of race.

The implementing regulations for Title VI provide that a recipient of Federal financial assistance that has previously
discriminated in violation of the statute or regulations must take affirmative action to overcome the effects of
the past discrimination. 34 CFR 100.3(b)(6)(i). Thus, a college that has been found to have discriminated against
students on the basis of race or national origin must take steps to remedy that discrimination. That remedial action
may include the awarding of financial aid to students from the racial or national origin groups that have been discriminated
against.

The proposed policy guidance provided that a finding of past discrimination could be made by a court or by an administrative
agency, such as the Department's Office for Civil Rights. It also could be made by a State or local legislative body,
as long as the legislature requiring the affirmative action had a strong basis in evidence identifying discrimination
within its jurisdiction for which that remedial action is required.

A number of commenters argued that colleges should be able to take remedial action without waiting for a formal finding
by a court, administrative agency, or legislature. The Department agrees. The final policy guidance provides that,
even in the absence of a finding by a court, legislature, or administrative agency, a college_in order to remedy its
past discrimination_may implement a remedial race-targeted financial aid program. It may do so if it has a strong
basis in evidence for concluding that this affirmative action is necessary to remedy the effects of its past discrimination
and its financial aid program is narrowly tailored to remedy that discrimination. Permitting colleges to remedy
the effects of their past discrimination without waiting for a formal finding is consistent with the approach taken
by the Supreme Court in 

Wygant

 v. 

Jackson Board of Education, supra.

 In 

Wygant,

 the Court clarified that a school district's race-conscious voluntary affirmative action plan could be upheld based
on subsequent judicial findings of past discrimination by the district. 

Wygant

 v. 

Jackson Board of Education,

 476 U.S. at 277.

In the 

Wygant

 case, teachers challenged their school board's adoption, through a collective bargaining agreement, of a layoff
plan that included provisions protecting employees from layoffs on the basis of their race. The school board contended,
among other things, that the plan's race-conscious layoff provisions were constitutional because they were adopted
to remedy the school board's own prior discrimination. 

Id.,

 at 276, 277. Justice Powell, in a plurality opinion, stated that a public employer must have ``convincing evidence''
that an affirmative action plan is warranted by past discrimination before undertaking that plan. 

Id.,

 at 277. If the plan is challenged by employees who are harmed by the plan, the court must then make a determination that
the employer had a ``strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action was necessary.'' 

Id.



In a concurring opinion, Justice O'Connor agreed that a ``contemporaneous or antecedent finding of past discrimination
by a court was not a constitutional prerequisite to a public employer's voluntary agreement to an affirmative action
plan.'' 

Id.,

 at 289. She explained that contemporaneous or antecedent findings were not necessary because ``A violation of Federal
statutory or constitutional requirements does not arise with the making of findings; it arises when the wrong is committed.''
Moreover, she explained that important values would be sacrificed if contemporaneous findings were required because
``a requirement that public employers make findings that they engaged in illegal discrimination before they engage
in affirmative action programs would severely undermine public employers' incentive to meet voluntarily their
civil rights obligations.'' 

Id.,

 at 289, 290 (citations omitted).

In 

Richmond

 v. 

J.A. Croson, supra,

 the Court again emphasized that remedial race-conscious action must be based on strong evidence of discrimination.
That case involved the constitutionality of a city ordinance establishing a plan to remedy past discrimination by
requiring prime contractors awarded city construction contracts to subcontract at least 30% of the dollar amount
of each contract to minority-controlled businesses. The Court found that the city council had failed to make sufficient
factual findings to demonstrate a ``strong basis in evidence'' of racial discrimination ``by anyone in the Richmond
construction industry.'' 

Richmond

 v. 

J.A. Croson,

 488 U.S. at 500.

Evidence of past discrimination may, but need not, include documentation of specific incidents of intentional discrimination.
Instead, evidence of a statistically significant disparity between the percentage of minority students in a college's
student body and the percentage of qualified minorities in the relevant pool of college-bound high school graduates
may be sufficient. Such an approach is analogous to cases of employment discrimination where the courts accept statistical
evidence to infer intentional discrimination against minority job applicants. See 

Hazelwood School District

 v. 

United States,

 433 U.S. 299 (1977).

Based on this case law, Principle 3 provides that a college may award race-targeted scholarships to remedy discrimination
as found by a court or by an administrative agency, such as the Department's Office for Civil Rights. OCR often has approved
race-targeted financial aid programs as part of a Title VI remedial plan to eliminate the vestiges of prior discrimination
within a State higher education system that previously was operated as a racially segregated dual system. As indicated
by the 

Croson

 decision, a finding of past discrimination also may be made by a State or local legislative body, as long as the legislature
has a strong basis in evidence identifying discrimination within its jurisdiction. The remedial use of race-targeted
financial aid must be narrowly tailored to remedy the effects of the discrimination.

<DOCNO> FR940223-2-00208 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940223-2-00101 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As revised, Principle 3 also allows a college to award student aid on the basis of race or national origin as part of affirmative
action to remedy the effects of the school's past discrimination without waiting for a finding to be made by OCR, a court,
or a legislative body, if the college has convincing evidence of past discrimination justifying the affirmative
action. The Department's Title VI regulations, like the Fourteenth Amendment, do not require that antecedent or
contemporaneous findings of past discrimination be made before remedial affirmative action is implemented, as
long as the college has a strong basis in evidence of its past discrimination. Allowing colleges to implement narrowly
tailored remedial affirmative action if there is strong evidentiary support for it_without requiring that it be
delayed until a finding is made by OCR, a court, or a legislative body_will assist in ensuring that Title VI's mandate
against discrimination based on race or national origin is achieved.



4. Financial Aid To Create Diversity



The Title VI regulations permit a college to take voluntary affirmative action, even in the absence of past discrimination,
in response to conditions that have limited the participation at the college of students of a particular race or national
origin. 34 CFR 100.3(b)(6)(ii); see 34 CFR 100.5(i). In 

Regents of the University of California

 v. 

Bakke, supra,

 the Supreme Court considered whether the University could take voluntary affirmative action by setting aside places
in each medical school class for which only minority students could compete.

7







The Court considered four rationales provided by the University of California for taking race and national origin
into account in making admissions decisions: (1) To reduce the historic deficit of traditionally disfavored minorities
in medical schools and the medical profession. (2) To counter the effects of societal discrimination. (3) To increase
the number of physicians who would practice in communities lacking medical services. (4) To obtain the educational
benefits of a diverse student body. Similar arguments have been advanced in response to the Department's proposed
policy guidance on student financial assistance awarded on the basis of race or national origin.

The Court rejected the first three justifications. The first reason was rejected as facially invalid because setting
aside a fixed number of admission spaces only to ensure that members of a specified race are admitted was found to be
racial ``discrimination for its own sake.'' 

Regents of the University of California

 v. 

Bakke,

 438 U.S. at 307. In rejecting the second contention that the effects of societal discrimination warranted the racial
preferences, the Court recognized that the State had a substantial interest in eliminating the effects of discrimination,
but that interest was found to be limited to ``redress[ing] the wrongs worked by specific instances of discrimination.''


Id.

 The third contention, concerning the provision of health care services to underserved communities, was rejected
by the 

Bakke

 Court as an evidentiary matter because the State had ``not carried its burden of demonstrating that it must prefer
members of particular ethnic groups over all other individuals in order to promote better health-care delivery to
deprived citizens.'' 

Id.,

 at 311.

With respect to the final objective, the ``attainment of a diverse student body,'' Justice Powell found that_




This clearly is a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education. Academic freedom, though
not a specifically enumerated constitutional right, long has been viewed as a special concern of the First Amendment.
The freedom of a university to make its own judgments as to education includes the selection of its student body.






Id.,

 at 311, 312. Thus, colleges have a First Amendment right to seek diversity in admissions to fulfill their academic
mission through the ``robust exchange of ideas'' that flows from a diverse student body. 

Id.,

 at 312-313.

8

 However, the means to achieve this ``countervailing constitutional interest'' under the First Amendment must comport
with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Medical School's policy of setting aside a fixed number of
admission spaces solely for minorities was found not to pass the Fourteenth Amendment's strict scrutiny test, because
the policy's use of race as a condition of eligibility for the slots was not necessary to promote the school's diversity
interest. 

Id.,

 at 315-316. Justice Powell found that the Medical School could advance its diversity interest under the First
Amendment in a narrowly tailored manner that passed the Fourteenth Amendment's strict scrutiny test by using race
or national origin as one of several factors that would be considered as a plus factor for an applicant in the admissions
process. 

Id.,

 at 317-319.





Following the 

Bakke

 decision, the Department reexamined its Title VI regulations to determine whether any changes were necessary. In
a policy interpretation published in the 

Federal Register

 (44 FR 58509), the Department concluded that no change was warranted. The Department determined that the Title VI
regulatory provision authorizing voluntary affirmative action was consistent with the Court's decision and that
the provision would be interpreted to incorporate the limitations on voluntary affirmative action announced by
the Court.

9

 Thus, if a college's use of race or national origin in awarding financial aid meets the Supreme Court's test under the
Fourteenth Amendment for permissible voluntary affirmative action, it will also meet the requirements of Title
VI.





In the Department's proposed policy guidance on financial aid, a principle was included permitting the use of race
or national origin as a ``plus'' factor in awarding student aid. The basis for the principle was the 

Bakke

 decision and the Department's assessment that using an approach that had been approved by the Supreme Court as narrowly
tailored to achieve diversity in the admissions context also would be permissible in awarding financial aid.

10







In response to the proposed policy, many colleges submitted comments arguing that the use of race or national origin
as a plus factor in awarding financial aid may be inadequate to achieve diversity. They contended that, in some cases,
it may be necessary to designate a limited amount of aid for students of a particular race or national origin. According
to those commenters, a college's financial aid program can serve a critical role in achieving a diverse student body
in at least three respects: First, the availability of financial aid set aside for members of a particular race or national
origin serves as a recruitment tool, encouraging applicants to consider the school. Second, it provides a means of
encouraging students who are offered admission to accept the offer and enroll at the school. Finally, it assists colleges
in retaining students until they complete their program of studies.

The commenters argued that a college_because of its location, its reputation (whether deserved or not) of being inhospitable
to minority students, or its number of minority graduates_may be unable to recruit sufficient minority applicants
even if race or national origin is considered a positive factor in admissions and the award of aid. That is, the failure
to attract a sufficient number of minority applicants who meet the academic requirements of the college will make
it impossible for the college to enroll a diverse student body, even if race or national origin is given a competitive
``plus'' in the admissions process. In addition, a college that has sufficient minority applicants to offer admission
to a diverse group of applicants may find that, absent the availability of financial aid set aside for minority students,
its offers of admission are disproportionately rejected by minority applicants.

<TEXT>
 

Furthermore, commenters were concerned that, while there may be large amounts of financial aid available for undergraduates
at their institutions, there may be insufficient aid for graduate students, almost all of whom are able to demonstrate
financial need. Thus, it is possible that a college that is able to achieve a diverse student body in some of its programs
using race-neutral financial aid criteria or using race or national origin as a ``plus'' factor may find it necessary
to use race or national origin as a condition of eligibility in awarding limited amounts of financial aid to achieve
diversity in some of its other programs, such as its graduate school or particular undergraduate schools. 

The Department agrees with the commenters that in the circumstances they have described it may be necessary for a college
to set aside financial aid to be awarded on the basis of race or national origin in order to achieve a diverse student
body. Whether a college's use of race-targeted financial aid is ``narrowly tailored'' to achieve this compelling
interest involves a case-by-case determination that is based on the particular circumstances involved. The Department
has determined, based on the comments, to expand Principle 4 to permit those case-by-case determinations. 

The Court in 

Bakke

 indicated that race or national origin could be used in making admissions decisions to further the compelling interest
of a diverse student body even though the effect might be to deny admission to some students who did not receive a competitive
``plus'' based on race or ethnicity.

11

 However, the use of a set-aside of places in the entering class was impermissible because it was not necessary to the
goal of diversity. In cases since 

Bakke,

 the Supreme Court has provided additional guidance on the factors to be considered in determining whether a classification
based on race or national origin is narrowly tailored to its purpose. These factors will be considered by the Department
in assessing whether a college's race-targeted financial aid program meets the requirements of Title VI. 





First, it is necessary to determine the efficacy of alternative approaches. 

United States

 v. 

Paradise,

 480 U.S. at 171. Thus, it is important that consideration has been given to the use of alternative approaches that are
less intrusive (

e.g

., the use of race or national origin as a ``plus'' factor rather than as a condition of eligibility). 

Metro Broadcasting, Inc.

 v. 

F.C.C.,

 497 U.S. at 583; 

Richmond

 v. 

J.A. Croson,

 488 U.S. at 507. Financial aid that is restricted to students of a particular race or national origin should be used
only if a college determines that these alternative approaches have not or will not be effective. 

Second, the extent, duration, and flexibility of the racial classification must be addressed. 

Metro Broadcasting, Inc. 

v. 

F.C.C.,

 497 U.S. at 594; 

United States 

v. 

Paradise,

 480 U.S. at 171. The extent of the use of the classification should be no greater than is necessary to carry out its purpose.


Richmond

 v. 

J.A. Croson,

 488 U.S. at 507. That is, the amount of financial aid that is awarded based on race or national origin should be no greater
than is necessary to achieve a diverse student body.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940223-2-00210 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940223-2-00101 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The duration of the use of a racial classification should be no longer than is necessary to its purpose, and the classification
should be periodically reexamined to determine whether there is a continued need for its use. 

Metro Broadcasting, Inc.

 v. 

F.C.C.,

 497 U.S. at 594. Thus, the use of race-targeted financial aid should continue only while it is necessary to achieve
a diverse student body, and an assessment as to whether that continues to be the case should be made on a regular basis.


In addition, the use of the classification should be sufficiently flexible that exceptions can be made if appropriate.
For example, the Supreme Court in 

United States 

v. 

Paradise

 found that a race-conscious promotion requirement was flexible in operation because it could be waived if no qualified
candidates were available. 480 U.S. at 177. Similarly, racial restrictions on the award of financial aid could be
waived if there were no qualified applicants. 

Finally, the burden on those who are excluded from the benefit conferred by the classification based on race or national
origin (

i.e.,

 non-minority students) must be considered. 

Id.,

 at 171. A use of race or national origin may impose such a severe burden on particular individuals_for example, eliminating
scholarships currently received by non-minority students in order to start a scholarship program for minority students_that
it is too intrusive to be considered narrowly tailored. See 

Wygant 

v. 

Jackson Board of Education, 

476 U.S. at 283 (use of race in imposing layoffs involves severe disruption to lives of identifiable individuals).
Generally, the less severe and more diffuse the impact on non-minority students, the more likely a classification
based on race or national origin will address this factor satisfactorily. However, it is not necessary to show that
no student's opportunity to receive financial aid has been in any way diminished by the use of the race-targeted aid.
Rather, the use of race-targeted financial aid must not place an undue burden on students who are not eligible for that
aid. 


A number of commenters argued that race-targeted financial aid is a minimally intrusive method to attain a diverse
student body, far more limited in its impact on non-minority students, for example, than race-targeted admissions
policies. Under this view, and unlike the admissions plan at issue in 

Bakke,

 a race-targeted financial aid award could be a narrowly tailored means of achieving the compelling interest in diversity.


The Department agrees that there are important differences between admissions and financial aid. The affirmative
action admissions program struck down in 

Bakke

 had the effect of excluding applicants from the university on the basis of their race. The use of race-targeted financial
aid, on the other hand, does not, in and of itself, dictate that a student would be foreclosed from attending a college
solely on the basis of race. Moreover, in contrast to the number of admissions slots, the amount of financial aid available
to students is not necessarily fixed. For example, a college's receipt of privately donated monies restricted to
an underrepresented group might increase the total pool of funds for student aid in a situation in which, absent the
ability to impose such a limitation, the donor might not provide any aid at all. 

Even in the case of a college's own funds, a decision to bar the award of race-targeted financial aid will not necessarily
translate into increased resources for students from non-targeted groups. Funds for financial aid restricted by
race or national origin that are viewed as a recruitment device might be rechanneled into other methods of recruitment
if restricted financial aid is barred. In other words, unlike admission to a class with a fixed number of places, the
amount of financial aid may increase or decrease based on the functions it is perceived to promote. 

In summary, a college can use its financial aid program to promote diversity by considering factors other than race
or national origin, such as geographic origin, diverse experiences, or socioeconomic background. In addition,
a college may take race or national origin into account as one factor, with other factors, in awarding financial aid
if necessary to promote diversity. Finally, a college may use race or national origin as a condition of eligibility
in awarding financial aid if it is narrowly tailored to promote diversity. 



5. Private Gifts Restricted by Race or National Origin
 


The fifth principle sets out the circumstances under which a recipient college can award financial aid provided by
private donors that is restricted on the basis of race or national origin. 

As noted by many commenters, pursuant to the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, all of the operations of a college
are covered by Title VI if the college receives any Federal financial assistance. 42 U.S.C. 2000d-4a(2)(A). Since
a college's award of privately donated financial aid is within the operations of the college, the college must comply
with the requirements of Title VI in awarding those funds.

12

 





A college may award privately donated financial aid on the basis of race or national origin if the college is remedying
its past discrimination pursuant to Principle 3 or attempting to achieve a diverse student body pursuant to Principle
4. In other words, Principles 3 and 4 apply to the use of privately donated funds and may justify awarding these funds
on the basis of race or national origin in accordance with the wishes of the donor. Similarly, under Principle 1, a college
may award privately donated financial aid that is restricted to disadvantaged students. 

Some commenters were uncertain whether it is permissible under Title VI for a college to solicit private donations
of student financial aid that are restricted to students of a particular race or national origin. If the receipt and
award of these funds is permitted by Title VI, that is, in the circumstances previously described, it is similarly
permissible to solicit the funds from private sources. 



Financial Aid at Historically Black Colleges and Universities 



To ensure that the principles in this policy guidance do not subvert congressional efforts to enhance historically
black colleges and universities (HBCUs), these institutions may participate in student aid programs established
by third parties for black students that are not limited to students at the HBCUs and may use their own institutional
funds in those programs if necessary for participation.

13

 See 20 U.S.C. 1051, 1060, and 1132c (congressional findings of past discrimination against HBCUs and of the need for
enhancement). 





This finding is based upon congressional findings of past discrimination against HBCUs and the students they have
traditionally served, as well as the Department's determination that these institutions and their students would
be harmed if precluded from participation in programs created by third parties that designate financial aid for black
students. That action would have an unintended negative effect on their ability to recruit excellent student bodies
and could undermine congressional actions aimed at enhancing these institutions. 

Congress has repeatedly made findings that recognize the unique historical mission and important role that HBCUs
play in the American system of higher education, and particularly in providing equal educational opportunity for
black students. 20 U.S.C. 1051, 1060, and 1132c. Congress has created programs that strengthen and enhance HBCUs
in Titles II through VII of the Higher Education Act, as amended by Public Law 99-498, 20 U.S.C. 1021-1132i-2.
It has found that ``there is a particular national interest in aiding institutions of higher education that have historically
served students who have been denied access to postsecondary education because of race or national origin . . .
so that equality of access and quality of postsecondary education opportunities may be enhanced for all students.''
20 U.S.C. 1051. ``A key link to the chain of expanding college opportunity for African American youth is strengthening
the Nation's historically Black colleges and universities.'' House Report No. 102-447, 1992 U.S. Code Cong.
and Adm. News p. 353.

Congress has found that ``the current state of HBCUs is partly attributable to the discriminatory action of the States
and the Federal Government and this discriminatory action requires the remedy of enhancement of Black postsecondary
institutions to ensure their continuation and participation in fulfilling the Federal mission of equality of educational
opportunity.'' 20 U.S.C. 1060. See also, House Report No. 102-447, 1992 U.S. Code Cong. and Adm. News p. 353;
House Report No. 99-383, 1986 U.S. Code Cong. and Adm. News 2592-2596. This includes providing access
and quality education to low-income and minority students, and improving HBCUs' academic quality. 20 U.S.C. 1051.

For these same reasons, every Administration in recent years has recognized the special role and contributions of
HBCUs and expressed support for their enhancement. See ``Revised Criteria Specifying the Ingredients of Acceptable
Plans to Desegregate State Systems of Public Higher Education,'' 43 FR 6658 (1977); Exec. Orders Nos. 12232, 45 FR
53437 (1980); 12320, 46 FR 48107 (1981); 12677, 54 FR 18869 (1989); and 12876, 58 FR 58735 (1993). The Department's
own data indicate that HBCUs continue to play a vital role in providing higher education for many black students. In
1989 and 1990, more than one in four black bachelor's degree recipients received their degree from an HBCU (26.7%).
See, ``Historically Black Colleges and Universities, 1976-90'' (U.S. Department of Education, Office of
Educational Research and Improvement, July 1992). 
This policy guidance is not intended to limit the efforts to enhance HBCUs called for by Congress and the President.
The Department recognizes, however, that Principle 3 (remedying past discrimination) and Principle 4 (creating
diversity) may not provide for HBCUs the same possibility of participating in race-targeted programs of financial
aid for black students established by third parties as are provided for other colleges and universities. As some commenters
pointed out, HBCUs continue to enroll a disproportionate percentage of black students and need to be able to compete
for the most talented black students if they are to improve the quality and prestige of their academic environments
and, therefore, enhance their attractiveness to all students regardless of race or national origin. 
HBCUs' abilities to recruit, enroll and retain talented students will be undermined unless HBCUs are permitted to
attract talented black students by participating in aid programs for black students that are established by third
parties in which other colleges, 

i.e.,

 those that meet Principle 3 or 4, participate. Limiting or precluding HBCUs' participation in private programs,
such as the National Achievement Scholarship program, would have an unintended negative effect on their ability
to recruit a talented student body. Under this scholarship program, which is restricted to academically excellent
black students, one type of National Achievement Scholarship is funded by the institution. If HBCUs were unable to
participate in this program, some top black students might be forced to choose between (1) receiving a National Achievement
Scholarship to attend a school that met Principle 3 or 4 and (2) attending an HBCU. For these reasons, the Department
interprets Title VI to permit HBCUs to participate in certain race-targeted aid programs for black students, such
as the National Achievement Scholarship program.

<DOCNO> FR940223-2-00212 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940223-2-00101 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Department reads Title VI consistent with other statutes and Executive orders addressing the special needs and
history of HBCUs. In particular, the Department notes congressional findings of discrimination against black students
that are the basis for enhancement efforts at HBCUs. Additionally, the Department interprets Title VI to permit limited
use of race to avoid an anomalous and absurd result, 

i.e.,

 penalizing HBCUs and students who seek admission to HBCUs, and putting HBCUs at a disadvantage with respect to other
schools precisely because of the special history and composition of the HBCUs. 

The use of race-targeted aid by HBCUs that the Department is interpreting Title VI to permit under this provision is
narrowly tailored to further the congressionally recognized purpose of enhancement of HBCUs. HBCUs may not discriminate
on the basis of race or national origin in admitting students. They may not create their own race-targeted financial
aid programs using their own institutional funds unless they satisfy the requirements of any of the other principles
in this guidance. Nor may they accept private donations of race-targeted aid for black students that are limited to
students at the institution unless otherwise permitted by the guidance. Because HBCUs have traditionally enrolled
black students, it should not subvert the goal of enhancing the institutions to require that they not restrict aid
to black students if using their own funds or funds from private donors that wish to set up financial aid programs at
these institutions. However, because the applicant pool that is attracted to HBCUs presently consists primarily
of black students, HBCUs would be placed at a distinct disadvantage with regard to other colleges in attracting talented
students if they could not participate in financial aid programs set up by third parties for black students. Thus,
the Department interprets Title VI to permit an HBCU to participate in race-targeted financial aid programs for black
students that are created by third parties, if the programs are not restricted to students at HBCUs. 

The participation by HBCUs in those race-targeted aid programs will be subject to periodic reassessment by the Department.
The Department will regularly review the results of enhancement efforts at HBCUs, including the annual report to
the President on the progress achieved in enhancing the role and capabilities of HBCUs required by Section 7 of Executive
Order 12876. If an HBCU has been enhanced to the point that the institution is attractive to individuals regardless
of their race or national origin to the same extent as a non-HBCU, then that institution may participate in only those
race-targeted aid programs that are consistent with the other principles in this policy guidance. 



Transition Period 



The proposed policy guidance would have provided a four-year transition period for individual students to ensure
that they did not lose their financial aid as a result of the guidance. Commenters pointed out that, in some cases, four
years may not be a sufficient time for a student to complete his or her academic program at a college. In addition, commenters
expressed concern that revising the policies and procedures used in recruiting minority students and in providing
student financial assistance would require time to develop and implement. The revisions that have been made to the
final policy guidance should result in far fewer instances in which colleges will be required to change their financial
aid programs. However, the Department recognizes that colleges may need to conduct extensive reviews of their current
programs and that in some cases adjustments to those programs may be necessary. As a result, the Department is expanding
the proposed transition period. 

The Department is providing colleges a reasonable period of time to review and, if necessary, adjust their financial
aid programs in an orderly manner that causes the least possible disruption to their students. Colleges must adjust
their financial aid programs to be consistent with the principles previously set out no later than two years after
the effective date of the Department's policy guidance. However, colleges may continue to provide financial aid
awarded on the basis of race or national origin to students who had either applied for or received that assistance prior
to the effective date of this guidance during the full course of those students' academic program at the college, even
though, in many cases, this will extend beyond the two-year period and, in some cases, the four-year period identified
in the proposed policy.

Although some commenters questioned the Department's authority to create a transition period, such a period for
adjustments is consistent with the Department's approach in the past under other civil rights statutes it enforces.
See 34 CFR 106.41(d) (transition period to permit recipients to bring their athletic programs into compliance with
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972); 34 CFR 104.22(e) (transition period to permit recipients to make facilities
accessible to individuals with disabilities, as required by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973). It is
based on the Department's recognition of the practical difficulties that some colleges may face in making changes
to their recruitment and financial aid award processes. 

The transition period also is consistent with the Department's policy, in approving plans for the desegregation
of State systems of higher education, that students who have been the beneficiaries of past discriminatory conduct
not be required to bear the burden of corrective action. For example, while the Department requires State higher education
systems to take remedial action to increase the enrollment of previously excluded students, it does not require the
expulsion of any student in order to permit admission of those previously excluded. See 

Wygant 

v. 

Jackson Board of Education,

 476 U.S. at 282-85. 

Finally, the transition period is consistent with the Department's obligations under Title VI to seek voluntary
compliance by recipients that have been found in violation of the statute. 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1. During the transition
period, the Department will provide colleges with technical assistance to help them make any necessary changes to
their financial aid programs in order to achieve compliance with Title VI.

Note: 

Although an application that focuses on a subject area other than mathematics, science or foreign languages is not
required to meet paragraph (a) of the competitive priority, the Secretary encourages the applicant to address the
needs of traditionally underserved populations and areas with scarce resources and limited access to courses in
the subject area addressed in the application.



(b) The applicant has secured the direct cooperation and involvement of public and private educational institutions,
State and local government, and industry in planning the network.
(c) The applicant will serve the broadest range of institutions, including, in the case of elementary and secondary
schools, those elementary and secondary schools having significant numbers of children counted for the purpose
of Chapter 1 of Title 1 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, programs providing instruction outside
of the school setting, institutions of higher education, teacher training centers, research institutions, and
private industry.
(d) The applicant will demonstrate that a significant number of educational institutions have agreed to participate
in the use of the telecommunications system for which assistance is sought.
(e) The applicant will have substantial academic and teaching capabilities including the capability of training,
retraining, and inservice upgrading of teaching skills.
(f) The applicant will provide a comprehensive range of courses for educators with different skill levels to teach
them instructional strategies for students with different levels of skills, provide training to participating
educators in ways to integrate telecommunications courses into existing school curricula, and include instruction
for students, teachers, and parents.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice contains three absolute priorities for distance education projects under the Star Schools program.
Under the distance education projects competition, the Star Schools program provides grants to telecommunications
partnerships to support the use of distance education technologies.




The notice also contains one absolute priority for dissemination projects under the Star Schools program. Dissemination
projects provide information and technical assistance concerning distance education technologies to local and
State education agencies.

On October 5, 1993 the Secretary published a notice of proposed priorities for this competition in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 51960).


Public Comment



In the notice of proposed priorities, the Secretary invited comments on the proposed priorities. The Secretary received
one comment in support of the proposed priorities.





Note:

 This notice of final priorities does not solicit applications. A notice inviting applications under these competitions
is published in a separate notice in this issue of the 

Federal Register

.


Priorities



Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3), the Secretary gives an absolute preference for applications that meet the following priorities.
The Secretary funds under the relevant competition only applications that meet one or more of the absolute priorities
established for that competition.


Star Schools Distance Education Projects


Absolute Priority 1_National Education Goals



Projects that develop and deliver instructional programming for elementary or secondary school students, or both,
that supports achievement of one or more of the National Education Goals, and that is consistent with challenging

1. Introduction



1.1 Background



On September 21, 1993, the President signed into law the National and Community Service Trust Act (the ``Act''). The
purpose of the Act is to engage Americans of all ages and backgrounds in community-based service to address the Nation's
educational, public safety, human, and environmental needs. The Act establishes several different types of service
programs designed to accomplish these goals, and establishes the Corporation for National and Community Service
(the ``National Service Corporation'') to administer these programs.
The service program that this Request for Proposals (``RFP'') addresses is the ``AmeriCorps'' program. The AmeriCorps
program will enable dedicated individuals to work on a variety of community and national service programs on a full-time
or part-time basis for a period of at least nine months. In exchange for their contribution, participants will receive
living stipends and, at the end of their terms of service, may receive educational awards to pay for further education
or to pay off student loans.
In order to further the goals of his national service initiative, the President has urged all Federal agencies to explore
ways in which to incorporate national and community service into their Federal programs. To encourage the integration
of national and community service with Federal programs, the National Service Corporation has earmarked up to $16.3
million that may be available specifically for the planning and operation of national and community service programs
to be operated by Federal agencies or by other eligible entities (as defined in Section 1.4.1, ``Eligible Service
Organizations,'' of this RFP) in partnership with Federal agencies. Federal agencies may also apply for educational
awards for program participants.
At the Department of Transportation (``DOT''), we intend to fully embrace this opportunity to use national and community
service programs to further our transportation-related community, state, and national goals. It is our mission
to provide future generations with a transportation system that is safer, more environmentally sound, and more efficient.
The strategic goals that we have set to accomplish this mission go hand-in-hand with the goals of the National and Community
Service Trust Act. At DOT, we are striving to: 



_Tie America together through an effective intermodal transportation system;
_Promote safe and secure transportation;
_Actively enhance our environment through wise transportation decisions;
_Put people first in our transportation system by making it relevant and accessible to users. 



We believe that national and community service can contribute effectively to the achievement of all of these transportation-related
goals.


1.2 Programs and Purpose


Since DOT is new to the community service field, our intent is to tap the resources of existing community service organizations
to implement our national and community service programs. The purpose of this RFP is to solicit proposals from eligible
service organizations for transportation-related national and community service projects. Applicants may submit
proposals involving activities within one or a combination of the five transportation-related programs that have
been developed by DOT as being particularly suitable for national and community service projects:
1. Rehabilitation, Reclamation and Beautification of Transportation-Related Facilities;
2. ``Transit Ambassadors''_providing assistance to the elderly, disabled, and children in Head Start programs
in using public transportation systems;

3. ``Operation Lifesaver''_making rail/highway crossings safer; 

4. Hazardous Materials Transportation Emergency Preparedness Assistance; and 

5. Youth Traffic Safety Education Programs. 

Each of these five programs are explained in more detail later in this RFP and are referred to throughout as the ``DOT
Programs.'' 

DOT will evaluate all of the proposals that it receives based on the criteria and priorities set forth in Section 4 of
this RFP, and will enter into formal agreements to establish partnerships with service organizations that submit
the proposals that are selected. Initially, these projects 
will most likely be concentrated in geographic areas of the greatest need based on the criteria set forth in the regulations
issued under the National and Community Service Trust Act (see ``Needs'' under Section 4.1, ``General Criteria''
in this RFP). However, DOT views these initial projects to be the beginning of a broader, more comprehensive program.


DOT plans to fund the initial projects in these programs through two sources. First, DOT funds appropriated to DOT
agencies will be available to partially finance projects in some of the five DOT Programs in fiscal year 1994. In addition,
DOT may apply to the National Service Corporation for additional funding for operational costs and for educational
awards (if requested) from the funds set aside by the National Service Corporation for Federal agency programs. (Since
there is no guarantee that DOT will receive funding from the National Service Corporation, a proposal selected by
DOT ultimately might not be fully funded or funded at all if DOT's request for funding from the National Service Corporation
is not granted.) The service organizations sponsoring the project will have to provide matching funds for a portion
of project costs. 

Any funds that DOT receives from the National Service Corporation will be from the $16.3 million that has been earmarked
for Federal agencies. Therefore, the DOT Programs may provide service organizations with access to a source of funds
for which they are otherwise not eligible. 

DOT will inform applicants prior to April 15, 1994, as to whether they have been selected to receive DOT funding and
whether they will be included in DOT's application to the National Service Corporation. DOT anticipates that notification
of National Service Corporation awards for Federal agency programs will occur in May or June of 1994. 



1.3 General Program Requirements 



Any proposal submitted under this RFP must comply with the general requirements for service programs that are set
forth in the National and Community Service Trust Act and related regulations. These requirements include: 

1. Employing participants on a full-time basis (1700 hours for a period of not less than nine months and not more than
a year); or on a part-time basis (900 hours for a period of not more than two years, or, if the individual is enrolled in
an institution of higher education while performing all or part of the service, not more than three years). 

2. Employing at least 20 full time equivalent participants unless an explanation is provided as to why a smaller number
is appropriate. 

3. Paying participants a living allowance of at least $7,440 for fiscal year 1994 (but not more than twice that amount).


4. Providing participants with health care benefits and, if necessary, child care benefits during the term of service.


5. Providing for participants to receive educational awards (either from the National Service Corporation or from
some other source) in an amount of $4,725 for one full-time term of service or $2,360 for one part-time term of service,
for up to two terms of service. (If educational awards will not be received by all participants, the program must ensure
that the distribution of educational awards is performed in an equitable manner that treats equally all participants
doing the same or essentially similar work. Distribution based solely on economic needs of participants is not encouraged.)


6. Not displacing other employees or positions, nor supplanting the hiring or promotion of employees. The written
concurrence of any local labor organization representing employees engaged in the same or substantially similar
work must be obtained. 

If a proposal is selected and funded, the service organization will be required to enter into a formal agreement to
establish the partnership with DOT, which will set forth the specific terms and conditions of the partnership arrangement,
including provisions for monitoring and evaluating the project. The selected service organization will also be
required to enter into formal agreements with the participants in its project to spell out the terms and conditions
of service. 



1.4 Eligibility Requirements 



1.4.1 Eligible Service Organizations 



Subdivisions of states, Indian Tribes, public or private nonprofit organizations (including labor organizations),
institutions of higher education, or a consortia of entities that propose to administer or operate a national or community
service program are eligible to submit proposals 
for the DOT Programs. 



1.4.2 Eligible Participants 



Eligibility for individual participation in community and national service projects is limited to participants
who: (1) are 17 years of age or older at the commencement of service, unless the individual is in a youth corps program,
in which case the participant must be between the ages of 16 and 25; (2) either have received a high school diploma or
its equivalent, including an 
alternative diploma or certificate for those individuals with mental and physical disabilities for whom such alternative
diploma or certificate is appropriate, or agree to obtain a high school diploma or its equivalent. (However, if the
program conducts an independent evaluation demonstrating that the potential participant is incapable of obtaining
a high school diploma or 
its equivalent, this requirement may be waived); (3) have not dropped out of elementary or secondary school in order
to enroll as a national service participant, unless the participant is enrolled in an institution of higher education
on an ability to benefit basis and is considered eligible for funds under section 484 of the Higher Education Act of
1965; (4) are citizens or 
nationals of the United States; and (5) meet the task-related eligibility requirements established by the program.

2. Program Descriptions 


2.1 Overview



To implement its national and community service program, DOT has identified five specific national and community
service programs that combine the goals and priorities of the National and Community Service Trust Act and the goals
and priorities of DOT. Applicants may submit proposals falling within one or a combination of DOT Programs. The proposals
should tailor 
the selected DOT Program(s) to the specific needs of the community to be served. The following is a description of the
five DOT Programs: 



2.2 Rehabilitation, Reclamation, and Beautification of Transportation-Related Facilities 



2.2.1 Description of Program




The DOT program for ``Rehabilitation, Reclamation and Beautification of Transportation-Related Facilities''
has been developed to implement the provisions of section 106(d) of the Act, which establishes an urban youth corps
in DOT, and authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to enter 
into formal agreements to form partnerships with qualified urban youth corps. The Secretary may make grants of DOT
funds to States (and through States to local governments) for the purpose of supporting qualified urban youth corps
projects. In addition, proposals for qualified urban youth corps projects to be conducted by eligible service organizations
(as defined in Section 1.4.1 of this RFP) may be included in DOT's application for funding from the National 
Service Corporation. These include projects that the Secretary is authorized to carry out under other authority
of law involving public works resources or facilities. 

Section 106(d) is based on the finding of Congress that public works and transportation resources are in need of labor
intensive rehabilitation, reclamation, and beautification work that has been neglected in the past and cannot be
adequately carried out by Federal, State, and local government at existing personnel levels. Rehabilitation, reclamation,
and beautification of public roads and public works facilities through the efforts of young people in the United States
participating in urban youth corps can benefit these youths and their communities. 

An urban youth corps project that would qualify under this DOT Program is one that is established by an eligible service
organization (as defined under Section 1.4.1 of this RFP) and that: 

a. Is capable of offering meaningful, full-time, productive work for individuals between the ages of 16 and 25, inclusive,
in an urban public works or transportation setting; 

b. Gives participants a mix of work experience, basic and life skills, education, training, and support services;
and 

c. Provides participants with the opportunity to develop citizenship values and skills through service to their
communities and the United States. 

Although any project proposed under this Program should involve an urban youth corps in a significant portion of the
work, the proposal may also include other eligible groups of community service participants that will work along
with the urban youth corps. 

Potential projects include organizing and managing community beautification projects to plant trees and flowers
adjacent to highways and transportation terminals and corridors; coordinating with railroad companies to organize
clean up campaigns and work days along railroad tracks and rights of way; working with local artists to beautify terminals
and facilities with art work; and clean up and beautification of roadsides, transportation corridors, and access
to transportation facilities. Community service projects will be associated with at least one mode of transportation,
i.e., rail, transit, or highway. 

All projects will need to be coordinated with the organizations having authority over the relevant transportation
facilities (such as State Departments of Transportation, local Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), or
transit authorities). As part of its proposal under this DOT 
Program, an applicant will need to show that the project is acceptable to the relevant transportation organizations.




2.2.2 Goals and Priorities 



This program addresses the following national priorities established by the National Service Corporation: 

a. Education_Urban youth corps projects will include specific project-related and general job skills training
that will prepare participants for future employment opportunities. Training will also include specific skills
related to the project being undertaken, such as carpentry, landscaping, and environmental planning. 

b. Public Safety_Recruiting at-risk youths in urban settings for participation in youth corps activities will provide
opportunities for youths to be productively involved in community activities, reducing the inclination to turn
to activities such as drug dealing or other crimes. In addition, cleaner transportation facilities will make the
facilities more attractive, drawing more users, and in turn, making them safer for use by all. 

c. Human Needs_Urban youth corps projects will provide job skills training that will help individuals become self-sufficient.
Job skills will include basics such as taking responsibility for attendance, being accountable for work products,
and dealing with supervisors. In addition, these projects will be targeted at improving communities and neighborhoods.


d. Environment_Rehabilitation, reclamation and beautification of transportation facilities will enhance neighborhoods
as well as assist in conserving and restoring the environment. 



2.2.3 Anticipated Outcomes and Results




Urban youth corps projects will result in benefits to communities, neighborhoods, and transportation facilities
in the form of renovated, restored, and cleaner facilities and areas. Participants will not only have the opportunity
to perform community service but will learn job skills that will prepare them for future employment opportunities.




2.2.4 Funding




The Federal share of funding for urban youth corps projects may be provided from existing DOT program funds and state
Federal-aid funds. DOT intends to apply for any additional funds needed for program costs, including living allowances,
educational awards, health insurance, and child care costs, from the National Service Corporation. It is anticipated
that direct funding for the Rehabilitation, Reclamation, and Beautification of Transportation-Related Facilities
Program may be available from DOT in future years.

2.2.5 DOT Agency Involvement and Expertise Available
 


DOT agencies involved in this Program include the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Transit Administration,
and the Federal Railroad Administration. For the selected proposals, DOT representatives will work with sponsoring
organizations to contact State DOTs, MPOs, transit authorities, etc., with authority over the relevant transportation
facilities to assist with project arrangements and agreements.

2.3 Transit Ambassadors 



2.3.1 Description of Program 



The DOT Federal Transit Administration's program for ``Transit Ambassadors'' proposes to use participants in community
service programs to help elderly and disabled persons learn to use public transportation systems in their communities.
Program participants, called ``transit ambassadors'', would assist these targeted individuals in locating bus
stops, understanding how the fare system works, and identifying potential destinations, such as grocery stores,
medical facilities, etc. Transit ambassadors would teach individuals how to use public transportation, and how
to read maps and time schedules. In addition, transit ambassadors will accompany persons who need such assistance
to navigate their way on conventional, fixed route public transportation service. 

Assistance may be of a one-time nature to acquaint an individual with public transportation routes and services.
Transit Ambassadors may also provide regular or scheduled guide services. The most minimal sort of service the transit
ambassador could provide would simply be visiting an individual and providing schedule and fare information, and
answering questions about a pending trip or series of trips. The service would include training individuals about
their neighborhood and the shops within it, increasing the confidence level for those who then could move around independently
and provide overall better security in the affected neighborhoods. 

As part of this program, transit ambassadors will assess the local transportation facilities to identify obstacles
that prevent disabled and elderly persons from safely and easily traveling on public transportation, and will work
with local transportation authorities to remove these obstacles. The transit ambassadors will also work with the
local transit authorities to develop and distribute information that will facilitate and encourage the use of public
transportation by the elderly and disabled (such as more easily readable bus schedules, community maps showing routes
to locations of particular interest, or information on special fares or rates available for 
the elderly or disabled). 

This program also has the potential for developing partnerships with other Federal agencies (such as the Department
of Health and Human Services or the Department of Education) to accompany youths to and from Head Start Programs and,
in addition, provide assistance to Head Start teachers during class. In such a partnership, transit ambassadors
could also be trained as aides on transportation vehicles to and from Head Start facilities/programs. Transit ambassadors
could instruct Head Start children and their parents on the routes to bus stops, and teach the children about proper
behavior and safety procedures while riding on a bus. Transit ambassadors could also act as aides to Head Start teachers
during the remainder of the day. 



2.3.2 Goals and Priorities
 


Transit Ambassadors will address the following national priorities: 

a. Public Safety. By providing escorts and training for elderly and disabled persons, this program will help decrease
potential violence to elderly and disabled citizens; transportation assistance for the Head Start program will
also increase safety to and from bus stops and on those buses. 

b. Health and Human Needs. Transportation assistance for elderly and disabled persons will enable them to get to medical
and other facilities more readily and more independently. 

c. Mitigate the impact of unfunded mandates. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires all public transit
systems to provide supplementary door-to-door paratransit service for those individuals who are unable to use even
fully accessible public transit. The Transit Ambassador Program will help instill confidence in elderly and disabled
persons in the use of conventional public transportation and limit the call for more expensive door-to-door paratransit
to individuals with mobility difficulties.

<TEXT>
 

d. Education. Transit ambassador participating in programs with the elderly and disabled will learn about the needs
of those populations and will help to integrate them into mainstream society. 

In addition, if cooperative partnerships are formed with other Federal agencies such as the Department of Health
and Human Services and the Department of Education, the Transit Ambassadors Program will provide aides for Head Start
programs and help make children more ``school ready.'' In such a partnership, transit ambassadors will be able to
work with children on the bus and in class, and provide information to them and their parents. 



2.3.3 Anticipated Outcomes and Results 



a. The program will benefit the local community and transit operators. Elderly and disabled citizens will be able
to participate in the community. Transit Ambassadors will develop knowledge of needs of the populations served and
increase skills for dealing with these populations. 

b. Disciplines learned in this program can be carried over into careers in the medical field, social services, transportation
and education. 



2.3.4 Funding 



Funding for this proposal will be available from the Federal Transit Administration at an anticipated level of up
to $235,000 for program costs. DOT intends to apply for any additional funds needed for program costs, including living
allowances, educational awards, health insurance, and child care costs, from the National Service Corporation.
It is anticipated that direct funding for the Transit Ambassadors Program may be available from DOT in future years.




2.3.5 DOT Agency Involvement and Expertise Available 



The Federal Transit Administration will be the agency within DOT that will implement the Transit Ambassador Program.

2.4 Operation Lifesaver 



2.4.1 Description of Program 



``Operation Lifesaver'' is an active, continuous national public information and education program that works
in conjunction with the DOT Federal Railroad Administration. This program provides help in preventing and reducing
crashes, injuries and fatalities and in improving driver performance at the nation's 300,000 public and private
rail/highway grade crossings. Operation Lifesaver originated in Idaho in 1972 after Union Pacific Railroad and
community leaders in the state decided to band together and fight the growing number of rail/highway grade crossing
crashes, injuries and fatalities with a public education program. At the end of the first year the rail/highway grade
crossing fatality rate dropped a resounding 39 percent. 

The program is now national in scope as all states have their own Operation Lifesaver programs. It is at the grassroots
level_in the cities, in rural communities, and in the schools_where Operation Lifesaver has been most effective.
States have reported fatality reductions at rail/highway grade crossings ranging from 28 percent to 100 percent
one year after establishing the program. 

There are two concepts through which Operation Lifesaver may be incorporated within the umbrella of the DOT National
Service program: 

a. The first would use a community service organization to assess the number and location of railroad/street, road,
and highway intersections within the defined geographic area. Based upon the data developed, the community service
organization would be responsible for developing and presenting an educational program suitable for elementary
schools, secondary schools, colleges, civic organizations, service organizations and fraternal groups. 

b. The second would address the provision of organizational and administrative assistance to the various state Operation
Lifesaver offices through the recruitment and placement of assistant program coordinators. These individuals
would enhance the ability of the State office to acquire information and establish geographic databases; organize
and plan educational programs and campaigns; coordinate media initiatives and relationships; and systematize
internal procedures and processes. This concept involves placement of individuals in single positions in a number
of different states, and would be part of a multi-state program that would fall under the national service provisions
of the Act. This portion of the program would be implemented incrementally based upon fiscal considerations. 

Organizations that could participate in the first concept include community service organizations eligible to
participate under the National and Community Service Trust Act (see Section 1.4.1 of the RFP).

<PARENT> FR940223-2-00104 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Implementation of the second concept would be coordinated through the national Operation 
Lifesaver headquarters office located in Alexandria, Virginia. This second concept would 
facilitate individual recruitment of National Service volunteers at the local level and would 
provide participants with opportunities to provide service to their local communities and states 
and to participate in the development of viable transportation safety programs. 



2.4.2 Goals and Priorities 



This program addresses the following national priorities: 

a. Education_Participants will be exposed to a variety of project specific tasks 
and general job skills that could prepare participants for future employment 
opportunities. 

b. Public Safety_Operation Lifesaver assists in promoting public awareness of the 
dangers associated with rail crossings, trespassing on railroad properties, and 
improper use of motor vehicles around rail facilities. Further, it will bring the 
audiences into contact with local police and other law enforcement agencies, 
which will open the lines of communication and create opportunities for 
cooperation. 

c. Human Needs_This Program will stimulate awareness of rail and highway 
safety-related problems within local and State communities and bring people 
together to address them. The programs will also provide safety training to a 
wide audience, ranging in age from pre-schoolers to senior citizens. 

d. Environment_Operation Lifesaver has been successful in reducing community 
environmental hazards associated with rail crossings. 



2.4.3  Anticipated Outcomes and Results 



a. The utilization of a community service organization would result in benefits to 
the local communities and provide needed public education in the area of rail 
safety to the specifically targeted audiences and the general public. As past 
records have shown, there should be a downward trend in accidents, injuries, 
and trespasser violations in conjunction with the Operation Lifesaver Program. 
The statistics developed would be readily available for program evaluation, cost 
analysis, and community acceptance and adoption. 

b. The hiring and placement of assistant administrative coordinators throughout the 
Operation Lifesaver system would result in better coordination of the program 
with railroad companies, law enforcement agencies, local and state governments, 
the various informational media and the general population. The opportunity to 
function within an established program would enhance the job skills and 
personal marketability for the participants for future endeavors. 

Both concepts will expose the participants to the opportunity to perform community service, and 
enhance the development of personal qualities, educational values and positive work ethics. 



2.4.4 Funding 



DOT intends to apply for funding for program costs, including living allowances, educational 
awards, health insurance, and child care costs, from the National Service Corporation. A 
budgetary review is ongoing at this time to seek other sources of funding within DOT. The 
National and Community Service Act will be an item in the Fiscal Year 1996 budget submission 
of the Federal Railroad Administration, and it is anticipated that direct funding for national 
service involvement in the Operation Lifesaver program may be available from DOT in future 
years. 



2.4.5 DOT Agency Involvement and Expertise Available 



The Operation Lifesaver and adjunct trespasser programs are addressed by several of the DOT 
modal administrations, specifically the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and the Federal 
Highway Administration (FHWA).

2.5 Hazardous Materials Transportation Emergency Preparedness Assistance 



2.5.1 Description of Program 





a. Background. 

The DOT Research and Special Programs Administration, Office of Hazardous Materials Safety 
(OHMS), currently carries out a national safety program to protect against the risks to life, 
health, property, and the environment inherent in the transportation of hazardous materials by 
water, air, highway and railroad. OHMS plans, implements, and manages hazardous materials 
regulatory, enforcement, and outreach programs, and administers a user fee funded grant 
program to States and Indian tribes for planning and training for hazardous materials 
emergencies. 

The number and type of entities regulated by OHMS have increased dramatically since 1990, 
when the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA) was amended. Prior to 1990, the 
office had jurisdiction over approximately 40,000 hazardous materials shippers and carriers. In 
the future, the inclusion of intrastate shippers and carriers will bring an additional 110,000 newly 
regulated shippers and carriers mandated by the HMTA amendment under the Hazardous 
Materials Regulations (HMR). 

Certain shippers and carriers are required to register with the Department and pay an annual fee. 
The Hazardous Materials Registration Program, which began in September 1992, funds 
emergency preparedness grants to States and Indian tribes for training and preparing to respond 
to hazardous materials emergencies. 

The HMTA Grant Program was presented to Congress in 1990 during the legislative process 
reauthorizing the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1974. Grant funds were first 
distributed in Fiscal Year 1993. The HMTA grant program is carefully crafted to build upon 
existing programs and relationships. It has increased the emphasis on improving the capability 
of communities to plan for the full range of transportation related hazardous materials risks they 
face. 

Forty-seven States are participating in the HMTA grant program_an overwhelming first year 
response. Fifty-eight grants, totaling approximately $8.4 million, were given to States, Tribes, 
and Territories in the first grant budget period. 180,000 emergency responders will be trained 
with HMTA grant funds in the first year of the program; 81% of these responders are either 
paid or volunteer firefighters. 

The existing grant process begins with each participating State's Governor determining which 
agency within the State receives the HMTA grant. The selected agency distributes funds in 
accordance with HMTA grant rules and required certifications, ensuring the assistance is 
provided to intended recipients. The grant distribution system allows each State's Governor to 
make decisions on funding based on local factors, and allows DOT to leverage resources, 
thereby operating the HMTA grant program efficiently. The HMTA grant distribution system 
is lean, and gives exceptionally responsive service to State grantees. 



b. National Service Corps. 

Under the OHMS's ``Hazardous Materials Transportation Emergency Preparedness Assistance'' 
Program, national service funding will be used to employ national service participants as 
assistants to the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local Emergency Planning 
Committee (LEPC), and State Emergency Management Agency levels. This Program will 
reinforce the Nation's Hazardous Materials Transportation Emergency Response/State 
Emergency Response structure, one of the objectives of the existing HMTA grant program. 

Local SERC/LEPC/emergency management national service participants may serve as assistants 
to prepare local emergency plans, perform hazardous materials commodity flow studies, and 
coordinate exercise of plans. These jobs, requiring little previous experience, could be learned 
mainly through on-the-job training. 

Use of national service funds to increase the effectiveness of the nationally recognized HMTA 
grant program would not only help the nation and localities, but also give national service 
participants experience in, and access to, an industry which is experiencing growth. The 
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, a reaction in part to the 
Bhopal, India tragedy, created SERCs and LEPCs to plan for emergency response, including 
feedback and coordination from broadly based local groups; many responsibilities were levied 
on states and localities with little funding. This program can provide assistance not previously 
available. Similarly, state emergency management agencies need assistance with hazardous 
materials planning and training grants. 

It is proposed that national service participants be involved as follows: 

1. A day in the life of a national service participant might include assignment 
to an LEPC. For this participant the day might include working under the 
LEPC chairperson's supervision to gather data at the state police inspection 
point for a commodity flow study. The participant might use the data while 
interacting with LEPC members at an evening meeting. As a result of the 
meeting the LEPC might modify their emergency plan. 

2. At other times the participant might distribute material safety data sheets to 
the public, conduct community outreach meetings, or receive notification of a 
hazardous materials release and provide support for the SERC/LEPC or the 
community. At a state emergency information center, the participant might 
assist the watch officer in preparing and distributing the daily situation report. 

3. Daily activities provide on-the-job training. For example, data may have 
indicated heavy transport of gasoline indicating the need for training in response 
to tanker incidents. The participant learns from experience the interaction 
between data, planning, and training. The participant might also be mentored 
by the members of the LEPC, the response community, or the trucking industry. 
In this way, the public good is served and the participant receives valuable 
training. 



2.5.2 Goals and Priorities 



The proposed program meets all criteria for funding under the President's National Service 
program; it improves public safety and health, guards the environment, and educates program 
participants. The program addresses national service priorities while at the same time provides 
an opportunity for public service and giving participants training that may enable them to gain 
employment later. It specifically addresses the following national priorities:

a. Environment. The program will help eliminate environmental risks through education of communities and through
risk preparation/prevention. 
Development of currently unavailable databases could provide the information 
especially helpful in accident avoidance and response. Hazardous materials 
planning and training assistant positions at SERC/LEPCs and HMTA State 
grantee offices are currently going unfilled. 

b. Education. If students are selected for these positions, this program will meet the ``Education'' national priority.
On-the-job training will provide unparalleled opportunities for individuals to learn skills leading to diplomas
or equivalent recognition of accomplishment. 

In addition, this program addresses two Department of Transportation Strategic Goals: (1) Promoting safe and secure
transportation, and (2) enhancing the environment through wise transportation decisions. 



2.5.3 Anticipated Outcomes and Results 



Communities and individuals will benefit from national service participation. Participants can contribute to
an increased awareness of environmental protection and emergency response. Community outreach, a possible activity
for participants, can help involve residents in discussion 
of issues and formulation of policy that can directly benefit the community. 

An ultimate goal of individual programs would be improved emergency response. Schools and community groups can be
targets for educational programs, thereby increasing the knowledge level in the community. 



2.5.4 Funding 



Up to $60,000 of the Federal share of living allowances for participants may be provided by the Research and Special
Programs Administration in DOT. DOT intends to apply for any additional funds needed for program costs, including
living allowances, educational awards, health insurance, and child care costs, from the National Service Corporation.





2.5.5 DOT Agencies Involved and Expertise Available 



The Office of Hazardous Materials Safety within the Research and Special Programs Administration will be the office
in DOT that will implement this Program. 



2.5.6 DOT Contact 



The primary contact for DOT for the Hazardous Materials Transportation Emergency Preparedness Assistance Program
will be: 



Charles Rogoff, 
HMTA Grants Manager, Office of Hazardous Materials Safety, the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA).

2.6 Youth Traffic Safety Education Programs 



2.6.1 Description of Program





a. Background and purpose. 

The DOT National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's program for Youth Traffic Safety Education offers the
opportunity to train young volunteers aged 16 to 25 to be proficient in 
traffic safety and then become positive role models for traffic safety behaviors for both younger children and their
young adult peers. The children, youth, and young adult populations are over-represented in fatal motor vehicle
crashes and are therefore at very high risk of being involved in potentially life-threatening or debilitating motor
vehicle incidents. 

In the U.S., injury is the leading cause of death for people ages 1 to 44. Traffic crashes alone are consistently the
leading cause of death for persons between the ages of 5 and 34. Many of the deaths and injuries that occur on our roads
are not the result of unavoidable incidents. By and large, these consequences are the result of failure to take proper
precautions such as wearing safety belts and bicycle helmets as well as unsafe behaviors such as speeding and impaired
driving. These losses strike particularly hard on young families and young children. 

Attempts to improve chances of survival focusing on injury prevention call for traffic safety programs to increase
safe behaviors. Increasing safe behaviors depends largely on educating individuals about precautionary measures
and rules of the road such as using child safety seats to transport young children, buckling up all motor vehicle passengers,
practicing safe bicycle and pedestrian behaviors, not speeding, and never driving impaired or riding with an impaired
driver. 



b. Scope of work. 

This project calls for a two-phase activity for the grantee to train young adult volunteer participants on critical
traffic safety issues and to conduct educational activities using trained volunteers to promote highway safety
for children and youth from prekindergarten through eighth grade. The educational activities use peer and cross-age
mentoring as a teaching technique that has been found quite effective with this age group. Phase one is the development
and conduct of training. Phase two is the program implementation. 

Prior to applying, the potential applicant shall conduct a preliminary assessment and problem identification,
to the extent possible, of the current status of community traffic fatalities and injuries as well as safety activities
and resources, consulting sources such as the state office of 
highway safety, law enforcement agencies, hospitals, health clinics, and local chapters of other organizations
involved with traffic safety efforts such as SAFE KIDS Coalition, Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), and Students
Against Driving Drunk (SADD). The state office of highway safety may be able to provide a general outline of the problem
and many of the 
activities underway within a designated area. The applicant shall use the preliminary assessment to help design
a complementary plan of educational activities, providing both the preliminary community assessment and the educational
activity plan as part of the application. 



i. Program Phase One. 

 Phase one will entail completing the preliminary community assessment, finalizing the educational program plan,
and developing and implementing the training component. In preparation for dealing with the complex and technical
highway safety issues, a training program for community service volunteers including specialized training and
experiential learning will be the integral part of the preparation for conducting educational safety activities.
The training program will be developed and implemented with the consultation and coordination of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (``NHTSA'') and community experts corresponding with the educational activity
plan. The training program must also be coordinated with and approved by the traffic unit of the local law enforcement
department. Ideally, local law enforcement will be represented in training sessions to the extent possible. All
participating program volunteers will complete initial training demonstrating a minimum level of knowledge and
skills before beginning traffic safety education activities. The training program may extend into the program implementation
phase as appropriate for continued instruction and consultation with experts. 



ii. Program Phase Two. 

The grantee will then utilize trained volunteers to implement key traffic safety programs to meet local needs using
available resources. Programs should incorporate one or more of the following traffic safety areas: child passenger
safety, pedestrian safety, bicycle safety, safety belt use, and alcohol impairment. Several activities may be done
concurrently or consecutively for added impact in a given traffic safety area or increased exposure to distinct traffic
safety issues. Subjects may also be combined for a more comprehensive traffic-safety message. Suggested activities
in the corresponding traffic safety areas include but are not limited to the following: 



Child Passenger Safety 

 Bounty Program 



A Bounty Program utilizes volunteers to work with merchants and others to remove no-longer-safe child safety seats
from the reuse and resale markets. No-longer-safe car seats include those manufactured before current standards;
no longer containing labeling identifying model and manufacturer; missing parts; containing broken, cracked,
frayed, or rusted parts; under recall; or previously involved in a motor vehicle crash. Volunteers could work with
local newspapers to publish public service announcements in the classified sections alerting the garage sale market
about the program. Safe child car seats are available at low cost in many areas through discount stores, car seat loaner
programs, insurance companies, and other sources. Additional child passenger safety activities could include
working with local distributors to develop a local shopping guide specifying sites with child safety seat model availability
and price lists. A ``how to'' manual is available from NHTSA to help establish a bounty program. (Can be conducted in
conjunction with hospitals, police departments, fire departments, and day care centers.)

Pedestrian Safety
 Pedestrian Safety Elementary Education Program


Two programs are available to reach young children with safe pedestrian information. The ``Willy Whistle'' program
can be conducted in one or two pedestrian safety lessons. Resources include an age appropriate video for children
from kindergarten through third grade or fourth through seventh grade and teaching guides with discussion questions,
activity ideas, and a parent letter. Both videos teach critical behaviors needed by young pedestrians to avoid dangerous
situations. ``Wary Walker'' is a pedestrian safety school-based curriculum consisting of five classroom lessons,
an outdoor field day, and a two-part parent/child activity workbook to be completed at home by the family. The focus
is on teaching elementary school children basic pedestrian skills emphasizing street crossing while encouraging
independent thinking, making safe choices, and evaluating themselves and others as pedestrians using a variety
of props including instructional videos, worksheets, cartoon characters, a pedestrian safety rap song, and a Map
to Safety. (Can be conducted in conjunction with schools.)


 School Crossing Guard Program


Adult school crossing guard programs have been developed to help safely expedite the movement of children to and from
school by creating gaps in traffic. Crossing guards act in identified high risk intersections separately from school
student safety patrols who assist students on school property. The crossing guard program is used in cities of all
sizes and has become an integral part of school crossing protection programs across the country. Most crossing guard
programs are organized and administered by local law enforcement units in cooperation and coordination with school
authorities and require strict reliability of participants. State or local legislation may establish procedures
and guidelines pertaining to school crossing guards which could include minimum age, education requirements, and
uniform attire for guards. Training materials available through the American Automobile Association (AAA) and
other sources may be used if standard training materials are not already established in a particular locality. (Can
be conducted in conjunction with law enforcement and schools. Note that this project can only be implemented if it
will not displace other employees.)


Bicycle Safety
 Bicycle Helmet Program


Despite the effectiveness of wearing helmets in preventing death and serious head injury, only a very small percentage
of cyclists wear them for many reasons including misperceptions of helmets being uncool, ugly, too hot, and too heavy.
Purchasing bicycle helmets may also be cost prohibitive to consumers not fully aware of their potential life-saving
benefits. Bicycle videos promoting safe cycling through increased use of helmets and videos demonstrating the proper
fit of helmets are available through the American Academy of Pediatrics and other organizations. Potential program
activities could include bicycle helmet demonstrations allowing first-hand helmet use, the distribution of bicycle
helmet discount coupons obtained with the cooperation of local merchants or manufacturers, and the development
and distribution of local shopping guides specifying area stores with model availability, sizes, and price lists.
(Can be conducted in conjunction with parent and teacher organizations, civic groups, and schools.)


 Bicycle Rodeo

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940223-2-00235 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940223-2-00104 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Bicycle rodeos are half or full-day events requiring fairly extensive planning and design which teach children of
all ages how to ride their bikes safely and correctly. The rodeo allows participants to ride their bicycles while they
practice and improve bicycle safety skills and learn about traffic situations while rotating through several activity
stations. Some of the skills are also transferable to situations in which children are pedestrians. Complete guides
for conducting rodeos are available for assistance. (Can be conducted in conjunction with law enforcement, schools,
and youth centers.)



Safety Belts
 School Safety Belt Use Program



Young drivers and passengers have the lowest safety belt use rates of any age group. Their reasons often include not
wanting to wrinkle their clothes, not wanting to appear uncool or wimpy in front of friends, and include myths such
as ``I could never be involved in a crash,'' ``I'd rather be thrown clear from the car in a crash,'' and ``I don't want
to be trapped if the car catches on fire.'' Safety belt use programs can be designed to correct the misperceptions with
facts and include activities that will raise awareness about the importance of wearing a safety belt properly every
time a person rides in a motor vehicle. Activities can include taking children out to a car to instruct them how to properly
buckle up in both the front and back seats and allowing them to practice, conducting a safety belt speed challenge to
show that buckling up only takes a couple of seconds that could save a life, demonstrating the effectiveness of safety
belts through a carefully designed egg experiment, taking an observational safety belt use survey of people arriving
and departing school property, and having students sign pledge cards to wear safety belts and encourage others to
do the same. (Can be conducted in conjunction with schools and student clubs.)



Alcohol
 Teen Courts



Teen courts represent an intervention approach that employs the dramatic role of peer influence responding to youth
problem behaviors often prompted by peer pressure, such as underage drinking, impaired driving, and other antisocial
behaviors. Teen courts could supplement the traditional juvenile justice system in which volunteers (teens or young
adults) could work with the local justice system to implement and administer a teen court system, serving as bailiffs,
clerks, prosecuting and defense attorneys, and, in some cases, judges. Volunteers would also coordinate recruiting
youth jurors from the community to sit on juries for individual cases. Information on how to set up a teen court is available
from NHTSA. On the whole, teen courts help provide a diversion from the juvenile justice system, appear to reduce recidivism,
and capitalize on peer influence to alleviate illegal behaviors. Additional alcohol-awareness activism for volunteers
could include efforts to utilize youth as court room monitors to collect data and make recommendations to solve problems,
conduct intergenerational issue presentations, and use impaired driving victim impact panels in presentations.
(Can be conducted in conjunction with juvenile justice system, schools, law enforcement, and Mothers Against Drunk
Driving.)


c. Volunteer Participant and Program Requirements. 

Due to the highly technical nature of the program and the limitation of available funds, this project is designed as
a pilot program to train the equivalent of 10 full-time youth or young adult volunteers. Volunteers should be between
the ages of 16 and 25, with a high school diploma or its equivalent, working in a single city or community. The volunteers
should be proficient speaking the dominant language or languages of the area. Volunteers should be divided into two
teams of five with two volunteers designated as team leaders. Team leaders should be full-time volunteers with a college
diploma or some college experience. Preference will be given to volunteers, especially team leaders, with experience
or interest in education, public safety, public health, recreation, physical education, marketing, public relations,
journalism, or media relations.
Eligible applicants will be required to demonstrate, through a letter of cooperation, the support of the traffic
division of the local law enforcement agency for the implementation of the planned program. Additional support organizations
might include: Highway safety agencies, emergency medical services units, motor vehicle administration, educational
institutions, public health officials, and private industry representatives. The applicant shall also provide
both the preliminary community assessment and the educational activity plan as part of the application. The program
shall incorporate evaluation measurements to determine the level of success of the program activities.



2.6.2 Goals and Priorities



This program addresses the following national service priorities:
a. Human Needs._Motor vehicle crashes cost the nation nearly $14 billion in health care expenditures each year. With
each serious injury prevented saving approximately $35,000 in health care costs, as much as $1 billion could be saved
nationally through the prevention of traffic deaths and injuries. U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pe&ntilde;a
has called for stepped-up national efforts to reduce the proportion of alcohol involved traffic crashes to 43 percent
and increase safety belt use to 75 percent by 1997 as part of President Clinton's health care initiative and year 2000
objectives.
b. Education._Traffic safety education for children and youth ages 3 through 13 (prekindergarten through grade
8) aims to increase school readiness and further early childhood development. Before children are able to learn in
school, they must be able to arrive at school safely each day. With traffic incidents as the leading cause of death and
disability for school age children, they face a risk every day in their transport to and from school and other activities.
c. Public Safety._Through better education and peer mentoring, traffic-related crimes can be reduced.



2.6.3 Anticipated Outcomes and Results



Young adult volunteers as mentors can make a constructive contribution to a national and community traffic safety
problem while gaining practical learning experiences. The objective of these efforts is to improve the quality of
life for young citizens by raising public awareness, reducing the severity and frequency of traffic safety problems,
and providing highway safety experiences which could lead to related future career field choices. This program will
allow volunteers to work cooperatively with law enforcement and other organizations within a designated community
developing a positive, visible, outcome-oriented relationship to decrease death and injury due to motor vehicle
crashes. The educational program will expose young children to appropriate behaviors which can become habits they
will model to others and will practice to help keep themselves and others safe now and in the future. If the program proves
beneficial to the community and agency, future expansion of a refined program with an increased number of participants
may be explored.



2.6.4 Funding



Funding available from DOT for program development, implementation, and administration is $50,000. Application
will be made to the National Service Corporation for any additional program costs, living allowance, education awards,
health insurance, and child care costs as appropriate for participating volunteers. It is anticipated that direct
funding of the Youth Traffic Safety Education Programs may be available from DOT in future years.



2.2.5 DOT Agency Involvement and Expertise Available



NHTSA will act as the project monitor working directly with the grantee to develop and implement a traffic safety training
program through the local law enforcement department and facilitate additional state and community contacts with
other organizations interested in and working on similar efforts. NHTSA may also provide access to additional materials,
training, technical assistance, and data as appropriate. In addition to its headquarters staff, NHTSA has ten regional
offices that work directly with the states to implement highway safety programs to reduce motor vehicle crashes including
related fatalities, injuries, and economic loss.

Any service organization submitting a proposal for a DOT program must show evidence that the 
proposal has been reviewed and approved by the community service commission for the state(s) 
in which the project will be performed. 


 In addition, DOT requests that each proposal include a preliminary evaluation by the state on 
national and community service for the state in which the project is to be performed (the ``state 
commission''). An evaluation form to be completed by the state commission is included as 
``Attachment 6'' to the attached application form. The evaluation by the state commissions are 
not mandatory and are not binding on DOT. However, DOT believes that any information from 
the state commissions would be extremely helpful in our review and, therefore, we strongly 
encourage all applicants to obtain an evaluation from the state commission. 



 

4. Selection Criteria 


 

4.1 General Criteria 


 

The following criteria and weights will be used by DOT to select national and community 
service proposals: 


 1. 

Need

 (10%). 


 DOT will take into consideration the extent to which both the overall program and its 
particular projects will address needs important to the community and be conducted in 
areas of need as defined in the National and Community Service Trust Act. These

national service program; the past performance of the organization or program; the 
organization's connection to the community; the extent to which the program builds on 
existing programs; evidence of strong and broad-based community support for the 
program; and availability of additional funding sources for the program. 


 An application proposing the replication of an existing program will also be evaluated 
based on the success of the program in its original site, including the results of any 
evaluation undertaken; the program's analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the 
original program; reasons for selecting the replication site and discussion of adjustments 
needed for adaptation to a new site; and the qualification of the leaders of the program 
at the new site. 


 4. 

Sustainability

 (10%). 


 DOT will consider the ability of the program to sustain itself beyond the period of 
support from DOT or from the National Service Corporation as evidenced by strong 
and broad-based community support; presence of multiple or private funding sources; 
and cost-effectiveness. Additional consideration will be given to programs that 
significantly exceed the regional match with non-Federal funds. 


 5. 

Innovation and Replication

 (10%). 


 DOT will consider the degree to which needs coincide to program design, the 
innovative aspects of the program, and the appropriateness of replicating the program 
in the future. 



 

4.2 Priority Consideration 


 

In addition to the criteria on which individual applications will be rated, DOT may give priority 
consideration to all or some of the following issues: 


 1. 

Early Start Date.

 DOT is interested in programs that will be able to start up 
quickly after completing an appropriate planning phase (ideally by September 
of 1994). 


 2. 

Participant Diversity. 


 DOT seeks a broadly diverse participant pool that includes a large representation 
of young adults; a mixture of individuals who have not attended college and 
those with college-education experience; approximately equal numbers of men 
and women; individuals of all races and ethnicities; and individuals with 
physical and cognitive disabilities. 


 3. Location.

5. Funding 


5.1 Direct Funding from DOT


Funds appropriated to DOT agencies will be available to partially finance initial national and 
community service projects in some of the five DOT programs in fiscal year 1994 (see 
individual discussions on funding in the individual DOT Program descriptions set forth in 
Section 2). These funds also may be allocated to finance portions of projects involving activities 
in more than one program area. 

Appropriations for fiscal year 1995, which begins October 1, 1994, are not expected to be 
enacted until September 1994, and it is not possible to verify the availability of follow-on 
funding at this time. However, it is anticipated that direct funding of all DOT national and 
community service Programs identified in this RFP may be available from DOT in future years. 

Depending on the nature of the proposal and the DOT Program to be implemented, it may be 
necessary for DOT funding to be given to State or local agencies, which will in turn pass the 
funding through to the service organization implementing the projects. DOT officials will advise 
and assist a service organization in arranging such coordination if its proposal is selected, and 
this coordination should not be viewed as an obstacle to the submission of an application at this 
time. 
Other restrictions on the use of Federal funds are discussed in Section 5.4 below. 



5.2 National Service Corporation Funding


DOT will submit a multi-program application containing all of the selected proposals and related 
partnership agreements to the National Service Corporation in order to request funding for the 
remaining program costs that cannot be covered by direct funding from DOT and matching funds 
from the service organization. Any funding provided by the National Service Corporation will 
come from the funds earmarked for Federal agencies. Since there is no guarantee that DOT will 
receive funding from the National Service Corporation, a proposal accepted by DOT ultimately 
may not be fully funded or funded at all if DOT's request for funding from the National Service 
Corporation is not granted. 


5.3 Matching Funds


Each selected applicant must provide matching funds equal to at least 25% of the cost of the 
program. Where authorized, other federal, state or local sources (not including funds provided 
directly by DOT or the National Service Corporation) may be counted as matching funds. In-kind contributions, including
facilities, equipment, goods or services, may also be counted as 
matching funds. (In-kind contributions to be used as a match in more that one program must 
be divided between the programs in proportion to use.) Note that a preference will be given to 
proposals that provide the match through non-federal sources and matches that exceed the 
minimum match requirement. 


5.4 Restrictions on Use of Federal and Corporation Funds



a. Restrictions on Benefits 


No more than 85% of the living stipend for participants may be paid from federal sources 
(including funds received from the National Service Corporation and any other federal funds 
received, including DOT funds). No more than 85% of the costs of the most affordable health 
care policy that provides minimum benefits may be paid from with National Service Corporation 
funds. Payment of the 15% of the living stipend from non-federal sources and 15% of health 
care benefits from non-Corporation sources will be included as part of the overall match for the 
program. 


b. Restrictions on Administrative Costs


Not more than 5% of the National Service Corporation funds may be used to pay for 
administrative costs. Administrative costs are costs associated with the overall administration 
of the program. Such costs include the following: (1) Indirect costs (i.e., costs identified with 
two or more cost objectives but not identified with a particular cost objective) as described in 
applicable provisions of Office of Management and Budget Circulars that relate to indirect costs; 
(2) costs for financial, accounting, or contracting functions; (3) costs for insurance that protects 
the entity that operates the program; and (4) costs related to the evaluation of the program; and 
(5) costs for salaries and benefits of staff who recruit, train, place, or supervise participants. 
Particular costs such as those associated with staff who perform both administrative and program 
functions may be prorated between administrative costs and costs directly related to program 
operations. 


c. Restrictions on Equipment Purchases.


Not more than 10% of National Service Corporation funds may be used to purchase equipment 
to be used for programmatic operation. 


d. Compliance with OMB Circulars


Programs must comply with all applicable Office of Management and Budget circulars for grant 
management, including Circulars A-133, A-128 and A-110, and with all applicable Federal, 
State and local laws.
