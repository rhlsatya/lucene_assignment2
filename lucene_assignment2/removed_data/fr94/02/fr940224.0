Rules of Practice Governing the Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing Areas Pursuant
to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Secretary; Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule amends 7 CFR parts 1 and 2 and 36 CFR part 223 by adding a new subpart M to 7 CFR part 1 establishing rules of practice
governing the adjudication of sourcing area applications pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage
Relief Act of 1990; by deleting, in 7 CFR part 2, the reference to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief
Act and adding, in its place, a reference to the rules of practice established by this rule; and by making technical
amendments to 36 CFR part 223 to conform it to the rules of practice established by this rule.



The Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (Act) prohibits the export of unprocessed Federal
timber west of the 100th meridian in the 48 contiguous states and the substitution of such unprocessed Federal timber
for unprocessed private timber from the west that is exported. The Act allows a person with an approved sourcing area
to export unprocessed private timber originating from outside of the sourcing area while purchasing Federal timber
within the sourcing area. The Act states that the Secretary shall approve or disapprove sourcing areas on the record
and after an opportunity for a hearing. Therefore, formal adjudication is required under the Administrative Procedure
Act. The Act also requires that reviews of sourcing areas be conducted at least every 5 years in accordance with the
procedures of the Act. Pursuant to section 556 of the Administrative Procedure Act, adjudications of sourcing area
applications and formal reviews of sourcing areas will be subject to the rules of practice adopted by this rulemaking.
Informal reviews of sourcing areas will be conducted in accordance with 36 CFR 223.191(e). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act (Act), enacted August 20, 1990, prohibits both the export
of unprocessed Federal logs originating west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 states and the substitution
of such unprocessed Federal logs for unprocessed private logs originating west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous
48 states that are exported.



The Act exempts persons with approved ``sourcing areas'' from the prohibition against substitution in certain circumstances.
A sourcing area is the area from which an owner/manufacturer of logs obtains logs for his or her mill. To be approved,
a sourcing area must be geographically and economically separate from any geographic area where the person harvests
private timber for export. A person with an approved ``sourcing area'' may export unprocessed private logs whose
origin is outside of the sourcing area, while continuing to purchase Federal logs within the sourcing area. Private
logs originating from within the sourcing area may not be exported.

Section 490(c) of the Act states that the Secretary is to approve or disapprove the application, ``on the record and
after an opportunity for a hearing'' 4 months after submission of a sourcing area application. Section 554 of Title
5, United States Code requires a formal adjudicatory process when a statute requires a determination to be made ``on
the record and after opportunity for an agency hearing.'' This rule amends 7 CFR part 1 by adding rules of practice governing
sourcing area applications, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 556. Specific rules governing sourcing area adjudications are
necessary because of the short time in which the statute requires decisions to be made (4 months), and the unique procedural
posture of sourcing area applications; i.e., sourcing area applications are submitted by a party other than the agency,
expect in certain cases, pursuant to a review of a sourcing area.

This rule also amends 7 CFR 2.35 by deleting the words ``in sourcing area adjudications under the Forest Resources
Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620 

et seq

.)'', and adding, in their place, the words ``in adjudication proceedings subject to the `Rules of Practice Governing
the Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing Areas Pursuant to the Forest Resources
Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620 

et seq

.)' set forth in 7 CFR part 1, subpart M;''.

Due to the amendments to 7 CFR parts 1 and 2, adopted by this rule, it is necessary in this rule, to make technical amendments
to 36 CFR part 223 to conform it to the rules of practice, established by this rule, which govern the adjudication of
sourcing area applications pursuant to the Act. This rule amends the rules governing initial sourcing applicants,
published in an interim rule at 55 FR 48572 (Nov. 20, 1990). Specifically to conform the procedures in the interim rule
to this rule, for ongoing applications, 36 CFR 223.190 is amended as follows: 

1. Section 223.190(g) is revised to state that the application review process will be conducted pursuant to the Rules
of Practice Governing the Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing Areas Pursuant
to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, 

et seq

.), found at 7 CFR part 1, subpart M. 

2. Section 223.190(h) (introductory text) and (h)(1)-(3) are removed. 

3. Section 223.190(h)(4) is redesignated as 36 CFR 223.190(h) and is revised to state that a final decision will be
issued within four (4) months of receipt of the sourcing area application or initiation date of the formal review of
the sourcing area. 

4. Section 223.190(h)(5) is redesignated as 36 CFR 223.190(i), and 36 CFR 223.190(h)(5)(i)-(iv) are redesignated
as 36 CFR 223.190(i), (1)-(4).


5. Newly redesignated 36 CFR 223.190(i)(1) is amended by deleting the words ``approving official'' and adding, in
their place, the words ``the Administrative Law Judge, or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer.''


This rule also makes technical amendments to 36 CFR 223.191(e) to conform the sourcing area review procedures to the
rules of practice adopted in this rule (36 CFR 223.191 was published in a final rulemaking at 56 FR 65834, December 19,
1991). Specifically, this rule removes from 36 CFR 223.191(e) the words ``deciding official'' and adds, in their
place, the words ``the Administrative Law Judge, or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer.'' This rule also amends the
following sentence in paragraph (e), ``The deciding official shall, on the record and after opportunity for a hearing,
approve or disapprove the sourcing area being reviewed'' by adding to the end of the sentence the words ``pursuant
to the Rules of Practice Governing the Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing Areas
Pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620 

et seq

.), found at 7 CFR part 1, subpart M;''. 




Environmental Impact 



This rulemaking consists primarily of technical and administrative changes related to the rules of practice governing
the adjudication of sourcing area applications pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief
Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, 

et seq

.). No extraordinary circumstances have been identified that might cause this proposed action to have a significant
effect on the human environment. Therefore, this rulemaking is categorically excluded from documentation in an
Environmental Impact Statement or an Environmental Assessment (40 CFR 1508.4; Forest Service Handbook 1909.15,
Environmental Policy and Procedures,  31.1b(2), 57 FR 43208, September 18, 1992).



Paperwork Reduction Act




This action contains no new or additional recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and contains no collections
of information as defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq. 

and its implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320. Therefore, the Paperwork Reduction Act and its implementing
regulations do not apply to this rulemaking. 




Regulatory Impact 




This rule relates to internal agency management. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, notice and opportunity for
comment are not required, and this rule may be made effective less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. Further, since this rule relates to internal agency management, it is exempt from the provisions of Executive Order
12866. Finally, this action is not a rule as defined in Public Law No. 96-354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act,
and thus is exempt from the provisions of that Act.


This rule has been reviewed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12630 and
it has been determined that the rule does not pose the risk of a taking of constitutionally protected private property.


This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under this rule: (1) All state and local
laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule or which could impede its full implementation will be preempted;


(2) No retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and 

(3) No administrative proceedings are required before parties may file suit in court challenging its provisions.

(2) The Judge shall not order any of the foregoing procedures that a party can show is inappropriate or unwarranted
under the circumstances of the particular determination.
(3) At the conference, the following matters shall be considered:
(i) The simplification of issues;
(ii) The possibility of obtaining stipulations of facts and of the authenticity, accuracy, and admissibility of
documents, which will avoid unnecessary proof;
(iii) The limitation of the number of expert or other witnesses;
(iv) Negotiation, compromise, or settlement of issues;
(v) The exchange of copies of proposed exhibits;
(vi) The identification of documents or matters of which official notice may be requested;
(vii) A schedule to be followed by the parties for completion of the actions decided at the conference; and
(viii) Such other matters as may expedite and aid in the disposition of the proceeding.
(b) 

Reporting.

 A prehearing conference will not be stenographically reported unless so directed by the Judge.
(c) 

Action in lieu of personal attendance at a conference.

 In the event the Judge concludes that personal attendance by the Judge and the parties or counsel at a prehearing conference
is unwarranted or impracticable, but determines that a conference would expedite the proceeding, the Judge may conduct
such conference by telephone or correspondence.
(d) 

Order.

 Actions taken as a result of a conference shall be reduced to an appropriate written order, unless the Judge concludes
that a stenographic report shall suffice, or if the Judge elects to make a statement on the record at the hearing summarizing
the actions taken.


 1.422

Conduct of the Hearing.


(a) 

Time and place.

 The hearing shall be held at the time and place fixed in the notice of hearing. If any change in the time or place of the

(b) 

Appearances.

 The parties may appear in person or by attorney of record in the proceeding. Any party who desires to be heard in person

counsel, such person or such counsel shall, before proceeding to testify or otherwise to participate in the hearing,
state for the record the authority to act as such counsel or representative, and the names, addresses, and occupations
of such person and such counsel. Any such person or such counsel shall give such other information respecting his appearance
as the Judge may request. Any person who appears as counsel must conform to the standards of ethical conduct required
of practitioners before the courts of the United States.
(c) 

Failure to appear.

 A party of record who, after being duly notified, fails to appear at the hearing without good cause, shall be deemed
to have waived the right to an oral hearing in the proceeding. Failure to appear at a hearing shall not be deemed to be
a waiver of the right to be served with a copy of the Judge's decision.
(d) 

Order of proceeding.

 The Judge shall determine the order in which the parties shall proceed.
(e) 

Evidence

_(1) 

In general.

 (i) The testimony of witnesses at a hearing shall be on oath or affirmation and shall be subject to cross-examination.
Cross-examination shall be permitted to the extent required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. The Judge
may require that testimony on one issue raised by numerous parties be heard at one time.
(ii) Upon a finding of good cause, the Judge may order that any witness be examined separately and apart from all other
witnesses except those who may be parties to the proceeding.
(iii) After a witness has testified on direct examination, any other party may request and obtain the production of
any statement, or part thereof, of such witness in the possession of the party who called the witness, which relates
to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified. Such production shall be made according to the procedures
and subject to the definitions and limitations prescribed in the Jencks Act (18 U.S.C. 3500).
(iv) Evidence which is immaterial, or unduly repetitious, or which is not of the sort upon which responsible persons
are accustomed to rely, shall be excluded insofar as practicable.
(2) 

Objections.

 (i) If a party objects to the admission of any evidence or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross-examination
or to any other ruling of the Judge, the party shall state briefly the grounds of such objection, whereupon an automatic
exception will follow if the objection is overruled by the Judge.
(ii) Only objections made before the Judge may subsequently be relied upon in the proceeding.
(3) 

Depositions.

 The deposition of any witness shall be admitted in the manner provided in and subject to the provisions of  1.228
of these procedures.
(4) 

Exhibits.

 Unless the Judge finds that the furnishing of copies is impracticable, two copies of each exhibit shall be filed with
the Judge. The party submitting the exhibit shall serve on every other party of record a copy of the exhibit, pursuant
to  1.427(c) of these procedures. A true copy of an exhibit may be substituted for the original.
(5) 

Official records or documents.

 An official government record or document or entry therein, if admissible for any purpose, shall be admissible in
evidence without the production of the person who made or prepared the same, and shall be prima facie evidence of the
relevant facts stated therein. Such record or document shall be evidenced by an official publication thereof or a
copy certified by a person having legal authority to make such certification.
(6) 

Official notice.

 Official notice shall be taken of such matters as are judicially noted by the courts of the United States and of any other
matter of technical, scientific, or commercial fact of established character: 

Provided,

 That the parties shall be given adequate notice of matters so noticed, and shall be given adequate opportunity to show
that such facts are erroneously noticed.
(7) 

Offer of proof.

 Whenever evidence is excluded by the Judge, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall
be included in the transcript. The offer of proof shall consist of a brief statement describing the evidence excluded.
If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement, it shall be included in the transcript in toto. If the evidence consists
of an exhibit, it shall be marked for identification and inserted in the hearing record.
(f) 

Transcript.

 Hearings shall be recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts thereof shall be made available to any person,
at actual cost of duplication (5 U.S.C. App. 2, section 11).

Judicial Officer by filing an appeal petition with the Hearing Clerk. As provided in  1.422(e)(2), objections
regarding evidence or a limitation regarding examination or cross-examination or other rulings made before the
Judge may be relied upon in an appeal. Each issue set forth in the petition, and the arguments thereon, shall be separately

<USDEPT>FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM</USDEPT>








Loans to Executive Officers, Directors, and Principal Shareholders of Member Banks; Loans to Holding Companies
and Affiliates 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board is revising Regulation O to permit the aggregate limit on lending to insiders by eligible, adequately capitalized
small banks to be increased from 100 percent of unimpaired capital and surplus to 200. The Board also is revising Regulation
O to permit banks to follow alternative recordkeeping procedures on loans to insiders of affiliates, to narrow the
definition of ``extension of credit,'' and to adopt certain exceptions to the general restrictions on lending to
insiders and the special restrictions on lending to executive officers. Other minor revisions clarifying certain
exemptions and conforming certain provisions to the enabling statutes are included as well. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


The Board is making permanent, with certain additional qualifications, its interim rule permitting small, adequately
capitalized banks to extend credit to insiders up to 200 percent of unimpaired capital and surplus, in circumstances
where such lending is necessary to serve local credit needs or to attract directors. The Board also is adopting amendments
to Regulation O (12 CFR part 215) designed to increase the ability of banks to make extensions of credit that pose minimal
risk of loss, to eliminate recordkeeping requirements that impose a paperwork burden but do not significantly aid
compliance with the regulation, and to remove certain transactions from the regulation's coverage consistent with
bank safety and soundness. The above amendments are expected to increase the availability of credit, particularly
in communities served by small banks, and to reduce the cost of compliance with the regulation. 
In view of the extensive changes made to Regulation O as a result of this rulemaking, the Board is restating subpart
A of Regulation O as amended, rather than separately describing each amendment. 
The Board is making the rule effective immediately in order to prevent a lapse in the 200 percent lending limit available
to eligible banks under the interim rule for loans to insiders, and to make all other provisions effective at the same
time. 


II. The 200 Percent Aggregate Lending Limit 


Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 375b) restricts the amounts and terms of extensions of credit from
a bank to executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders of the bank and its holding company affiliates
and to any related interest of those persons (insiders). Section 306 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA)

1

 amended section 22(h) to impose an aggregate limit on the amount a bank may lend to its insiders as a class. See 12 U.S.C.
375b(5). In general, the limit is equal to 100 percent of the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. The
Board is authorized, however, to make exceptions to the general limit for banks with deposits of less than $100 million
``if the Board determines that the exceptions are important to avoid constricting the availability of credit in small
communities or to attract directors of such banks.'' 12 U.S.C. 375b(5)(C). The higher limit may not exceed 200 percent
of the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. 

Id. 




Effective May 18, 1992, the Board amended Regulation O, which implements section 22(h), to incorporate the aggregate
lending limit added by FDICIA. The general limit on lending to insiders and their related interests_100 percent of
the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus_was adopted. The Board also decided as an interim measure to
permit banks with deposits under $100 million to adopt a higher limit, not to exceed 200 percent of the bank's unimpaired
capital and unimpaired surplus, for a period of one year to expire May 18, 1993. The interim period was intended to allow
the Board to consult with the other federal banking agencies and collect data on the lending practices of banks in order
to analyze the effect of the aggregate lending limit on the availability of credit and service of directors. See 57
FR 22417, 22420, May 28, 1992. 
The Board subsequently extended the interim rule for six months, through November 18, 1993, in order to obtain public
comments on whether the interim rule should be made permanent, modified, or permitted to expire. See 58 FR 28492, May
14, 1993. The Board thereafter extended the interim rule an additional three months, through February 18, 1994, in
order to review the written comments, call reports of small banks, and relevant information from other governmental
agencies. See 58 FR 61803, November 23, 1993.

The interim rule established requirements that a small bank had to meet in order to adopt a higher aggregate lending
limit. Under that rule, the board of directors of the bank had to determine by resolution that a higher aggregate lending
limit was consistent with prudent, safe, and sound banking practices in light of the bank's experience in lending
to its insiders, and that a higher limit was necessary to attract or retain directors or to prevent restricting the
availability of credit in small communities. The resolution had to set forth the facts and reasoning that supported
this determination, including the amount of the bank's aggregate lending to insiders, expressed as a percentage
of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, as of the date of the resolution. The bank also was required to submit
its resolution to the appropriate federal banking agency, with a copy to the Board. Finally, the bank had to meet or
exceed all applicable capital requirements. See 12 CFR 215.4(d)(2). 
In response to the notice of the extension of the interim rule, the Board received 147 written comments, with 144 respondents
in favor of making the 200 percent limit permanent. Small banks subject to the rule submitted the large majority of
comments. Other commenters included numerous state and national banking trade associations, several state banking
superintendents and Federal Reserve Banks, individual bank directors, bank holding companies, and law firms. 
Adverse comment focused on the relatively low level of use of the interim provision. Two of the three adverse commenters
argued that a higher aggregate lending limit was not important to credit or director availability because very few
banks had used the interim rule. One state banking commissioner noted that of the 88 small banks it supervised, only
one had aggregate insider loans in excess of 60 percent of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus as of March 31,
1993. 
Call report data reflected a similar low level of aggregate insider lending. As of September 30, 1993, of a total population
of 7,435 banks with deposits of less than $100 million, only 17 reported loans to insiders in an amount greater than
100 percent of capital. A total of 131 banks reported insider loans greater than 60 percent of capital. Only 54 banks
have notified the Board pursuant to the interim rule that they have adopted a higher aggregate lending limit. 
In support of the proposed rule, sixty-two commenters stated that a higher aggregate lending limit was important
in order that small banks not be forced to choose between refusing credit to qualified insiders and asking insiders
to resign as directors. Several banks observed that this was a particular hardship because qualified directors typically
are active businesspersons whose businesses have substantial yet healthy credit requirements. 
Fifteen commenters observed that the aggregate lending limit was a particular hardship in small communities and
rural markets because in those settings small banks were dependent on insiders as a loan source, insiders had fewer
alternative credit sources, and insiders tended to be closely identified with their banks, making it difficult for
them to seek credit from a competitor. 
In order to demonstrate that the higher limit was being used and would have important benefits if made permanent, the
Independent Bankers Association of America (IBAA) presented in its comment a survey of 8,057 small banks. Of 1,060
banks that responded to the survey, 152 reported that the general aggregate lending limit had prevented them from
making a loan to an insider; 95 respondents reported that the aggregate lending limit had prevented them from naming
an individual as a director; and 53 respondents reported that they had accepted a director resignation attributable
to the aggregate lending limit. 
Additional commenters presented a variety of reasons for the low level of use of the interim 200 percent limit: concern
that the interim rule would be eliminated, thereby forcing banks to retract credit extended in reliance on it; historically
low lending levels; loan participations as an alternative to approving a higher limit; and deferral of consideration
of the issue by small banks whose insider loans had not matured since adoption of the interim rule. Some commenters
also observed that the interim rule imposed detailed requirements and that some banks may have feared attracting
additional regulatory scrutiny by adopting the interim rule.

After the close of the comment period, the General Accounting Office (GAO) provided to the Board a draft report on bank
insider activities. The GAO reviewed banks that failed during 1990 and 1991 in order to determine whether insider
practices contributed to the banks' failures. (The GAO did not evaluate any existing or proposed regulation in this
area.) The GAO found that insider problems (which the GAO defined very broadly) were prevalent at failed banks, that
banks with less than $100 million of assets were more likely than larger banks to be cited for insider problems, and
that the most frequently cited violations were loans to insiders made in excess of lending limits and on preferential
terms not available to the general public. 
However, the GAO report did not establish a causal link between insider problems and bank failures. Rather, the GAO
appeared to conclude that insider problems, as broadly defined by the GAO, were correlated with poor internal controls
and underwriting practices. The GAO was not able to measure the actual level of insider lending at failed or troubled
banks, and therefore was not able to address specifically the relationship of the actual level of insider lending
to bank failures. The major GAO recommendations were for increased monitoring of insider lending and more effective
follow-up on violations. 
The Board has concluded that the concerns raised in the GAO report do not justify preventing qualified banks from utilizing
a higher aggregate lending limit. If the higher limit should present safety and soundness problems at an institution,
then the appropriate banking supervisor retains general authority to require a reduction in the level of insider
loans. If problems should occur more generally, the Board retains authority to eliminate or reduce the exemption.

Although the 100 percent aggregate lending limit does not appear to be currently creating a widespread problem with
credit or director availability, the Board has concluded that it does appear to pose important problems for banks
in certain communities. Given the available data and the comments, the Board believes that the 100 percent limit is
restricting the availability of credit and the recruitment of directors in communities where the proper certification
can be made. In such circumstances, the Board believes that an eligible small bank should be permitted to establish
a higher lending limit up to 200 percent of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Each eligible bank's board
of directors will still be required to certify that the higher limit is necessary to avoid restricting credit or to
assist in attracting directors and is consistent with prudent, safe, and sound banking practices. 
The Board emphasizes that, as was the case prior to FDICIA, borrowing by insiders will continue to be subject to scrutiny
during the examination process, including an evaluation of whether such borrowing represents an inappropriate
concentration of loans. 
In the final rule, the Board has adopted three modifications to the proposed rule. First, the Board has provided that
to qualify for the higher lending limit, a bank must be in satisfactory overall condition as determined in the most
recent report of examination of the bank, as well as being adequately capitalized, as was already required in the interim
rule. Second, a provision has been added clarifying that a bank operating above the 100 percent limit that subsequently
becomes ineligible for the higher limit may retain its existing insider loans but may not extend credit that would
maintain aggregate insider lending in excess of 100 percent of unimpaired capital and surplus. Third, banks are not
be required to file the required resolutions with their primary regulator or the Board, as was required by the interim
rule. The resolutions are to be made available for inspection during the examination process. 


III. Recordkeeping Procedures 


Section 215.8 of Regulation O currently requires that each bank maintain records necessary for compliance with the
insider lending restrictions of Regulation O. Specifically, banks are required to maintain records (1) identifying
all directors, officers, and principal shareholders of the bank and its affiliates and all related interests of those
persons (collectively, ``insiders''), and (2) specifying the amounts and terms of all credit extended to these insiders.
Section 215.8 further requires each bank to request on an annual basis that its insiders and insiders of its affiliates
identify their related interests. The list of insiders is then used by the bank to identify all existing or proposed
extensions of credit covered by Regulation O, to monitor the amount thereof subject to the individual and aggregate
lending limits, and to ensure that all appropriate approval procedures are followed.

<TEXT>
 

Since adoption of the initial recordkeeping requirement, the annual survey has grown in size and complexity. Bank
holding companies have become increasingly large and diversified, and commercial organizations have acquired
credit card banks and limited purpose banks. Thus, for example, a small, grandfathered bank owned by a large diversified
holding company may have hundreds of affiliates with thousands of officers and directors. Although the bank may have
no contact with these officers and directors and companies controlled by them, it currently is required to collect
information on all these parties. In another example, a CEBA credit card bank is prevented by law from making loans
to anyone but individuals,

2

 and is thus effectively prohibited from lending to insiders' related interests, but the current rule nonetheless
requires the bank to conduct an annual survey of related interests. 




On September 9, 1993, the Board published notice of proposed rulemaking and requested comment concerning alternative
recordkeeping procedures that banks may follow to monitor loans to insiders of the bank and its affiliates. See 58
FR 47400. The Board proposed to allow each bank to decide on its own how to gather information on related interests,
so long as its method was effective. For example, in the case of a nonbank credit card bank or other bank that does not
make commercial loans, the bank could decide not to keep records on related interests. For banks that make commercial
loans, two acceptable recordkeeping methods were identified: (1) The ``survey'' method currently required, under
which all insiders are asked annually to identify all their related interests; and (2) the ``borrower inquiry'' method,
under which the bank would (a) ask each commercial borrower as part of the loan application process whether it is a related
interest of an insider of the bank, and (b) maintain a record of each affirmative response. Finally, the proposed rule
sought comment on whether any other recordkeeping methods would be effective in monitoring compliance with Regulation
O. 
The draft GAO report, discussed above, urged the federal bank agencies to emphasize the importance of accurate and
complete insider recordkeeping. Management recordkeeping failures, the GAO argued, were indicative of larger
bank management problems, and management solutions in this area, the GAO reasoned, would contribute to the resolution
of management's larger problems. The Board believes that the proposed recordkeeping amendments, which attempt
to eliminate unnecessary recordkeeping and allow for alternative methods of recordkeeping, are consistent with
the GAO's recommendations. 
Commenters supported the recordkeeping amendments as a means of decreasing unnecessary paperwork burden. Commenters
uniformly supported no longer requiring credit card banks and other institutions that do not make commercial loans
to keep records on the related interests of insiders. No commenter proposed any general recordkeeping methods in
addition to those identified in the rule. 
A few commenters expressed concerns about the second recordkeeping option put forth in the proposed rule_the ``borrower
inquiry'' method. Commenters noted that in some cases a corporate borrower might be unaware that it is a related interest
of a bank insider and therefore might inadvertently misinform a bank's loan officer. For example, a corporate employee
negotiating a loan may not know that one of his company's controlling shareholders is also a director of one of the lending
bank's affiliates. Citing this possibility, several bank commenters supported the recordkeeping provision but
requested that the Board specify that use of the borrower inquiry method would give a bank a ``safe harbor'' from criticism
during an examination in the event that inaccurate certifications were accepted from borrowers. On a related point,
two commenters sought assurance that internal controls consistent with the proposed recordkeeping alternatives
would meet the compliance certification requirements of section 112 of FDICIA. 
The Board believes protections currently exist to prevent intentional misreporting by borrowers under the borrower
inquiry method. Intentional misreporting could bring criminal or civil penalties. First, a borrower that knowingly
misstates whether it is a related interest of the lending bank is criminally liable. 18 U.S.C. 1014. Second, a bank
insider to whom the corporate borrower is related and who is aware of the loan violates Regulation O if the insider permits
the related interest to receive any extension of credit not authorized under Regulation O. 12 CFR 215.6. 
The Board has also concluded that any unintentional misreporting should not be a matter of serious concern. While
there could be cases in large multi-bank holding companies where a borrower and lender are genuinely ignorant of the
relationship between them, there is no potential in those circumstances for an insider's status to improperly affect
the credit decision. 
The Board has decided to adopt the recordkeeping provisions, as proposed, with three amendments. First, in order
to address concerns about inaccurate reporting, the Board has adopted an additional safeguard to prevent the occurrence
of those reporting errors, both intentional and unintentional, that are likely to occur most frequently and that
raise the greatest concern. The final rule establishes a minimum requirement that every bank, regardless of the recordkeeping
method it selects, must conduct an annual survey to identify its own insiders (that is, its own executive officers,
directors, and principal shareholders and their related interests, but not those of its holding company affiliates).
Every bank is expected to check this short list before extending credit, even if it is employing the borrower inquiry
method of recordkeeping for affiliates in lieu of the survey method. In addition to addressing possible violations
of Regulation O, the limited survey and the short list it produces will be available for monitoring compliance with
section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.

<TEXT>
 

As for concerns about a ``safe harbor,'' the Board believes that an implicit safe harbor exists for banks electing
either one of the two recordkeeping options included in the final rule, and that following either of these options
would allow the necessary certification to be made for purposes of section 112 of FDICIA. Furthermore, under the enforcement
guidelines, the federal banking agencies should not assess civil money penalties for an inadvertent or accidental
violation of their rules. 

Second, because the commenters did not identify any recordkeeping methods other than the two proposed by the Board,
the Board has adopted a presumption in the final rule that a bank must use either one of the two identified methods unless
it can demonstrate that another method is equally effective. The suitability of any alternative procedure for monitoring
lending to insiders and their related interests must be determined, of course, on the basis of the effectiveness of
the procedure in preventing violations of law and insider abuse. Any alternative recordkeeping procedure must sufficiently
identify extensions of credit covered by Regulation O to ensure that proper monitoring of and compliance with insider
lending restrictions is maintained. 

Finally, the Board has made an explicit exemption from the requirement that a bank keep records of, or inquire about
related interests of insiders of the bank or its affiliates, for banks that are prohibited from making commercial
loans in the first place.

3

 Related interests consist only of companies or other similar entities, as a result of which a bank that is prohibited
from making commercial loans is prohibited from making loans to any company or other entity that may be a related interest.
When such a prohibition exists, recordkeeping or inquiries with respect to related interests is unnecessarily burdensome.






IV. Definition of Extension of Credit 



The Board proposed three amendments to the definition of ``extension of credit'' in Regulation O: a clarification
of the ``tangible economic benefit'' rule; a new exception for the discount by a bank of obligations sold by an insider
without recourse; and an increase in the threshold for treating credit card debt as an extension of credit. See 58 FR
47400, September 9, 1993. 



A. ``Tangible Economic Benefit'' Rule 



Regulation O provides that an extension of credit is deemed to be made to an insider when the proceeds of the credit are
used for the tangible economic benefit of, or are transferred to, the insider. 12 CFR 215.3(f). These extensions of
credit are thereby counted toward the lending limits of Regulation O. 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940224-0-00019 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940224-0-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Following the enactment of FDICIA, which expanded the lending limit provision of section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve
Act to cover directors and their related interests, questions were raised more frequently regarding the scope and
proper application of the tangible economic benefit rule. If interpreted literally, the tangible economic benefit
rule would apply whenever a bank extended credit to any person, including a member of the general public with no other
relationship to the bank, and the proceeds of the extension of credit were transferred to or used for the benefit of
an insider or an insider's related interest. For example, as one commenter noted, loans on non-preferential terms
to members of the general public to purchase homes from a builder who is a director of the bank would be treated as loans
to the builder/director. 

The tangible economic benefit rule is similar to a provision contained in section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, and
was adopted at a time when the Board was required by section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act to use the definition of
``extension of credit'' found in section 23A. See Public Law 95-630 Section 104, 92 Stat. 3644 (1978). The definition
of extension of credit in section 22(h), however, is no longer tied to section 23A, and the Board is authorized to adopt
appropriate definitions of terms in the statute. See 12 U.S.C. 375b(9)(D) and 375b(10). The Board therefore proposed
to revise the tangible economic benefit rule to clarify that it was not intended to reach such transactions, by providing
explicitly that the rule does not apply to an arm's-length

4

 extension of credit by a bank to a third party where the proceeds of the credit are used to finance the bona fide acquisition
of property, goods, or services from an insider or an insider's related interest. 





Commenters supported the proposal, and no adverse comments were received. Three commenters objected to the requirement
that any arm's-length loan satisfy the non-preferential provisions for insider loans found in  215.4(a),
labelling that requirement overly restrictive. The Board has retained the requirement, however, that loans be on
non-preferential terms, in order to prevent banks from participating in commercial promotions that benefit the
bank's insiders to the detriment of the bank.

5

 





Continuing to be covered by the tangible economic benefit rule are extensions of credit to an insider's nominee and
transactions in which the proceeds of the credit are loaned to an insider. The Board also notes that provisions of the
definition of ``extension of credit'' outside the tangible economic benefit rule will continue to reach transactions
in which an insider actually becomes obligated to a bank, ``whether the obligation arises directly or indirectly,
or because of an endorsement on an obligation or otherwise, or by any means whatsoever.'' 12 CFR 215.3(a)(8). 



B. Discount of Obligations without Recourse 



Regulation O includes within the definition of ``extension of credit'' any ``discount of promissory notes, bills
of exchange, conditional sales contracts, or similar paper, 

whether with or without recourse

.'' 12 CFR 215.3(a)(5) (emphasis added). At the time this provision was adopted, the Board was required by section
22(h) to include such items in the regulatory definition of extension of credit.

6

 However, the current statutory definition does not require the inclusion of such items where the transaction is made
without recourse to the transferor.

7

 The Board proposed to delete this provision so as to exclude non-recourse transactions from Regulation O coverage.
Transactions entered into with recourse to the transferor would continue to be covered under other provisions of
the definition. See 12 CFR 215.3(a)(4) and (8).

<DOCNO> FR940224-0-00020 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940224-0-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Board has adopted this amendment as proposed. Non-recourse transactions resemble a purchase of assets more than
the lending of money, and the final rule conforms the treatment of these transactions to the treatment of other asset
pruchases between a bank and its insiders. Moreover, these non-recourse transactions do not constitute ``extensions
of credit'' to the transferor under the National Bank Act as interpreted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
See 12 U.S.C. 84(b)(1); 12 CFR 32.2(a). These transactions will continue to be governed, however, by general standards
of safety and soundness, prohibitions against fraud and abuse, and corporate fiduciary duties.

8

 






Commenters supported the proposal, and no adverse comments were received. One commenter asked the Board to clarify
whether limited or partial recourse transactions would be treated as extensions of credit. The Board believes that
it is more appropriate to address the numerous possible recourse arrangements on a case-by-case basis. 



C. Credit Card Plan Indebtedness 



Regulation O exempts from the definition of ``extension of credit,'' and thus from Regulation O's lending limits,
indebtedness of $5,000 or less arising through any general arrangement by which a bank: (1) Acquires charge or time
credit accounts; or (2) makes payments to or on behalf of participants in a bank credit card plan or other open-end credit
plan. 12 CFR 215.3(b)(5). To qualify for the exemption, the indebtedness must be on market terms and must not involve
prior individual clearance or approval by the bank other than for the purpose of determining the borrower's eligibility
and compliance with any applicable dollar limit. 

Id.

 


The Board proposed to increase from $5,000 to $15,000 the threshold above which standard credit card loans to insiders
would be counted as extensions of credit. This proposed increase reflected widespread increases by credit card issuers
in pre-approved lending limits and, to some extent, inflation since the initial adoption of the $5,000 limit in 1979.
The Board did not propose raising the limit for extensions of credit through overdraft plans, leaving that limit at
$5,000. Extensions of credit through overdrafts in amounts up to $15,000 have not become routine. 


Commenters supported the proposed increase. Many commenters, however, requested that the increase be expanded.
Thirteen commenters suggested that the proposed $15,000 cap on the amount of excluded credit card debt either be eliminated,
increased, indexed, or periodically reviewed. Two commenters requested that credit card debt be exempted from the
cap on general purpose loans to executive officers. 


Eight commenters requested that the overdraft limit be raised by an identical amount. Commenters reasoned that one
extension of credit is the same as another and thus that no substantive difference exists between credit card loans
and overdraft extensions of credit. Moreover, some overdraft protection plans are now tied directly to credit card
lines of credit. Commenters also noted that the rationale that the credit card limit was being raised to compensate
for inflation applied equally to overdraft protection. 


The Board has decided to increase the credit card exemption from $5,000 to $15,000 and to maintain the overdraft limit
at $5,000. Raising the limit could encourage insiders to view overdraft plans as a source of credit, rather than solely
as protection against infrequent and unplanned events. The Board is not prohibiting payment of overdrafts over $5,000
pursuant to a permissible pre-approved overdraft plan, but merely providing that overdrafts over $5,000 are counted
toward the individual and aggregate lending limits of Regulation O. 


The Board believes that the proposed limit is an appropriate compromise between its concern to prevent insider lending
abuse and the added convenience that even higher or indexed limits may provide. Commenters presented no evidence
to support their argument that a cap on exempt credit card lending is no longer necessary. Finally, the Board believes
that exempting credit card loans from the cap on general purpose loans to executive officers would be more properly
addressed in the context of a more general review of executive officer lending restrictions. 




V. Consumer Installment Paper 




Pursuant to the authority granted it by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (HCDA),

9

 the Board proposed an exception to the aggregate lending limit for the discount of consumer installment paper from
an insider with recourse, so long as the bank is relying primarily upon the creditworthiness of the maker of the paper
and not on any endorsement or guarantee of the insider. Such transactions would continue to constitute extensions
of credit subject to the aggregate lending limit if the maker of the consumer installment paper was an insider. See
58 FR 47400, September 9, 1993. 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940224-0-00021 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940224-0-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The legislative history of HCDA states that the Board should make a ``zero-based review'' of any exceptions it adopts.

10

 The proposed exception is consistent with this directive. The Board has concluded that, where the bank is relying
primarily upon the creditworthiness of the underlying maker, the accompanying extension of credit to an insider
transferring the paper with recourse poses minimal risk of loss to the bank.

11

 In addition like the previous three exceptions, the new exception is found in the National Bank Act,

12

 and is incorporated as an exception to the individual lending limit in Regulation O. See 12 U.S.C. 84(c)(8); 12 CFR
215.2(h) and 215.4(c). 







Commenters generally supported the new exception, and no adverse comments were received. Three commenters argued
that the proposed requirement that a designated officer of the bank certify in writing that the bank is relying primarily
upon the maker of the discounted paper was too burdensome because it did not accommodate itself to bulk transactions
in which the bank may perform only a statistical sampling of a discounted loan portfolio. One commenter asked the Board
to clarify that the discount of consumer lease paper was included in the provision. Six commenters suggested adoption
of additional exceptions contained in the National Bank Act, and one commenter suggested an additional exception
not included in the National Bank Act. 


The requirement that a designated officer certify that the bank has followed appropriate underwriting procedures
is found in the National Bank Act, and the Board has decided to maintain consistency with that Act. 


Concerning consumer lease paper, the Board notes that an interpretative letter concerning the circumstances under
which a lease transaction may be considered to be an extension of credit for purposes of Regulation O has previously
been issued. See Interpretative Letter dated April 8, 1976. The Board believes that it would be more appropriate to
provide further guidance as to the treatment of particular transactions under Regulation O on a case-by-case basis.



Additional exemptions found in the National Bank Act have not been adopted. Those are either limited exemptions,
exemptions for credit secured by collateral that is not stable and liquid, or exemptions that would be difficult to
administer in the Regulation O context. Other exemptions suggested by commenters would require statutory change.





VI. Loans to Executive Officers 




The Board proposed three amendments to the rules governing extensions of credit by a bank to its executive officers:
A new exemption to the limit for general purpose loans that are fully collateralized by certain categories of highly
stable and liquid collateral; clarification that home mortgage loan refinancing, subject to certain limitations,
is included in the category of home mortgage loans; and a restatement of the prior approval requirement in section
22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act. See 58 FR 47400, September 9, 1993.

<TEXT>
 

A. General Purpose Loans 



Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act establishes a special additional rule for extensions of credit by a bank to
its executive officers. In general, a bank's lending to each of its executive officers is limited to an amount equal
to the greater of $25,000 or 2.5 percent of the bank's capital and unimpaired surplus, but not to exceed $100,000. 12
CFR 215.5(c). Qualifying home mortgage loans and educational loans are not counted toward this limit, although they
do count toward the general individual and aggregate lending limits applicable to all insiders under  215.4
of Regulation O. 12 CFR 215.5(c)(1) and (2). Also, unlike the general individual and aggregate lending limits, there
has been no exception to the executive officer lending limit based on the manner in which the extension of credit is
collateralized. 

The Board proposed to create an exemption to the general purpose lending limit for loans to executive officers for
loans fully secured by: (a) Obligations of the United States or other obligations fully guaranteed as to principal
and interest by the United States; (b) commitments or guarantees of a department or agency of the United States; or
(c) a segregated deposit account with the lending bank. 

The Board previously has determined that extensions of credit collateralized in the manner described above pose
minimal risk of loss to a bank. See 58 FR 26507, May 4, 1993. In view of this determination, the Board has concluded that
it is consistent with safe and sound banking practices to increase the amount of credit that a bank may extend to its
executive officers when the credit is secured as described above. Because such loans would continue to be subject
to the prohibitions against preferential lending, the Board also believes that the proposed exception would not
lend itself to evasions of the law or any other abuse. 

Commenters supported the proposed exception. Six commenters suggested that additional categories of exempt extensions
of credit be adopted. Nine commenters requested that the current $100,000 cap on general purpose loans be increased,
and two commenters suggested that the cap be eliminated altogether. One commenter suggested that loans to an executive
officer serving in a bona fide fiduciary capacity not be included as loans to the executive officer for purposes of
12 CFR 215.5(c). 

The additional exceptions that have been proposed apply more readily to loans made in a commercial context rather
than to personal loans. Section 215.5 primarily governs personal loans, however, and the additional proposals therefore
are neither necessary nor appropriate. The Board also considers it more appropriate to reconsider the appropriate
lending limit for executive officers in connection with a more general review of executive officer restrictions.
Finally, the Board notes that the proper treatment under Regulation O of loans to an executive officer serving in a
bona fide fiduciary capacity has previously been addressed. See I Fed. Res. Reg. Serv. 3-1048. The Board will
provide any further guidance on this issue on a case-by-case basis. 



B. Refinancing of Home Mortgage Loans 



Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act provides that a bank may make a loan to its executive officer, without restriction
as to amount, if the loan is secured by a first lien on a dwelling that is owned by the executive officer and used by the
executive officer as a residence after the loan is made. 12 U.S.C. 375a(2). Section 215.5(c)(2) of Regulation O implements
this provision, and sets forth additional restrictions on such loans. 

The Board proposed to revise the regulation to provide clearly that the refinancing of a home mortgage loan is included
within this category to the extent that the proceeds are used to pay off the prior home mortgage loan or for one or more
of the permissible purposes enumerated in 12 CFR 215.5(c)(2). 

Comments were generally supportive. Two commenters asked the Board to clarify that the closing costs of a home mortgage
refinancing are included as part of the qualifying portion of the loan. Two commenters requested that all proceeds
of a home mortgage refinancing be included in this category. 

The Board, as requested in the comments, has revised the regulation further to provide expressly that closing costs
are included as part of the exempt portion of a home mortgage refinancing, and to make other clarifying changes. Inclusion
within the exemption of proceeds of a refinancing that may be used for unrestricted purposes is prohibited by the enabling
statute. 



C. Prior Approval of Home Mortgage Loans 



Section 22(g) provides that the board of directors of a bank must specifically approve in advance a home mortgage loan
to an executive officer. 12 U.S.C. 375a(2). Regulation O, however, does not set forth this requirement. The Board
proposed that 12 CFR 215.5(c) be revised to conform to the enabling statute. 

Comments upon this proposal were mixed. One commenter asked the Board to clarify that prior approval is required for
all home mortgage loans regardless of size, notwithstanding the general provisions of Regulation O that require
prior approval only for loans in excess of a calculated amount. See 12 CFR 215.4(b). Two commenters suggested that
the Board rely on its rulemaking authority not to conform to the statute, and two commenters asked the Board to seek
relief from this requirement from Congress. 

The Board has adopted this provision substantially as proposed. As discussed above, the Board has added an introductory
statement to  215.5 to clarify that the requirements for extensions of credit to executive officers under that
section, pursuant to section 22(g), are in addition to the general requirements for insiders set forth elsewhere
in Regulation O. The Board lacks the authority to adopt a provision of Regulation O that does not conform to the statutory
prior approval requirement. The additional comments are beyond the scope of this rulemaking.

VII. Conforming Definition of ``Bank'' 



Subpart B of Regulation O partially implements the reporting requirements of title VIII of FIRA, as amended by the
Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982
 and FDICIA. 12 U.S.C. 1972(2)(G). Section 215.22 requires an executive officer or principal shareholder of a bank
to report to the bank each year if the person or any related interest of the person borrowed during the prior calendar
year from a correspondent bank of the bank. 




As originally enacted, a correspondent bank was defined in title VIII of FIRA to include a bank as defined in the Bank
Holding Company Act. Title VIII was subsequently amended to include in the definition a mutual savings bank, a savings
bank, and a savings association as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. 12 U.S.C. 1971 and 1972(H).
The Board proposed to amend the definition of bank in subpart B of Regulation O to conform the rule to the statutory amendments.
See 58 FR 47400, September 9, 1993. 

Comments were favorable, and the Board has adopted this provision as proposed. 



VIII. Technical Amendments 



The Board has adopted a series of technical amendments to Regulation O that are designed to make the regulation more
easily understandable and somewhat shorter. The amendments include a new definition of ``affiliate,'' which makes
the regulation read more clearly and allows various cross-references and footnotes to be eliminated. Because the
technical amendments do not make any substantive change to the regulation, notice and comment on them was not required.




IX. Final Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.) requires an agency to prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis when the agency promulgates a final rule.
Two of the requirements of a final regulatory flexibility analysis, a succinct statement of the need for and objectives
of the rule, and a summary and assessment of issues raised by the public comments and of any changes made in the proposed
rule as a result thereof (5 U.S.C. 604(b)), are contained in the summary and supplementary information above. No significant
alternatives to the final rule were considered by the agency. 



X. Paperwork Reduction Act 



In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3507, and 5 CFR 1320.130, the Board, under authority
delegated by the Office of Management and Budget, has reviewed its amendments to Regulation O. The Board has determined
that the revisions do not significantly increase the burden of the reporting institutions. The changes are expected
to reduce regulatory burden for some banks, particularly small community banks and rural banks, but the estimated
effect on aggregate burden calculations is not deemed to be significant. 



List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 215

or by any means whatsoever.

(1) An advance against accrued salary or other accrued compensation, or an advance for the payment of authorized travel
or other expenses incurred or to be incurred on behalf of the bank; 

(2) A receipt by a bank of a check deposited in or delivered to the bank in the usual course of business unless it results
in the carrying of a cash item for or the granting of an overdraft (other than an inadvertent overdraft in a limited amount

course of business considered to be a loan, advance or extension of credit to the depositing bank. 

(d) For purposes of  215.4 of this part, an extension of credit by a member bank is considered to have been made

(2) 

Exception. 

An extension of credit is not considered made to an insider under paragraph (f)(1) of this section if: 

(i) The credit is extended on terms that would satisfy the standard set forth in  215.4(a) of this part for extensions
of credit to insiders; and 

(ii) The proceeds of the extension of credit are used in a bona fide transaction to acquire property, goods, or services
from the insider. 



 215.4 

General prohibitions. 



(a) 

Terms and creditworthiness. 

No member bank may extend credit to any insider of the bank or insider of its affiliates unless the extension of credit:


(1) Is made on substantially the same terms (including interest rates and collateral) as, and following credit underwriting
procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions by the bank
with other persons that are not covered by this part and who are not employed by the bank; and 

(2) Does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. 

(b) 

Prior approval. 

(1) No member bank may extend credit (which term includes granting a line of credit) to any insider of the bank or insider
of its affiliates in an amount that, when aggregated with the amount of all other extensions of credit to that person
and to all related interests of that person, exceeds the higher of $25,000 or 5 percent of the member bank's unimpaired
capital and unimpaired surplus, unless: 

(i) The extension of credit has been approved in advance by a majority of the entire board of directors of that bank;
and 

(ii) The interested party has abstained from participating directly or indirectly in the voting. 

(2) In no event may a member bank extend credit to any insider of the bank or insider of its affiliates in an amount that,
when aggregated with all other extensions of credit to that person, and all related interests of that person, exceeds
$500,000, except by complying with the requirements of this paragraph (b). 

(3) Approval by the board of directors under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section is not required for an extension
of credit that is made pursuant to a line of credit that was approved under paragraph (b)(1) of this section within 14
months of the date of the extension of credit. The extension of credit must also be in compliance with the requirements
of  215.4(a) of this part. 

(4) Participation in the discussion, or any attempt to influence the voting, by the board of directors regarding an
extension of credit constitutes indirect participation in the voting by the board of directors on an extension of
credit.

(c) 

Individual lending limit_

No member bank may extend credit to any insider of the bank or insider of its affiliates in an amount that, when aggregated
with the amount of all other extensions of credit by the member bank to that person and to all related interests of that
person, exceeds the lending limit of the member bank specified in  215.2(i) of this part. This prohibition does
not apply to an extension of credit by a member bank to a company of which the member bank is a subsidiary or to any other
subsidiary of that company. 

(d) 

Aggregate lending limit

 _(1) 

General limit.

 A member bank may not extend credit to any insider of the bank or insider of its affiliates unless the extension of credit
is in an amount that, when aggregated with the amount of all outstanding extensions of credit by that bank to all such
insiders, does not exceed the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus (as defined in  215.2(i) of
this part). 

(2) 

Member banks with deposits of less than $100,000,000.

 (i) A member bank with deposits of less than $100,000,000 may by an annual resolution of its board of directors increase
the general limit specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to a level not to exceed two times the bank's unimpaired
capital and unimpaired surplus, if: 

(A) The board of directors determines that such higher limit is consistent with prudent, safe, and sound banking practices
in light of the bank's experience in lending to its insiders and is necessary to attract or retain directors or to prevent
restricting the availability of credit in small communities; 

(B) The resolution sets forth the facts and reasoning on which the board of directors bases the finding, including
the amount of the bank's lending to its insiders as a percentage of the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus
as of the date of the resolution; 

(C) The bank meets or exceeds, on a fully-phased in basis, all applicable capital requirements established by the
appropriate Federal banking agency; and 

(D) The bank received a satisfactory composite rating in its most recent report of examination. 

(ii) If a member bank has adopted a resolution authorizing a higher limit pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section
and subsequently fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(i)(C) or (d)(2)(i)(D) of this section, the member
bank shall not extend any additional credit (including a renewal of any existing extension of credit) to any insider
of the bank or its affiliates unless such extension or renewal is consistent with the general limit in paragraph (d)(1)
of this section. 

(3) 

Exceptions. 

(i) The general limit specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section does not apply to the following: 

(A) Extensions of credit secured by a perfected security interest in bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness,
or Treasury bills of the United States or in other such obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by
the United States; 

(B) Extensions of credit to or secured by unconditional takeout commitments or guarantees of any department, agency,
bureau, board, commission or establishment of the United States or any corporation wholly owned directly or indirectly
by the United States; 

(C) Extensions of credit secured by a perfected security interest in a segregated deposit account in the lending bank;
or 

(D) Extensions of credit arising from the discount of negotiable or nonnegotiable installment consumer paper that
is acquired from an insider and carries a full or partial recourse endorsement or guarantee by the insider, provided
that: 

(

1

) The financial condition of each maker of such consumer paper is reasonably documented in the bank's files or known
to its officers; 

(

2

) An officer of the bank designated for that purpose by the board of directors of the bank certifies in writing that the
bank is relying primarily upon the responsibility of each maker for payment of the obligation and not upon any endorsement
or guarantee by the insider; and 

(

3

) The maker of the instrument is not an insider. 
 
(ii) The exceptions in paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A) through (d)(3)(i)(C) of this section apply only to the amounts of
such extensions of credit that are secured in the manner described therein. 

(e) 

Overdrafts. 

(1) No member bank may pay an overdraft of an executive officer or director of the bank

(ii) A written, preauthorized transfer of funds from another account of the account holder at the bank. 

(2) The prohibition in paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not apply to payment of inadvertent overdrafts on an account
in an aggregate amount of $1,000 or less, provided: 

(i) The account is not overdrawn for more than 5 business days; and 

(ii) The member bank charges the executive officer or director the same fee charged any other customer of the bank in
similar circumstances.

 215.5 

Additional restrictions on loans to executive officers of member banks. 


The following restrictions on extensions of credit by a member bank to any of its executive officers apply in addition
to any restrictions on extensions of credit by a member bank to insiders of itself or its affiliates set forth elsewhere
in this part. The restrictions of this section apply only to executive officers of the member bank and not to executive
officers of its affiliates. 
(a) No member bank may extend credit to any of its executive officers, and no executive officer of a member bank shall
borrow from or otherwise become indebted to the bank, except in the amounts, for the purposes, and upon the conditions
specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. 
(b) No member bank may extend credit in an aggregate amount greater than the amount permitted in paragraph (c)(3) of
this section to a partnership in which one or more of the bank's executive officers are partners and, either individually
or together, hold a majority interest. For the purposes of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the total amount of credit
extended by a member bank to such partnership is considered to be extended to each executive officer of the member bank
who is a member of the partnership. 
(c) A member bank is authorized to extend credit to any executive officer of the bank: 
(1) In any amount to finance the education of the executive officer's children; 
(2) With the specific prior approval of the board of directors, in any amount to finance or refinance the purchase,
construction, maintenance, or improvement of a residence of the executive officer, provided: 
(i) The extension of credit is secured by a first lien on the residence and the residence is owned (or expected to be owned
after the extension of credit) by the executive officer; and 
(ii) In the case of a refinancing, that only the amount thereof used to repay the original extension of credit, together
with the closing costs of the refinancing, and any additional amount thereof used for any of the purposes enumerated
in this paragraph (c)(2), are included within this category of credit; 
(3) In any amount, if the extension of credit is secured in a manner described in  215.4(d)(3)(i)(A) through
(d)(3)(i)(C) of this part; and 
(4) For any other purpose not specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section, if the aggregate amount
of extensions of credit to that executive officer under this paragraph does not exceed at any one time the higher of
2.5 per cent of the bank's capital and unimpaired surplus or $25,000, but in no event more than $100,000. 
(d) Any extension of credit by a member bank to any of its executive officers shall be: 
(1) Promptly reported to the member bank's board of directors; 
(2) In compliance with the requirements of  215.4(a) of this part; 
(3) Preceded by the submission of a detailed current financial statement of the executive officer; and 
(4) Made subject to the condition in writing that the extension of credit will, at the option of the member bank, become
due and payable at any time that the officer is indebted to any other bank or banks in an aggregate amount greater than
the amount specified for a category of credit in paragraph (c) of this section. 


 215.6 

Prohibition on knowingly receiving unauthorized extension of credit. 


No executive officer, director, or principal shareholder of a member bank or any of its affiliates shall knowingly
receive (or knowingly permit any of that person's related interests to receive) from a member bank, directly or indirectly,
any extension of credit not authorized under this part.

Extensions of credit outstanding on March 10, 1979. 


(a) Any extension of credit that was outstanding on March 10, 1979, and that would, if made on or after March 10, 1979,
violate  215.4(c) of this part, shall be reduced in amount by March 10, 1980, to be in compliance with the lending
limit in  215.4(c) of this part. Any renewal or extension of such an extension of credit on or after March 10, 1979,
shall be made only on terms that will bring the extension of credit into compliance with the lending limit of  215.4(c)
of this part by March 10, 1980. However, any extension of credit made before March 10, 1979, that bears a specific maturity
date of March 10, 1980, or later, shall be repaid in accordance with its repayment schedule in existence on or before
March 10, 1979. 
(b) If a member bank is unable to bring all extensions of credit outstanding on March 10, 1979, into compliance as required
by paragraph (a) of this section, the member bank shall promptly report that fact to the Comptroller of the Currency,
in the case of a national bank, or to the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank, in the case of a State member bank, and explain
the reasons why all the extensions of credit cannot be brought into compliance. The Comptroller or the Reserve Bank,
as the case may be, is authorized, on the basis of good cause shown, to extend the March 10, 1980, date for compliance
for any extension of credit for not more than two additional one-year periods. 


 215.8 

Records of member banks. 


(a) 

In general. 

Each member bank shall maintain records necessary for compliance with the requirements of this part. 
(b) 

Recordkeeping for insiders of the member bank. 

Any recordkeeping method adopted by a member bank shall: 
(1) Identify, through an annual survey, all insiders of the bank itself; and 
(2) Maintain records of all extensions of credit to insiders of the bank itself, including the amount and terms of each
such extension of credit. 
(c) 

Recordkeeping for insiders of the member bank's affiliates. 

Any recordkeeping method adopted by a member bank shall maintain records of extensions of credit to insiders of the
member bank's affiliates by: 
(1) 

Survey method. 

(i) Identifying, through an annual survey, each insider of the member bank's affiliates; and 
(ii) Maintaining records of the amount and terms of each extension of credit by the member bank to such insiders; or

(2) 

Borrower inquiry method. 

(i) Requiring as part of each extension of credit that the borrower indicate whether the borrower is an insider of an
affiliate of the member bank; and 
(ii) Maintaining records that identify the amount and terms of each extension of credit by the member bank to borrowers
so identifying themselves. (3) 

Alternative recordkeeping methods for insiders of affiliates. 

A member bank may employ a recordkeeping method other than those identified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this
section if the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that the bank's method is at least as effective as the
identified methods. 
(d) 

Special rule for non-commercial lenders. 

A member bank that is prohibited by law or by an express resolution of the board of directors of the bank from making an
extension of credit to any company or other entity that is covered by this part as a company is not required to maintain
any records of the related interests of the insiders of the bank or its affiliates or to inquire of borrowers whether
they are related interests of the insiders of the bank or its affiliates. 


 215.9 

Reports by executive officers. 


Each executive officer of a member bank who becomes indebted to any other bank or banks in an aggregate amount greater
than the amount specified for a category of credit in  215.5(c) of this part, shall, within 10 days of the date
the indebtedness reaches such a level, make a written report to the board of directors of the officer's bank. The report
shall state the lender's name, the date and amount of each extension of credit, any security for it, and the purposes
for which the proceeds have been or are to be used.

(a) 

Definitions.

 For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply: 
(1) 

Principal shareholder of a member bank

 means any person

4

 other than an insured bank, or a foreign bank as defined in 12 U.S.C. 3101(7), that, directly or indirectly, owns, controls,
or has power to vote more than 10 percent of any class of voting securities of the member bank. The term includes a person
that controls a principal shareholder (e.g., a person that controls a bank holding company). Shares of a bank (including
a foreign bank), bank holding company, or other company owned or controlled by a member of an individual's immediate
family are presumed to be owned or controlled by the individual for the purposes of determining principal shareholder
status. 




(2) 

Related interest

 means: 
(i) Any company controlled by a person; or 
(ii) Any political or campaign committee the funds or services of which will benefit a person or that is controlled
by a person. For the purpose of this section and subpart B of this part, a related interest does not include a bank or a
foreign bank (as defined in 12 U.S.C. 3101(7)). 
(b) 

Public disclosure.

 (1) Upon receipt of a written request from the public, a member bank shall make available the names of each of its executive
officers and each of its principal shareholders to whom, or to whose related interests, the member bank had outstanding
as of the end of the latest previous quarter of the year, an extension of credit that, when aggregated with all other
outstanding extensions of credit at such time from the member bank to such person and to all related interests of such
person, equaled or exceeded 5 percent of the member bank's capital and unimpaired surplus of $500,000, whichever
amount is less. No disclosure under this paragraph is required if the aggregate amount of all extensions of credit
outstanding at such time from the member bank to the executive officer or principal shareholder of the member bank
and to all related interests of such a person does not exceed $25,000. 
(2) A member bank is not required to disclose the specific amounts of individual extensions of credit. 
(c) 

Maintaining records.

 Each member bank shall maintain records of all requests for the information described in paragraph (b) of this section
and the disposition of such requests. These records may be disposed of after two years from the date of the request.



 215.12 

Reporting requirement for credit secured by certain bank stock. 


Each executive officer or director of a member bank the shares of which are not publicly traded shall report annually
to the board of directors of the member bank the outstanding amount of any credit that was extended to the executive
officer or director and that is secured by shares of the member bank. 


 215.13 

Civil penalties. 


Any member bank, or any officer, director, employee, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs
of the bank, that violates any provision of this part (other than  215.11 of this part) is subject to civil penalties
as specified in section 29 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 504).

Definition of Predominantly Minority Neighborhood




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Resolution Trust Corporation.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) is hereby adopting an interim rule which defines ``predominantly minority
neighborhood'' as used in section 21A(s) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (FHLBA) and section 21A(w)(17) of the FHLBA,
as amended by the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act. Section 21A(w)(17) of the FHLBA requires, among other
things, that in considering offers to acquire any insured depository institution, or any branch of an insured depository
institution, located in a predominantly minority neighborhood (as defined in regulations prescribed under section
21A(s) of the FHLBA), the Corporation shall give preference to an offer from any minority individual, minority-owned
business, or a minority depository institution, over any other offer that results in the same cost to the Corporation,
as determined under section 13(c)(4) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Section 21A(s) of the FHLBA permits the
RTC to lease to a minority acquiror, on a rent-free basis, subject to certain conditions, any branch of a failed institution
which is located in a ``predominantly minority neighborhood.'' Section 21A(w)(17) of the FHLBA also generally provides
that the RTC may provide to such minority individual, minority-owned business, or minority depository institution
additional preferences in the form of capital assistance and performing assets. The interim rule generally defines
``predominantly minority neighborhood'' as any U.S. Postal Zip Code geographical area in which 50% or more of the
persons residing therein are minorities based upon the most recent Census data, unless the RTC has determined, in
its sole discretion, that other reasonably reliable, readily accessible data indicates different neighborhood
boundaries. The RTC is also seeking comment on the interim rule.



This interim rule is effective on February 24, 1994.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background 



In August 1989, Congress enacted section 501 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act
of 1989, (FIRREA), (codified as section 21A(b) of the FHLBA, 12 U.S.C. 1441a(b)), which established the Resolution
Trust Corporation (RTC). Pursuant to FIRREA the RTC has the duty to manage and resolve failed depository institutions
that come under its jurisdiction and to conduct the operations of the RTC in a manner which ``maximizes the * * *
return from the sale of institutions or assets,'' ``makes efficient use of funds'' and ``minimizes * * *
losses * * * in the resolution of [failed institutions]''. Section 21A(b)(3) of the FHLBA, as added
by section 501(a) of FIRREA. In addition, the RTC is required to resolve all failed institutions in the ``least costly
* * * of all possible methods'' (collectively Cost Constraints). Section 13(c)(4)(A)(ii) of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), 12 U.S.C. 1823(c)(4)(A)(ii), as made applicable by section 21A(b)(4) of the
FHLBA, 12 U.S.C. 1441a(b)(4). The RTC is committed, wherever practicable and whenever consistent with those statutory
Cost Constraints, to preserving the ownership characteristics of historically minority-owned depository institutions,
and to increasing the total number of minority-owned depository institutions. 

See,

 Strategic Plan for the Resolution Trust Corporation, 54 FR 46574, November 3, 1989. 

Section 21A(s) of the FHLBA permits the RTC to make available to an acquiror which is either a minority depository institution
or a women's depository institution, on a rent-free lease basis for not less than 5 years, any branch of a failed institution
which is located in a ``predominantly minority neighborhood.'' 

Section 21A(w)(17) of the FHLBA, which was added by section 3(a) of the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act,
Pub. L. 103-204 (the Act), provides that in considering offers to acquire any insured depository institution,
or any branch thereof, located in a ``predominantly minority neighborhood'', (as defined in regulations prescribed
under subsection (s)), the RTC shall give preference to an offer from a minority individual, minority-owned business,
or a minority depository institution (Minority Acquiror), over any other offer that results in the same cost to the
RTC as determined under section 13(c)(4)(A) of the FDIA.
 





This interim rule defines ``predominantly minority neighborhood'' as used in sections 21A(s) and 21A(w)(17) of
the FHLBA as a geographic area constituting a United States Postal Service 5-digit Zip Code (Zip Code) in which 50%
or more of the persons residing therein are minorities, based upon the most recent census data, unless the RTC determines,
in its sole discretion, that other reasonably reliable, readily accessible data indicates different neighborhood
boundaries. The population data and the minority composition of these Zip Codes are determined using the most recent
(currently 1990 data) Census of Population data (Census Data) collected and published by the U.S. Department of Commerce,
Economics and Statistics Administration, Bureau of the Census (Census Bureau). 

If the institution or a branch thereof is located in a Zip Code area for which no significant Census Data is available
(e.g., a business district or office building) the Zip Code of a nearby geographic area served by the institution or
branch, for which such Census Data is available, will be used as its Zip Code for purposes of this rule. If the RTC determines,
in its sole discretion, based upon other reasonably reliable and readily accessible data, and subject to RTC's Cost
Constraints, that a different delineation would more accurately reflect the area served by the financial institution
or branch to be marketed, the RTC will use such delineation as the boundaries for the relevant neighborhood. 

There is no legislative history which might provide clear guidance in developing a definition of ``predominantly
minority neighborhood.'' Consequently, except for the word ``minority'' which is statutorily defined, the definition
of ``predominantly minority neighborhood'' was, therefore, developed based upon the common or ordinary meanings
of the individual words comprising the phrase, the statutory context in which they have been used, and based upon readily
available data.

One of the ordinary meanings of the word ``predominant'' is ``the most common.'' WEBSTER'S II NEW RIVERSIDE UNIVERSITY
DICTIONARY 927 (1988). Since in the context of this statutory framework a neighborhood can only be either a minority
neighborhood or a non-minority neighborhood, the most common or prevalent of two categories means a majority or more
than half. Moreover, consistent with the legislative purpose of preserving and promoting minority ownership and
service, in the case of any exact 50% split between the two categories, minorities should be viewed as predominant.
Therefore, if half or more of the residents of a neighborhood are minorities, that neighborhood is predominantly
minority.

The word ``minority'' is defined by statute to have the meaning given such term in section 1204(c)(3) of FIRREA. Sections
21A(s) & 21A(w)(17) of the FHLBA. Section 1204(c)(3) of FIRREA defines ``minority'' to mean ``any Black American,
Native American, Hispanic American, or Asian American.'' This interim rule provides a definition of the word ``minority''
which incorporates the statutory definition but permits the use of equivalent classifications used by the Census
Bureau in collecting the Census Data. Among other categories, the Census Bureau collects and publishes population
Census Data by State, County, County subdivision, Place, Zip Code (available on CD-rom or tape) Census Tract or block
numbering area, Block group, and Block. Each census of the U.S. population provides data on the minority composition
of those areas in a manner which corresponds with the statutory definition of ``minority'' in FIRREA. The population
classifications utilized in the Census Data for the 1990 census are: Hispanic origin and the following racial categories:
White; Black; American Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut; Asian or Pacific Islander; and Other Race. Bureau of the Census,
Economics and Statistics Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1990 CENSUS OF POPULATION, GENERAL POPULATION
CHARACTERISTICS (1992). Since Census Data is readily available, its use to determine the minority composition of
a particular geographic area is not only reasonable and efficient, but also consistent with the RTC's statutory Cost
Constraints.

The ordinary dictionary meaning of the word ``neighborhood'' is a district or area with distinctive characteristics.
WEBSTER'S II NEW RIVERSIDE UNIVERSITY DICTIONARY 789 (1988). Neighborhoods vary in size and can be contained within
each other. Since the only reasonably reliable population data which is readily available on a nationwide basis is
Census Data, it is both reasonable and cost-efficient to define ``neighborhood'' in terms of the geographic areas
utilized by the Census Bureau. Census Data, including minority composition, is available for specific geographic
areas, including among others, State, County, County subdivision, Place, Zip Code, Census Tract, Block and Block
group. Census Tracts and Zip Codes appear to be the only such categories which might approximate the size and characteristics
of a ``neighborhood'' served by an ``institution, or any branch'' thereof.






The United States Postal Service has subdivided the United States and its territories into discrete geographic areas
for purposes of the distribution of mail, and has designated each such area with a 5-digit numeric Zip Code. See, U.S.
Postal Service, 1993 NATIONAL FIVE-DIGIT ZIP CODE & POST OFFICE DIRECTORY. The individual areas defined by the
Zip Codes generally correspond to a district or area with distinctive characteristics. The Zip Code itself is one
distinctive characteristic that ties the area and its residents together. Moreover, most Zip Code areas are further
distinguished by the presence of a postal facility designed to service those neighborhoods. Accordingly, Zip Codes
constitute an existing, comprehensive system for describing areas that generally approximate neighborhoods.

Individual Census Tracts and Census Blocks, by their nature, do not appear to be reasonable alternatives to Zip Codes
to utilize on a general basis. According to the Census Bureau, Census Blocks are small areas bounded on all sides by
visible features such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by invisible boundaries such as city,
town, township, and county limits, property lines, and short, imaginary extensions of streets and roads. Bureau
of the Census, Economics and Statistics Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1990 CENSUS OF HOUSING, GENERAL
HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS (1992). Individual Census Blocks because of their size appear to be inappropriate for determining
the boundaries of a neighborhood served by a financial institution, or a branch thereof on a general basis. Census
Tracts,
 although larger than Census Blocks, are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a country which
usually have between 2,500 and 8,000 persons, and when first delineated, are designed to be homogeneous with respect
to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. Bureau of the Census, Economics and Statistics
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1990 CENSUS OF HOUSING, GENERAL HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS (1992).







Individual Census Tracts or Census Blocks are generally impractical for use in defining the boundaries of a neighborhood
served by a financial institution, or a branch thereof, on a generally uniform basis and are inconsistent with the
spirit of the legislation. However, use of Census Tracts or Census Blocks on an individual or aggregate basis may be
appropriate on an exception basis. The Act is intended to enhance opportunities for Minorities to acquire institutions
and branches which primarily ``serve'' Minority residents. 139 Cong. Rec. H10899-900 (daily ed. November
22, 1993) (statement of Rep. Mfume). The people served by a depository institution or branch may be located over a relatively
large geographic area, generally transcending Census Block boundaries and, most likely, Census Tract boundaries
as well. Census Tracts and Census Blocks tend to be small areas, focused only on residences and are generally not focused
on all residential neighborhoods served by a local financial institution, or a branch office thereof.



The Zip Codes (and the boundaries thereof) of offices of a failed institution tend to be larger areas and are readily
ascertainable both by RTC personnel and by potential bidders. Such is not the case for Census Tracts. The addresses
of each of the offices of a failed institution already contain the Zip Code, and the boundaries of each Zip Code area
are available at the local Post Office.



Notwithstanding the obvious advantages of a definition based on fixed methodology, circumstances may arise where
that approach fails to accurately reflect the reality of the relevant neighborhood. For example, if an institution
or branch is physically located within Zip Code 00001, near the boundary with Zip Code 00002, a mechanical application
of the Zip Code approach would indicate that the branch serves customers in the neighborhood defined by Zip Code 00001.
Or for example, a rigid application of the Zip Code approach to the individual offices of an institution might preclude
the designation of the whole institution as being located in a predominantly minority neighborhood, although other
rational bases might exist for a determination that the institution as a whole is located in a predominantly minority
neighborhood. Therefore, rather than rigidly applying the Zip Code approach, if the RTC determines, in its sole discretion
and subject to its Cost Constraints, that other reasonably reliable information and data, that is readily accessible
to it, indicates different boundaries which more accurately reflect the relevant neighborhood, the RTC may define
the relevant neighborhood in terms of those different boundaries.




Conclusion





The RTC's definition of ``predominantly minority neighborhood'' is based on readily available, established and
accepted information: Zip Codes and Census Data. A ``predominantly minority neighborhood'' can, therefore, be
identified using existing, objective standards: (1) A Zip Code to define the geographic area which generally constitutes
the neighborhood and (2) Census Data to determine the minority composition of that neighborhood. In the event that
the RTC, in its sole discretion, determines that other reasonably reliable information and data, that is readily
accessible to it, indicates more accurate boundaries for such neighborhood, the RTC will define such neighborhood
using those more accurate boundaries. The proposed definition permits the RTC to quickly identify ``predominantly
minority neighborhoods'' without delaying the resolution of an institution consistent with the RTC's statutory
Cost Constraints. The methodology adopted by this interim rule constitutes a reasonable basis upon which to define
``predominantly minority neighborhood'' consistent with the purposes of sections 21A(s) and (w)(17) of the FHLBA
and consistent with the RTC's duties in resolving failed institutions.




Administrative Procedure Act





The RTC is adopting this rule as an interim rule. It will be effective immediately upon publication in the 

Federal Register

 without the usual notice and comment period or delayed effective date as provided for in the Administrative Procedure
Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. These requirements may be waived for ``good cause.'' The definition provided by the interim rule
implements the Act. Promulgation of the rule on an expedited basis is necessary to permit the immediate implementation
of the new statute in order to avoid the additional losses that would otherwise be incurred due to the delay in the resolution
of failed institutions pending the usual delayed effective date. Thus, the RTC finds that the benefits to the public
in adopting the interim rule outweigh any possible harm resulting from not seeking comment on the proposed rule in
advance of its effective date. The RTC actively solicits comment on this interim rule and will consider those comments
in the adoption of the rule as final.





Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis





As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.,

 the following initial regulatory flexibility analysis is provided:



1. Reasons, objectives, and legal bases underlying the interim rule. These elements have been discussed above in
the Supplementary Information section.



2. Small entities to which the rule would apply. This rule applies equally to acquiring institutions of all sizes inasmuch
as the RTC has been given no discretion in this matter by Congress.



3. Impact of the interim rule on small businesses. There is no burden imposed on small businesses by this rule which
merely defines, pursuant to Congressional direction, a term utilized in the statute.

4. Overlapping or conflicting federal rules. There are no known federal rules that overlap, duplicate, or conflict
with the interim rule.

5. Alternatives to the interim rule. The RTC has not identified alternatives that would be less burdensome to small
businesses and yet effectively accomplish the objectives of the rule because there is no burden imposed on small business.



Request for Public Comment



The RTC is issuing this interim rule in response to statutory direction to define ``predominantly minority neighborhood.''
The RTC is, however, hereby requesting comment during a 30-day comment period on all aspects of the interim rule.

master pulley and cable with new parts of improved design. Reports of cable fatigue, particularly the master pulley
cable, on several of the affected airplanes 
prompted this action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent flap system failure caused by cable
fatigue, which could result in loss of control of the airplane. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that would apply to certain Twin Commander
500, 520, 560, 680, 681, 685, 690, 695, and 720 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 19, 1993 (58 FR 38540). The action proposed to require inspecting the flap system for cables with broken wires
and pulleys with worn clips, replacing any damaged parts, and replacing the master pulley with a new part of improved
design. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with Twin Commander Service Bulletin No. 210, dated
February 1, 1991. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the two 
comments received. 

One commenter, the Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation, supports the proposed rule, and recommends wording the
proposed AD to more closely coincide with Service Bulletin 210, dated February 1, 1991. The FAA concurs and has reworded
the proposal accordingly. This change does not add any additional burden upon U.S. owners/operators of the affected
airplanes than was originally proposed. 

The other commenter states that a parts availability problem may occur if owners/operators of the affected airplanes
find as many damaged pulleys in 
the cable system as this owner/operator did on a Model 690B airplane. This commenter feels that there is not sufficient
parts inventory to coincide with the 50-hour time-in-service (TIS) compliance time, and recommends changing the
compliance time to 12 months. The FAA does not concur. Twin Commander has assured the FAA that there will be adequate
parts available for all required repairs. In addition, if a temporary delay in parts availability should occur, then
an owner/operator could request an extension of the compliance time 
through instructions specified in paragraph (d) of the proposed AD. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this
comment. 

After careful review of all available information, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest
require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for the wording changes referenced above and minor editorial corrections.
The FAA has determined that these minor changes and corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional
burden upon the public than was already proposed. 

The FAA estimates that 1,860 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
25 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55
an hour. Parts cost approximately $600 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S.
operators is estimated to be $3,673,500. This figure is based upon the assumption that none of the affected airplane
operators have accomplished the required actions. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore,
in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a 
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the
criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action is contained in
the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Limit on Duty-Free Insular Watches in Calendar Year 1994



AGENCIES: 

Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce; Office of Territorial and
International Affairs, Department of the Interior.




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action amends 15 CFR Part 303, which governs duty-exemption allocations and duty-refund entitlements for watch
producers in the United States' insular possessions (the Virgin Islands, Guam and American Samoa) and the Northern
Mariana Islands. The amendments establish the total quantity and territorial shares of duty-exemption for 1994
and adjust the wages considered creditable towards the production incentive certificate (PIC).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The insular possessions' watch industry provision in Section 110 of Public Law 97-446 (96 Stat. 2331) (1983)
(19 U.S.C. 1202, note) requires the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior, acting jointly, to establish
a limit on the quantity of watches and watch movements which may be entered free of duty during each calendar year. The
law also requires the Secretaries to establish the shares of this limited quantity which may be entered from the Virgin
Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands. Regulations on the establishment of these quantities
and shares are contained in   303.3 and 303.4 of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations (15 CFR 303.3 and
303.4). Section 303.6(h) gives the Secretaries authority to make the changes in  303.14.




The rule also modifies  303.14(a)(1)(i) by increasing the dollar amount of wages per person that the Departments
can consider in calculating the producers' allocations and PICs. The limit is raised to $35,000 in order to help attract
and retain the managerial talent necessary to operate efficient watch assembly plants.

We publish these revisions in proposed form on December 14, 1993 (58 FR 65294) and invited comments. We received no
comments.

The Departments establish for calendar year 1994 a total quantity and respective territorial shares as shown in the
following table:







Under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1), the effective date of this rule need not be delayed for
30 days because their rule relieves a restriction. The restriction is relieved by raising the amount of wages per person
that the Departments can consider in calculating the producers' allocations and PICs.

This rule was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866.

This final rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
assessment under Executive Order 12612.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

., the General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Fewer than ten entities are directly affected by this action. The
commercial benefits of the program governed by these regulations, for entities both directly and indirectly affected,
are less than $10 million per year.



Paperwork Reduction Act



This rulemaking involves information collection activities subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq

., which are currently approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0625-0040 and 0625-0134.
The amendments will not increase the information burden on the public.

Computers: General License Eligibility; Supercomputer Definition 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Export Administration, Commerce. 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to revise the
definition of ``supercomputers''. This final rule increases the ``supercomputer'' threshold level from a CTP (composite
theoretical performance) equal to or exceeding 195 Mtops (million theoretical operations per second) to a CTP equal
to or exceeding 1,500 Mtops. 



This rule also increases the General License GFW eligibility level for digital computers controlled by ECCN 4A03A
to a CTP of 500 Mtops or less for eligible countries listed in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Special Country List (i.e.,
Supplement No. 4) and 1,000 Mtops or less for other eligible countries. To conform with recent COCOM changes to the
International Industrial List (IL), this rule makes General License G-DEST available for exports of ``digital''
computers with a ``CTP'' not exceeding 260 Mtops, except to Country Groups S and Z, Iran, Syria, and South African military
and police entities. The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control maintains an embargo on other
destinations, such as Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). 

In addition, this rule raises the level at which nuclear nonproliferation controls apply to digital computers controlled
by ECCNs 4A01A, 4A02A, and 4A03A. Nuclear nonproliferation controls now apply to computers with a CTP exceeding 500
Mtops for countries listed in Supplement No. 4. 

This rule makes more computers eligible for export under the special license procedures because the eligibility
levels for certain countries are tied to either the supercomputer threshold level or the nuclear nonproliferation
control level for computers, both of which are increased by this rule. 

Finally, this rule revises the Technical Note in the Commerce Control List that provides instructions on calculating
``CTP''. 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 



This interim rule revises the definition of a supercomputer, expands the General License GFW eligibility level for
digital computers controlled by ECCN 4A03A, raises the levels at which nuclear nonproliferation controls apply
to computers controlled by ECCNs 4A01A, 4A02A, and 4A03A, and makes more computers eligible for export under the special
license procedures.

In international negotiations with our partner in the supercomputer regime, we have reached agreement on a new supercomputer
threshold level. Accordingly, this rule revises the definition of ``supercomputer'' in  770.2 and  776.11(a)
to increase the supercomputer threshold level from a CTP (composite theoretical performance) equal to or exceeding
195 Mtops (million theoretical operations per second) to a CTP equal to or exceeding 1,500 Mtops. The United States
continues to seek an agreement that would increase the supercomputer threshold level to 2,000 Mtops. Following the
completion of negotiations with our supercomputer partner, the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) intends to
publish a rule that will revise the supercomputer safeguards that apply to certain countries. 

This rule also increases the General License GFW eligibility level for digital computers controlled by ECCN 4A03A
from a CTP less than 195 Mtops to a CTP of 500 Mtops or less for eligible countries listed in Supplement No. 4 to part 778
and a CTP of 1,000 Mtops or less for other eligible countries. Subject to the restrictions in  771.2(c), items
eligible for General License GFW may be exported to most destinations in Country Groups T and V. General License GFW
is not available for exports to Iran, Syria, the People's Republic of China, or the South African military or police
and a validated license continues to be required for exports of all computers controlled by ECCN 4A03A to these destinations.


To conform with recent COCOM changes to the International Industrial List (IL), this rule amends the Validated License
Required paragraph in ECCN 4A03A to indicate that General License G-DEST is available for exports of ``digital''
computers with a ``CTP'' not exceeding 260 Mtops, except to Country Groups S and Z, Iran, Syria, and South African military
and police entities. 

National security-based validated license requirements continue to apply to: (1) Exports of ``digital computers''
with a CTP exceeding 260 Mtops to controlled destinations and to all other destinations not eligible for General License
GFW and (2) exports to GFW-eligible destinations of ``digital computers'' that exceed the GFW eligibility levels
(i.e., 500 Mtops or less for eligible Supplement No. 4 countries and 1,000 Mtops or less for other eligible countries).


Foreign policy-based validated license requirements remain in effect for exports of computers controlled by ECCNs
4A03A and 4A94F (i.e., computers with a CTP of 6 Mtops or greater) to Iran or Syria and for exports of all computers to
Country Groups S and Z, and South African military and police entities. Exporters 
should also be aware that the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control maintains an embargo on
other destinations, such as Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). 

This rule also amends ECCNs 4A01A, 4A02A, and 4A03A to increase the level at which nuclear nonproliferation controls
apply to 
computers. Nuclear nonproliferation controls now apply only for exports of computers with a CTP exceeding 500 Mtops
to countries 
listed in Supplement No. 4 to part 778. Previously, nuclear nonproliferation controls applied to computers with
a CTP of 
195 Mtops or above for countries listed in Supplement No. 4 to 
part 778. 

This rule makes more computers eligible for export under the special license procedures. Destinations that are not
subject to nuclear nonproliferation controls, and not eligible to receive supercomputers under the special license
procedures, are eligible to receive computers below the new supercomputer threshold level, i.e., 1,500 Mtops. Countries
for which exports of computers with a CTP above 500 Mtops are subject to nuclear nonproliferation controls are now
eligible to receive computers with a CTP of 
500 Mtops or less.

Section 772.1 is amended by adding a new paragraph (h) to inform exporters that validated license conditions are terminated
when items are decontrolled. Exporters who have received validated licenses containing restrictive conditions
for items that are now eligible for shipment under a general license (e.g., General Licenses GFW, GCT, or G-DEST) may
use the appropriate general license to export such items, subject only to the specific conditions that apply to the
use of these general licenses. Exporters should be aware, however, of the general prohibitions in  771.2(c)
concerning the use of general licenses and of the validated license requirements that apply to certain nuclear, missile
technology, or chemical-biological weapons activities described in  778.3,  778.7,  778.8,
and  778.9. 

Finally, this rule revises the Technical Note under the heading ``Information on How to Calculate Composite Theoretical
Performance (CTP)'' at the end of Category 4 in the Commerce Control List (CCL). The changes in this Technical Note
may affect the control status of certain computers (e.g., eligibility for export under General License G-DEST, GFW,
or GCT), as well as whether or not a computer is treated as a supercomputer. 



Saving Clause 



Shipments of items removed from general license authorizations as a result of this regulatory action that were on
dock for loading, on lighter, laden aboard an exporting carrier, or en route aboard carrier to a port of export pursuant
to actual orders for export before March 10, 1994 may be exported under the previous general license provisions up
to and including March 24, 1994. Any such items not actually exported before midnight March 24, 1994, require a validated
export license in accordance with this regulation. 



Rulemaking Requirements 



1. This rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. 

2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0694-0005,
0694-0010, 0694-0013, 0694-0015, and 0694-0073. 

3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
assessment under Executive Order 12612. 

4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this
rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under section 3(a) of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has
to be or will be prepared. 

5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the
opportunity for public participation, and a delay in the effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation
involves a military or foreign affairs function of the United States. Further, no other law requires that a notice
of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. 

Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is no formal comment period, public comments on
this regulation are welcome on a continuing basis. Comments should be submitted to Willard Fisher, Office of Technology
and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.

to Calculate Composite Theoretical Performance (CTP)'' is revised to read as follows: 

Information on How to Calculate ``Composite Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP''):






Technical Note:

 ``Composite theoretical performance'' (CTP). 



Abbreviations used in this Technical Note 



CE ``computing element'' (typically an arithmetic logical unit) 
FP floating point 
XP fixed point 
t execution time 
XOR exclusive OR 
CPU central processing unit 
TP theoretical performance (of a single CE)

Execution time `t' is expressed in microseconds, TP and ``CTP'' are expressed in Mtops (millions of theoretical operations
per second) and WL is expressed in bits. 



Outline of ``CTP'' Calculation Method 



``CTP'' is a measure of computational performance given in millions of theoretical operations per second (Mtops).
In calculating the ``Composite Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP'') of an aggregation of ``Computing Elements''
(``CEs''), the following three steps are required: 

1. Calculate the effective calculating rate (R) for 
each ``computing element'' (``CE''); 

2. Apply the word length adjustment (L) to the effective calculating rate (R), resulting in a Theoretical Performance
(TP) for each ``computing element'' (``CE''); 

3. If there is more than one ``computing element'' (``CE''), combine the Theoretical Performances (TPs), resulting
in a ``Composite Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP'') for the aggregation. 

Details for these steps are given in the following section.

 




Note 1:

 For aggregations of multiple ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') that have both shared and unshared memory subsystems,
the calculation of ``CTP'' is completed hierarchically, in two steps: first, aggregate the groups of ``computing
elements'' (``CEs'') sharing memory; second calculate the ``CTP'' of the groups using the calculation method for
multiple ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') not sharing memory. 



Note 2:

 ``Computing elements'' (``CEs'') that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive,
communication and video display controllers) are not aggregated into the ``CTP'' calculation.

The following table shows the method of calculating the Effective Calculating Rate (R) for each ``Computing Element''
(``CE''): 

Step 1: The effective calculating rate R. 










Note W:

 For a pipelined ``CE'' capable of executing up to one arithmetic or logic operation every clock cycle after the pipeline
is full, a pipelined rate can be established. The effective calculating rate (R) for such a ``CE'' is the faster of the
pipelined rate or non-pipelined execution rate.

Note X: 

For a ``CE'' that performs multiple operations of a specific type in a single cycle (e.g., two additions per cycle or
two identical logic operations per cycle), the execution time t is given by: 









``Computing elements'' (``CEs'') that perform different types of arithmetic or logic operations in a single machine
cycle are to be treated as multiple separate ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') performing simultaneously (e.g.,
a ``CE'' performing an addition and a multiplication in one cycle is to be treated as two ``CEs'', the first performing
an addition in one cycle and the second performing a multiplication in one cycle). 
If a single ``computing element'' (``CE'') has both scalar function and vector function, use the shorter execution
time value.

Note Y: 

For the ``CE'' that does not implement FP add or FP multiply, but that performs FP divide: 








If the ``CE'' implements FP reciprocal, but not FP add, 
FP multiply or FP divide, then: 








If none of the specified instructions is implemented, the effective floating point (FP) rate is 0. 






Note Z: 

In simple logic operations, a single instruction performs a single logic manipulation of no more than two operands
of given lengths. 




In complex logic operations, a single instruction performs multiple logic manipulations to produce one or more results
from two or more operands.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940224-0-00051 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940224-0-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Rates should be calculated for all supported operand lengths considering both pipelined operations (if supported),
and non-pipelined operations, using the fastest executing instruction for each operand length based on: 

1. Pipelined or register-to-register operations. Exclude extraordinarily short execution times generated for
operations on a predetermined operand or operands (for example, multiplication by 0 or 1). If no register-to-register
operations are implemented, continue with (2). 

2. The faster of register-to-memory or memory-to-register operations; if these also do not exist, then continue
with (3). 

3. Memory-to-memory. 

In each case above, use the shortest execution time certified by the manufacturer. 

Step 2: 

TP for each supported operand length WL: 

Adjust the effective rate R (or R

t

) by the word length adjustment L as follows:

 


TP=R * L, where L=(1/3+WL/96).

 




Note: 

The word length WL used in these calculations is the operand length in bits. (If an operation uses operands of different
lengths, select the largest word length.)

 


The combination of a mantissa ALU and an exponent ALU of a floating point processor or unit is considered to be one ``computing
element'' (``CE'') with a Word Length (WL) equal to the number of bits in the data representation (typically 32 or 64)
for purposes of the ``Composite Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP'') calculation. 

This adjustment is not applied to specialized logic processors that do not use XOR instructions. In this case TP=R.




Select the maximum resulting value of TP for:

 


Each XP-only ``CE'' (R

xp

); 

Each FP-only ``CE'' (R

fp

); 

Each combined FP and XP ``CE'' (R); 

Each simple logic processor not implementing any of the specified arithmetic operations; 

and 

Each special logic processor not using any of the specified arithmetic or logic operations. 



Step 3: ``CTP'' for aggregations of ``CEs'', including CPUs: 

For a CPU with a single ``CE'', ``CTP''=TP (for CEs performing both fixed and floating point operations, TP=max (TP

fp

, TP

xp

)). 

``CTP'' for aggregations of multiple ``CEs'' operating simultaneously is calculated as follows:

 




Note 1: 

For aggregrations that do not allow all of the ``CEs'' to run simultaneously, the possible combination of ``CEs''
that provides the largest ``CTP'' should be used. The TP of each contributing ``CE'' is to be calculated at its maximum
value theoretically possible before the ``CTP'' of the combination is derived.

 




N.B.: 

To determine the possible combinations of simultaneously operating ``CEs'', generate an instruction sequence
that initiates operations in multiple ``CEs'', beginning with the slowest ``CE'' (the one needing the largest number
of cycles to complete its operation) and ending with the fastest ``CE''. At each cycle of the sequence, the combination
of ``CEs'' that are in operation during that cycle is a possible combination. 

The instruction sequence must take into account all hardware and/or architectural constraints on overlapping operations.

 




Note 2:

 A single integrated circuit chip or board assembly may contain multiple ``CEs''.

 




Note 3:

 Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel or simultaneous
operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.

Note 4:

 ``CTP'' values are not to be aggregated for ``CE''-combinations (inter)connected by ``Local Area Networks'', Wide
Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented
by software. 


Note 5:

 ``CTP'' values must be aggregated for multiple ``CEs'' specially designed to enhance performance by aggregation,
operating simultaneously and sharing memory-, or multiple memory/``CE''- combinations operating simultaneously
utilizing specially designed hardware.

Provided: 

1. The TP

i 

of each ``CE'' or group of ``CEs'' does not exceed 30 Mtops; 

2. The ``CEs'' or groups of ``CEs'' share access to main memory (excluding cache memory) over a single channel; and


3. Only one ``CE'' or group of ``CEs'' can have use of the channel at any given time. 



N.B.: 

This does not apply to items controlled under Category 3. 






Note 2: 

``CEs'' share memory if they access a common segment of solid state memory. This memory may include cache memory, main
memory, or other internal memory. Peripheral memory devices such as disk drives, tape drives, or RAM disks are not
included.

=0.45 * k

i 

(i=65, ..., 256)

When calculating a C

i

 for a group of ``CEs'', the number of the first ``CE'' in a group determines the proper limit for C

i

. For example, in an aggregation of groups consisting of 3 ``CEs'' each, the 22nd group will contain ``CE''

64

, ``CE''

65

, and ``CE''

66

. The proper limit for C

i 

for this group is 0.60.

Note: 

The k

factor is not to be applied to ``CEs'' to 2 
to 12 if the TP

i 

of the ``CE'' or group of ``CEs'' is more than 50 Mtops; i.e., C

for ``CEs'' 2 to 12 is 0.75.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document makes corrections to the document published in the

 which set forth interim amendments to the Customs Regulations to implement the preferential tariff treatment and
other Customs-related provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement
Implementation Act.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background


On December 30, 1993, Customs published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 69460) T.D. 94-1 to set forth interim amendments to the Customs Regulations to implement the preferential
tariff treatment and other Customs-related provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which
was adopted by the United States through the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation
Act (``the Act''), Public Law 103-182, 107 Stat. 2057. Those interim regulatory amendments took effect on January
1, 1994, to coincide with the effective date of the NAFTA. 
This document corrects some errors published in T.D. 94-1. Two errors involved amended  24.22: (1) Paragraph
(g)(1), as revised in the document, failed to fully reflect the change in wording of section 13031(a)(5) of the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (19 U.S.C. 58c(a)(5)) effected by section 521 of the Act for fiscal years
1994 through 1997; and (2) the document failed to amend paragraph (g)(2)(iv) to avoid a conflict between that paragraph
and the amended statutory and paragraph (g)(1) language. In new  181.45, a printing error involving the text
of paragraph (a) before the example is corrected by rearranging the text without any change in substance. In addition,
in order to ensure coverage of all appropriate litigation contexts involving Customs and its officers or agents,
at the end of new   181.98(b) and 181.116(f) the word ``defendant'' is corrected to read ``party to the
action''. Finally, this document corrects a number of drafting or typesetting errors of an editorial nature. 


Corrections of Publication


Accordingly, the document published in the 

Federal Register

 as T.D. 94-1 on December 30, 1993 (58 FR 69460) is corrected as set forth below. 


Correction to the Background Section 


1. On page 69461, in the second column under the heading Part 24, the first paragraph is corrected to read: 
Section 24.22, which was published as a final rule in T.D. 93-85 on October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54271), is amended to
reflect changes to the commercial passenger arrival fee provisions of section 13031 of the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (19 U.S.C. 58c) effected by section 521 of the Act. The changes involve, for fiscal
years 1994 through 1997 (in effect, from January 1, 1994 through September 30, 1997), (1) replacement of the words
``from a place outside the United States'' by the words ``from outside the customs territory of the United States'',
(2) an increase in the fee from $5 to $6.50, and (3) suspension of the fee exemption for persons whose journey involves
certain specified locations outside the United States. 


Corrections to the Interim Regulations 


2. On page 69470, in the third column, the amendatory language and text pertaining to  24.22 are corrected to
read: 
Section 24.22 is amended by revising paragraph (g)(1), the introductory text of paragraph (g)(2)(i)(A), and paragraph
(g)(2)(iv) to read as follows: 


 24.22

Fees for certain services. 


* * * * * 


(g) 

Fee for arrival of passengers aboard commercial vessels and commercial aircraft.

Antibiotic Drugs; Cefadroxil Hemihydrate: Cefadroxil Hemihydrate Capsules and Cefadroxil Hemihydrate Tablets




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the antibiotic drug regulations to provide for the inclusion of
accepted standards for a new antibiotic drug, cefadroxil hemihydrate, and the use of the antibiotic drug in two dosage
forms, cefadroxil hemihydrate capsules and cefadroxil hemihydrate tablets. The manufacturer has supplied sufficient
data and information to establish its safety and efficacy.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA has evaluated data submitted in accordance with regulations promulgated under section 507 of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 357), as amended, with respect to a request for approval of a new antibiotic drug,
cefadroxil hemihydrate, and its use in two dosage forms, cefadroxil hemihydrate capsules and cefadroxil hemihydrate
tablets. The agency has concluded that the data supplied by the manufacturer concerning these antibiotic drugs are
adequate to establish their safety and efficacy when used as directed in the labeling and that the regulations should
be amended in 21 CFR parts 436 and 442 to provide for the inclusion of accepted standards for these products.


Environmental Impact


The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.


Submitting Comments and Filing Objections


This final rule announces standards that FDA has accepted in a request for approval of an antibiotic drug. Because
this final rule is not controversial and because when effective it provides notice of accepted standards, FDA finds
that notice and comment procedure is unnecessary and not in the public interest. This final rule, therefore, is effective
March 28, 1994. However, interested persons may, on or before March 28, 1994, submit comments to the Dockets Management
Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy.
Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments
may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Any person who will be adversely affected by this final rule may file objections to it and request a hearing. Reasonable
grounds for the hearing must be shown. Any person who decides to seek a hearing must file (1) on or before March 28, 1994,
a written notice of participation and request for a hearing, and (2) on or before April 25, 1994, the data, information,
and analyses on which the person relies to justify a hearing, as specified in 21 CFR 314.300. A request for a hearing
may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and
substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. If it conclusively appears from the face of the data, information,
and factual analyses in the request for a hearing that no genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the action
taken by this order, or if a request for a hearing is not made in the required format or with the required analyses, the
Commissioner of Food and Drugs will enter summary judgment against the person(s) who request(s) the hearing, making
findings and conclusions and denying a hearing. All submissions must be filed in three copies, identified with the
docket number appearing in the heading of this document and filed with the Dockets Management Branch.
The procedures and requirements governing this order, a notice of participation and request for a hearing, a submission
of data, information, and analyses to justify a hearing, other comments, and grant or denial of a hearing are contained
in 21 CFR 314.300.
All submissions under this order, except for data and information prohibited from public disclosure under 21 U.S.C.
331(j) or 18 U.S.C. 1905, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

Amendment of the Fee Exemption for Federal, State and Local Government Employees



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This final rule limits the exemption from payment of application fees for registration or reregistration to Federal,
state, or local government operated hospitals or institutions. This will eliminate the need for DEA to dedicate manpower
or other resources to controlling abuse of the fee exempt status.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

On June 1, 1993, a notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 31180). DEA proposed to limit the exemption from payment of registration or reregistration application fees
to Federal, state or local government operated hospital/clinics. 



A total of three comments were received, all opposed to the proposed changes. Two of the comments concerned state certified
euthanasia technicians. The commentors objected to the changes on the grounds that the change would impose a financial
burden on the euthanasia technicians and the animal shelters at which they work, due to the extremely high turnover
rate the industry experiences. This will not be the case. The euthanasia technicians are employees of animal control
facilities or shelters. They may not engage in their activities other than as employees of the facilities or shelters.
Under such circumstances, DEA has traditionally issued the registrations for such activities under the facility
or shelter name with the euthanasia technician's name appearing thereafter. It is appropriate under such circumstances
for the Federal, state or local government facility or shelter to request and receive the exemption from the fee. In
light of the fact that DEA registers these activities as other than a hospital or clinic, the original language of the
proposal with respect to Federal, state or local hospitals or clinics has been changed to Federal, state or local hospitals
or other institutions. 

The third commentor objected to the changes on the grounds that the proposed changes, if implemented, would prevent
public sector employees from using their exempt status to obtain registrations for use in private practice. That
is the exact intent of the proposal. Any individual who engages in private practice utilizing a DEA registration must
pay the required fee for that registration. Individuals who engage in public practice as agents or employees of Federal,
state or local hospitals or institutions would not be required to obtain a registration; they would conduct their
controlled substances activities under the registration of the hospital or institution. Although this has been
a longstanding policy, DEA will clarify the provisions for such activities in light of the impact that the limiting
of the fee exemption will have. A proposal to amend  1301.24 has been drafted to clarify the exemption from the
registration requirement of individual practitioners who act as agents or employees of other individual practitioners
and of hospitals or other institutions. That proposal will be published in the 

Federal Register

 in the near future. 

There are approximately 44,000 active DEA registrations which were issued under the fee exempt status. Over 35,000
of the registrations are for practitioners and the remainder are for Federal, state or local hospitals or institutions.
By restricting the fee exempt status to the hospitals or institutions and allowing the practitioners to carry out
their official duties under the hospital or institution registrations, DEA will eliminate the need to dedicate manpower
or other resources to controlling the misuse of the fee exempt status.

The limiting of the fee exemption will not affect those law enforcement analytical laboratories which are described
in  1301.26.





The Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, hereby certifies that this final rule will have
no significant impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.
601 

et seq. 

Any financial or regulatory burdens that practitioners may experience are existing burdens which the practitioners
have heretofore avoided by inappropriate use of the fee exemption.





This final rule is not a significant regulatory action and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget pursuant to Executive Order 12866.





This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in Executive Order 12612, and it has been
determined that the final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.

Rules To Carry Out the Purposes of Section 42 and for 
Correcting Administrative Errors and Omissions 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulations.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains final regulations 
concerning the Secretary's authority to provide guidance 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of 
section 42, the low-income housing credit. This document 
also contains final regulations allowing State and local 
housing credit agencies to correct administrative errors and 
omissions made in connection with allocations of low-income 
housing credit dollar amounts and recordkeeping within a 
reasonable period after their discovery. The final 
regulations affect State and local housing credit agencies, 
owners of buildings or projects for which the low-income 
housing credit is allocated, and taxpayers claiming the low-income housing credit.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Paperwork Reduction Act 


The collection of information contained in this final 
regulation has been reviewed and approved by the Office of 
Management and Budget in accordance with the Paperwork 
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under control number 1545-1357. The estimated annual burden per respondent
varies 
from 1 hour to 2 hours, depending on individual 
circumstances, with an estimated average of 1.5 hours. 

Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate 
and suggestions for reducing this burden should be directed 
to the Internal Revenue Service, Attention: IRS Reports 
Clearance Officer, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and to the 
Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for 
the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503. 



Background 


On January 4, 1993, a notice of proposed rulemaking (PS-50-92) was published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 44) 
proposing amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR 
part 1) under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code.

<TEXT>
 

Written comments responding to the notice were received, 
and a public hearing was held on April 5, 1993. After 
consideration of all written and oral comments regarding the 
proposed amendments, those amendments are adopted as revised 
by this Treasury decision. 



Explanation of Provisions 



Changes Made by the Final Regulations 



The proposed regulations generally describe an 
administrative error and omission and include illustrative 
examples. Commentators have requested that the final 
regulations include an ``accounting error'' as an 
administrative error or omission. The Service and the 
Treasury Department are concerned that the term ``accounting 
error'' is too vague. However, in order to address the 
commentators' concerns, the final regulations clarify that 
an administrative error or omission includes an error in 
tracking the housing credit dollar amount an Agency has 
allocated (or that remains to be allocated) in a calendar 
year. For example, assume an Agency, believing that it has 
$100 of credit remaining in its credit ceiling for the 
current calendar year, allocates $100 to a project and 
agrees to allocate an additional $30 from the next calendar 
year's credit ceiling. Later, in the current calendar year, 
the Agency discovers that it failed to include in its credit 
ceiling for the current calendar year $50 of credits that 
were returned in the current calendar year. The error in 
tracking the $50 of credits that were returned is an 
administrative error or omission. 

One commentator asked for clarification of the correction 
procedure an Agency should use when correcting a document 
without the Secretary's prior approval. Under the final 
regulations, a document that corrects a document containing 
an error or omission that has not yet been filed with the 
Internal Revenue Service should be filed as the original. 
If a document containing an error has already been filed 
with the Internal Revenue Service, the Agency should refile 
a copy of the document containing the error that prominently 
and clearly notes the correction. The Agency should 
indicate at the top of the document(s) that the correction 
is being made under  1.42-13 of the Income Tax Regulations. 

The proposed regulations require that an Agency obtain 
the prior approval of the Secretary to correct an 
administrative error or omission if (1) the correction is 
not made before the close of the calendar year of the error 
or omission, and (2) the correction is a numerical change to 
the housing credit dollar amount allocated for the building 
or project. One commentator suggested that an Agency should 
have until February 28, the date by which an Agency must 
file its Form 8610, to correct an administrative error or 
omission that changes the housing credit dollar amount 
allocated to a building or project without obtaining the 
Secretary's prior approval. Another commentator made a 
similar suggestion solely for credits returned in the same 
year in which they were allocated. These suggestions have 
not been adopted. Section 42(h)(1) requires that an 
allocation for a certain calendar year be made by the close 
of that calendar year. Consistent with that approach, these 
regulations do not permit an Agency to make a post-year 
allocation without the Secretary's prior approval. Of 
course, for a correction of an administrative error or 
omission that an Agency cannot correct on its own, an 
Agency, or the Agency and the affected taxpayer, may seek 
the Secretary's prior approval. 



Special Analyses 



It has been determined that this Treasury Decision is not 
a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive 
Order 12866. It also has been determined that section 
553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 
5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) 
do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a 
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant 
to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, a copy of 
the proposed regulations was submitted to the Chief Counsel 
for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for 
comment on its impact on small business.

List of Subjects


26 CFR Part 1


Income taxes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.


26 CFR Part 602


Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.


Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations


Accordingly, 26 CFR parts 1 and 602 are amended as follows:


PART 1_INCOME TAXES




Paragraph 1. 

The authority citation for part 1 is amended by adding an entry in numerical order to read as follows:





Authority:

 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * *.



Section 1.42-13 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 42(n); * * *.


Par. 2. 

Section 1.42-13 is added to read as follows:


 1.42-13 

Rules necessary and appropriate; housing credit agencies' correction of administrative errors and omissions.


(a) 

Publication of guidance. 

Under section 42(n), the Secretary has authority to prescribe regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry
out the purposes of section 42. The Secretary may also provide guidance through various publications in the Internal
Revenue Bulletin. (See  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter.)
(b) 

Correcting administrative errors and omissions_

(1) 

In general. 

An Agency may correct an administrative error or omission with respect to allocations and recordkeeping, as described
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, within a reasonable period after the Agency discovers the administrative error
or omission. Whether a correction is made within a reasonable period depends on the facts and circumstances of each
situation. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, an Agency need not obtain the prior approval
of the Secretary to correct an administrative error or omission, if the correction is made in accordance with paragraph
(b)(3)(i) of this section. The administrative errors and omissions to which this paragraph (b) applies are strictly
limited to those described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and, thus, do not include, for example, any misinterpretation
of the applicable rules and regulations under section 42. Accordingly, an Agency's allocation of a particular calendar
year's low-income housing credit dollar amount made after the close of that calendar year, or the use of an incorrect
population amount in calculating a State's housing credit ceiling for a calendar year are not administrative errors
that can be corrected under this paragraph (b).
(2) 

Administrative errors and omissions described. 

An administrative error or omission is a mistake that results in a document that inaccurately reflects the intent
of the Agency at the time the document is originally completed or, if the mistake affects a taxpayer, a document that
inaccurately reflects the intent of the Agency and the affected taxpayer at the time the document is originally completed.
Administrative errors and omissions described in this paragraph (b)(2) include the following_
(i) A mathematical error;
(ii) An entry on a document that is inconsistent with another entry on the same or another document regarding the same
property, or taxpayer;
(iii) A failure in tracking the housing credit dollar amount an Agency has allocated (or that remains to be allocated)
in the current calendar year (e.g., a failure to include in its State housing credit ceiling a previously allocated
credit dollar amount that has been returned by a taxpayer);
(iv) An omission of information that is required on a document; and
(v) Any other type of error or omission identified by guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter) as an administrative error or omission covered by this paragraph (b).
(3) 

Procedures for correcting administrative errors or omissions_

(i) 

In general. 

An Agency's correction of an administrative error or omission, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section,
must amend the document so that the corrected document reflects the original intent of the Agency, or the Agency and
the affected taxpayer, and complies with applicable rules and regulations under section 42.
(ii) 

Specific procedures. 

If a document corrects a document containing an administrative error or omission that has not yet been filed with the
Internal Revenue Service, the Agency, or the Agency and the affected taxpayer, should complete and file the corrected
document as the original. When a document containing an administrative error or omission has already been filed with
the Service, the Agency, or the Agency and the affected taxpayer, should refile a copy of the document containing the
administrative error or omission, and prominently and clearly note the correction thereon or on an attached new document.
The Agency should indicate at the top of the document(s) that the correction is being made under  1.42-13
of the Income Tax Regulations.

<TEXT>
 

(iii) 

Secretary's prior approval required. 

An Agency must obtain the Secretary's prior approval to correct an administrative error or omission, as described
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if the correction is not made before the close of the calendar year of the error
or omission and the correction_
(A) Is a numerical change to the housing credit dollar amount allocated for the building or project;
(B) Affects the determination of any component of the State's housing credit ceiling under section 42(h)(3)(C);
or
(C) Affects the State's unused housing credit carryover that is assigned to the Secretary under section 42(h)(3)(D).
(iv) 

Requesting the Secretary's approval. 

To obtain the Secretary's approval under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, an Agency must submit a request for
the Secretary's approval within a reasonable period after discovering the administrative error or omission, and
must agree to any conditions that may be required by the Secretary under paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section. When
requesting the Secretary's approval, the Agency, or the Agency and the affected taxpayer, must file an application
that complies with the requirements of this paragraph (b)(3)(iv). For further information on the application procedure
see Rev. Proc. 93-1, 1993-1 I.R.B. 10 (or any subsequent applicable revenue procedure). (See  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter.) The application requesting the Secretary's approval must contain the following information_
(A) The name, address, and identification number of each affected taxpayer;
(B) The Building Identification Number (B.I.N.) and address of each building or project affected by the administrative
error or omission;
(C) A statement explaining the administrative error or omission and the intent of the Agency, or of the Agency and the
affected taxpayer, when the document was originally completed;
(D) Copies of any supporting documentation;
(E) A statement explaining the effect, if any, that a correction of the administrative error or omission would have
on the housing credit dollar amount allocated for any building or project; and
(F) A statement explaining the effect, if any, that a correction of the administrative error or omission would have
on the determination of the components of the State's housing credit ceiling under section 42(h)(3)(C) or on the State's
unused housing credit carryover that is assigned to the Secretary under section 42(h)(3)(D).
(v) 

Agreement to conditions. 

To obtain the Secretary's approval under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, an Agency, or the Agency and the affected
taxpayer, must agree to the conditions the Secretary considers appropriate.
(c) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the scope of this section:





Example 1. 

Individual B applied to Agency X for a reservation of a low-income housing credit dollar amount for a building that
is part of a low-income housing project. When applying for the low-income housing credit dollar amount, B informed
Agency X that B intended to form Partnership Y to finance the project. After receiving the reservation letter and prior
to receiving an allocation, B formed Partnership Y and sold partnership interests to a number of limited partners.
B contributed the low-income housing project to Partnership Y in exchange for a partnership interest. B and Partnership
Y informed Agency X of the ownership change. When actually allocating the housing credit dollar amount, Agency X sent
Partnership Y a document listing B, rather than Partnership Y, as the building's owner. Partnership Y promptly notified
Agency X of the error. After reviewing related documents, Agency X determined that it had incorrectly listed B as the
building's owner on the allocation document. Since the parties originally intended that Partnership Y would receive
the allocation as the owner of the building, Agency X may correct the error without obtaining the Secretary's approval,
and insert Partnership Y as the building's owner on the allocation document.


Example 2. 

Agency Y allocated a lower low-income housing credit dollar amount for a low-income housing building than Agency
Y originally intended. After the close of the calendar year of the allocation, B, the building's owner, discovered
the error and promptly notified Agency Y. Agency Y reviewed relevant documents and agreed that an error had occurred.
Agency Y and B must apply, as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, for the Secretary's approval before
Agency Y may correct the error.

(d) 

Effective date.

 This section is effective February 24, 1994. However, an Agency may elect to apply these 
regulations to administrative errors or omissions that 
occurred before the publication of these regulations. Any 
reasonable method used by a State or local housing credit 
agency to correct an administrative error or omission prior 
to February 24, 1994, will be considered proper, provided that 
the method is consistent with the rules of section 42.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; approval of amendment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing the approval of proposed program amendments to the Kentucky permanent regulatory program (hereinafter
referred to as the Kentucky program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed
amendments include revisions to those portions of the Kentucky Administrative Regulations dealing with bond forfeiture
funds, definitions of terms, and inspection frequency.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



I. Background on the Kentucky Program.
II. Submission of Amendment.
III. Director's Findings.
IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments.
V. Director's Decision.
VI. Procedural Determinations.



I. Background on the Kentucky Program



On May 18, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Kentucky program. Information pertinent
to the general background, revisions, modifications, and amendments to the proposed permanent program submission,
as well as the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments and a detailed explanation of the conditions of approval
can be found in the May 18, 1982, Federal Register (47 FR 21404-21435). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions
of approval and program amendments are identified at 30 CFR 917.11, 917.13, 917.15, 917.16, and 917.17.



II. Submission of Amendments



By letter dated May 21, 1993, (Administrative Record No. KY-1221) Kentucky submitted proposed amendments
containing additions and modifications to 405 KAR 10:050 Bond forfeiture, 405 KAR 12:001 Definitions, and 405 FAR
12:010 General provisions for inspection and enforcement.

OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendments in the June 11, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 32618), and in the same notice, opened the public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearing
on the adequacy of the proposed amendments. The comment period closed on July 12, 1993.

On June 14, 1993 (Administrative Record No. KY-1226), Kentucky revised the proposed amendment at 405 KAR 12:001
by adding a definition of the term ``unwarranted failure to comply'', since that term is used in 405 KAR 12:020 section
8. The proposed definition is identical to the existing definition set forth in 405 KAR 7:001. Since the definition
already exists as part of Kentucky's approved program, the Director determined that no purpose would be served by
reopening the public comment period for the modification submitted by Kentucky on June 14, 1993.

By letter dated October 19, 1993 (Administrative Record No. KY-1242), Kentucky submitted a proposed program
amendment which was intended to replace the proposals submitted on May 21, 1993, and June 14, 1993. The regulations
contained in the October 19, 1993, submission completed the Kentucky promulgation process under Kentucky Revised
Statue Chapter 13A. 

OSM announced receipt of the October 19, 1993 proposed amendment in the November 5, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 58997), and in the same notice, reopened the public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearing
on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The comment period closed on November 22, 1993.



III. Director's Findings



Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17 are the Director's findings
concerning the proposed amendments to the Kentucky program.

Revisions not specifically discussed below concern nonsubstantive wording changes, or revised cross-references
and paragraph notations to reflect organizational changes resulting from this amendment. 



A. Revisions to Kentucky's Regulations That Are Substantively Identical to the Corresponding Federal Regulations



 



Because the above proposed revision is identical in meaning to the corresponding Federal regulation, the Director
finds that Kentucky's proposed rule is no less effective than the Federal rule. 



B. Revisions to Kentucky's Regulations That Are Not Substantively Identical to the Corresponding Federal Regulations

In several sections of the regulations affected by this amendment, Kentucky is proposing to revise the use of the terms
``permittee'', ``operator'', and ``person'' in order to achieve consistency in the use of the terms and to more clearly
identify the entities that are intended to be subject to the particular statutory requirements involved. The Director
finds that the proposed revisions add clarity to Kentucky's rules and are no less effective than the Federal regulations
as listed below.





2. 405 KAR 12:001 Definitions for 405 KAR Chapter 12


Kentucky proposes to add a definition of ``willfully and willful violation'' which is identical to the definition
currently found in Kentucky's program at 405 KAR 7:001, 8:001 and 10:001, and which was approved by the Director on
October 1, 1992 (57 FR 45297). The Director finds that this definition was previously approved in other sections of
the Kentucky program and the proposal to add it to 405 KAR Chapter 12 will not render Kentucky's regulations less effective
than the Federal program.


3. 405 KAR 12:010 General Provisions for Inspection and Enforcement


Kentucky proposes to revise its regulations governing frequency of inspections set forth at 405 KAR 12:010 section
3(5) (a) by providing an exception to the monthly partial inspection requirement where the cabinet has received notice
of temporary cessation of operations. As proposed for revision, if the cabinet has received notice of temporary cessation,
the partial inspections shall continue until the cabinet determines that the permit area is sufficiently stable
to insure that the quarterly complete inspections required by 405 KAR 12:010 section 3(5)(b) will provide adequate
inspection of the permit area. The Federal rule at 30 CFR 840.11(a) provides for ``partial inspections of each inactive
surface coal mining and reclamation operation . . . as are necessary to ensure effective enforcement
of the approved State program.'' 30 CFR 840.11(f) (1) includes as an inactive surface coal mining and reclamation
operation one for which the regulatory authority has received written notice of temporary cessation of mining. The
Director finds that the proposed rule represents reasonable exercise of Kentucky's discretion under 30 CFR 840.11(a)
and is no less effective than the Federal counterparts at 30 CFR 840.11 (a) and (f).


C. Revisions to Kentucky's Regulations With No Corresponding Federal Regulations


1. General


a. Kentucky proposes to revise the introductory material at 405 KAR 10:050 and 405 KAR 12:010 to include appropriate
statutory and regulatory citations relating to the materials covered by the respective regulations. The Director
finds that the inclusion of this material is not inconsistent with any requirements of SMCRA or the Federal regulations.
b. In proposed revisions to the Necessity and Function sections of 405 KAR 10:050, 12:001 and 12:010, as well as 405
KAR 10:050 section 1(1) and 405 KAR 12:010 section 4(3), Kentucky refers to 

administrative regulations,

 rather than just 

regulations

 as currently expressed in those provisions. The Director finds that the proposed revisions add appropriate clarity
to the State's program and do not adversely affect any requirement of SMCRA or the Federal regulations.
c. Kentucky proposes to revise the Necessity and Function section of 405 KAR 10:050 by adding the following clarifying
sentence:



This administrative regulation establishes criteria under which unused forfeited bond funds shall be returned
to the person from whom they were collected.



The Director finds that this proposed addition will not render Kentucky's program inconsistent with any provisions
of the Federal program.

2. 405 KAR 10:050 Bond Forfeiture



Kentucky proposes to revise this regulation by adding section 2(5) which provides for the return of unused forfeited
bond funds to the person from whom they were received, subject to the right to attach or set-off the funds under state
law. The provision applies where the cabinet has not completed the reclamation plan on the forfeited site and the site,
including any related off-site disturbances, is completely overlapped by a subsequent permanent program permit
and is completely disturbed by the overlapping permittee. As proposed, the provision is limited to interim program
sites forfeited on or after July 15, 1988, and to forfeited permanent program sites. While there is no direct Federal
counterpart to this proposal, the Director has determined that it is not inconsistent with the Federal rule at 30 CFR
800.50(d)(2) which provides for the return of unused funds to the person from whom they were collected where the amount
of performance bond forfeited is more than the amount necessary to complete reclamation. Therefore, the Director
finds that the proposal is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA or the Federal regulations.



IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments



Public Comments



The public comment periods and opportunities to request a public hearing were announced in the June 11, 1993 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 32618), and the November 5, 1993 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 58997). The public comment periods closed on July 12, 1993, and November 22, 1993, respectively. No one requested
an opportunity to testify at the scheduled public hearings so no hearings were held.

The Kentucky Resources Council (KRC) filed written comments on July 23, 1993 (Administrative Record Number KY-1331),
and supplemented those comments on November 30, 1993 (Administrative Record Number KY-1259). A summary of
those comments and their disposition is set forth below.



405 KAR 10:050



KRC expressed concern that the revisions to subsection (5) might result in the release of forfeited bonds in cases
where the permit area is completely disturbed under an overlapping permit, and where there is off-permit disturbance
that should be addressed under the forfeited bond. As a result of the concerns raised by KRC, Kentucky revised 405 KAR
10:050 section 2(5) in its October 19, 1993, resubmission by making specific reference to the inclusion of any off-site
disturbance. In its November 30, 1993, letter, after reviewing Kentucky's revisions, KRC restated its concern with
particular reference to ``those cases, for example, where the former mining operation has caused damage to the hydrologic
balance (such as loss or damage to water supplies, pollution of groundwater resources), or where other off-site damage
might not be readily apparent or yet manifest, the allowance of a return of unused bond funds where the site is overlapped
by a new permit and bond may result in unfunded liabilities''. In its Statement of Consideration (Administrative
Record Number KY-1333) filed by Kentucky on September 2, 1993, the State discusses these issues in some detail.
In specific response to KRC's original concerns, Kentucky stated that it ``has no intention of releasing forfeited
bond funds when there is off-permit disturbance for which the original bond stands liable and such disturbance was
not encompassed in the overlapping permit.'' In response to comments filed by another party (Item 7, Statement of
Consideration), Kentucky stated that ``[T]he original permittee's bond does not become ``unused'' and ``more than
the amount necessary to do reclamation'' within the meaning of KRS 350.131(2) until the new permittee disturbs the
entire overlapped area, triggering a reclamation obligation on his behalf. Prior to that, the new permittee could
delete the unreclaimed area from its permit. The Cabinet must be assured that the original forfeited funds will in
fact be unnecessary before it can release the funds.'' Finally, in response to KRC's concern regarding liabilities
that may not become apparent until after a bond has been released, there is no authority in SMCRA or the Federal regulations
to retain bond funds after all release requirements have been met, for such unknown liabilities. The State can always
pursue the original permittee if such liabilities occur. The Director feels that the clarification provided by Kentucky
adequately responds to the concerns raised by KRC.

405 KAR 12:001



KRC objects to the proposed definition of ``willfully and willful violation'' because it appears to impose a higher
burden for demonstrating the willfulness of a violation than does the Federal counterpart at 30 CFR 843.5. The State's
definition was previously considered and approved by OSM in a 

Federal Register 

notice dated October 1, 1992 (57 FR 45295). In that approval, the Director observed ``[T]he Federal regulations provide
separate definitions for ``willfully'' at 30 CFR 846.5, and ``willful violation'' at 30 CFR 701.5 and 843.5. Unlike
the Federal definition of ``willful violation'', Kentucky's proposed combined definition does not stipulate that
the person who committed the act or omission must have intended the result that actually occurs. However, since Kentucky's
proposed definition includes all intentional acts and omissions, it will necessarily include all acts and omissions
specified in the Federal definitions. Because Kentucky's proposed combined definition will result in sanctions
and penalties no less stringent than those resulting from the separate Federal definitions, the Director finds that
the proposal is no less effective than the Federal regulations.'' Based upon the same reasoning as discussed above,
the Director is approving the proposed addition of the definition at 405 KAR 12:001(30).



405 KAR 12:010




KRC has raised two concerns regarding the reduction in inspection frequency proposed in section 3(5). KRC feels that
the proposal is ambiguous as to whether or not a finding of site stability must precede any reduction of inspection
frequency. In response to this concern, the State, in its Statement of Considerations dated August 13, 1993 (Administrative
Record No. KY-1333), pointed out that ``[A]fter a notice of temporary cessation is filed, the regulations require
the cabinet to conduct partial inspections until the cabinet determines that the permit area is sufficiently stable
with respect to mass stability, erosion, revegetation, water quality, and other reclamation requirements so that
quarterly complete inspections will provide adequate inspection of the permit area.'' OSM feels that the State's
explanation of its interpretation of this regulation resolves the concern raised by KRC. The second concern expressed
by KRC involves the State's reference to reduction in partial inspection frequency upon completion of Phase I reclamation.
The cited reference was approved by OSM on May 18, 1982 (47 FR 21404), and has not been submitted to OSM for reconsideration
as part of the current amendment. However, OSM feels that the issue requires further review, in light of the counterpart
Federal rule at 30 CFR 840.11(f)(2) published on August 16, 1982 (47 FR 35620). If, as a result of that review, OSM determines
that revisions to Kentucky's regulations are required, action in accordance with 30 CFR Part 732 will be taken to insure
that Kentucky's program is no less effective than the Federal counterpart.



Agency Comments



Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and the implementing regulations of 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited
from various government agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Kentucky program. The U.S. Forest Service,
the Bureau of Land Management, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Soil Conservation Service responded
but did not have any substantive comments on the proposed rules. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA)
raised two concerns in their response. In connection with the bond forfeiture procedures at 405 KAR 10:050 section
2(4), MSHA feels that the word ``operator'' should be deleted from this section since the agency questions how the
operator could be held liable if the operator is no longer on the site and/or has no interest in the bond. However, the
question of liability is one of fact to be determined in each individual case. In addition, the use of the term operator
is not part of the current amendment inasmuch as the term already exists in section 2(4) and is not part of the proposed
revisions. Therefore, the Director is taking no action regarding this comment.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940224-0-00070 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940224-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


MSHA also feels that 405 KAR 12:010 section 3(5)(a), regarding inspection frequency, should be revised in order to
clarify that a reduction in partial inspection frequency cannot occur until after Phase I reclamation. In reviewing
the proposed revisions to section 3(5)(a), as discussed in Finding III.B.2. herein, the Director has determined
that Kentucky's proposal is no less effective than the Federal counterpart at 30 CFR 840.11 (a) and (f). The Federal
rule clearly provides the regulatory authority with certain discretion in conducting partial inspections of inactive
surface coal mining and reclamation operations. In subsection (f), the rule identifies an inactive site as one for
which the regulatory authority has received notice of temporary cessation of operations. Kentucky's proposal is
consistent with the Federal rule in that it allows for a reduction in partial inspections upon completion of Phase
I reclamation, 

or

 upon receipt of notification of temporary cessation of operations. Therefore, the Director believes that the proposal
is acceptable as submitted.



V. Director's Decision




Based on the above findings, the Director is approving the program amendment as submitted by Kentucky on May 21, 1993,
and revised and resubmitted on June 14, 1993, and October 19, 1993. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 917 codifying
decisions concerning the Kentucky program are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being
made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage the State to conform
its program with the Federal standards without delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.



Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence




Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator
of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with respect to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate
to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 

et seq.

) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 

et seq

.). The Director has determined that this amendment contains no provisions in these categories and that EPA's concurrence
is not required.



VI. Procedural Determinations



Executive Order 12866




This final rule is exempt from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866.



Executive Order 12778




The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and has determined
that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of the
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10),
decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely
on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and
whether the other requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.



National Environmental Policy Act




No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).



Paperwork Reduction Act




This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.



Regulatory Flexibility Act

The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Maryland; Particulate Matter (PM-10): Group
III Areas State Implementation Plan



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving a State implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Maryland. This revision establishes
and requires the implementation of primary and secondary particulate matter standards consistent with the National
ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM-10). The intended effect of this action is
to approve five (5) regulations, amended by Maryland in order to conform with the requirements established for Group
III areas for PM-10. This action is being taken under section 110 of the Clean Air Act.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On March 1, 1989, the Maryland Department of the Environment submitted a revision to the Maryland State implementation
plan (SIP) to achieve and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM-10).
The revision consists of: (1) An amended Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 10.18.01-''General Administrative
Provisions''; (2) An amended COMAR 10.18.02-''Permits, Approvals, and Registrations''; (3) An amended COMAR
10.18.03-''State-Adopted National Ambient Air Quality Standards and Guidelines''; (4) An amended COMAR
10.18.05-''Air Pollution Episode System''; and (5) An amended COMAR 10.18.06-''General Emission Standards,
Prohibitions, and Restrictions''. 





The March 1, 1989 submittal is consistent with the SIP revision requirements for PM-10 Group III areas as detailed
in the July 1, 1987 

Federal Register

 notice (52 FR 24672). The amended Maryland regulations are consistent with the NAAQS for PM-10, and specify:





 PM-10 as an indicator of particulate matter.




 Exceedance levels.




 Reference methods for measurement of PM-10.




 Emergency episode plan revisions to include PM-10.




 Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulation standards for both PM-10 and Total Suspended Particulate
(TSP), with standards for emission rates and significant monitoring concentrations.




Summary of SIP Revision


On July 1, 1987, EPA promulgated national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic
diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM-10) (52 FR 24634). The PM-10 standards replace
the total suspended particulate (TSP) standards promulgated by EPA in 1971. Also on July 1, 1987, EPA promulgated
changes to the policies and regulations by which it will implement the NAAQS for PM-10 in 40 CFR parts 51 and 52
(52 FR 24672). 






Using the classification criteria established at 52 FR 24672, EPA has preliminarily designated areas within each
State as Group I, II, or III based upon an area's probability of attaining the PM-10 standard. The July 1, 1987


Federal Register

 notice requires State implementation plan (SIP) revisions for all classified Group I, II, and III areas and indicates
the SIP revision requirements for each classification.






On August 7, 1987, the State of Maryland was classified at 52 FR 29383 as follows:





Group II-Baltimore County-City of Baltimore. 



 

Group III-All other Areas not classified as Group I or
 Group II. 






The Clean Air Act as amended (1990 Amendments) affects these classifications, and the associated requirements,
in a number of ways. The 1990 Amendments eliminated the need for States to seek approval of ``committal'' SIP revisions
for Group II areas as prescribed in the July 1, 1987 

Federal Register

. The Group II areas are to be addressed using the authorities established in section 107 of the Clean Air Act concerning
the classification of areas as attainment or nonattainment with regard to the NAAQS. EPA has determined that sufficient
evidence does not exist to redesignate the City of Baltimore as nonattainment for PM-10 at this time. 





The 1990 Amendments did not affect the requirements established for Group III areas. The July 1, 1987 

Federal Register

 requires States to seek approval of SIP revisions as required under the preconstruction review program and to codify
other minor regulatory changes as needed. It is presumed that the existing Maryland SIP is adequate to demonstrate
attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS for PM-10 in all Group III areas in the State. On March 1, 1989, the State
of Maryland responded to the July, 1, 1987 

Federal Register

 by submitting five (5) regulations amended to reflect the revised particulate matter standards as a SIP revision.
This SIP revision addresses Group III areas only.



EPA Evaluation


EPA has evaluated Maryland's SIP revision request and concluded the following: (1) The amended regulations conform
with the revised primary and secondary NAAQS for PM-10; (2) the amended regulations are clearly enforceable;
and (3) the applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 51 have been met. A more detailed evaluation is provided in the Technical
Support Document available upon request from the Regional EPA office listed in the 

Addresses

 section of this document.




EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. These revisions to Maryland's regulations have been effective in the State
since March 21, 1989. This action will be effective April 25, 1994 unless, by March 28, 1994, notice is received that
adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the
effective date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw the final action and
another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no
such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on April 25, 1994. 


Final Action


EPA is approving the five (5) regulations submitted by the Maryland Department of the Environment as a revision to
the Maryland SIP. EPA's review of this material indicates that it conforms to the requirements of 40 CFR parts 51 and
52, and to the July 1, 1987 promulgation of NAAQS for PM-10 in the 

Federal Register

. 

The Agency has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved State implementation plan for conformance
with the provisions of the 1990 Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The Agency has determined that this action
conforms with those requirements irrespective of the fact that the submittal preceded the date of enactment.

Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose
any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities
affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a
flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Clean
Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIP's on such grounds.

 v. 

U.S. EPA

, 427 U.S. 246, 255-66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).

This SIP revision establishing revised particulate matter standards in Maryland has been classified as a Table 3
action for signature by the Acting Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived
Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years.
EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver
until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866, which superseded
Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.




Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by April 25, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does
it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2) of the Clean Air Act.)
