Oil and Gas Leasing; Lewis and Clark National Forest, MT



AGENCIES:

 Forest Service, USDA, and Bureau of Land Management, Interior.




<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to
disclose the impacts of proposed oil and gas leasing on the Lewis and Clark National Forest. The Forest Service and
the BLM will be joint lead agencies for this EIS (40 CFR 1501.5). The EIS will be designed to satisfy the requirements
of the Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing Reform Act of 1987 and implementing regulations (36 CFR 228.102).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Forest Service proposes to make certain lands within the Lewis and Clark National Forest administratively available
for oil and gas leasing, subject to constraints specified in the 1986 Lewis and Clark National Forest Land and Resource
Management Plan. The Forest Service also proposes to authorize the BLM to offer those lands for lease, subject to specified
stipulations. Both the administratively-available decision, and the leasing decision for specific lands are being
made. The BLM will decide whether to offer the specific lands for lease subject to the Forest Service ensuring that
correct stipulations will be attached to leases issued by BLM. In cases where the surface resources are not managed
by the federal government but the minerals are federally owned (split estate), the BLM will also decide whether or
not to offer these mineral rights for lease and what stipulations to apply. Except where stipulations prohibit all
surface use, operations and development may be allowed on the leased lands. Such activity is subject to the operator
obtaining an approved Surface Use Plan of Operations from the Forest Service in accordance with 36 CFR, subpart E,
228.106 and 228.107.



The EIS will examine the effects of the proposal to implement the oil and gas leasing direction in the 1986 Lewis and
Clark Forest Plan and additional alternatives. The primary purpose of this analysis is to determine which lands should
be available for leasing, what stipulations should be applied to any leases, and which specific lands should be offered
for lease at this time.

Lands affected are within the boundaries of the Lewis and Clark National Forest. These lands encompass several mountain
ranges south and east of Great Falls, Montana (including the Little Belt, Highwood, Castle, north Crazy, Big and Little
Snowy Mountains), as well as the eastern Front Range of the Rocky Mountains west of Choteau, Montana. By regulation,
several classes of National Forest System lands are considered legally unavailable for leasing at this time, and
will be considered unavailable for lease under all alternatives in the analysis. On the Lewis and Clark Forest, these
lands include existing wilderness, specifically the Bob Marshall-Scapegoat Wilderness complex. Also unavailable
are those lands recommended for wilderness in the Lewis and Clark Forest Plan, which includes about 51,800 acres on
the Rocky Mountain Division adjacent to the Bob Marshall and Scapegoat Wildernesses. These lands are described in
the Lewis and Clark Forest Plan as the Renshaw, South Fork and West Fork of the Teton, and Silver King-Falls Creek areas.
In addition, lands proposed for wilderness study under the Montana Wilderness Study Act (Pub. L. 95-150) are
not available for oil and gas leasing. This includes 92,000 acres in the Middle Fork of the Judith River Wilderness
Study Area in the Little Belt Mountains, and 98,000 acres in the Big Snowy Mountain Wilderness Study Area.

This analysis is required by the Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing Reform Act of 1987 and implementing regulations
promulgated in 1990 (36 CFR 228.102).

Potential issues that have been identified to date are the effects of oil and gas activities on:




1. Threatened and endangered species.

2. Sensitive fish, wildlife, and plant species.

3. Big game wildlife species.

4. Water quality.

5. Soil resources.

6. Inventoried roadless areas.

7. Indian rights and religious practices.

8. Dispersed and developed recreation opportunities.

9. Heritage resources.

10. Social and economic impacts to local and area communities.

11. Consistency with Forest Plan goals and objectives.

12. Lands considered in wilderness legislation.

13. Scenic byways.

14. Municipal watersheds.

15. Experimental Forest.

16. Noxious weeks.




The Lewis and Clark Forest Plan provides direction for the use of stipulations to be attached to leases in order to comply
with Forest Plan goals and objectives. As outlined in the Forest Plan, no-surface occupancy (NSO) is recommended
for lands where oil and gas development could conflict with riparian values, wetlands and floodplains, as well as
on slopes greater than 60%. The Forest Plan calls for no-surface occupancy to protect existing uses such as powerlines,
irrigation canals, and cemeteries, and developed recreation sites, as well as the area above Gibson Dam on the Sun
River. Areas identified in the Forest Plan as Research Natural Areas also require the NSO stipulation. The Ford Creek
Plateau area on the Rocky Mountain Division would be available only for no-surface occupancy leasing for the first
decade of the Forest Plan.

The Plan also identifies areas for which timing restrictions on activity would be stipulated to protect resource
values such as threatened and endangered species habitat, sensitive species habitat, big game seasonal ranges,
and raptor nest sites. NSO is recommended in areas where more than one key wildlife habitat is present and the combined
seasons of use leaves no opportunity for oil and gas occupancy.

In addition, the Lewis and Clark Forest Plan identifies resource concerns requiring special operating constraints,
such as landtypes susceptible to moderate-severe cut-bank failure potential, semi-primitive recreation areas,
Experimental Forests, and municipal watersheds. A stipulation controlling surface use would be applied to leases
with these resource concerns.

Under the Forest Plan, stream segments eligible for ``wild'' status under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 will
not be offered for lease. Most of these stream segments are within existing wilderness areas, but on those segments
outside of designated wilderness on Forest, lands unavailable for lease include areas within 1/4 mile either side
of segments of the South Fork of the Sun River, the Dearborn River, and North Fork Birch Creek.

Public participation will be important to the analysis. Part of the goal of public involvement is to identify additional
issues and to refine the preliminary issues identified above. People may visit with Forest Service officials at any
time during the analysis and prior to the decision. However, two periods are specifically designated for comments
on the analysis: (1) During the scoping process and (2) during the Draft EIS (DEIS) comment period.

During the scoping process, the Forest Service is seeking information and comments from Federal, State, and local
agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed action. A scoping
document will be prepared and mailed to parties known to be interested in the proposed action by February 25, 1994.
The agency invites written comments and suggestions on this action, particularly in terms of identification of issues
and alternative development. In addition, public open houses will be held during the scoping period: on Monday, February
28 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Kings Hill Ranger District Office in White Sulphur Springs, MT; on Wednesday, March 2,
from 6 p.m. until 9 p.m. at the Great Falls Civic Center in Great Falls, MT; on Monday, March 14, from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. at
the Holiday Inn in Missoula, MT; on Tuesday, March 16, from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. at the Little Flower Parish in Browning, MT;
and on Wednesday, March 17, from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. at the Choteau Public Library in Choteau, MT.

In addition to the proposed action, a range of alternatives will be developed in response to issues identified during
scoping. This includes the no-action alternatives required by NEPA in which no leasing would be authorized at this
time. The Forest Service will analyze and document the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of all alternatives.
Stipulations will be developed to mitigate effects and protect other resources, and the effectiveness of those stipulations
will be assessed.

The BLM and Forest Service are jointly preparing a Reasonably Foreseeable Development (RFD) scenario to predict
the level and type of oil and gas activity anticipated to occur for the 10-15 year period following leasing. The
RFD is based on known geologic, economic, and technical information for the local area. This RFD will be used to analyze
the effects of the proposed action and alternatives.

The Forest Service will continue to involve the public and inform interested and affected parties on how to participate
and contribute to the final decision. Another formal opportunity for response will be provided following completion
of a Draft EIS.

The Draft EIS should be available for review in the fall of 1994. The Final EIS is scheduled for completion in September
1995.

The comment period on the Draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency publishes the
Notice of Availability in the 

Federal Register

.

The Forest Supervisor for the Lewis and Clark National Forest has been assigned the task of compiling the EIS. However,
the officials responsible for making the decision resulting from the analysis are: David F. Jolly, Northern Region
Regional Forester, Federal Building, 200 E. Broadway, P.O Box 7669, Missoula, MT 59807; and State Director, USDI-Bureau
of Land Management, Montana State Office, 222 North 32nd Street, P.O. Box 36800, Billings, MT 59107-6800.

They will decide on an alternative to be implemented after considering comments and responses, environmental consequences
discussed in the Final EIS, and applicable laws, regulations, and policies. The decision and reasons for the decision
will be documented in a Record of Decision.

The comment period on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement will have 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency publishes the Notice of Availability in the 

Federal Register

.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so it is meaningful and
alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions (

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.

 v. 

NRDC

, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact
statement stage but are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived
or dismissed by the courts. 

City of Angoon

 v. 

Hodel

, 803 F. 2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cr. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.

 v. 

Harris

, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important those interested in
this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so substantive comments and objections
can be made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider and respond to them in the Final
Environmental Impact Statement.

To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
during the scoping period should be as specific as possible. Initial comments concerning the scope of the analysis
should be mailed to John D. Gorman, Forest Supervisor by March 31, 1994. When the Draft EIS is released, it is also helpful
if comments refer to specific pages or chapters in the draft document. Comments may also address the adequacy of the
Draft EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer
to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

Rice From Thailand; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 International Trade Administration/Import Administration, Department of Commerce. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final results of countervailing duty administrative review.


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 
On March 10, 1992, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results of its administrative
review of the countervailing duty order on rice from Thailand (57 FR 8437). We have now completed that review and determine
the total bounty or grant during the period January 1, 1990 through December 31, 1990 to be 0.53 percent 

ad valorem 

for all producers and exporters. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On March 10, 1992, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 8437) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the countervailing duty order on rice from Thailand
(51 FR 12356; April 10, 1986). The Department has now completed that administrative review in accordance with section
751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). 

Since the preliminary results of review, respondent, the Royal Thai Government (RTG), filed a case brief. All comments
received are addressed in this notice. 

In response to the comments, the Department recalculated loans made under the EPC program and the ACFT program using
the 1989 benchmark rate instead of the 1990 benchmark rate for short-term loans received in 1989 but repaid in 1990.


The Department adjusted the net benefit to the millers under the Ministry of Interior (MOI) paddy price raising program.
This adjustment results in a revised benefit to the millers. 

Because of these changes, the estimated bounty or grant of 0.69 percent 

ad valorem 

found in our preliminary results has been recalculated to 0.53 percent 

ad valorem

.

Scope of Review 



Imports covered by this review are shipments of all Thai rice including rice in the husk (paddy or rough); husked (brown)
rice including basmati and other; semi-milled or wholly-milled rice, whether or not polished or glazed, including
parboiled and other; and broken rice. During the review period, such merchandise was classifiable under item numbers
1006.10.00, 1006.20.20, 1006.20.40, 1006.30.10, 1006.30.90 and 1006.40.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
(HTS). The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.


The review covers the period January 1, 1990 through December 31, 1990 and fifteen programs: (1) Export Packing and
Stocking Credits (EPCs), (2) Marketing Organization of Farmers (MOF) Payment-in-kind Program, (3) MOF Paddy Rice
Purchase Program, (4) Cooperative Promotion Department (CPD) loans to Agricultural Cooperative Federation of
Thailand (ACFT), (5) Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) Paddy Rice Mortgage Program, (6)
BAAC Second Crop Paddy Rice Purchasing Program, (7) Ministry of Interior (MOI) Paddy Rice Raising Project and Compensatory
Financing Program for Millers, (8) Bank of Thailand (BOT) Agricultural Purchase Project, (9) Department of Agricultural
Extension (DAE) Loans to Farmer Associations, (10) Public Warehouse Organization (PWO) Loan Program, (11) Department
of Foreign Trade (DFT) Purchase of Milled Rice Program, (12) Export Processing Zones, (13) Incentives for International
Trading Firms, (14) Export Promotion Fund, and (15) Tax Certificates for Exporters. 



Standing 



Respondent, the Royal Thai Government (RTG), contends that only the USA Rice Council (USA Rice), by letter dated April
29, 1991, requested this administrative review, and that the Department's preliminary determination that this
review was initiated upon request of an interested party under 19 CFR 355.2(i)(5) is not supported by substantial
evidence on the record of this review. Further, respondent argues that there is no evidence on the record of this review
that the Rice Millers Association (RMA), the original petitioner in this proceeding, timely requested a review during
the anniversary month of the publication of the order. 

The Department accepted the USA Rice/RMA letter dated April 29, 1991, as being a request for review on behalf of both
USA Rice and RMA because all the statements in the letter were made collectively and the names and addresses of contact
individuals at both organizations were provided. To determine whether USA Rice had standing as an interested party
in this proceeding, the Department in its letter of May 2, 1991, requested information from USA Rice regarding the
function of USA Rice, the eligibility requirements for membership, and the number of members classified as importers,
producers or sellers of rice. By letter of May 13, 1991, USA Rice provided the requested information as well as copies
of their bylaws, articles of incorporation, and their annual report covering the period of review (POR). Based on
the information provided by USA Rice, the Department determined that USA Rice is an interested party to this proceeding.
Further, by letter dated June 7, 1991, the Department asked that RMA clarify its intent to request a review jointly
with USA Rice. RMA's affirmative response of June 7, 1991 was treated not as a request for review, but as a clarification
of RMA's intent. For these reasons, the Department treated the request for this administrative review to be jointly
from USA Rice and RMA. 



Analysis of Comments Received 



We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received comments from the respondent.




Comment 1: 

Respondent contends that in its preliminary determination, the Department wrongly rejected the short-term loan
benchmark developed by the Bank of Thailand (BOT) and erred in using the benchmark methodology adopted in Final Affirmative
Countervailing Duty Determination and Countervailing Duty Order; Steel Wire Rope from Thailand (56 FR 46299; Sept.
11, 1991), (Steel Wire Rope).

Respondent argues that the Department failed to address new evidence and arguments submitted by the RTG in the questionnaire
responses on the record of this review which show that the BOT benchmark methodology is more representative of short-term
commercial lending rates in Thailand than the Department benchmark methodology used in Steel Wire Rope. The respondent
explained that the BOT compiles a database from monthly balance sheets and semi-annual income statements submitted
by Thai commercial banks from which the BOT calculates a weighted-average commercial interest rate for short-term
borrowing. Respondent asserts that this BOT benchmark has been consistently used in all Thai cases previous to Steel
Wire Rope and was most recently verified in the 1989/90 administrative review of carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings
from Thailand. 

Respondent also argues that the Steel Wire Rope benchmark is premised on a misunderstanding of the minimum loan rate
(MLR) and minimum overdraft rate (MOR). Respondent asserts that the MLR and MOR are merely an indication of the commercial
bank's prospective short-term lending rates, and that banks are free to make commercial loans below either the MLR
or MOR. Commercial banks usually indicate high MLRs because certain loans cannot be made in excess of their MLRs. Further,
the MOR carries a higher interest rate than regular loans and is used only when a loan has not been repaid by its due date.
The MLR and MOR are ``prime'' rates from the perspective of the commercial banks, and exporters, as secured borrowers
repaying in hard foreign currencies, often receive commercial loans at rates below these rates. 

For these reasons, respondent contends that the MLR and the MOR do not reflect the actual lending practices of commercial
banks, and the Department should instead use the BOT benchmark to recalculate the benefits from all short-term loan
programs found countervailable in this review. 



Response:

 The Department has considered all the information submitted in respondent's questionnaire responses which explain
in detail the methodology and sources of information used to calculate the BOT benchmark. However, using the data
submitted by the respondent in the responses resulted, as it did in the final determination and order in Steel Wire
Rope, in a BOT benchmark which was lower than the average of the monthly prime rates (MLRs and MORs) as compiled by BOT
from commercial banks and published in the 1990 BOT Quarterly Bulletin, and less even than the interbank lending rate
reported in the government's response. Contrary to respondent's assertions that the MLR and MOR are merely indications
of the commercial bank's prospective short-term lending rates, throughout the BOT Annual Report and Quarterly Bulletins,
the MORs and MLRs are reported both as commercial banks' interest rates to prime customers or as prime rates (See 

BOT 1990 Annual Economic Report

 at p. 51 and 55; and 


December 1990 BOT Quarterly Bulletin

, at p. 12 and Table 22, 
p. 32). Also, the prime rates are published in the BOT Annual Report under Thailand's Key Economic Indicators at page
one. Further, it was found in Steel Wire Rope, that most of the commercial bank's short-term loans were made at the MOR/MLR
rates. This is confirmed by the 

1990 BOT Quarterly Bulletin

, Table 12 at p. 17 and the 

BOT Annual Economic Report

 at p. 53. Finally, because the interbank lending rate is the rate at which a commercial bank obtains its funds, the BOT
benchmark, which is less than the interbank lending rate reported in the government's response, demonstrates unmistakably
that the BOT benchmark does not reflect commercial realities. 

Based on these facts, the Department is not persuaded that the information submitted by respondent on the record of
this review more accurately reflects the actual interest rates for commercial short-term financing in Thailand
than the published MLR and MOR. Therefore, we determine that it is appropriate to continue to use the average of the
MOR and the MLR as our benchmark interest rate in these final results of review. 



Comment 2:

 Respondent contends that the Department should apply the 1989 benchmark rate to the benefit calculations for loans
made under the EPC program in 1989 and repaid in 1990. Respondent argues that this methodology matches the appropriate
benchmark rate to the time when the terms of the loans, including the interest rates, were set. 



Response:

 The Department's practice is to select a benchmark interest rate at the time the government and the firm agree on the
terms of the loan, which in this case was when the loan was received. (See, e.g., Final Affirmative Countervailing
Duty Determination and Countervailing Duty Order; Steel Wire Rope from Thailand) (56 FR 46299, September 11, 1991).
Therefore, we agree that the 1989 benchmark rate should be used for calculating the benefit of EPC loans received in
1989 but on which interest was paid in 1990 and have recalculated the benefit from this program. The revised net subsidy
from this program is 0.32 percent 

ad valorem.

 



Comment 3:

 Respondent claims the Department did not follow its recent practice of accounting for EPC loans with repayments made
both during and outside the review period. Respondent argues that, in calculating the benefit from this program,
the Department should include the entire loan if partial repayments are made before and during the review period and
exclude the entire loan if repayments are made during and after the review period. RTG specifically requested corrections
to be made to 22 loans with payments both inside and outside the review period.

Response:

 The Department disagrees with respondent. According to our practice as expressed in section 355.48(b)(3) of our
Proposed Rules, (54 FR 23384, May 31, 1989), the benefit from a loan occurs when a firm is due to make a payment on the loan.
The questionnaire response clearly states that in the case of EPC pre-shipment loans, the entire loan must be repaid
in full within two days of shipment, whether or not this occurred before the due date on the note. Further, in the case
of EPC post-shipment financing, the loan must be repaid on the earlier of the date on which the loan was due or the payment
for the shipment was received. In both types of loans, provision is made only for the payment of the entire loan and no
provision is made for partial payments. Therefore, we consider each payment listed in the questionnaire response
to be a repayment of a separate loan and according to our practice, have countervailed all those loans repaid within
our POR or with penalties refunded during the POR. 



Comment 4:

 Respondent contends that the loan disbursements from three domestic price stabilization programs_CPD loans to
ACFT, BAAC Paddy Mortgage Program and BOT Agricultural Purchase Project_should be allocated over the crop-year
during which the funds were available rather than allocated entirely during the calendar year covered by the review.
Respondent argues that the allocation of the disbursements should be made by calculating a ratio of crop-year months
falling within 1989 to total crop-year months which includes months in both 1989 and 1990. For calculating the benefit
from this program, the 1989 benchmark should be used for the portion of loans equivalent to the ratio of months falling
in 1989 and the 1990 benchmark used for the portion of loans equivalent to the ratio of months falling in 1989. 



Response:

 The Department agrees in part. The questionnaire response shows all CPD loans to ACFT, the provincial federations,
and district-level cooperative societies were disbursed in 1989 and repaid in 1990. Therefore, we have adjusted
our calculations to reflect the use of the 1989 benchmark rate of 12.23 for loans disbursed under this program (see
Comment 2). The revised net subsidy under this program is 0.05 percent 

ad valorem.

 

Although the RTG allocated the funds to BAAC and BOT in 1989 at the beginning of the crop year, respondent submitted
no information as to when the individual loans to farmers under these programs were disbursed by the BAAC and BOT. Therefore,
we continue to consider the aggregate amount of BAAC and BOT loans to be disbursed and repaid during the POR. 



Comment 5:

 Respondent asserts that the Department's best information available (BIA) rate imposed on the four companies not
submitting EPC loan information is overly punitive. Respondent argues that a more reasonable method for calculating
the benefits for this program should be adopted because complete EPC loan information was submitted for eight companies
accounting for 95.31 percent of rice exports to the United States for which EPCs were received. 



Response:

 In its questionnaire, the Department requested information on all EPCs granted, paid, or on which interest was paid
or due on rice exports to the United States during the POR. In its supplemental questionnaire, the Department requested
complete loan information for all 12 companies exporting to the United States who utilized EPCs during the POR. Respondent
submitted complete loan information for only eight of the 12 companies but stated in their supplemental questionnaire
response that the loan charts for the four exporters would be submitted as soon as they were available to counsel. No
loan information was submitted for the four companies. Section 776(c) of the Act requires the Department to use BIA
whenever a party refuses or is unable to produce the information requested. Furthermore,  355.37 of the Department's
regulations gives the Department broad discretion in the use of BIA to calculate benefits for non-cooperating companies
who do not submit a complete response. In light of respondent's failure to respond to our request for complete loan
information, we are continuing to use the highest individual company benefit found in this review to calculate the
benefit of the four companies not submitting complete responses. However, in accordance with our utilization of
different benchmarks for 1989 and 1990 loans 
(

See

 response to comment 2), the revised net subsidy from this program is 0.32 percent 

ad valorem.

Comment 6: 

Respondent contends that the Department's application of section 771B of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, 
19 U.S.C. Sec. 1677-2, is in error and, absent an upstream subsidies investigation, the Department has no authority
to countervail any of the paddy rice (paddy) price support and stabilization programs in this review. Respondent
argues that at harvest, the RTG intervenes in the market to purchase paddy from paddy farmers at prices above prevailing
market prices and holds the paddy off the market until prices improve. Although this practice serves to increase the
price received by paddy farmers, it increases the millers' cost of paddy, thereby decreasing the competitiveness
of milled rice, the exported product, in the U.S. and world markets. Therefore, an upstream subsidies investigation
would show that the price support and stabilization programs for paddy rice provide no competitive advantage to milled
rice, the exported product, and therefore are not countervailable. 

Further, respondent argues that the Department should determine whether 771B is relevant to the paddy rice purchase
programs by reexamining the following four factors: (1) Paddy growers and rice millers are not related and there is
no commonality of economic interest_in fact, their economic interests are adverse; (2) rice processing adds more
than limited value; (3) there can be no circumvention of the order because both paddy rice and milled rice are included
in the scope of the order and product shifting is impossible; (4) the processing operations (milling) change the essential
character of the paddy rice from an inedible raw fiber to an edible grain and create the added value, whether measured
by price or essential characteristics. In light of these facts, respondent claims that it would be inappropriate
to apply section 771B to the paddy rice purchase programs insofar as such programs serve only to raise the price of the
exported milled rice. 



Response: 

The Department disagrees with Respondent's contention that, absent an upstream subsidy investigation, the Department
has no authority to countervail the paddy rice support and stabilization programs in this review. In this review,
the Department determines that the criteria of 771B of the Act are satisfied, and as such need not apply an upstream
subsidy analysis with respect to subsidies on raw agricultural products used in the production of processed agricultural
products. 

In addition, the Department disagrees with Respondent's claim that Commerce has deemed four factors relevant to
determining which agricultural subsidies are subject to section 771B's provisions. Respondent extracts its four
factors from Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Live Swine and Fresh, Chilled and Frozen Pork
Products from Canada, (50 FR 25098, June 17, 1985) (Live Swine), a determination which predates section 771B by several
years. While the Live Swine determination may have provided the genesis for section 771B, it is not dispositive in
the Department's application and interpretation of the superseding statutory provision, particularly in cases
involving other products. 

Finally, the Department disagrees with Respondent's argument and reasoning that the domestic paddy purchase programs
should not be countervailed because they increase milled rice export prices, decreasing the competitiveness of
Thai rice in the United States and world markets. By raising the farm income of poor paddy farmers and stabilizing a
domestic paddy market, the programs ensure a continuous, level supply of paddy rice for domestic millers. A drop in
the supply of paddy due to either seasonal low levels of paddy production or a decrease in the number of paddy farmers
could compel Thai millers to source paddy abroad at even higher prices. 

Prior to enactment of section 771B, the Department considered a benefit to producers of a raw agricultural product
as a benefit to producers of a processed agricultural product. See Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination
and Countervailing Duty Order; Rice From Thailand, (51 FR 12356, April 10, 1986) (Rice). In Rice we determined that
``the primary, if not sole purpose of all segments of the industry in the case is to produce a single end product_milled
rice.'' We also noted that almost all of the raw agricultural product, paddy or unmilled rice, is dedicated to the production
of milled rice, and determined that there is a single, continuous line of production from paddy rice to milled rice.
Rice, at 12358. 

Section 1313 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 amended the Tariff Act of 1930 to include a new section
771B that states: ``In the case of an agricultural product processed from a raw agricultural product in which (1) the
demand for the prior stage product is substantially dependent on the demand for the latter stage product, and (2) the
processing operation adds only limited value to the raw commodity, subsidies found to be provided to either producers
or processors of the product shall be deemed to be provided with respect to the manufacture, production, or exportation
of the processed product.'' 

In this review, we determine that the first criterion of section 771B is met because the demand for paddy rice depends
substantially upon the demand for milled rice. As in Rice, we find in this review that substantially all of the raw agricultural
product, paddy rice, is dedicated to the production of milled rice. As determined in Rice, the fact that there is a single,
continuous line of production from paddy rice to milled rice is further evidence that the demand for the prior stage
product is dependent on the demand for the latter stage product.

<TEXT>
 

Furthermore, as in Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review; Rice From Thailand (56 FR 68, January
2, 1991) (Final), we determine that the second criterion of 771B, limited value added, is also satisfied in this review.
Respondent would have us consider the difference between paddy rice and milled rice in terms of price as the focus in
determining value added. The statute, however, requires us to consider the processing operation in determining
value added for the purposes of 771B. Notably, the bulk of value added in terms of price reflects supply and demand conditions
in the world market for rice and includes selling costs and profits in addition to the cost of milling or processing
operations. In this case, the processing operations consist primarily of parboiling the paddy rice, removing the
rice hulls, and removing the bran layer. The resulting processed agricultural product, milled rice, while not identical
to the raw agricultural product, paddy rice, is essentially unchanged in composition. As a result, the Department
determines that the processing operation itself adds only limited value to the raw commodity. 

Therefore, for the reasons set forth above, we determine that subsidies found to be provided to paddy rice shall be
deemed to be provided with respect to the manufacture, production, or exportation of milled rice in accordance with
section 771B of the Act. 



Comment 7: 

Respondent claims that in order to receive interest-free loans under the MOI's loan program, millers are required
by the Government to buy paddy from farmers at prices approximately ten percent above prevailing market prices. Therefore,
respondent argues that the gross benefit from the loans should be reduced by ten percent, as authorized under section
771(6) of the Act. 



Response: 

For the purpose of determining the net subsidy, section 771(6) of the Act allows the administering authority to subtract
from the gross subsidy the amount of ``(A) any application fee, deposit, or similar payment paid in order to qualify
for, or to receive, the benefit of the subsidy, (B) any loss in the value of the subsidy resulting from the deferred receipt,
if the deferral is mandated by Government order, and 
(C) export taxes, duties, or other charges levied on the export of merchandise to the United States specifically intended
to offset the subsidy received.'' Our practice is to interpret this section of the Act very narrowly, and we determine
that the requirement to buy paddy at prices above prevailing market prices is not an offset provided for under section
771(6).

However, in order not to double-count the subsidy conferred upon the subject merchandise under this program, we have
adjusted our preliminary calculations. Under this program, the MOI required rice millers to purchase rice from farmers
at a price ten percent above the prevailing market price. To partially cover the additional payments to the farmers,
the MOI provided interest-free loans to the rice millers. 
In our preliminary results of review, we calculated a countervailable subsidy under this program based on the ten
percent government-mandated price premium paid to the rice farmers. If we were also to calculate a benefit from the
interest-free loans provided to the millers to finance this program, we would be double-counting the benefit conferred
on the subject merchandise under this program: once, as grant payments provided to rice farmers, and again as the amount
of interest savings incurred by the millers from the interest-free loans used to pay the rice farmers the price premium
grant. 
In order to avoid this double-counting, and to calculate properly the full amount of the subsidy conferred upon the
subject merchandise under this program, we compared the amount of the ten percent premium paid for paddy rice purchases
to the amount of the interest savings from the MOI loans. Because the amount of the interest savings was greater than
the amount of the premiums paid on purchases of paddy rice, both the rice farmers and the millers received benefits
under this program. 
Since section 771B of the Act applies to this review, the benefits provided to both rice farmers and millers are deemed
to be conferred on the subject merchandise. (See Comment 6 for a discussion of section 771B of the Act.) Therefore,
to determine the net benefit to the millers under this program, we calculated the difference between the amount of
interest savings under this program and the ten percent premium provided to the rice farmers. This change results
in a revised benefit to the millers under this program. The benefit to the paddy farmers remains the same as in the preliminary
results. Thus, by dividing the sum of these two benefits by the domestic denominator and applying the export adjustment
factor, the net subsidy conferred upon the subject merchandise under this program is 0.02 percent 

ad valorem.

 


Comment 8:

 Respondent points out that the preliminary results have no effect on the cash deposit rate and requests that the Department
rescind any instructions to Customs issued upon publication of the preliminary determination. 


Response:

 No instructions were issued to Customs following the publication of the preliminary results. In accordance with

19 CFR 355.22(c)(10), the Department will issue instructions to Customs after publication of the final results of
this review. 


Final Results of Review 


As a result of our review, we determine the net bounty or grant to be 0.53 percent 

ad valorem

 for the period January 1, 1990 through December 31, 1990. 
Therefore, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess countervailing duties of 0.53 percent of the
f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments from Thailand of the subject merchandise exported on or after January 1, 1990
and on or before December 31, 1990. 
Further, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to collect
cash deposits of estimated countervailing duties of 0.53 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments of the
subject merchandise from Thailand entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication
of this notice. This deposit requirement shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review. 
This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 355.22.

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NIST invites interested members of the public to review validation requirements that have been developed for products
that implement FIPS PUB 140-1, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. NIST plans to establish a
product certification program using independent third party laboratories to validate cryptographic modules for
conformance to the security requirements of FIPS 140-1. The requirements for certification will be finalized
after the proposed procedures, inspections and tests for conformance have been determined. A National Voluntary
Laboratory Accreditation Program will be set up to accredit the third party laboratories at an appropriate future
time. At this time, NIST solicits public review of the proposed procedures, inspections, and tests that will be used
and the expected results to be achieved in the validation of cryptographic modules.




Those wishing to review the validation requirements may obtain a copy from the Standards Processing Coordinator

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for Disposal of Decommissioned, Defueled Cruiser,
Ohio, and Los Angeles Class Naval Reactor Plants</DOCTITLE>


AGENCIES:

 Department of the Navy and Department of Energy.



<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Navy, with the Department of Energy as 
a cooperating agency, announces its intent to prepare an 
Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), in 
accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations 
for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the National 
Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), and to conduct 
a series of public scoping meetings. This Environmental Impact 
Statement will address final disposal of decommissioned, defueled 
reactor plants from cruisers and OHIO (Trident) and LOS ANGELES 
(SSN 688) Class submarines and will analyze the associated 
reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts. The disposal of 
future reactor compartments from vessels that have not yet been 
commissioned (e.g., SEAWOLF Class of submarines) will be addressed, 
as appropriate, in future National Environmental Policy Act 
documents. By participating as a cooperating agency in this 
Environmental Impact Statement, the Department of Energy expects to 
be able to adopt this Environmental Impact Statement, if 
appropriate, to fulfill its environmental review obligations under 
the National Environmental Policy Act. 


In accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality National 
Environmental Policy Act regulations, the Department of the Navy is 
preparing this Environmental Impact Statement to focus on the 
potential for significant environmental impacts and to consider 
reasonable alternatives. 
Because of the common design characteristics of the reactor plants 
and their reactor compartments, the method currently being used by 
Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington to dispose of 
submarine reactor compartments is the preferred alternative for 
disposal of the defueled reactor plants from cruisers and OHIO and 
LOS ANGELES Class submarines. Briefly, this alternative would 
involve draining the piping systems, tanks, vessels, and other 
components to the maximum extent practical, sealing the radioactive 
systems, removing the reactor compartment and sealing it to provide 
a high integrity welded steel package. The reactor compartment 
package would be transported by barge out of Puget Sound through 
the Straits of Juan de Fuca, down the Washington coast, and up the 
Columbia River to the Port of Benton where it would be loaded onto 
an overland transporter for the short movement to the Department of 
Energy's low level radioactive waste burial grounds at Hanford, 
Washington. 
The reactor plants contain radioactivity due to neutron irradiation 
of structural alloys forming the reactor plant components. The 
reactor compartment packages would comply with the shipping 
container requirements of the Department of Transportation, the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Department of Energy. 
Disposal of the reactor compartments would be in accordance with 
Department of Energy requirements for low level radioactive waste 
disposal. Disposal of the reactor compartments would be regulated 
by the State of Washington due to the lead shielding contained 
within the reactor compartments and by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency due to the small quantity of polychlorinated 
biphenyls in materials within the reactor compartment such as 
insulation, electrical cables, and rubber parts. 
The Navy also will evaluate in detail a ``no action'' alternative. 
In this alternative, the defueled ships would be maintained in 
waterborne protective storage for an indefinite period of time at 
the inactive ships facilities at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and 
Norfolk Naval Shipyard. 
Several other alternatives will be examined. These alternatives 
include sea disposal, land disposal at other sites, land disposal 
or reuse of subdivided portions of the reactor plant, and above 
ground storage or disposal.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The United States Navy placed the world's first nuclear powered 
submarine, the NAUTILUS, into service in 1954. The first nuclear 
powered cruiser, the LONG BEACH, was commissioned in 1961. As of 
the end of 1993, the U.S. Navy had 106 nuclear-powered submarines 
and 15 nuclear-powered surface ships in operation. Today, over 40% 
of the Navy's principal combatants are nuclear powered. 

At the end of their useful lifetime, when the cost of continued 
operation is not justified by their military capability, or when 
they are no longer needed, the defueled reactor compartments from 
these ships require disposal. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, 
the Navy evaluated a number of options for disposing of the pre-LOS 
ANGELES class nuclear powered submarine reactor compartments as the 
ships were beginning to approach the end of their design life. The 
options examined included disposal of the reactor compartment at an 
existing land burial site, with the non-radioactive remainder of 
the submarine disposed of either by sinking at sea or by cutting up 
for sale as scrap metal, and disposal by sinking the entire 
submarine in the deep ocean. The ``no action'' alternative of long 
term protective storage also was examined. The Navy's 1984 Final 
Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision concluded 
that permanent disposal would be environmentally safe and feasible 
using either the land burial or deep ocean option. The Record of 
Decision issued by the Secretary of the Navy stated that ``No 
unacceptable environmental impacts associated with either option 
have been identified as a result of the analysis or through the 
public review process'', and that ``Based on consideration of all 
current factors bearing on a disposal action of this kind 
contemplated, the Navy has decided to proceed with disposal of the 
reactor compartments by land burial.'' The Navy has successfully 
pursued this course of action and, as of the end of 1993, has 
safely shipped 35 submarine reactor compartments to the Department 
of Energy's burial grounds at Hanford, Washington.

Today the Navy faces the necessity of downsizing the fleet to an 
extent that was not envisioned before the end of the Cold War. 
Over the next few years a number of major surface combatants, 
including nuclear powered cruisers, will be removed from service. 
Some LOS ANGELES Class submarines are scheduled for removal from 
service. Eventually, the Navy will also need to decommission OHIO 
Class submarines. These classes of nuclear powered ships were not 
considered in the 1984 Environmental Impact Statement. The total 
number of cruiser, OHIO, and LOS ANGELES Class reactor compartments 
is approximately 100. The purpose of this Environmental Impact 
Statement will be to assess the potential environmental impact of 
disposing of defueled reactor compartments from nuclear powered 
cruisers and the LOS ANGELES and OHIO Class submarines. 



Preliminary Description of Alternatives 



1. Preferred Alternative 



Because of the common design characteristics of the reactor plants 
and their reactor compartments, the method currently being used by 
Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington to dispose of 
submarine reactor compartments is the preferred alternative for 
disposal of the defueled cruiser, OHIO and LOS ANGELES Class 
reactor plants. Briefly, this alternative would involve draining 
the piping systems, tanks, vessels, and other components to the 
maximum extent practical, sealing the radioactive systems, removing 
the reactor compartment and sealing it to provide a high integrity 
welded steel package, and transporting the package first by barge 
up the Columbia River and then a short distance over land to the 
Department of Energy's low level radioactive waste burial grounds 
at Hanford, Washington. The reactor compartment packages would be 
placed in a trench, backfilled with earth, and covered by an 
engineered cap to minimize future water infiltration.

2. No Action 


This alternative would involve keeping defueled nuclear powered ships in waterborne protective storage for an indefinite
period of time. Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Norfolk Naval Shipyard have inactive ships storage facilities for
defueled nuclear powered ships. Rather than temporarily storing the ships until their reactor compartments can
be removed, the ``no action'' alternative would result in a much larger number of ships in storage. This option would
require periodic ship inspections as well as performance of drydocking preservations. If no permanent disposal
alternative is available, the ``no action'' alternative will occur by default. 


3. Other Alternatives 


Several other alternatives will be examined including the following: 
The detailed evaluation of sea disposal contained in the Navy's 1984 Environmental Impact Statement will be used
and updated in this Environmental Impact Statement to take into account the number and radioactivity content of the
cruiser, OHIO, and LOS ANGELES Class reactor compartments. The 1984 Environmental Impact Statement concluded that
sea disposal could be performed in an environmentally safe manner with no significant adverse effect. However, the
1984 Record of Decision noted that Congress passed an amendment which restricted the issuance of permits for sea disposal
of radioactive material and required Congressional approval before such a permit could be issued, and the Environmental
Protection Agency stated that additional regulations may be required before a permit request could be reviewed.
Also, in November 1993, the United States voted along with the majority of other signatories to the London Convention
to ban sea disposal of low level radioactive waste subject to a scientific review in 25 years. Therefore, this alternative
would now be precluded by treaty. 
Disposal sites other than the Department of Energy's burial site at Hanford will be considered for disposal of reactor
compartment packages. Criteria to be considered in site evaluation will include availability of barge unloading
facilities, navigability of waterways, bridge clearances, and overland transport requirements. 
Land disposal or reuse of subdivided portions of the reactor plant would involve the cutting up of the defueled reactor
plant into smaller pieces. This option would require evaluation of locations and methods to dismantle and package
the reactor plant components and determination of appropriate locations and methods for final disposal or reuse
of the resulting subdivided portions of the reactor plant. 
Placement of the reactor compartments above ground in specially designed buildings or in an arid environment will
be evaluated as an interim storage measure, and as a permanent disposal method. As in the case of the burial option,
the above ground storage evaluation will consider the long term migration potential of long lived radionuclides.



Preliminary Identification of Environmental Issues 


The following issues, subject to consideration of comments received in response to public scoping, have been tentatively
identified for analysis in the Environmental Impact Statement. This list is presented to facilitate public comment
on the scope of the Environmental Impact Statement. It is not intended to be all inclusive nor is it intended to be a predetermination
of impacts. 
1. Potential impacts to the public and on-site workers from radiological and non radiological releases caused by
activities to be conducted within the context of the proposed action and alternatives. 
2. Potential environmental impacts, including air and water quality impacts, caused by the proposed action and alternatives.

3. Potential transportation impacts as a result of the proposed action and alternatives. 
4. Potential effect on endangered species, floodplain/wetlands, and archeological/historical sites as a result
of the proposed action and alternatives. 
5. Potential impacts from postulated accidents as a result of the proposed action and alternatives. 
6. Potential socioeconomic impacts to the surrounding communities as a result of implementing the proposed actions
and alternatives. 
7. Potential cumulative impacts from the proposed action and other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future
actions. 
8. Potential irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources.

<DOCTITLE>Distrigas of Massachusetts Corporation, et al. </DOCTITLE>
Natural Gas Certificate Filings 


February 15, 1994.


Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 


1. Distrigas of Massachusetts Corporation 


Docket No. CP91-2243-002 


Take notice that on February 8, 1994, Distrigas of Massachusetts (DOMAC) with an office at 200 State Street, Boston
Massachusetts 02109, filed in Docket No. CP91-2243-002 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act and
part 157 of the Commission's regulations an application for an amendment to the certificate of public convenience
and necessity issued by the Commission in this Docket on December 3, 1991 (

Distrigas of Massachusetts Corporation

, 57 FERC   61,295, 1991; 

clarified 

58 FERC   61,297 (March 18, 1992)). The December 3 Certificate authorized DOMAC to install additional vaporization
capacity and appurtenant facilities at DOMAC's liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Everett, Massachusetts.
That Certificate, as clarified, required DOMAC to complete construction of the authorized facilities by March 18,
1994. 
Because of intervening developments and changes in DOMAC's original market projections, installation of the certificated
facilities by the March 18, 1994, in-service date is no longer warranted by current market demand. Accordingly, given
the substantial lead times needed to complete design and to obtain needed equipment, DOMAC requests that the December
3 Certificate be amended to remove the in-service date. In place of a specific in-service date, DOMAC requests that
the certificate require DOMAC to file with the Commission by March 31, 1995, final design specifications and evidence
that final equipment orders have been placed. Timing of completion of the certificated facilities will thus depend
on the completion and delivery of the required equipment and will not require further intervention by the Commission
to precisely tailor the certificate to the delivery dates for that equipment. 


Comment date: 

March 8, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 



2. Williams Natural Gas Company 


Docket No. CP94-196-000 


Take notice that on January 24, 1994, Williams Natural Gas Company (WNG), Post Office Box 3288, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101,
filed an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for an order permitting the abandonment of certain
of its gathering system facilities by conveyance to Williams Gas Processing - Mid-Continent Region Company (WGP-MCR),
all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
WNG will convey approximately 88 miles of predominantly small diameter pipeline, 38,286 horsepower of compression,
two drip control plants and various appurtenant facilities, all used to gather gas from approximately 700 wells in
the states of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. WNG will sell the facilities to WGP-MCR at the net book value at the time of
conveyance. 


Comment date: 

March 8, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 


3. Williams Natural Gas Company 


Docket No. CP94-221-000 


Take notice that on February 9, 1994, Williams Natural Gas Company (WNG) P.O. Box 3288, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101, filed
in Docket No. CP94-221-000 an application pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate
of public convenience and necessity authorizing WNG to replace approximately 20 feet of 20-inch transition pipeline
and, upon replacement, to hydrotest and increase the maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) of the Blackwell,
Oklahoma to Hesston, Kansas segment of WNG's system, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file
with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
Specifically, WNG states that in order to increase the MAOP of the Blackwell to Hesston portion of its pipeline system
approximately 20 feet of 20-inch pipeline, in five four-foot sections, must be replaced. WNG states that the pipe
replacement and subsequent uprating will give WNG the capability to transport increased volumes of gas to the Wichita
market center. WNG further states that the increased MAOP will also enhance service reliability and flexibility
by increasing WNG's ability to shift demand volumes between the north and south portions of its pipeline system. 
WNG states that the proposed replacement and uprating will cost approximately $222,000, which will be paid from funds
on hand.

4. Arkla Energy Resources Company 


Docket No. CP94-222-000 


Take notice that on February 9, 1994, Arkla Energy Resources Company (AER), P.O. Box 21734, Shreveport, Louisiana
71151, filed a prior notice request with the Commission in Docket No. CP94-222-000 pursuant to Section
157.205 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for authorization to construct and operate
a one-inch delivery tap in St. Francis County, Arkansas, under AER's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-384-000,


et al.

 and deliver natural gas under its blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP88-820-000, pursuant to
Section 7 of the NGA, all as more fully set forth in the request which is open to the public for inspection. 
AER proposes to construct and operate a one-inch delivery tap in St. Francis County, Arkansas, for the delivery of
natural gas to Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company's (ALG) customer, James E. Knox. AER would deliver approximately 85
Mcf of natural gas annually and one Mcf on a peak day. AER states that Mr. Knox would reimburse AER for the estimate $1,600
in construction costs for the proposed delivery tap. AER also states that it would transport gas to ALG and provide
service under its Order No. 636 restructured rate schedules, the volumes would be within ALG's certificated entitlements,
and AER's tariff allows the addition of new delivery points. 



Comment date: 

April 1, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 



5. K N Interstate Gas Transmission Co. 


Docket No. CP94-225-000 


Take notice that on February 10, 1994, K N Interstate Gas Transmission Co (KNI)
, P.O. Box 281304, Lakewood, Colorado 80228, filed an application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for
an order permitting and approving the abandonment of facilities by KNI sale to GPM Gas Corporation (GPM) all as more
fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 




KNI requests permission from the Commission to abandon, by transfer to GPM, the following facilities: 
(a) 27,773 feet of 12.75-inch steel pipeline extending north from the former Tyrone Plant in Texas County, Oklahoma
to a point of interconnect with Northern Natural Gas Company (Northern) in Seward County, Kansas, 
(b) 46,813 feet of 8.625-inch steel pipeline extending south from the former Tyrone Plant to points of interconnect
with the facilities of Colorado Interstate Gas Company and Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company in Texas County, Oklahoma,
and 
(c) 4,564 feet of 4.5-inch steel pipe extending from a point southwest of the former Tyrone Plant site north to a point
of interconnect with the facilities of Northern in Texas County, Oklahoma, and various valves, regulators, and miscellaneous
facilities.

<TEXT>
 

KNI states that the Tyrone System, located in Beaver and Texas Counties, Oklahoma and Seward County, Kansas, was constructed
in 1953. KNI indicates that the system was constructed even though it was isolated from the rest of its system. It was
also indicated that adequate reserves could not be purchased adjacent to its main pipeline system. KNI states that
gas purchased by KNI was delivered from the Tyrone System to third parties for ultimate redelivery to KNI on its mainline
system. KNI advised that over time its reliance upon the supplies connected to the Tyrone System diminished and, as
a result, KNI released all of the gas supplies it had under contract along the Tyrone System. 

It is indicated that because the Tyrone System was isolated and distant from its mainline system and was no longer needed
to move its system supplies, K N transferred its facilities upstream of the Tyrone Plant to GPM but did not transfer
the residue lines connecting the plant with the three downstream interstate transporters. The Commission approved
this abandonment by sale by order issued August 4, 1993, in Docket No. CP92-661-000 and also determined
that the upstream facilities were non-jurisdictional gathering lines. KNI also states that, upon acquisition of
the Tyrone gathering facilities, GPM began using these facilities to gather gas for delivery to its own processing
plants. It is then indicated that, as a result, gas no longer flowed to the Tyrone Plant for processing and for ultimate
delivery into KNI's residue lines. It is also stated that, subsequently, the owner of the Tyrone Plant sold the plant,
and removed the facility from the plant site. 

KNI states that, with the removal of the Tyrone Plant, the residue lines are no longer usable to KNI. KNI now seeks to
transfer these facilities to GPM. It is indicated that pursuant to a memorandum of understanding, KNI would receive
the net book value of the residue lines ($36,000 as of October 31, 1993) in return for the transfer of facilities to GPM.
KNI states that by abandoning the remainder of the Tyrone System facilities, it would eliminate the expense and inefficiencies
associated with the isolated facilities.

<DOCTITLE>Southern Natural Gas Co.; GSR Cost Recovery Filing</DOCTITLE>



February 17, 1994.



Take notice that on February 14, 1994, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern) filed pursuant to section 4 of the Natural
Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. 717(c) (1988), to recover gas supply realignment (GSR) costs incurred as a consequence of Southern's
implementation of restructured pipeline services under Order No. 636, 

et seq.

 Southern states that the tariff sheets identified below were filed in compliance with the Commission's order in Southern's
restructuring proceeding in Docket No. RS92-10-000 and the procedures set forth in section 31 of the General
Terms and Conditions of Southerns's FERC Gas Tariff, Seventh Revised Volume No. 1:




Fourth Revised Sheet No. 15
Alternate Fourth Revised Sheet No. 15
Fourth Revised Sheet No. 17
Alternate Fourth Revised Sheet No. 17
Fourth Revised Sheet No. 18
Third Revised Sheet No. 29
Third Revised Sheet No. 30
Third Revised Sheet No. 31




Southern states that the purpose of this filing is to set forth additional known and measurable GSR costs which have
been paid or incurred by Southern since the filing on December 1, 1993, of its first GSR cost recovery filing in Docket
No. RP94-67-000. Southern states that it sets forth in this filing the revised demand surcharges and revised
interruptible rates that will be charged in connection with its recovery of GSR costs associated with the reformation
of additional gas supply contracts that have become unnecessary and/or unmarketable as a result of the receipt by
Southern of revised service elections from its customers following the mandatory restructuring by Southern of its
pipeline services under Order No. 636. Southern requests that the tariff sheets be made effective on March 1, 1994.

Southern states that it seeks to recover $53.9 Million in GSR costs which has been paid or incurred in connection with
the reformation of four gas supply contracts. Southern states that these GSR costs have arisen as a direct result of
the need to realign gas supply contracts following customers' elections during restructuring to terminate their
sales entitlements under Order No. 636. Southern further states that none of the GSR costs sought to be recovered in
the instant filing constitute take-or-pay settlement costs under gas supply contracts existing at March 31, 1989
which would be subject to the provisions of Southern's 1988 take-or-pay settlement in Docket No. RP86-63-000.

Southern states that copies of the filing were served upon Southern's customers and interested state commissions.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and
214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before February
25, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will
not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene.

<DOCTITLE>Texas Eastern Transmission Corp.; Notice of Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>


February 17, 1994.


Take notice that on February 14, 1994, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern), tendered for filing
as part of its FERC Gas Tariffs, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1 and Original Volume No. 2, revised tariff sheets listed on
appendix A to the filing.
Texas Eastern states that on December 30, 1993, Texas Eastern filed tariff sheets in Docket No. TM94-4-17-000,
to be effective February 1, 1994, to reflect changes in Texas Eastern's projected expenditures for electric power
for the twelve month period beginning February 1, 1994, based upon actual expenditures for the twelve month period
ending October 31, 1993 (``EPC Filing'').
Texas Eastern states that on January 28, 1994, the Commission issued an order on the EPC Filing in Docket No. TM94-4-17-000
which accepted and suspended, effective February 1, 1994, the proposed tariff sheets, subject to the Commission's
receipt and review of certain additional information to be filed by Texas Eastern (``January 28 Order''). Texas Eastern
states that it is providing the required information and filing certain tariff sheets, listed on appendix A of the
filing, which reflect the various rate components for EPC costs included in incremental services and the exclusion
from the EPC tariff provision of those Rate Schedule FT-1 services approved on an incremental basis.
The proposed effective date of the tariff sheets is February 1, 1994.
Texas Eastern states that copies of its filing have been served on all firm customers of Texas Eastern, current Rate
Schedule FT-1 and IT-1 shippers and interested state commissions.
Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Regulatory Commission, 825 North
Capitol Street NE, Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with  385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations.
All such protests should be filed on or before February 25, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining
the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this
filing are on a file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.

<DOCTITLE>Texas Eastern Transmission Corp.; Notice of Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>



February 17, 1994.



Take notice that on February 14, 1994, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern), tendered for filing
as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1, the tariff sheets listed on appendix A of the filing.

Texas Eastern states that on December 30, 1993, Texas Eastern filed certain tariff sheets: (1) Pursuant to ordering
paragraph (C) of the Commission's order issued October 29, 1993, in Docket No. RP93-204-000, to implement
a small customer mitigation methodology, and (2) to flow through a rate refund received from Columbia Gulf Transmission
Company. These tariff sheets reflected a proposed effective date of October 31, 1993. By Commission order issued
January 28, 1994, (January 28 Order) such tariff sheets were accepted and suspended to be effective January 1, 1994,
subject to Texas Eastern refiling the sheets to revise the billing amounts prospectively, for the remainder of the
amortization period, so as to adjust for the differences between the new allocations and the amounts already billed
to customers.

Texas Eastern states that pursuant to and in compliance with the January 28 Order, Texas Eastern is refiling the tariff
sheets listed on appendix A of the filing. In the December 30, 1993, filings, Texas Eastern states it contemplated
a twelve (12) month amortization period for these billing amounts beginning October 31, 1993. Texas Eastern has already
billed its customers for the months of November 1993, December 1993 and January 1994 according to First Revised Sheet
Nos. 165, 166 and 167. As a result, the tariff sheets listed on appendix A which are effective January 1, 1994, show that
the Account No. 858 Stranded Cost Direct Bill commences on January 31, 1994, because January 31, 1994, is the first
day of the next unbilled amortization period (February 1994). Texas Eastern states that this is purely an administrative
matter resulting from the billing process and will not affect amounts previously billed for the months of November
1993, December 1993 and January 1994. Attachment A of the filing illustrates the calculation of the new principal
amount by customer for the remaining nine (9) month amortization period in accordance with the January 28 Order.

The proposed effective date of the tariff sheets listed on appendix A of the filing is January 1, 1994.

Texas Eastern states that copies of the filing were served on Texas Eastern's jurisdictional customers and interested
state commissions.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before February 25, 1994. Protests will be considered by the
Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the
proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>Texas Eastern Transmission Corp.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>



February 17, 1994.



Take notice that on February 14, 1994, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern), tendered for filing
as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets:



Proposed To Be Effective June 1, 1993



2nd Sub Original Sheet No. 634


Sub Original Sheet No. 636



Proposed To Be Effective October 1, 1993



Sub First Revised Sheet No. 633



Proposed To Be Effective October 3, 1993



1st Rev Second Revised Sheet No. 633



Proposed To Be Effective November 1, 1993



Sub Fourth Revised Sheet No. 633




Texas Eastern states that it is making the instant filing to clarify tariff inconsistencies called to Texas Eastern's
attention by the Commission Staff in connection with a January 25, 1994, technical conference in Docket No. TM94-2-17.
Staff indicated that Section 15.6(A) could be read as meaning that all Rate Schedule FT-1 services are subject
to the ASA provision. Texas Eastern states that it is filing Sub Fourth Revised Sheet No. 633 to clarify that certain
incremental services, including ITP, are not subject to the ASA provision and to further clarify the definition of
``Applicable Shrinkage Percentages''.

Additionally, Staff pointed out that Section 15.6(A) listed Rate Schedules LLFT, LLIT, VKFT and VKIT, also incremental
rate schedules, as ASA Rate Schedules in Section 15.6(A). Pursuant to Commission orders authorizing these services,
Rate Schedules LLFT, LLIT, VKFT, and VKIT should be and were intended to be defined as Non-ASA Rate Schedules, as shown
on currently effective Sheet No. 130 of Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1. Texas Eastern
states that it is filing Sub First Revised Sheet No. 633 and 1st Rev Second Revised Sheet No. 633 to eliminate these Rate
Schedules from the listing of ASA Rate Schedules. Such tariff sheets are to be effective October 1, 1993 and October
3, 1993, the effective dates of Rate Schedules LLFT and LLIT and VKFT and VKIT, respectively.

Further, as Staff pointed out at the technical conference, the reference to ``ASA Reservation Charge Surcharge''
in Section 15.6(E) of Texas Eastern's tariff should read ``ASA Usage Surcharge.'' Texas Eastern states that it is
filing Sub Original Sheet No. 636 to make this modification. In addition, Texas Eastern states that it is filing 2nd
Sub Original Sheet No. 634 to correct an error in the page reference in Section 15.6(A)(2).

Texas Eastern states that copies of the filing were served on firm customers of Texas Eastern and interested state
commissions.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211
and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before
February 25, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken,
but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion
to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Co.; Notice of Compliance Tariff Filing</DOCTITLE>



February 17, 1994.



Take notice that on December 16, 1993, Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company (Williston Basin), tendered
for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Original Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheet:



Effective December 1, 1993



Sub Forth-ninth Revised Sheet No. 11B




On December 13, 1993, Williston Basin submitted for filing its compliance filing in Docket No. RP94-48-001.
The filing was made in compliance with the Commission's December 3, 1993, Order to reflect the annual principal amount
(plus interest) of the ten percent of Gas Supply Realignment Transition Costs as an allocated costs attributable
to interruptible transportation service provided under Rate Schedule IT-1 and the removal of the facilities
transferred by Williston Basin to Koch Hydrocarbon Company from Williston Basin's rate base.

Upon further review of its December 13 filing, Williston Basin noticed that Forty-ninth Revised sheet No. 11B contains
an inadvertent error. Rate Schedule X-13 should not have reflected the take-or-pay throughput surcharge of
21.251 cents per Dkt. Williston Basin is therefore submitting herewith a corrected, Sub Forth-ninth Revised Sheet
No. 11B, to replace Forth-ninth Revised Sheet No. 11B submitted on December 13, 1993. The change to this tariff sheet
has no effect on any other rates.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211). All such protests should be filed on or before February 25, 1994. Protests will be considered
by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to the proceeding. Copies of the filing are on file with the
Commission and are available for public inspection.

 Notice of the Proposed Revision of the Form EIA-871A, ``Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey, Building
Questionnaire,'' and Solicitation of Comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Energy Information Administration (EIA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent
burden (required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-511, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), conducts
a presurvey consultation program to provide the general public and other Federal agencies with an opportunity to
comment on proposed and/or continuing reporting forms. This program helps to ensure that requested data can be provided
in the desired format, reporting burden is minimized, reporting forms are clearly understood, and the impact of collection
requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. Currently, EIA is soliciting comments concerning the proposed
revision of Form EIA-871A, ``Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey, Building Questionnaire,''
to collect information on Federal government buildings using EIA-871A (FS), ``Commercial Buildings Energy
Consumption Survey, Building Questionnaire, (Federal Supplement).''

I. Background 


In order to fulfill its responsibilities under the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 (Pub. L. No. 93-275)
and the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. No. 95-91), the Energy Information Administration is
obliged to carry out a central, comprehensive, and unified energy data and information program. As part of this program,
EIA collects, evaluates, assembles, analyzes, and disseminates data and information related to energy resource
reserves, production, demand, and technology, and related economic and statistical information relevant to the
adequacy of energy resources to meet demands in the near and longer term future for the Nation's economic and social
needs. 

Form EI-871A, ``Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey, Buildings Questionnaire'' collects information
about energy characteristics and related energy consumption and expenditures in commercial buildings. These data
are used for energy modelling and forecasting. Specifically, the data to be obtained by the Form EIA-871A (FS)
will assist in measuring the potential for energy savings in Federal buildings, pursuant to the requirements of Section
152 through 167 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Form EIA-871A (FS) will collect data on Federally-owned buildings.
Data will be collected on building size, principal building activity, physical characteristics of the building
and energy-related equipment, energy sources used and related energy end uses. The data collected will be similar
to that previously collected by EIA for commercial buildings using Form EIA-871A ``Building Questionnaire''.

This is a revision of an existing collection. Modifications to the existing Form EIA-871A ``Building Questionnaire''
include eliminating questions that are not related to Federal buildings or to EPACT requirements and adding several
questions related to: water heating, energy audits conducted by the DOE Office of Federal Energy Management Programs,
and energy consumption. 



III. Request for Comments 



Prospective respondents and other interested parties should comment on the actions discussed in item II. The following
general guidelines are provided to assist in the preparation of responses. 

As a potential respondent: A. Are the instructions and definitions clear and sufficient? If not, which instructions
require clarification? 

B. Can the data be submitted using the definitions included in the instructions? 

C. Can data be submitted in accordance with the response time specified in the instructions? 

D. Public reporting burden for this collection is estimated to average 27 minutes per respondent. Given that this
survey will be conducted by telephone, how much time do you estimate it will require you to review the advanced letter
mailed to you, gather the necessary data needed (square footage of building, year constructed and annual energy consumption)
and respond to the telephone interview which includes questions about the physical characteristics of the building
and energy-related equipment. 

E. What is the estimated cost of completing this form, including the direct and indirect costs associated with the
data collection? Direct costs should include all costs, such as administrative costs, directly attributable to
providing this information. 

F. How can the form be improved? 

G. Do you know of any other Federal, State, or local agency that collects similar data? If you do, specify the agency,
the data element(s), and the means of collection. 

As a potential user: A. Can you use data at the levels of detail indicated on the form? 

B. For what purpose would you use the data? Be specific. 

C. How could the form be improved to better meet your specific needs? 

D. Are there alternate sources of data and do you use them? What are their deficiencies and/or strengths? 

E. For the most part, information is published by EIA in U.S. customary units, e.g., cubic feet of natural gas, short
tons of coal, and barrels of oil. Would you prefer to see EIA publish more information in metric units, e.g., cubic meters,
metric tons, and kilograms? If yes, please specify what information (e.g., coal production, natural gas consumption,
and crude oil imports), the metric unit(s) of measurement preferred, and in which EIA publication(s) you would like
to see such information. 

EIA is also interested in receiving comments from persons regarding their views on the need for the information contained
in the form EIA-871A (FS), ``Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey, Building Questionnaire (Federal
Supplement)''. 

Comments submitted in response to this notice will be summarized and/or included in the request for OMB approval of
the form; they also will become a matter of public record.

<USDEPT>FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM</USDEPT>





Modification of the Payments System Risk Policy; 
Bankers' Banks, Edge Corporations, 
and Limited-Purpose Trust Companies 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Policy statement.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board has determined to assess a penalty fee on the average daily daylight overdrafts in Federal Reserve accounts
incurred by bankers' banks that do not maintain reserves, Edge and agreement corporations, and limited-purpose
trust companies. The rate for the daylight overdraft penalty fee is equal to the regular daylight overdraft rate applicable
to other institutions plus 100 basis points, quoted on a 24-hour basis, for a 360-day year, and adjusted for the length
of the Fedwire operating day. The penalty fee should create an incentive for institutions that do not have regular
discount window access to avoid incurring daylight overdrafts in Federal Reserve accounts.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Board has modified its payments system risk policy by adopting a daylight overdraft penalty fee. The penalty fee
will be assessed on average daily daylight overdrafts in Federal Reserve accounts incurred by Edge and agreement
corporations,

1

 bankers' banks

2

 that do not maintain reserves, and limited-purpose trust companies. These institutions do not have regular discount
window access. 





The Board anticipates that the penalty fee will provide an incentive for institutions without regular discount window
access to refrain from incurring daylight overdrafts. This incentive will help a Reserve Bank to avoid a situation
where it may be obliged to permit an overnight overdraft or to extend extraordinary discount window credit if an institution
is unable to cover a daylight overdraft by the end of the business day. In addition, should daylight overdrafts be considered
as Federal Reserve extensions of credit, the penalty fee for bankers' banks that do not maintain reserves would reflect
the 

quid pro quo 

policy of reserves for discount window access embodied in the Monetary Control Act of 1980. 


Background


Under the Board's current payments system risk policy, most depository institutions may incur daylight overdrafts
in their Federal Reserve accounts up to a maximum, or cap, that is a multiple of their risk-based capital. Effective
April 14, 1994, the Reserve Banks will assess a fee of 24 basis points (annual rate) on average daily daylight overdrafts.
After full phase-in, expected in 1996, this fee will rise to 60 basis points (annual rate). 
If an institution fails to cover a daylight overdraft by the close of the business day, it may either obtain a discount
window loan (if it has access to the discount window) or carry the overdraft overnight (a practice that is discouraged
by the Federal Reserve). The Reserve Banks charge a penalty fee on overnight overdrafts. Since 1981, the overnight
penalty rate has equalled the higher of 10 percent or the federal funds rate plus 2 percent (annual rate). On February
16, 1994, the Board approved a new overnight overdraft penalty rate equal to the federal funds rate plus 4 percent,
with no floor. When an institution incurs an overnight overdraft, it must make up for any reserve or clearing account
deficiency by holding make-up balances on another night. 
The Federal Reserve Act exempts bankers' banks from reserve requirements,

3

 and Regulation A explicitly excludes bankers' banks from regular discount window access.

4

 Nevertheless, the Board has permitted bankers' banks to have access to the discount window if they choose to maintain
reserves voluntarily. Bankers' banks that maintain reserves may establish a cap and incur daylight overdrafts under
the payments system risk policy to the same extent and subject to the same fees as depository institutions. To address
the risks arising from daylight overdrafts and to avoid the extension of overnight credit to institutions with no
discount window access, current policy provides that bankers' banks that do not maintain reserves should refrain
from incurring daylight overdrafts. If such institutions do incur daylight overdrafts, however, they are required
to post collateral to cover the overdrafts. 





Edge corporations are subject to reserve requirements, but do not have access to the discount window on the same basis
as depository institutions. Instead, Edge corporations generally are funded by their parent depository institutions,
which have discount window access. Current policy permits Edge corporations to establish a cap and to incur overdrafts
within that cap, provided that they post collateral to cover the overdrafts. Edge corporations also may incur book-entry
securities overdrafts above their cap, provided the overdrafts are collateralized. 
Limited-purpose trust companies may become members of the Federal Reserve, at the Board's discretion, subject to
conditions the Board may prescribe pursuant to the Act. As a general matter, member limited-purpose trust companies
do not accept reservable deposits, do not have regular discount window access, and may not incur daylight overdrafts.

Previous Board Actions


In May 1990, the Board proposed to levy a penalty fee, at a rate equal to the overnight overdraft penalty rate, on the
maximum daily daylight overdrafts incurred by bankers' banks that do not maintain reserves and Edge corporations
(55 FR 22086, May 31, 1990). In August 1993, the Board adopted a modified version of the 1990 proposal, but sought further
comment on the rate at which the daylight overdraft penalty fee would be assessed (58 FR 44672, August 24, 1993). The
policy adopted by the Board in 1993 provides that the daylight overdraft penalty fee will be levied on the daily average,
rather than maximum, daylight overdraft of institutions that do not have regular discount window access. The Board
also determined to apply the daylight overdraft penalty fee to limited-purpose trust companies as well as bankers'
banks that do not maintain reserves and Edge corporations. The Board retained the requirement that, in the event a
bankers' bank, Edge corporation, or limited-purpose trust company incurs a daylight overdraft, the overdraft should
be collateralized.

5

 Reserve Banks will have the ability to waive the penalty fee if, for example, the overdraft resulted from a Reserve
Bank error. 




The daylight penalty rate proposed in 1993 was equal to the overnight penalty rate plus the federal funds rate (e.g.,
given a 10 percent overnight penalty rate and a 3 percent federal funds rate, the daylight penalty rate would be 13 percent),
adjusted for the length of the Fedwire operating day. The Board proposed the addition of the federal funds rate to make
the daylight penalty rate more comparable to the overnight penalty rate. As noted above, institutions are required
to make up any reserve or clearing account deficiency resulting from an overnight overdraft, thereby incurring a
loss of interest earnings on the make-up funds. Rather than instituting a make-up requirement for daylight overdrafts
subject to the penalty fee, the Board proposed that the daylight overdraft penalty rate include a factor to account
for the cost of holding make-up funds. 
The Board also proposed to adjust the manner in which the penalty fee is calculated to make it similar to the calculation
of the ``regular'' daylight overdraft fee. The regular daylight overdraft fee is quoted on a 24-hour basis, for a 360-day
year, and adjusted for the length of the Fedwire operating day. This adjustment maintains a constant per-minute charge
in the event that Fedwire hours change. The Board proposed that the daylight penalty rate be quoted on a similar basis.
Under the 1993 proposal, assuming an overnight overdraft rate of 10 percent and a federal funds rate of 3 percent, the
annual 24-hour daylight penalty rate would be 22.3 percent, adjusted to 9.3 percent for a 10-hour Fedwire operating
day. 


Daylight Overdraft Penalty Rate Adopted by the Board


The Board believes that it is appropriate to retain a relatively high overnight penalty rate (i.e., greater than the
federal funds rate) to provide a strong incentive for all depository institutions to avoid overnight overdrafts.
However, a daylight penalty rate tied to the overnight rate would also be relatively high, perhaps higher than necessary
to provide an incentive for institutions to avoid daylight overdrafts. Therefore, the daylight overdraft penalty
rate adopted by the Board is tied to the regular daylight overdraft rate, rather then the overnight penalty rate. 
The daylight overdraft penalty rate adopted by the Board is equal to the regular Federal Reserve daylight overdraft
rate plus 100 basis points. The annual daylight penalty rate will equal 124 basis points as of April 14, 1994, rising
to 160 basis points when the regular daylight overdraft fee is fully phased in. The daylight penalty rate, like the
regular daylight rate, will be adjusted to take account of the length of the Fedwire operating day, yielding a rate
of 52 basis points as of April 14, 1994 (given a 10-hour Fedwire day), and rising to 67 basis points after full phase-in
of the regular daylight fee. There is no deductible associated with the daylight overdraft penalty fee. In addition,
the Board has set a minimum fee of $25 for any two-week period in which a penalty fee is assessed (i.e., any fee greater
than zero and less than $25 over a two-week period would be rounded up to $25).

Summary of and Responses to Comments on 1993 Proposal



The Board received 28 comments on the proposed penalty fee calculation. The comments were distributed as follows:




 


The corporate credit union commenters generally expressed similar views regarding the proposal. They opposed both
the concept of the daylight overdraft penalty and the size of the proposed rate. These commenters contended that the
Board did not present a legally sustainable case as to why the same daylight overdraft rate should not be imposed on
all institutions. They also asserted that the Federal Reserve Act does not authorize a penalty fee for corporate credit
unions. 

The corporate credit union commenters, as well as the National Credit Union Administration, maintained that one
of the purposes of the proposed penalty fee appeared to be to penalize those bankers' banks that do not maintain reserves.
They argued that it is unwarranted and contrary to the letter and spirit of the Monetary Control Act (MCA) for the Board
to attempt to reduce the equality of treatment among users of Federal Reserve services by assessing corporate credit
unions a penalty fee for daylight overdrafts. 

Five commenters, including a bank trade association, a bank holding company, and a commercial bankers' bank, agreed
that the MCA does not require the Federal Reserve to treat daylight credit as a service to which depository institutions
should have equal access. Two of these commenters stated that charging the same rate for all daylight overdrafts would
give an unfair competitive advantage to those institutions that do not maintain reserves. 

The legislative history of the MCA indicates that Congress intended bankers' banks to have access to Federal Reserve
payment services despite the fact that they do not maintain reserves, but also indicates that the access to Federal
Reserve services was opened up to depository institutions in general because they all were to be subject to reserve
requirements.

6

 The Board believes that, when implementing a fee for daylight overdrafts incurred through use of Federal Reserve
payments services, it is reasonable to establish different rates for institutions that maintain reserves and those
that do not. The language of the MCA supports this distinction, by explicitly providing that the Board may impose balances
``sufficient for clearing purposes'' as a requirement for access to Federal Reserve services. By including this
provision, Congress recognized that certain institutions with access to Federal Reserve services may not hold reserves
at the Reserve Bank and may be subject to terms that would account for that fact. 





The corporate credit union commenters also stated that the Board has not shown how daylight overdrafts incurred by
corporate credit unions differ from those incurred by commercial banks and other depository institutions. Many
of these commenters cited the Board's 1989 overdraft survey, which showed that corporate credit unions incurred
only 0.18 percent of the total amount of daylight overdrafts incurred. The corporate credit unions, as well as an Edge
corporation, stated that a penalty incentive is not necessary, as these institutions rarely incur daylight overdrafts.
The commenters also stated that corporate credit unions do not incur overnight overdrafts, and therefore there is
no evidence that a daylight penalty fee is necessary to prevent overnight overdrafts. 

The Board believes there is a fundamental difference between overdrafts incurred by institutions that have access
to Federal Reserve credit and those that do not. Even though corporate credit union overdrafts constitute only a small
percentage of the total daylight overdrafts in Federal Reserve accounts, the Board believes that these institutions
should not receive any daylight credit from the Federal Reserve. On the other hand, the Board allows depository institutions
with discount window access to incur limited daylight overdrafts. The daylight overdraft penalty fee reflects this
difference. 

The corporate credit unions and the National Credit Union Administration argued that the proposed penalty fee is
excessive for the purposes of discouraging daylight overdrafts. These commenters also noted that the Board has stated
that even the regular daylight overdraft fee of 60 basis points (adjusted to 25 basis points given a 10-hour Fedwire
day) will provide an incentive for depository institutions to reduce daylight overdrafts. The corporate credit
union commenters, as well as a bank trade association, also noted that the 10 percent floor in the current overnight
penalty rate, to which the proposed daylight penalty rate was tied, yields an anomalous result as the federal funds
rate declines. One commenter suggested that a daylight penalty rate 100 basis points above the federal funds rate
should provide more than sufficient incentive for corporate credit unions to avoid daylight overdrafts. Four commenters,
including a bank holding company and a commercial bankers' bank, supported the Board's proposed penalty fee calculation
as equitable and sufficient to deter daylight overdrafts.

As noted above, the daylight overdraft penalty rate adopted by the Board will not be linked to the overnight penalty
rate, but rather to the regular daylight rate applicable to depository institutions. The daylight penalty rate will
be computed using the regular daylight rate plus a penalty add-on of 100 basis points, which is more proportional to
the regular daylight rate. This policy will allow the Board to maintain a relatively high overnight rate that will
provide a strong incentive to avoid overnight overdrafts, while maintaining a relatively low daylight penalty rate
that will be less of a cost burden on affected institutions yet high enough to effect behavioral changes by institutions
to avoid daylight overdrafts altogether. The Board may consider raising the penalty rate if such behavioral changes
do not occur. Also, if an intraday market rate were to develop in the future, the Board may base the daylight penalty
on that rate. The daylight penalty rate will be adjusted to account for the length of the Fedwire operating day (multiplied
by 10/24, given the current 10-hour Fedwire day), as is the regular daylight overdraft rate. 

A bank trade association recognized the Board's intent to prevent institutions that do not have regular discount
window access from obtaining credit from the Federal Reserve, but stated that a penalty-oriented approach could
result in risk-shifting from the Federal Reserve to the private sector, rather than reducing overall payment system
risk. 

The intent of the penalty fee is to induce institutions to manage their accounts so as to avoid overdrafts, this reducing
overall risk. The Board recognizes, however, that some risk-shifting would occur if institutions affected by the
penalty fee move their payments business from the Federal Reserve to the private sector. Presumably, however, the
risk would be shifted to depository institutions that have discount window access and thus could obtain Federal Reserve
credit to cover daylight or overnight overdrafts in their Federal Reserve accounts. 

Several corporate credit union commenters stated that the proposed penalty fee formula unfairly penalizes corporate
credit unions by not allowing a deductible. The commenters noted that the Board's stated purpose of the deductible
for depository institutions was to refrain from charging a large number of institutions who present small amount
of risk and that this reasoning should also apply to corporate credit unions. One commenter suggested that, as an alternative
to a deductible, the Board allow a one-hour grace period before assessing a penalty fee. 

The Board established a deductible for the regular daylight overdraft fee to account for Reserve Bank error and computer
downtime. The deductible also provides a minimal amount of free intraday credit to depository institutions. The
Board does not believe that it is appropriate to supply free intraday credit to institutions that do not have discount
window access, and thus has not provided a deductible or grace period for the daylight penalty fee. Reserve Banks will
be able to waive penalty fees that result from Reserve Bank error or computer malfunction. 

Two commenters suggested that no penalty fee be imposed until the Federal Reserve's book-entry securities system
is redesigned to allow receiver control of securities deliveries. These commenters stated that the current system's
design forces unanticipated daylight overdrafts and that the penalty fee punishes certain institutions for a shortfall
in the Federal Reserve's book-entry securities transfer system. 

Although institutions that receive securities versus payment over Fedwire do not have operational control over
the timing of the transaction, they often know the approximate size and time of incoming securities deliveries. The
Board believes it is appropriate to require institutions without access to Federal Reserve credit to manage their
account so as to avoid securities-related overdrafts. The Federal Reserve is currently studying new service capabilities
that would permit receivers of securities to control the use of securities-related intraday Federal Reserve credit.


An Edge corporation requested that, if a penalty fee is imposed, the Board clarify that an Edge corporation could pledge
collateral to support regular discount window borrowing similar to the policy allowing bankers' banks to voluntarily
maintain reserves, thereby allowing such Edge corporations to pay only the regular daylight overdraft fee rather
than the penalty fee. This commenter also suggested that the Board should allow a parent bank to guarantee the daylight
overdraft position of, or substitute itself for, an Edge corporation, similar to practice under CHIPS rules. This
practice would allow a Reserve Bank to combine the daylight position of an Edge corporation and its parent.

The Board believes that collateral and pricing serve two related but separate purposes. Although collateral limits
Reserve Bank risk, its purpose is to make discount window loans to book-entry securities overdrafters feasible during
periods of operational difficulty. The daylight overdraft penalty fee is designed to create economic incentives
to eliminate the use of daylight credit by institutions without regular discount window access. Their lack of access
to the discount window suggests that Edge corporations should be subject to the same policy as bankers' banks that
do not maintain reserves. The policy statement notes that the parent of an Edge or agreement corporation could fund
its subsidiary during the day over Fedwire and/or the parent could substitute itself for its subsidiary on private
networks. Such an approach by the parent could both reduce systemic risk exposure and permit the Edge or agreement
corporation to continue to service its customers. 


Competitive Impact Analysis 


The Board assesses the competitive impact of changes that have a substantial effect on payments system participants.

7

 Under this analysis, the Board determines whether the change would have a direct and material adverse effect on the
ability of other service providers to compete effectively with the Federal Reserve in providing similar services.






Many corporate credit unions have argued that the daylight overdraft penalty fee would put them at a competitive disadvantage
vis-a-vis other payments system participants, particularly in book-entry security settlement and safekeeping
services. These commenters asserted that daylight overdraft penalty fees would drive corporate credit unions out
of the securities services and would force credit unions to do business with other service providers. Such other service
providers could be private institutions, such as commercial banks, or credit unions could choose to establish accounts
directly with a Federal Reserve Bank. 
The Board does not believe that its policy adversely affects the ability of corporate credit unions to compete with
the Reserve Banks in providing payments services. The policy places controls on the use of the Federal Reserve Banks'
funds and book-entry transfer services, which are consistent with controls used in private clearing and settlement
systems. Corporate credit unions have the ability to establish caps and collateralize book-entry securities overdrafts
if they voluntarily maintain reserves, as commercial banks are required to do. By voluntarily maintaining reserves,
the corporate credit unions would avoid the penalty fees that, according to their comments, would cause their customer
credit unions to go to the Reserve Banks or elsewhere for payments services. In addition, the penalty rate adopted
by the Board is significantly lower than the rates proposed in 1990 and 1993 and will result in a lower cost burden on
corporate credit unions vis-a-vis their competitors. 


Policy Statement 


The Board has adopted the following to replace part (I)(D)(4) of its ``Federal Reserve System Policy Statement on
Payments System Risk'' under the headings ``I. Federal Reserve Policy'', ``D. Net Debit Caps'', and ``4. Special
Situations,'' effective April 14, 1994: 
4. 

Special Situations. 

Special risks are presented by the participation on Fedwire of Edge and agreement corporations, bankers' banks that
are not subject to reserve requirements, limited-purpose trust companies, and institutions that have been assigned
a cap of zero by their Reserve Banks. Most of these institutions lack regular discount window access. In developing
its policy for these institutions, the Board has sought to balance the goal of reducing and managing risk in the payments
system, including risk to the Federal Reserve, with that of minimizing the adverse effects on the payments operations
of these institutions. 
Regular access to the Federal Reserve discount window generally is available to institutions that are subject to
reserve requirements. If an institution that is not subject to reserve requirements and thus does not have regular
discount window access were to incur a daylight overdraft, the Federal Reserve may face the necessity of extending
overnight credit to that institution if the daylight overdraft is not covered by the end of the business day. This credit
would be contrary to the 

quid pro quo 

of reserves for discount window access established in the Federal Reserve Act and Board regulations. In addition,
the Board expects that assessing a fee for daylight overdrafts could lead to an intraday funds market, similar to the
current overnight funds market. As daylight credit begins to have significant value, daylight overdrafts in accounts
at the Federal Reserve will begin to appear more and more like overnight extensions of credit by Reserve Banks. Thus,
institutions that do not have regular access to the discount window should not incur either overnight overdrafts
or daylight overdrafts in their Federal Reserve accounts.

As set out below, Edge and agreement corporations, bankers' banks that are not subject to reserve requirements, and
limited-purpose trust companies are subject to a daylight overdraft penalty fee levied against the average daily
daylight overdraft incurred by the institution. The annual rate for the daylight overdraft penalty fee is equal to
the annual rate applicable to the daylight overdrafts of other depository institutions (i.e., the rate set forth
in section (I)(B)) 

plus

 100 basis points, adjusted to take account of the Fedwire operating day (multiplied by the fraction of the day Fedwire
is scheduled to operate). The daily daylight penalty rate is calculated by dividing the annual penalty rate by 360.

The penalty fee applies to the institution's average daily daylight overdraft in accounts at the Federal Reserve.
The average daily overdraft is calculated by dividing the sum of the negative Federal Reserve account balances at
the end of each minute of the scheduled Fedwire operating day (with positive balances set to zero) by the total number
of minutes in the scheduled Fedwire operating day. The penalty fee is charged in lieu of, not in addition to, the daylight
overdraft fee described in section (I)(B) and is effective April 14, 1994. 
Overnight overdrafts for these institutions are treated similarly to overnight overdrafts of other depository
institutions. 
a. 

Edge and agreement corporations

.

9

 Edge and agreement corporations should refrain from incurring daylight overdrafts in their reserve or clearing
accounts. In the event that any daylight overdrafts occur, the Edge or agreement corporation must post collateral
to cover the overdrafts. In addition to posting collateral, the Edge or agreement corporation would be subject to
a daylight overdraft penalty fee levied against the average daily daylight overdrafts incurred by the institution,
as described above. 




This policy reflects the lack of access of these institutions to the discount window and the possibility that the parent
of an Edge or agreement corporation may be unable or unwilling to cover its subsidiary's overdraft on a timely basis.
The Board notes that the parent of an Edge or agreement corporation could fund its subsidiary during the day over Fedwire
and/or the parent could substitute itself for its subsidiary on private networks. Such an approach by the parent could
both reduce systemic risk exposure and permit the Edge or agreement corporation to continue to service its customers.
Edge and agreement corporation subsidiaries of foreign banks are treated in the same manner as their domestically-owned
counterparts. 
b. 

Bankers' banks

.

10

 Bankers' banks are exempt from reserve requirements and do not have regular access to the discount window. They do,
however, have access to Federal Reserve payments services. The Board's policy provides that bankers' banks should
refrain from incurring overdrafts and post collateral to cover any overdrafts they do incur. In addition to posting
collateral, a bankers' bank would be subject to a daylight overdraft penalty fee levied against the average daily
daylight overdrafts incurred by the institution, as described above. 




The Board's policy for bankers' banks reflects the need to protect Reserve Banks from potential losses resulting
from daylight overdrafts incurred by bankers' banks. The policy also reflects the fact that some bankers' banks do
not incur the costs of maintaining reserves as do other depository institutions and do not have regular access to the
discount window and the similarity between overdrafts and discount window credit. 
Bankers' banks may voluntarily waive their exemption from reserve requirements, thus gaining access to the discount
window. Such bankers' banks would be free to establish caps and would be subject to the same policy as other depository
institutions. The policy set out in this section applies only to those bankers' banks that have not waived their exemption
from reserve requirements.

c. 

Limited-purpose trust companies.



10A

 The Federal Reserve Act permits the Board to grant Federal Reserve membership to limited-purpose trust companies
subject to conditions the Board may prescribe pursuant to the Act. As a general matter, member limited-purpose trust
companies do not accept reservable deposits, do not have regular discount window access, and may not incur daylight
overdrafts.




Limited-purpose trust companies are subject to the same daylight overdraft penalty fees as other institutions that
do not maintain reserves and do not have regular discount window access. Limited-purpose trust companies should
refrain from incurring overdrafts and should post collateral to cover any overdrafts they do incur. In addition to
posting collateral, a limited-purpose trust company would be subject to a daylight overdraft penalty fee levied
against the average daily daylight overdrafts incurred by the institution, as described above.
d. 

Zero-cap depository institutions. 

Some depository institutions have caps of zero that are imposed by Reserve Banks because of the institutions' financially
troubled status or failure to comply with the Board's payments system risk policy or because the institution itself
requested a zero cap. Regardless of whether it has access to the discount window, if a depository institution on which
a Reserve Bank has imposed, or that has adopted, a zero cap incurs a funds-transfer-related overdraft, the Reserve
Bank would counsel the institution and may monitor the institution's activity in real-time and reject or pend any
Fedwire funds transfer instruction that would cause an overdraft. Because the timing of book-entry securities transfers
are not fully within the control of the receiving depository institution, the Board will allow depository institutions
with caps of zero that have access to the discount window to continue to incur book-entry overdrafts, but will require
that such overdrafts be collateralized even if they are infrequent and modest.
By order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 17, 1994.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board has approved an expansion of Fedwire funds transfer operating hours for the public policy benefits that
will result through the use, over the long term, of the service by banks individually and through clearing groups.
The Board believes that the potential, long run benefits from offering final payment capabilities that will strengthen
interbank settlements outweigh the costs to the Federal Reserve of expanding the Fedwire funds transfer service
operating hours. Over time, longer Fedwire funds transfer hours can contribute to reductions in Herstatt risk through
innovations in payment and settlement practices. As well, the Fedwire funds transfer service will become a tested
tool for managing settlement risk early in the day during times of financial stress. 


Specifically, the Board is announcing that the hours of operation of the Fedwire on-line funds transfer service will
be expanded to 18 hours per day, opening at 12:30 a.m. e.t. and closing at 6:30 p.m. e.t., five days per week (Monday through
Friday) to become effective in early 1997. A specific implementation date will be announced approximately one year
in advance of the effective date. Intraday credit from the Federal Reserve will be available during expanded hours
on the same terms that it would be provided from 8:30 a.m. e.t. to 6:30 p.m. e.t. Further expansion of the funds transfer
operating day could be considered following several years of experience with the new schedule. 
In addition, the Board is announcing that current Fedwire securities transfer operating hours will not be expanded
until after the implementation of new service capabilities that permit receivers of securities to control the use
of securities-related intraday Federal Reserve credit. Public comment will be sought in 1994 on new service capabilities
that permit users the option to participate in expanded securities transfer service operating hours and to control
the receipt of securities that are delivered to them during expanded hours. This request for public comment could
be combined with a request for views on the use of similar service features during regular securities transfer operating
hours. In the case of expanded or regular hours, but especially in the latter case, a key issue concerns the effects
of such changes on the liquidity and efficiency of the U.S. government securities market.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The growth in financial market activity worldwide, and in foreign exchange market activity in particular, has heightened
attention and sensitivity to settlement and systemic risks. Market participants, as well as regulators, are particularly
concerned about current methods for settling multi-currency, cross-border transactions. Data published by the
Bank for International Settlements (BIS) indicate that the daily average value of global foreign exchange market
activity was approximately $880 billion in April 1992.

1

 The interbank payments generated by foreign exchange transactions account for a substantial portion of the total
value of payments settled in many of the industrialized countries. 




The most significant settlement risks presented by foreign exchange or other multi-currency contracts involve
the risk that a counterparty to such contracts will pay one currency and not receive payment in the contra-currency.
Concerns about such risks have been prominent since the failure of Bankhaus Herstatt in 1974, when foreign exchange
counterparties of Herstatt made Deutsche mark payments to Herstatt to settle foreign exchange contracts, but did
not receive contra-payments in U.S. dollars before the closure of the bank, which occurred at the end of the German
banking day. The settlement risk associated with the sequential payment of currencies, and involving the potential
loss of the full principal amount of foreign exchange contracts, has come to be known as Herstatt risk. 
Despite the rapid growth of the foreign exchange markets since 1974, foreign exchange contracts are currently settled
much as they were at the time of the Herstatt episode. For example, in the case of yen-U.S. dollar foreign exchange contracts,
the yen amounts due on a particular banking day would be paid and settled in Tokyo before the start of that banking day
in New York. U.S. dollar contra-payments would likely be initiated early in the U.S. banking day and settled with finality
at the end of the U.S. banking day, some 18 hours after the close of business in Tokyo. Similarly, payments in most European
currencies would be made and settled hours before U.S. dollar payments are either initiated or settled with finality.
The overall magnitude of Herstatt risks associated with these settlement delays has grown commensurately with the
rapid growth in foreign exchange and other multi-currency transactions. 
Over the past few years, there has been a series of central bank studies aimed at heightening the understanding and
awareness of risks in various international payment and settlement processes. These studies have also provided
a common framework for evaluating both new and enhanced interbank settlement arrangements, as well as changes in
central bank services, that might be designed to reduce and manage better Herstatt risk. Working groups from the G-10
central banks have published reports, under the aegis of the BIS, on such topics as minimum standards for interbank
netting systems, delivery-versus-payment (DVP) in securities settlement systems, and options for enhanced central
bank payment and settlement services with respect to multi-currency and cross-border transactions.

2

 




The recent report on central bank services, for example, pointed to the significant expansion of the operating hours
for large-value payment systems as an important central bank option that could contribute to reductions in risk in
settlement practices. Longer hours for central bank large-value payment systems would provide the banking sector

3

 with additional flexibility in developing innovative methods to reduce time delays between the settlement of the
different legs of foreign exchange contracts. Such innovations might include the development of delivery-versus-payment
techniques, in which one currency is paid (settled) when and only when the contra-currency is also paid (settled),
either by individual correspondent banks or by groups of banks that are members of clearing arrangements. Over the
long run, such arrangements could substantially reduce Herstatt risks in the settlement of multi-currency contracts.








Even without the development of delivery-versus-payment techniques, the possibility of greater harmonization
of the timing of currency settlements based on longer operating hours of central bank large-value payment systems
could help reduce time delays and risks in settlements. 


Significant advances in information technology have been introduced to banking and financial markets in recent
years. The level of automation and sophistication of banking systems has increased rapidly and likely will continue
to do so for some time to come. In this environment, and particularly during a time of increasing volumes, values, and
sophistication of financial transactions, advanced technology needs to be applied to payment systems so that these
systems can provide for both high efficiency and low risk in the settlement of all kinds of economic transactions.
The adoption and implementation of this kind of technology, however, requires significant lead times and careful,
advanced planning.

Against this background, and following public comment on the Board's October 1992 proposal to open the Fedwire funds
transfer service two hours earlier in the morning, the Board directed a staff task force (Fedwire Study Group, see
Appendix A of this notice) to discuss the issues involving longer Fedwire hours with representatives of commercial
banks and other interested members of the public and to analyze the associated public policy concerns. These discussions
helped clarify the issues relating to the expansion of Fedwire hours and the difficulties in devising new techniques
to reduce settlement risks. 

Consideration of the appropriate operating hours for the Fedwire funds and securities transfer services must, in
the first instance, take account of the Federal Reserve's responsibilities as a central bank to support final interbank
settlement. The Federal Reserve Banks provide final interbank payment and settlement services to the banking system
through the transfer of banks' balances (reserves and clearing balances) on deposit with Reserve Banks. These balances_also
called central bank money_are free of default risk and are an integral part of monetary arrangements for the U.S. dollar.
``Instantaneous'' intraday final payment in risk-free, central bank money is delivered operationally to banks
through the Fedwire funds and securities transfer services. The benefits of such instantaneous intraday final payment
in central bank money are, in turn, available to the public through the payment services provided by banks to their
customers. To achieve this level of finality, Fedwire and similar sophisticated central bank payment services rely
on a processing technique known as real-time gross settlement. In fact, most G-10 central banks currently provide,
or are in the process of introducing, real-time gross settlement payment services, along the lines of the Fedwire
funds transfer service.

4

 (See Appendix B of this notice for a discussion of the structure of large-value interbank payment arrangements.)






The following two public policy objectives can be stated for the Fedwire funds and securities transfer services.
These public policy objectives are useful as a guide to analysis of expanded operating hours and were used by the Fedwire
Study Group to set the stage for discussions held with the public. Fedwire should: 

(1) Provide a means that can be used to enhance the safety and efficiency of U.S. dollar settlement arrangements, including
arrangements that rely on interbank settlement of netted positions, particularly during periods of financial stress.


(2) Respond to the needs of both existing and emerging financial markets, including overseas markets, which depend
on the U.S. dollar and are increasingly reliant on state-of-the-art technology. 

Members of the Fedwire Study Group met with representatives of various commercial banks, broker-dealers, and clearing
organizations, and with a group of corporate treasurers to discuss current problems in payment and settlement arrangements.
The Fedwire Study Group encountered a diversity of views within the financial industry, and even within individual
organizations, regarding approaches to managing settlement risk and the use of Fedwire to obtain real-time gross
settlement in central bank money outside of current operating hours.

<TEXT>
 

The diversity of views is, in part, related to the functional responsibilities of the individuals interviewed. For
example, a number of persons with credit management responsibilities in banks and other financial firms tended to
favor expanded Fedwire hours based on the potential benefits associated with access to final, that is, irrevocable
and unconditional, settlement using central bank money_notably, potential reductions in counterparty and systemic
risk. In contrast, individuals with responsibilities for transaction processing services and information technology
within banking organizations tended not to favor an expansion of Fedwire operating hours because, for example, (1)
they could not identify customer demand for longer Fedwire hours, (2) there would be costs and operational challenges
associated with ``off hour'' services, and (3) competitive responses by rival banking organizations would compel
them to undertake product and operational changes. In addition, many of those interviewed also pointed to the charging
of fees for Federal Reserve intraday credit as creating a disincentive to the use of Fedwire funds and securities transfer
services during both regular and expanded hours of operation. 

A main concern raised during the meetings held by the Fedwire Study Group, particularly by executives and senior credit
managers, was that of settlement risk in foreign exchange dealings, or Herstatt risk. Those expressing concern noted,
however, that while expanded Fedwire funds transfer operating hours might be useful as a component part of some new
approaches to controlling Herstatt risk, without changes in overall settlement practices, longer hours would not
be able to make a major contribution to risk reduction. Further, changes in risk management techniques and settlement
practices would need to take account of a variety of operational and financial factors for different currencies.
Some of these issues are discussed further in appendix C of this notice. 

Given that there is a reduced tolerance for temporal risk in settlements, especially_but not solely_settlement
of multi-currency transactions, the Board anticipates that efforts to control settlement risk will continue, with
or without the support of central banks. The Board believes, however, that final, real-time gross settlement through
Fedwire should play an important part in market efforts to control risk more effectively. As discussed earlier, final
settlements in central bank money are free of default risk and, as a result, settlement in central bank money provides
the highest possible degree of certainty and liquidity in interbank settlements. 

The routine availability of Fedwire on an expanded schedule will add final interbank payment capabilities that the
markets, the Federal Reserve, and other federal regulatory agencies recognize as being particularly important
during periods of financial stress. Only by becoming familiar with the use of expanded Fedwire will banks be prepared
operationally and procedurally to use expanded final payment capabilities effectively. Over time, as the availability
and use of expanded Fedwire capabilities becomes more routine, operating procedures for using Fedwire earlier in
the day will become well tested and integrated into banks' operations and contingency planning. 

In addition, expanding Fedwire operating hours will eliminate an operational barrier that stifles potentially
important innovation in privately-provided payment and settlement services. Expansion of Fedwire operating hours
will provide opportunities for market participants to experiment with the use of real-time gross settlement to meet
a variety of market needs. New bank services and settlement arrangements based on real-time gross settlement will
have the potential to reduce significantly banks' own and their customers' settlement risks in the foreign exchange
and other markets.

5

 A particular application could be the development of delivery-versus-payment settlement techniques either for
individual foreign exchange transactions or for obligations arising from netting arrangements. 





A Federal Reserve initiative to expand Fedwire funds transfer operating hours also demonstrates a long-term commitment
to increasing the availability of real-time gross settlement services in the international financial system. The
Federal Reserve is taking a leadership role in the international financial community in seeking to stimulate new
or enhanced central bank services to facilitate cross-border, multi-currency payments and settlements. By expanding
the operating hours of Fedwire, the Federal Reserve will make it possible for banks to settle the U.S. dollar, with
finality using central bank money, during the banking and trading days of major international financial centers
in Europe and the Far East.

6

 Such a Federal Reserve initiative looks to private sector banking organizations to develop improved multi-currency
services and settlement arrangements, in some cases relying on Fedwire. 





Finally, a clearly stated Federal Reserve policy regarding Fedwire operating hours provides the certainty and stability
banks have indicated that they need to develop their own business and technology plans. This approach to communicating
Federal Reserve policy was requested both in public comments on the Board's October 1992 proposal and in meetings
with representatives of the industry held by the Fedwire Study Group. As noted here, expanded Fedwire funds transfer
operating hours are announced three years in advance of implementation. Banks will have a clear understanding of
the Federal Reserve's intentions with respect to its operating hours and could use the lead time to incorporate the
expanded hours into their strategic plans for payment services and supporting technical systems.

Fedwire on-line funds transfer operating hours will be expanded to open at 12:30 a.m. e.t. (5:30 a.m. G.m.t. and 2:30
p.m. Tokyo time) to support strengthened, interbank settlement for domestic and cross-border markets. This precedes
the opening of the current European banking day by about three hours and overlaps with current payment system and money
market hours in Tokyo by about two and one-half hours. This overlap of payment system hours could increase further
if, in the future, the operating hours of other national payment systems were expanded. 

The closing time for the Fedwire funds transfer service will remain at 6:30 p.m. e.t. (11:30 p.m. G.m.t. and 8:30 a.m.
Tokyo time), in order not to delay inordinately the calculation of U.S. dollar positions by U.S. banks providing dollar
clearing services to clients operating in the Asian markets, or to disrupt domestic money management. Further, keeping
the closing time at 6:30 p.m. e.t. will not disturb the reserve management operations of the large number of smaller
U.S. banks that are not active internationally and that are unlikely to participate in an expanded Fedwire operating
day. 

The Federal Reserve's estimated incremental costs to operate the funds transfer service from 12:30 a.m. e.t. to 6:30
p.m. e.t. will be roughly $2.5 to $4.0 million per year, or about 3 to 5 percent of the total cost of providing the service
in 1993. While the operational costs incurred by banks using Fedwire during the expanded operating period are difficult
to estimate, such costs would be incurred entirely voluntarily. Banks could choose to remain closed during the expanded
operating period and thus forego any additional operating costs. 

Further, an 18-hour day (beginning at 12:30 a.m. e.t. and closing at 6:30 p.m. e.t.) provides an adequate six-hour
quiet period within which banks can perform end-of-day processing and provides for contingency situations. It also
provides for a definite period for measuring reserve positions, a requirement for the conduct of monetary policy.
There are some other minor issues posed by an 18-hour Fedwire funds transfer day that are discussed in appendix C of
this notice. 

With respect to Fedwire securities transfer operating hours, under current DVP arrangements, banks do not have the
capability to control the timing of deliveries of securities and associated debits to their funds accounts. Accordingly,
banks have limited control over the effect of securities-related debits on their funds positions and their use of
Federal Reserve securities-related intraday credit. These control limitations could lead to either increased
operating costs or increased use of intraday credit, with accompanying charges, during periods of expanded hours.
(See appendix C of this notice for further discussion.) In contrast to the Fedwire funds transfer service, therefore,
expanding the operating hours of the securities transfer service would likely impose unavoidable costs on a large
number of banks. Thus, the Board believes that it is inadvisable at this time to approve an expansion of the operating
hours for the Fedwire securities transfer service. 



Competitive Impact Analysis



During expanded Fedwire funds transfer operating hours, the Federal Reserve Banks will be providing real-time gross
settlement in central bank money. While this service cannot be duplicated in the private sector, this situation is
no different under expanded operating hours than it is under the existing Fedwire operating hours. Service providers
that provide funds transfer services under a netting arrangement could expand their operating hours to coincide
with Fedwire operating hours; however, only by setting earlier settlement time(s) and settling through Fedwire
could these organizations provide risk-free central bank money earlier in the day to their participants. Service
providers that provide real-time gross settlement funds transfer services across their own books could not solely
backstop these transactions with central bank money and, thus, could be reliant on their own capital and credit standing
to assure participants of final settlement. Again, this situation is no different under expanded operating hours
than it is under normal Fedwire operating hours.

Appendix B_Structure of Large-Value Interbank Payment Arrangements



Most large-value, domestic interbank payments are currently made via the transfer of money balances on the books
of the Federal Reserve Banks through the Fedwire system. Fedwire is the large-value payment system operated by the
Federal Reserve Banks for the transfer of funds and delivery of book-entry (electronic) securities against payment.
Fedwire is a real-time gross settlement system that settles transfers immediately on a transaction-by-transaction
basis. The Fedwire funds transfer service is a credit transfer process. That is, a bank sends a funds transfer to the
Federal Reserve instructing the Federal Reserve to debit its account for a specified amount and to credit the account
of another bank. In 1993, the daily average value of transfers originated over the Fedwire funds transfer system was
about $824 billion. 

In contrast, the Fedwire securities transfer service, which is the principal means for transferring and settling
U.S. government securities,
 is a debit transfer process that permits the seller of the securities to send a transfer that will result in the Federal
Reserve withdrawing funds from the account of the receiver of the securities transfer. The Fedwire securities transfer
process is based on the delivery-versus-payment (DVP) principle, whereby the final transfer of securities from
the seller to the buyer (delivery) occurs at the same time as final transfer of funds from the buyer to the seller (payment).
Fedwire achieves such simultaneous settlement by treating the instruction initiated by the seller as both an instruction
to deliver securities to the buyer and an instruction to debit payment from the buyer's reserve or clearing account.
In 1993, the daily average value of transfers originated through the Fedwire securities transfer system was roughly
$580 billion. 





Banks may also provide settlement services to their customers through the final transfer of balances across their
books. In addition, banks also use multilateral clearing and settlement arrangements to meet some of their large-value
payment needs. In such arrangements, including the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS) operated by
the New York Clearing House, payment instructions may be entered into a netting system throughout a pre-determined
clearing cycle and each participant's net position vis-a-vis the other participants is determined on an ongoing
basis throughout the cycle. Settlement for the payment instructions occurs at an agreed upon settlement time. Participants
with net debit obligations may satisfy their obligations by transferring funds on the books of a ``settlement bank.''
Central banks can serve as a ``settlement bank'' for such interbank netting arrangements and, in the case of CHIPS,
this role is performed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In this arrangement, CHIPS settling participants in
a net debit position send Fedwire funds transfers to a settlement account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which,
when fully funded, is the source for payments to participants in net credit positions. In 1993, the daily average value
of transfers originated through the CHIPS system was over $1 trillion.

Appendix C_Issued Associated With Expanded Fedwire Operating Hours


This appendix analyzes issues associated with expanded Fedwire funds and securities transfer operating hours.
The appendix is organized in three parts. First, settlement practices in financial markets are analyzed, with particular
attention to Herstatt risk. Second, the operation of the Fedwire securities transfer delivery-versus-payment
service is analyzed. Finally, other implementation issues associated with expanded Fedwire hours are analyzed.



Settlement Practices in Financial Markets 


The following discussion of settlement practices and risks in financial markets takes into account (1) the integrity
of settlement during times of financial stress, (2) multi-currency, cross-border settlements, (3) domestic corporate
and interbank markets and the needs of the futures markets, and (4) the current availability of bank payment services
on a 24-hour basis. 
Settlement during times of financial stress. Concerns regarding the ability of counterparties to meet their payment
obligations and the certainty of settlement are heightened during times of financial stress. Sudden events that
disrupt markets can increase the risk associated with domestic and, in particular, multi-currency transactions,
and can contribute to uncertainty, payment delays, and market liquidity problems. If such problems are widespread,
systemic risk may be increased substantially. It is during times of stress in the financial markets that the certainty
associated with interbank settlement across the books of the central bank takes on added importance. 
In the past, the Fedwire funds transfer service has been opened early on an ad hoc basis, at short notice, during times
of stress in the financial markets at the request of market participants and regulatory authorities. For example,
the Federal Reserve opened the Fedwire funds transfer service early on the days following the October 1987 stock market
break and the beginning of the Gulf War. Experience has shown, however, that market participants are not prepared
operationally to use facilities, such as Fedwire, when these facilities are made available during ``off-hours''
on an ad hoc basis at short notice. These difficulties suggest that to be most helpful during times of financial stress,
Fedwire should be available in the early morning hours on a more routine basis. 
Multi-currency settlements. With respect to multi-currency settlements, the settlement of a foreign exchange
contract involves the settlement of both currencies involved in the contract, such as the U.S. dollar and the Deutsche
mark or the U.S. dollar and the yen. In such settlements, risk management and efficiency considerations must take
into account payment arrangements in the country of issue for each currency, including the relative intraday timing
of payments and the finality of payment in the respective currencies. Settlement risk is incurred by paying final
funds in one currency before receiving final funds in another currency. As a general matter, the magnitude of settlement
risk in the foreign exchange markets has grown substantially, in large part as a result of a vast expansion of foreign
exchange trading. At the same time, there has been continued reliance on traditional methods of settling trades one
currency at a time with significant delays before related payments and contra-payments become final. 
Because the large U.S. cities are in the western-most time zones of the major financial centers, under current settlement
arrangements for multi-currency transactions, the U.S. dollar is normally the last currency to be settled. The two
charts at the end of this appendix provide information on global time zone relationships and on the operating hours
of selected large-value interbank transfer systems in different countries.

1

 




On an exception basis today, banks may choose to require final payment of the U.S. dollar leg of a multi-currency transaction
either in advance of, or in certain cases simultaneously with, final payment of the contra-currency, as a means to
protect against risk of nonpayment.

2

 Foreign exchange market participants have indicated that such protective measures are taken, for example, in special
cases where counterparties would exceed their U.S. dollar credit lines. Banks, however, find these exception procedures
to be very expensive due to the lack of an established mechanism to effect settlements under these terms (that is, final
U.S. dollar payment before, or simultaneously with, final payment in the other currency). For exception processing,
the parties must negotiate how the related payments are to be made and closely monitor the settlement process to ensure
that the payment sequence unfolds as expected. 




Substantially earlier Fedwire funds transfer service operating hours as well as later payment system hours for other
major currencies will increase the opportunity to achieve simultaneous or near-simultaneous settlements of individual
deals involving the U.S. dollar and European and Asian currencies, where needed. Such settlements might involve
a variety of new institutional designs for settlements, including private correspondent bank DVP services, new
clearing organization procedures, or innovative arrangements that are not readily apparent given current payment
system constraints.

Current initiatives to reduce Herstatt risk in foreign exchange transactions point to the need for greater future
overlap of final interbank settlement facilities in Asia, Europe, and North America. While in the future Asian and
European systems may well be open later during their local banking days, the achievement of a significant overlap
in payment system hours also requires earlier opening hours for U.S. payment systems, especially to achieve overlapping
hours with Asian markets. With such earlier hours, opportunities may increase substantially for more nearly simultaneous
settlements of multi-currency transactions, and associated reductions in Herstatt risk. It should be noted, however,
that although simultaneous or near-simultaneous payment for multi-currency transactions reduces the temporal
dimension of settlement risk, achieving final payment in one currency against a simultaneous, but provisional,
payment in another currency does not eliminate fully Herstatt risk. Therefore, to address fully the problem of controlling
Herstatt risk, it is important that the overlap in operating hours include overlap in systems that provide final settlement
in central bank money.

3

 




Domestic markets. With respect to domestic markets, there are relatively few types of transactions for which immediate
and final payment at a particular time during the day is an absolute requirement. The demand for final payment at a particular
time during the day for corporate customers is currently quite small and is limited to such things as payments to settle
mergers and acquisitions and the distribution of funds from underwritings of securities. In general, because banks
often make funds available to corporate customers before final settlement, corporate customers are largely unaware
of the distinctions between final and provisional payment or when during the day payments are actually settled. Instead,
corporations generally rely on their banks to make decisions regarding how their large-value payments are originated
and received. 
Even in the interbank markets, participants are typically satisfied with same-day settlement for certain types
of transactions. At present, Federal funds contracts do not generally stipulate that payment must be made at or before
a specific time of day other than before the close of the Fedwire funds transfer service. Federal funds contracts are
generally settled using the Fedwire funds transfer system. 
For some futures exchange settlements, the convention today is to accept irrevocable commitments to pay from designated
settlement banks to cover clearing members' settlement obligations prior to the start of the current day's trading,
with the settlement banks actually fulfilling the obligation via Fedwire funds transfers by 10 a.m. e.t. The futures
clearing organizations and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have expressed a desire for settlement
to occur in final funds before the commencement of trading. Such earlier settlement is viewed as reducing risks to
futures exchanges and the financial markets despite some concerns that it would merely shift risks from the clearing
organizations to their settlement banks. Settlement banks would clearly need to manage carefully their own cash
needs earlier in the day in order to make settlement payments at an earlier time, which is not necessary under current
arrangements. 
Within a few years, there may be a demand for later Fedwire funds transfer hours from banks that provide services to
the futures and options markets. This demand could arise from two sources. First, some clearing organizations are
progressively moving toward same-day settlement of margin obligations arising from the current day's trading activity.
Second, some of the exchanges are contemplating longer trading hours for certain of their products. The exchanges
are beginning to incorporate automated trade matching and confirmation systems that will permit timely same-day
calculation of all margin obligations. Indications are that these systems, which will remove a significant obstacle
to same-day settlement, could be widely adopted within three to five years. Longer trading hours, in combination
with the desire for same-day settlement, would argue for a later Fedwire funds transfer service closing time.

To date, there has been little evidence of demand for a materially later closing time for the Fedwire funds and securities
transfer services to meet domestic needs. The most likely source of demand to make later payments is from the Pacific
time zone. Banks with operations in that time zone, however, have expressed only slight interest in later Fedwire
hours in response to requests for comment made by the Board of Governors in 1989 and in 1992. Moreover, many corporate
treasurers generally view later-in-the-day payments activity as disruptive to their primary goal of determining
the amount of money available for investment. This preference is, of course, conditioned by current conventions
in the U.S. money markets, especially the times at which decisions must be made to invest or borrow funds. 

Bank payment services. Currently, a number of large, internationally active U.S. banks offer their customers real-time
account balance inquiry and payment services on a 24-hour basis. Many of these banks offer the capability to originate
payment instructions in up to 60 currencies. Payment orders may be processed as book transfers or held in an electronic
queue until the national payment system for the currency to be paid is open for business. Given current queuing practices,
there would appear to be some scope for earlier settlement of queued payments if international clearing banks find
it advantageous to process customer payments earlier in the day and national payment systems are open to process and
settle such payments. 



Fedwire Securities Transfer Service



As mentioned earlier, most interbank transfers of U.S. government securities are processed through Fedwire. The
DVP capability of the Fedwire securities transfer service increases the efficiency and integrity of the securities
clearance and settlement process. In fact, the liquidity of the government securities market is partly a function
of the Fedwire securities transfer system design, whereby the seller is assured of payment at the time the securities
are delivered. While it virtually eliminates settlement risk, the current design of the Fedwire securities transfer
service may, in some cases, result in significant demands for intraday credit. Once Fedwire opens in the morning,
users of the Fedwire securities transfer service have no control over the time at which they may receive securities
on a DVP basis. In particular, since the sellers of securities initiate the DVP transfers, receivers do not have any
operational control over the time during the day when their securities and funds accounts are credited and debited,
respectively. 

Since the inception of the Board's Payment System Risk Reduction Program, the implications of the cost of intraday
credit have taken on greater significance for participants in the Fedwire DVP securities transfer service. Receivers
of securities, especially those maintaining relatively low intraday cash balances, are not in a position to manage
their use of intraday Federal Reserve credit resulting from securities deliveries. Because of the inability to review
transfers prior to receipt, this problem may be compounded if the securities delivery is not known, or the delivery
amounts are incorrect. Although receivers of securities can reverse transfers received in error virtually immediately
after delivery and payment occur, they must very actively monitor and manage their activity to be in a position to do
so. 

The charging of fees for Federal Reserve intraday overdrafts has important implications for expanding the Fedwire
securities transfer operating hours. An expansion of such operating hours could impose significant cost burdens
on a potentially large number of banks that would need to make a choice between staffing their operations to manage
their intraday overdraft positions, or remaining closed and incurring the costs of intraday overdrafts that might
arise from securities deliveries during ``off-hours.'' In an effort to provide participants with the tools necessary
to manage their operations and credit costs, the Federal Reserve is designing new Fedwire securities transfer service
features, including receiver controls (such as receiver-authorized deliveries) and a mechanism allowing participants
to choose whether to use the service during non-standard business hours. The Board believes that public comment on
these new service features is required because of the impact they would have on senders and receivers of securities
transfers and on the operation of the U.S. government securities market. 

Analysis of a potential expansion of Fedwire securities transfer service operating hours must also take into account
``free'' transfers of securities, that is, the movement of collateral. The ability to move collateral during early
morning Fedwire operating hours was identified as a potentially useful measure by several clearing organizations
and banks in their comments on the Board's October 1992 Fedwire operating hours proposal. The ability to pledge collateral
during early morning hours can reduce settlement uncertainties and enhance participant liquidity, particularly
in times of financial stress. 

The discussion above suggests that careful attention must be given in the near term to features of the Fedwire securities
transfer service that limit the control users of the service have over the receipt of securities, particularly if
the hours of operation for the service were to be lengthened. The Board anticipates that the implementation of new
service capabilities, such as those discussed earlier, could reduce or even eliminate the involuntary costs imposed
on receivers of securities transfers, especially during expanded operating hours. Under these conditions, the
public benefits of expanding these operating hours could be significant and would be derived in part from the opportunities
to use securities as collateral, or as a near-cash equivalent, for purposes of meeting obligations that arise overnight.
At present, however, an expansion of hours would not be advisable. The Board believes that the issues surrounding
the development and use of new features for the Fedwire securities transfer service can be effectively addressed
through the public comment process during 1994. 



Implementation Issues 



Because of the aforementioned complications associated with operating characteristics of the current Fedwire
securities transfer system, the following analysis of implementation issues is limited to an expansion of Fedwire
funds transfer service operating hours. The key implementation issues addressed in this section are technology,
operational costs, monetary control and reserve management, overlapping business and calendar days, and the Federal
Reserve's intraday overdraft policy.

Technology issues. Banks as well as other financial and non-financial institutions are installing or planning to
install advanced technology to support their critical business functions. For example, many major banking organizations
employ real-time control procedures to manage their own and customer payments over major large-value electronic
payment systems. Many financial organizations are also continuing to automate major dealing functions and integrate
these with their clearing and payment systems. 

In turn, in order to provide the banking and financial system with advanced tools with which to design payment and settlement
arrangements using central bank money, the Federal Reserve is installing advanced computing and communications
systems. These systems will support all of the Federal Reserve's national payment services and accounting functions.
Among other things, this new technology will enable the Federal Reserve to provide real-time gross settlement services
in central bank money virtually around-the-clock. Other benefits of this technology are expected to include greater
payments processing efficiency, improvements in the reliability and availability of critical payment systems,
and enhanced contingency processing capabilities. 

Most existing accounting and other back office systems require that banks, including Federal Reserve Banks, accumulate
a wide range of transactions throughout the day in order to calculate and balance customer account positions. Traditionally,
this ``end-of-day'' processing has been treated as a batch operation for which large quantities of information are
accumulated from a variety of sources and then processed overnight. For example, information received from large
commercial banks that provide corporate payment services and U.S. dollar clearing services reveals that their current
systems have been designed to perform end-of-day processing within an approximate six- to eight-hour window. Most
large commercial banks are either currently changing, or have plans to change, their systems to move to a two- to four-hour
end-of-day processing window, an evolution which should be completed within about five years. 

Contingency processing requirements also need to be considered in connection with proposals to expand Fedwire funds
transfer operating hours, or bank payment system operations more generally. Specifically, for large commercial
banks, an 18-hour operating day compresses the current end-of-day processing period, including a ``cushion'' of
time to deal with the failure of regular systems or other unexpected operational disruptions that must be resolved
before opening for the next day's business. 

The Board believes that current efforts by banks and other financial institutions to use technology to improve the
efficiency of end-of-day processing will, over the next several years, reduce the time necessary to perform these
activities. Thus, with a 3-year lead time, an 18-hour Fedwire day should provide an adequate cushion of time for end-of-day
processing under normal and most contingency conditions. 

Operational costs. The Reserve Bank's incremental costs to expand operating hours can be estimated fairly accurately.
The estimated incremental costs to the Federal Reserve of lengthening the current 10-hour funds transfer operating
day to 18 hours are relatively small compared to the total cost of providing the service. Specifically, the Board estimates
that an 18-hour day beginning at 12:30 a.m. e.t. will add roughly $2.5 to $4.0 million to annual Fedwire funds transfer
operating costs, or about 3 to 5 percent of 1993 total service costs.

4

 (The Board recently asked staff to study issues related to Federal Reserve pricing methodology, which is underway.)





The incremental costs that would be incurred by banks in using the Fedwire funds transfer service during expanded
hours are difficult to estimate. In any event, the incremental operational costs to banks of participating in expanded
hours would be incurred entirely voluntarily. Banks would make individual business decisions whether to use the
Fedwire funds transfer service during expanded hours. 

Monetary control and reserve management issues. The Board believes that an expansion of Fedwire funds transfer operating
hours, involving a 6:30 p.m. e.t. closing time, does not complicate reserve maintenance for banks. Also, provided
that there is a sufficient break in time during the operating day for purposes of measuring reserve holdings, monetary
measurement and control problems do not arise for the Federal Reserve. In the event of full 24-hour operations, both
monetary measurement and control issues would need careful attention.

Overlapping business and calendar days. One complication associated with a Fedwire funds transfer day that begins
earlier than 3 a.m. e.t. concerns asynchronous business and calendar days for domestic payments and possibly for
cross-border payments as well. For example, assuming a 6:30 p.m. e.t. closing time and an 18-hour Fedwire funds transfer
day, the 12:30 a.m. e.t. opening time is 9:30 p.m. Pacific Time (p.t.). This means that today's business day, as defined
by the opening of Fedwire, begins on the prior calendar day in continental United States time zones other than the Eastern
time zone. Some clarification or adjustment in accounting practices and possibly legal conventions may be necessary
to address this situation. These adjustments do not appear to present large issues and they can be readily addressed
through such things as modifications in financial reporting conventions and business practices. 

For example, financial reporting conventions that rely on precise ``as of'' reporting dates and times would appear
reasonably to address most reporting issues. Similarly, more precision may be needed in financial contracts about
when completion of a payment or other financial transaction must occur. This is a problem that exists today and that
is addressed in contracts by specifying the location at which payment is to be made and the date (``pay to my account
in San Francisco on x date''). The new problem posed by an earlier Fedwire opening time could be addressed readily by
specifying when during the day payment is to be made at a particular location (``pay to my account in San Francisco by
close of Fedwire on x date''). 

Federal Reserve daylight overdraft policy. In an expanded Fedwire funds transfer operating environment, Federal
Reserve intraday credit will be provided to banks on the same basis that it would be provided from 8:30 a.m. e.t. to 6:30
p.m. e.t. That is, eligible institutions will be able to incur intraday overdrafts subject to the net debit caps and
daylight overdraft fees in place at the time the overdraft is incurred. 

Some adjustments to the intraday overdraft measurement rules will be required. For example, posting times for non-wire
transactions settled on the books of the Reserve Banks that are currently tied to the opening of Fedwire, such as ACH
and principal and interest payments for securities, need to be adjusted. Since users will be accustomed to the current
schedule, which generally results in posting these transactions at 8:30 a.m. e.t., a clear option would be for the
Board to consider establishing 8:30 a.m. e.t. as the ``explicit'' posting time for these transactions.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of request for public comments on developmental disabilities funding priorities for Projects of National
Significance for Fiscal Year 1994.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), announces
that public comments are being requested on funding priorities for Fiscal Year 1994 Projects of National Significance.


We welcome specific comments and suggestions on these proposed funding priorities as well as recommendations for
additional priority areas which will assist in bringing about the increased independence, productivity, and integration
into the community of people with developmental disabilities.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Part I. Background


A. Goals of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities


The Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) is located within the Administration for Children and Families
(ACF), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Although different from the other ACF program administrations
in the specific constituency it serves, ADD shares a common set of goals that promote the economic and social well-being
of families, children, individuals and communities. Through national leadership we see:
 Families and individuals empowered to increase their own economic independence and productivity;
 Strong, healthy, supportive communities having a positive impact on the quality of life and the development
of children;
 Partnerships with individuals, front-line service providers, communities, states and Congress that enable
solutions which transcend traditional agency boundaries;
 Services planned and integrated to improve client access;
 A strong commitment to working with Native Americans, persons with developmental disabilities, refugees
and migrants to address their needs, strengths and abilities.
Emphasis on these goals and progress towards them will help more people with developmental disabilities to live productive
and independent lives integrated into their communities. The Projects of National Significance program is one means
through which ADD promotes the achievement of these goals.
Two issues are of particular concern with these projects. First, there is a pressing need for networking and cooperation
among specialized and categorical programs, particularly at the service delivery level, to ensure continuation
of coordinated services to people with developmental disabilities. Second, project findings and successful innovative
models of projects need to be made available nationally to policy makers as well as to direct service providers.


B. Purpose of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities


The Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) is the lead agency within ACF and DHHS responsible for planning
and administering programs which promote the self-sufficiency and protect the rights of people with developmental
disabilities.
The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (42 U.S.C. 6000 

et seq.

) (the Act) supports and provides assistance to States and public and private nonprofit agencies and organizations
to assure that all people with developmental disabilities receive the services, assistance and opportunities necessary
to enable them to achieve their maximum potential through increased independence, productivity and integration
into the community.
The Act stresses that individuals with developmental disabilities typically:
 Experience significant functional limitations due to physical or mental, or a combination of physical and
mental, impairments; and is manifested before the person attains age 22 (as described in the Act, section 102(5)).
 Possess significant abilities of which employers are generally unaware;
 Have wants and needs;
 Remain unserved or underserved;

<DOCNO> FR940224-2-00086 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940224-2-00046 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Act further finds that: 

 The family and community can play a central role in enhancing their lives when properly supported; and 

 It is in the nation's interest for people with developmental disabilities to be employed, and to live conventional
and independent lives as a part of families and communities. 

Towards these ends, ADD seeks to enhance the capabilities of families in assisting people with developmental disabilities
to achieve their maximum potential to support the increasing ability of people with developmental disabilities
to exercise greater choice and self-determination; to engage in leadership activities in their communities; as
well as to ensure the protection of their legal and human rights.

 


Programs funded under the Act are: 



 Basic State formula grants; 

 State system for the protection and advocacy of individual rights; 

 Grants to University Affiliated Programs for interdisciplinary training, exemplary services, technical
assistance, and information dissemination; and 

 Grants for Projects of National Significance. 



C. Description of Projects of National Significance 



Under Part E of the Act, grants and contracts are awarded for Projects of National Significance to increase and support
the independence, productivity and integration into the community of people with developmental disabilities,
and to support the development of national and state policy which enhances the independence, productivity and integration
of these individuals. These projects may include, but are not limited to: 

 Projects to conduct data collection and analysis; 

 Projects to provide technical assistance to program components; 

 Projects to provide technical assistance for the development of information and referral systems; 

 Projects which improve supportive living and quality of life opportunities which enhance recreation, leisure
and fitness; 

 Projects to educate policymakers; 

 Projects to pursue Federal interagency initiatives; 

 Projects that support the enhancement of minority participation in public and private sector initiatives
in developmental disabilities; and 

 Other projects of sufficient size and scope, and which hold promise of expanding or otherwise improving opportunities
for people with developmental disabilities (especially those who have multiple disabilities or are disadvantaged,
including cultural and ethnic minority groups, (African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Latino
Americans, American Indian and Native Americans, Native Alaskan and Hawaiian) and other underserved groups. In
addition, funds may be awarded for technical assistance and demonstration projects (including research, training,
and evaluation in connection with such projects) which expand or improve the advocacy functions performed by University
Affiliated Programs, State Developmental Disabilities Planning Councils, and the Protection and Advocacy System.


Section 162(c) of the Act requires that ADD publish in the 

Federal Register

 its proposed priorities for grants and contracts to carry out Projects of National Significance for the fiscal year.
The Act also requires a period of 60 days for public comments and suggestions concerning such proposed priorities.
After analyzing and considering such comments, ADD must publish in the 

Federal Register

 final priorities for such grants and contracts, and solicit applications for funding based on the final priorities
selected. 

The following section presents the proposed priority areas for Fiscal Year 1994 Projects of National Significance.
We welcome specific comments and suggestions as well as suggestions for additional priority areas. We would also
like to receive suggestions on topics which are timely and relate to specific needs in the developmental disabilities
field. 

Topics of particular interest to ADD for Fiscal Year 1994 include self-advocacy and empowerment of consumers and/or
their families, specifically members of diverse cultural/ethnic minority constituencies. ADD is seeking disability
and other grassroots organizations, minority coalitions, civil rights and other private non-profit organizations
experienced in working with culturally diverse communities to develop successful collaborative models for supporting
the ability of minorities with developmental disabilities to exercise greater choice and self-determination by
engaging in leadership activities in their communities. Such leadership activities at a minimum should provide
them the needed knowledge, skills and confidence to access services and other supports available to them.

Part II. Fiscal Year 1994 Proposed Priority Areas for Projects of National Significance 




ADD is interested in all comments and recommendations which address areas of existing or evolving national significance
related to the field of developmental disabilities. 

We also solicit recommendations for project activities which will advocate for public policy change and community
acceptance of all people with developmental disabilities and families so that such persons receive the services,
supports, and other assistance and opportunities necessary to enable them to achieve their maximum potential through
increased independence, productivity, and integration into the community. 

ADD is also interested in activities which promote the inclusion of all people with developmental disabilities including
persons with the most severe disabilities, in community life; which promote the interdependency of all people with
developmental disabilities with all others; and which recognize the contributions of these individuals, as such
individuals share their talents at home, school, and work, and in recreation and leisure time. 

No proposals, concept papers or other forms of applications should be submitted at this time. Any such submission
will be discarded. 

ADD will not respond to individual comment letters. However, all comments will be considered in preparing the final
funding solicitation announcement and will be acknowledged and addressed in that announcement. 

Comments should be addressed to: Bob Williams, Commissioner, Administration on Developmental Disabilities, Administration
for Children and Families, Department of Health and Human Services, room 329-D HHH Building, 200 Independence
Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20201. 


Proposed Fiscal Year 1994 Priority Area 1: Leadership Education and Development of Individuals With Disabilities
and Their Families From Culturally Diverse Backgrounds 



In recent years, individuals with developmental and other disabilities have benefitted from new approaches to providing
services that dramatically changed the lives of many of those who were previously unserved or underserved. However,
many individuals and families, particularly those of culturally diverse backgrounds, remain on the outside looking
in. Many such individuals may seem to have been invisible in the developmental disabilities community. Due to a long
history of cultural stereotyping of such individuals, open discussions about disabilities remain a very sensitive
and emotionally charged topic in some communities. Although minority individuals and families are affected by developmental
and other disabilities (as the population at large), many often cannot gain access to the service system let alone
fully participate in or benefit from it. In many instances, these individuals and families may be poor, may live in
isolated areas; may be homeless or lack general knowledge about the services available to them or how the system works.


Therefore, ADD is proposing to fund Projects of National Significance (PNS) that target individuals with developmental
disabilities and their families from culturally diverse backgrounds in an effort to enable them to impact service
delivery and fully access the services they need. These projects would strengthen the ability of individuals with
developmental disabilities and their families from culturally diverse backgrounds to serve as leaders and advocates
on critical issues in the developmental disabilities field, particularly in their own communities. These projects
would assist individuals with developmental disabilities from culturally diverse backgrounds and their families
in the development and implementation of effective methods of communication and systems change to increase public
awareness, inform individuals from culturally diverse backgrounds with disabilities of issues and services, and
to develop and to implement networking strategies that improve access to community resources. Furthermore, these
projects would institutionalize action strategies that promote policies and practices which are family-centered
and community-based. 

ADD is particularly interested in grassroots organizations with a record of planning and implementing programs
with individuals from culturally diverse backgrounds, such as major civil rights organizations, minority coalitions,
and other private non-profits that would be able to establish ongoing working relationships with State Developmental
Disabilities Planning Councils, University Affiliated Programs, Protection and Advocacy Systems and other relevant
community resources. 

It is essential to identify local linkages to establish collaborative agreements/arrangements on critical issues
in the developmental disabilities field that would strengthen the capacity of individuals to serve as leaders/ advocates
on behalf of themselves and their families.

Every effort will be made to coordinate the activities under this priority areas with the Department of Education
and other Federal agencies. 



Proposed Fiscal Year 1994 Priority Area 2: Expanding the Scope of Developmental Disabilities Planning Councils




Individuals with significant disabilities other than developmental disabilities can and have benefitted from
the systems change, capacity building and advocacy activities of the Developmental Disabilities Planning Councils
(DDPCs) authorized by Part B of the Act. In response to concerns of some advocates in the States, ADD proposes to award
funds to study the expansion of the scope of DDPCs to include concerns of a broad range of citizens with disabilities
other than developmental disabilities. Because this issue is complex and little information is available regarding
the implications of such an expansion, ADD is interested in funding three types of projects to explore the effects
of such an expansion: 

 A short-term (not to exceed six months) study of DDPCs that are currently authorized under State law to focus
on individuals with disabilities other than developmental disabilities as well as persons with developmental disabilities.


 Pilot studies in up to five (5) additional states by DDPCs, in conjunction with and with support from Protection
and Advocacy systems and University Affiliated Programs, to explore the implications of expanding the current scope
of Council activity. Pilots are expected to be completed within 15 months. 

 A national study of the process, outcomes, and implications of the five (5) pilot studies. Completion of this
study is expected five months following the pilots. 


Under separate contractual solicitations, ADD proposes to award funds to provide technical assistance to improve
the functions of the DD Council, Protection and Advocacy System, and the University Affiliated Program; and to develop
information and referral systems. 

ADD also proposes to fund projects through demonstrations as well as procurements that would ensure the integration
and active participation of racial and ethnic minorities into the ``mainstream'' of the service delivery system.

<DOCTITLE>Chorionic Villus Sampling Meeting</DOCTITLE>


The National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces
the following meeting.





Name:

 Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) Meeting.


Time and Date:

 8:30 a.m.-5 p.m., Friday, March 11, 1994.


Place:

 CDC, Auditorium A, 1600 Clifton Road, NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30333.


Status:

 Open to public for observation and comment, limited only by space available.


Purpose:

 CVS is an obstetrical diagnostic procedure done prenatally to detect genetic abnormalities. The safety of the procedure
has been questioned since infants have been reported with birth defects (limb deficiency) after their mothers had
undergone CVS. Studies have been published which both support and contradict the hypothesis that CVS has caused birth
defects. CDC has recently completed a multistate study investigating the association between limb deficiency and
CVS. CDC will convene this public meeting to discuss all recent studies of this issue and to receive advice from individual
participants on establishing public health recommendations for CVS utilization.


Matters to Be Discussed:

 An invited group of qualified individuals will be asked to provide comments on recent studies of limb deficiency after
CVS. The risk for these birth defects will be discussed in the context of other risks, benefits, and alternatives of
the procedure. A written commentary from CDC which provides recommendations for CVS utilization will also be discussed.


Contact Person for More Information:

 fertilization (IVF) to be reviewed by an Ethics Advisory Board (EAB). Because of the absence of an EAB since 1980, Federal
funding of IVF protocols was not possible. With the enactment of the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-43),
the regulatory provision requiring EAB review of IVF proposals was nullified. As a result, IVF proposals, as well
as research involving human embryos that result from IVF or other sources, may now be considered for Federal funding.

The NIH has received a number of applications for support in this area and in the related field of parthenogenesis.
However, before proceeding with the consideration of specific human embryo research proposals for funding, the
NIH must address the profound moral and ethical issues raised by the use of human embryos in research and develop guidelines
to govern the review and conduct of Federally-funded research. Panel members will be asked to consider various areas
of research involving the human embryo and provide advice as to those areas they view to be acceptable for Federal funding,
areas that warrant additional review, and areas that are unacceptable for Federal support. For those areas of research
considered acceptable for Federal funding, the Panel will be asked to recommend specific guidelines for the review
and conduct of this research. Issues related to human germ-line gene modification are not within the Panel's purview.
The Panel's final report will be presented to the ACD for review.

A critical part of the process of considering these issues is to gain an understanding of the diversity of beliefs and
opinions held about the moral status of the human embryo and about Federal funding of research involving the human
embryo. The NIH is seeking public comment on Federal funding of human embryo research for consideration by the Panel
and encourages interested individuals and organizations to share with the Panel their views and perspectives on
this important topic. Those who wish to submit written comments of any length should forward these to Steven Muller,
Ph.D., Chair, NIH Human Embryo Research Panel, c/o National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Building


#

1, room 218, Bethesda, Maryland 20892. To ensure that public input is available to the Panel during its deliberations,
written comments should be received in advance of the Panel's fourth scheduled meeting, May 4, 1994.

Each meeting of the Panel will also provide an opportunity for interested individuals and organizations to make brief
oral presentations to the Panel. During the first Panel meeting, public commentary was heard in a two-hour session.
To register to make an oral statement before the Panel, individuals and organizations should contact Ms. Peggy Schnoor
at the NIH by telephoning 301-496-1454 or by sending a facsimile message to 301-402-0280 or
301-402-1759. Oral statements must not exceed five minutes in length, and a copy of the remarks should
be forwarded to the above address one week in advance of the scheduled presentation date. Opportunities to present
statements will be determined by the order in which requests are received.

The NIH will endeavor to provide seating for all members of the public who wish to attend the meetings. Individuals
are, however, asked to notify the NIH of their interest in attending by using the telephone or facsimile numbers listed
above. Individuals who require special accommodations are also asked to contact Ms. Schnoor at the above number.
General questions about the Panel or future meetings should also be directed to Ms. Schnoor.

ACTION:

 Program update and reannouncement.

 



The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) is reannouncing the following grant program:

 


Grants for Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Adolescents with Serious Emotional
Disturbance

 


Under the authority of section 561 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by Public Law 102-321, the CMHS
will accept applications from States, political subdivisions of States, and Indian tribes for the purpose of providing
comprehensive community mental health services for children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance.
The grants will be used to support a broad array of community-based and family-focused services for children and adolescents
with serious emotional, behavioral, or mental disorders to enable communities to develop coordinated local systems
of care which involve mental health, child welfare, education, juvenile justice and other agencies, as appropriate.
Approximately $10-15 million will be available to support approximately 10-15 grants in FY 1994. The
receipt date for applications for FY 1994 funds is May 10, 1994. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number
for this program is 

93.104

. 

The Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Adolescents with Serious Emotional Disturbance
program was originally announced on April 15, 1993 (

Federal Register

, Vol. 58, No. 71) and FY 1993 grant awards were made in September 1993. This program has subsequently been updated to:
(1) Provide further clarification of the definition of a community; (2) provide additional specifications on the
services that a grantee must provide in developing the system of care; (3) clarify that Indian tribal applicants receiving
grants under Section 103 of P.L. 93-638 are exempt from the restriction which prohibits the use of Federal funds
as a match; (4) provide greater explanation/clarification of the review criteria; and (5) incorporate other minor
technical changes related to individual contacts and addresses, and to help ensure overall clarity. 

Application kits including the PHS 5161-1 application form, a copy of the updated announcement, and guidance
for submitting an application are available from: Grants Management Office, Center for Mental Health Services,
5600 Fishers Lane, room 15-87, Rockville, MD 20857, Telephone: (301) 443-4456.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On November 8, 1993, the Department of the Interior received a ``petition'' to certify the People's Republic of China
and Taiwan under the Pelly Amendment to the Fishermen's Protective Act for undermining the effectiveness of the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES, or the Convention). The U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service (Service) is the agency responsible for the implementation of CITES in the United States. The request
alleged unlawful international trade by nationals of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan, in the following
species: Asiatic black bears, Asian brown bears, Malayan sun bears, sloth bears, clouded leopards, leopards, snow
leopards, gibbons, and orangutans. The People's Republic of China and Taiwan were previously certified by the Secretary
of the Interior under the Pelly Amendment on September 7, 1993 for undermining the effectiveness of CITES for trade
in rhinoceros and tiger parts and products. This notice requests comments and information from the public on the following:
the international trade in Asiatic black bears, Asian brown bears, Malayan sun bears, sloth bears, clouded leopards,
leopards, snow leopards, gibbons, and orangutans, particularly involving the People's Republic of China and Taiwan;
the conservation status of these species in the wild; the effect of illegal trade on their populations; whether or
not actions of nationals of the People's Republic of China and/or Taiwan are undermining the effectiveness of CITES;
and any illegal trade in these species by nationals of other countries or entities. This information will be utilized
by the Service in determining whether the existing certification should be amended to cover these additional species.

Background 






On November 8, 1993, the Department of the Interior received a ``petition'' to certify the People's Republic of China
and Taiwan under the Pelly Amendment to the Fishermen's Protective Act for undermining the effectiveness of the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service)
is the agency responsible for the implementation of CITES in the United States. Both the People's Republic of China
and Taiwan were previously certified by the Secretary under the Pelly Amendment on September 7, 1993 for undermining
the effectiveness of CITES for trade in rhinoceros and tiger parts and products. The November 8, 1993 letter requesting
certification was submitted by the following organizations: Environmental Investigation Agency, Earth Island
Institute, Animal Welfare Institute, Society for Animal Protective Legislation, Defenders of Wildlife, International
Primate Protection League, and World Society for the Protection of Animals. The letter provided information on the
alleged illegal international trade by nationals of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan in the following species:
Asiatic black bears, Asian brown bears, Malayan sun bears, sloth bears, clouded leopards, leopards, snow leopards,
gibbons, and orangutans. Although the November 8 letter focusses on the certification of China and Taiwan, international
trade in other countries with respect to these species is also alleged in the materials appended to the letter. Public
comment is requested on the international trade in each of these species, including, but not limited to, trade by nationals
of the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, and other countries mentioned in the appended materials. 

The Service has reviewed and analyzed this supplemental data, in combination with other information in the Service's
files on trade in the species mentioned in the November 8 letter (Asiatic black bears, Asian brown bears, Malayan sun
bears, sloth bears, clouded leopards, leopards, snow leopards, gibbons, and orangutans). All of the species mentioned
in the letter are listed in CITES Appendix I, and are therefore considered to be species threatened with extinction
which are or may be affected by trade, among other factors. Because the species are listed in Appendix I, any primarily
commercial trade in these species is generally in violation of the Convention. The letter provided information to
support the allegation that illegal trade is continuing in specimens of these species, particularly involving nationals
of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. 

The Service is aware that habitat loss and fragmentation is a major factor threatening these and many other endangered
species. In addition, and in the context of the Pelly Amendment, the supplemental information alleges that these
species are also threatened with extinction by international trade, either as live animals or as parts and products.
All of these species have declined significantly in recent years, with some populations entirely extirpated and
others on the verge of extinction. The November 8 letter provides detailed information on both the internal and international
trade in parts and products of these species, involving nationals of both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan.
The letter provides information alleging that these species are threatened with extinction by the following types
of international trade, either as live animals or as parts and products: 



Bears: 

Asian brown bears (

Ursus arctos

), Asiatic black bears (

Selenarctos thibetanus

), Malayan sun bears (

Helarctos malayanus

), sloth bears (

Melursus ursinus

): The trade in their gall bladders and extracted bile for use in traditional Chinese medicines is a major threat to
the survival of these bear species, combined with the trade in paws, liver, fat, and meat as a gourmet delicacy. Malayan
sun bears are believed to be traded as pets as well. 



Leopards: 

Clouded leopards (

Neofelis nebulosa

) are poached and traded illegally mostly for their skins, although some use in traditional Chinese medicine is reported.
Leopards (

Panthera pardus

), particularly the Amur leopard (

Panthera p. orientalis

), and snow leopards (

Panthera uncia

), are poached and traded illegally for their skin, bones, and other parts; their bones are used for the Chinese medicinal
market. Supplemental information is provided on both the internal and international trade in leopard parts and products,
involving nationals of both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. 



Primates: 

Gibbons (

Hylobates spp.

) are traded illegally mostly as pets, particularly to Taiwan. Limited supplemental information is provided on the
trade in gibbons for traditional medicine markets as well. Orangutans (

Pongo pygmaeus

) are traded illegally as pets, particularly to Taiwan. 
The information included in the November 8 letter does not explain the degree to which the alleged biological injury
posed to these CITES species is properly attributable to trade. Public comment is specifically sought on the existence
of a causal connection between trade and alleged adverse effects posed to the CITES species discussed in the November
8 letter.

Summary of Previous Pelly Amendment Certification of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan 




On September 7, 1993, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt determined that nationals of the People's Republic
of China and Taiwan are engaging in trade in rhinoceros and tiger parts and products that diminishes the effectiveness
of CITES, and so notified the President of the United States. That determination constituted a certification under
the Pelly Amendment to the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967, 22 U.S.C. 1978(a)(2), which provides that the Secretary
of the Interior shall make a certification to the President if he determines that nationals of a foreign country, directly
or indirectly, are engaged in trade or taking which diminishes the effectiveness of any international program for
the conservation of endangered or threatened species; CITES is such a program. Secretary Babbitt announced this
certification at the thirtieth meeting of the CITES Standing Committee, in Brussels, Belgium September 6-8,
1993; staff of the Service's Office of Management Authority (OMA) also participated in the meeting. The Standing
Committee made several recommendations to both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan on eliminating the illegal
trade in both rhinoceroses and tigers. In response to the Secretary of the Interior's certification, the Standing
Committee recommendations, and after bilateral discussions with both China and Taiwan, and careful deliberation
and evaluation, on November 5, 1993 the President: Reported to Congress on the certification; made several recommendations
to both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan; and required that unless measurable, verifiable, and substantial
progress is made by March, 1994, import prohibitions on trade with both governments would be necessary, as recommended
by the CITES Standing Committee. Since that time, two CITES missions have visited both the People's Republic of China
and Taiwan, and bilateral meetings have taken place. A U.S. government technical assistance mission from the Departments
of Interior and Justice will visit both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan in late February-early March. An
evaluation of progress and a preliminary decision on possible trade prohibitions is expected in March, 1994. The
thirty first CITES Standing Committee meeting will take place March 21-25 in Geneva, Switzerland, where the
issues of rhinoceros and tiger trade will also be discussed. 



Request for Information and Comments 




The Service has reviewed the November 8 letter, and finds that it contains sufficient information to warrant a consideration
of whether nationals of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan are undermining the effectiveness of CITES by engaging
trade or taking of endangered species other than rhinoceroses and tigers. Both the People's Republic of China and
Taiwan have been previously certified to the President under the Pelly Amendment for trade in rhinoceros and tiger
parts and products. If the Secretary of the Interior finds that nationals of the People's Republic of China and/or
Taiwan are diminishing the effectiveness of CITES by trading in additional species, the existing certification
would be amended accordingly. 

This notice requests comments and information from the public on the following: The international trade in the species
discussed, particularly involving the People's Republic of China and Taiwan; the conservation status of these species
in the wild; the effect of illegal trade on their populations; whether or not actions of nationals of the People's Republic
of China and/or Taiwan are undermining the effectiveness of CITES; and on any illegal trade in these species by nationals
of other countries or entities. This information will be utilized by the Service in determining whether to recommend
that the Secretary amend the existing certification.

No. 42-01211) all located in Emery County, Utah. The petitioner proposes to use high-voltage (2400 volts) cable

[Docket No. M-94-16-C] 



Andalex Resources, Inc., P.O. Box 902, Price, Utah 84501 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1002

proposes to use high-voltage (2400 volts) equipment in the last open crosscut at the longwall sections. The petitioner

3024 inby the affected area to measure the quantity and direction of the air flow; to post a marker indicating the proper
direction of the air flow; and to record the results of air readings and examinations in a record book accessible to
all interested parties. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same
measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Public Workshop: Reliability of Reactor Designs Proposing To Use Passive Safety Systems</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Nuclear Regulatory Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of public workshop.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is announcing a public workshop on reliability assessments of safety system
designs having passive features. The purpose of the workshop is to review the present status of available methodology
for assessing safety systems having passive features, to discuss possible improvements in these methods and to develop
guidelines for performing meaningful assessments of such systems. This action is being taken to initiate a dialogue
on this important topic and to provide the opportunity for early public participation in the development of review
methods and criteria for passive safety systems. In addition to open public participation in this workshop, the NRC
is inviting all known interested parties to attend.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The purpose of this workshop is to initiate a dialogue on practical approaches for assessing the reliability of engineering
systems comprised partially or completely of passive components and/or subsystems such as for example gravity fed
emergency water supplies. Even though the workshop focus will be on the generic issues associated with nuclear reactor
safety systems having passive features, it is also intended to draw on relevant experience in engineering fields
other than nuclear such as the chemical industry or NASA's space programs. Another objective of this workshop is to
discuss ways for improving our understanding of the sensitivity of functional success of passive systems to changes
in controlling system parameters. Examples of such changes include variations in heat transfer coefficient and
driving pressure (

D

P) across check valves under conditions of natural circulation and low driving head. Due to the preliminary nature
of the NRC's reviews of the advanced reactor designs planning to utilize passive safety features, the workshop will
not include discussions of specific proprietary design information. The results of the workshop will provide an
input to assessing the need for additional research into understanding passive system reliability in integral designs.



Specific Topics: The proceedings of this meeting will address issues pertinent to the assessment of reactor safety
systems having passive features including such topics as:




1. Regulatory needs for assessments of passive safety system reliability. What ingredients must logically be included
in the quantification of functional reliability of passive systems? What results (e.g., uncertainty analysis)
should be presented and documented?

2. What is meant by the reliability of a passive safety system and by the uncertainty in its reliability? What is the
best way of determining this uncertainty and of incorporating experimental information to reduce the uncertainty?

3. Discussion of past efforts to assess the reliability of reactor systems that utilize passive features. What methods
have proven successful in past efforts in light of stated needs (Item I) and what were their shortcomings?

4. Which assessment methods are good candidates for improvement and what might those improvements be?




Other questions on the proposed approach to the assessment of passive safety systems will be entertained if time permits.




Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 17th day of February 1994.

Rule 20a-3_File No. 270-134

Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') has submitted for OMB approval amendments to Regulation
14A and Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 20a-1 through 20a-3 and
Form N-14 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``1940 Act'').

Regulation 14A, and Schedule 14A thereto, sets forth general requirements for the solicitation of proxies. Approximately
8,000 respondents, other than management investment companies registered under the 1940 Act, prepare proxies with
an estimated compliance time of 89 hours per registrant. Regulation 14A and Schedule 14A, currently and as proposed
to be amended, have provisions applicable to investment companies. However, the burden hours for proxy filings by
investment companies are imposed under Rules 20a-1 through 20a-3 discussed below and the Commission
does not anticipate any changes to the burden imposed under Regulation 14A or Schedule 14A.

Regulation S-K includes generally applicable disclosure items for registration statement forms, proxies,
and other documents filed under the federal securities laws, and has an estimated compliance burden of one hour for
administrative convenience because it does not directly impose filing requirements. The Commission does not anticipate
that the propose amendments will change the burden associated with Regulation S-K.

Rules 20a-1 through 20a-3 set forth various specific requirements applicable to the solicitation of
proxies by investment companies. About 970 investment companies prepare proxies with an estimated compliance time
of 97.2 hours per registrant. The Commission expects the amendments to decrease the burden by one hour, for a total
compliance time of 96.2 hours.

N-14 is the registration statement for use by investment companies to register securities under the Securities
Act of 1933 issued in mergers and other forms of business combination. Approximately 95 registrants filed Form N-14
in 1992, with an estimated compliance time of 2,500.3 hours per registrant. The maximum additional burden imposed
by the amendments is estimated to be one hour, for a total of 2,502.3 hours.

General comments regarding the estimated burden hours should be directed to Gary Waxman at the address below. Any
comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated average burden hours for compliance with Commission rules and
forms should be directed to John J. Lane, Associate Executive Director, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549 and Gary Waxman, Clearance Officer, Office of Management and Budget, (paperwork
Reduction Act Numbers 3235-0059, 3235-0158, 3235-0071, and 3235-0336), room 3208, New Executive

Rule 6e-2_File No. 270-177

Rule 17a-8_File No. 270-225

Rule 17f-1_File No. 270-236




Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et. seq.

), the Securities and Exchange Commission has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget request for approval
of extensions on the following currently approved rules and forms: 

Form N-8f is the form prescribed for use by certain registered investment companies requesting orders of the
Commission declaring that they have ceased to be investment companies. The form takes approximately 6 hours to complete.


Form N-23C-1 is a form on which closed-end investment companies report repurchases of their own securities.
The form requires about one hour to fill out on each occasion, up to twelve times per year, on the part of approximately
4 companies that undertake such repurchase transactions each year. Total annual burden hours are estimate to be 23.


Rule 6e-2 grants investment companies offering scheduled premium and single premium variable life insurance
contracts exemptions from the Investment Company Act of 1940. Only management accounts that register to sell contracts
under Rule 6e-2 have a reporting burden, estimated to be approximately 111 annual hours per respondent, imposed
under paragraph (b)(9) of the rule. Since 1988, there have been no filings under paragraph (b)(9) of rule 6e-2
by existing management accounts, and separate accounts now are being organized as trust accounts, which are not subject
to the reporting requirements, rather than as management accounts. Without the rule, management companies that
offer variable insurance contracts and their sponsoring life insurers would have to file individual exemptive applications
in addition to a registration statement in order to obtain the relief needed to sell the contracts. This process would
be burdensome on both the life insurer and the Commission's staff. 

Rule 17a-8 exempts certain mergers or consolidations involving investment companies from the restrictions
on transactions between affiliates set forth in Section 17(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The rule annually
requires approximately 1.5 hours of recordkeeping by each of approximately 17 companies estimated to be involved
in such a merger or consolidation each year, for a total of 26 annual burden hours. 

Rule 17f-1 requires that a custodial contract and an accountant's certificate be filed with the Commission
in connection with the placement or maintenance of the assets of a registered management investment company in the
custody of a member of a national securities exchange. The rule requires each respondent to spend about 4 hours meeting
reporting requirements annually. 

General comments regarding the estimated burden hours should be directed to Gary Waxman at the address below. Any
comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated average burden hours for compliance with Commission rules and
forms should be directed to John J. Lane, Associate Executive Director, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549 and Gary Waxman, Clearance Officer, Office of Management and Budget, (Paperwork
Reduction Act No. 3235-0157, 3235-0230, 3235-0177, 3235-0235, and 3235-0222), room
3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. to Article II, Sections 10 and 11 of the Code of Procedures Relating to the Procedures of the National
Business Conduct Committee</DOCTITLE>


February 15, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on February 14, 1994,
 the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


Below is the text of the proposed rule change. Proposed new language is italicized; proposed deletions are in brackets.


Code of Procedure


* * * * *


Article II


* * * * *


Sec. 10


* * * * *


Acceptance, Waiver and Consent of the Respondent


(a) If the Committee has reason to believe a violation has occurred and the member or associated person does not dispute
the violation, the Committee may suggest that the member or associated person submit a letter containing an acceptance
of a finding of violations, a waiver of all rights of appeal to the National Business Conduct Committee (and any review
thereof by the Board of Governors), the Securities and Exchange Commission and the courts or to otherwise challenge
or contest the validity of the Order issued if the letter is accepted, and a consent to the imposition of sanctions.
The letter shall describe the act or practice engaged in or omitted; the rule, regulation or statutory provision violated;
and the sanction to be imposed therefore. If the Committee then concludes that the Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and
Consent is appropriate and should be accepted, it shall be submitted to the National Business Conduct Committee.
If the letter is accepted by the National Business Conduct Committee or a 

Subcommittee designated by the National Business Conduct Committee, 

it shall become final and shall constitute the complaint, answer and decision in the matter. If the letter is rejected
by the Committee

, 

[or] the National Business Conduct Committee, or a 

Subcommittee designated by the National Business Conduct Committee, 

any acceptances, waivers and consents contained therein shall not be considered in any further complaint action
which may be taken against the member or associated person.

accepts the Letter, the Corporation will report the violation to the Securities and Exchange Commission as required
by the Commission pursuant to a plan approved under Rule 19d-1(c)(2) adopted under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. If the Committee

, 

[or] 

the 

National Business Conduct Committee, or a

, which is hereby delegated authority to accept or reject an Offer of Settlement. If the National Business Conduct
Committee [by a majority vote] or a 

Subcommittee designated by the National Business Conduct Committee 

approves the Committee's Order, it shall communicate its conclusion to the Committee which shall thereafter issue
such Order.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The National Business Conduct Committee of the NASD (``NBCC'') is composed of participating members of the first
year class of the NASD Board of Governors (``Board'') plus an elected Chair and Vice-Chair from the Board's second
year class. The members of the NBCC are sent a weekly package (``weekly mailings'') for review on proposed Acceptance,
Waiver, and Consents (``AWCs''), Minor Rule Violations Letters, and Offers of Settlement. The NBCC also reviews,
on a weekly basis, all disciplinary decisions of the District Business Conduct Committees and the Market Surveillance
Committee. All matters are first reviewed by the Chair and Vice-Chair of the NBCC and then reviewed by the other members
of the NBCC along with the recommendations of the Chair and Vice-Chair.

The NASD has determined that the weekly mailings to the NBCC require a substantial commitment of time of NBCC members
and that the review by NBCC members of all the foregoing matters is unnecessary and unduly burdensome. In order to reduce
the amount of materials which must be read by NBCC members, the NASD proposes to amend Article II, Sections 10(a), 10(b),
and 11(e)
 of the Code of Procedure (``Code'') to allow the NBCC to designate a Subcommittee composed of members of the NBCC to
review AWCs, Minor Rule Violations Letters, and Offers of Settlement in all instances other than matters that are
outside the NASD Sanction Guidelines
 or where the designated Subcommittee, in its discretion, otherwise believes full NBCC review is appropriate. The
NASD intends that, initially, the Subcommittee designated by the Committee will consist of the Committee Chair and
Vice-Chair, but may modify the composition of the Subcommittee in the future.,








The NASD is, therefore, proposing to amend Article II, Sections 10(a) and 10(b) of the Code, to allow acceptance and
rejections of AWCs and Minor Rule Violations Letters to be made by a Subcommittee designated by the NBCC as an alternative
to full NBCC review.

The NASD is also proposing to amend Article II, section 11(e) of the Code to allow acceptances and rejections of Offers
of Settlement to be made by a Subcommittee designated by the NBCC as an alternative to full NBCC review. The NASD is also
proposing to delete the phrase ``by a majority vote'' from Article II, section 11(e) of the Code. The NASD considers
the phrase ``by a majority vote'' to be confusing since a majority vote is always required by an NASD review body acting
pursuant to the Code.

The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of section 15A(b)(8) of the Act in
that the proposed rule change provides for fair procedures for the disciplining of members and persons associated
with members. The proposal enhances the NASD's disciplinary procedures with respect to AWCs, Minor Rule Violations
Letters, and Offers of Settlement by facilitating the review of such matters by the NBCC.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition.



The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

A. By order approve such proposed rule, or

B. Institute proceeding to determine whether the proposed rule should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by March 17,
1994.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>First Prairie Cash Management et al.; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>



February 16, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').





APPLICANTS:

 First Prairie Cash Management (``Cash Management''), First Prairie Money Market Fund (``Money Market''), First
Prairie U.S. Treasury Securities Cash Management (``Treasury Cash Management'') and such other registered investment
companies that in the future (i) are advised by FNBC or any entity under common control with or controlled by FNBC, (ii)
are taxable money market funds, (iii) are permitted to invest in repurchase agreements, and (iv) effect purchase
and sales through FNBC's ``sweep'' program (the ``Funds''), and The First National Bank of Chicago (``FNBC'').




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS:

 Exemption requested pursuant to sections 6(c) and 17(b) from section 17(a).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION:

 Applicants seek an amendment to a prior order that permits Money Market to enter into repurchase agreements with FNBC.
The prior order limits the collateral for the repurchase agreements to U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes, or Bonds, with
remaining maturities of one year or less, and valued at least equal to 102% of the maximum amount of a Fund's net assets
that could be invested in such repurchase agreements. The order will not limit the maturity of the collateral and,
with respect to the amount of the collateral, will provide only that the repurchase agreements must be fully collateralized
within the meaning of rule 2a-7.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.


Applicants' Representations


1. The Funds are open-end, diversified management investment companies. Each Fund is a money market fund that maintains
a net asset value of $1.00 per share for purchases and redemptions and, pursuant to rule 2a-7 under the Act, uses
the amortized cost method of valuing its securities.
2. FNBC is the investment adviser for each of the Funds. FNBC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Chicago Corporation,
a registered bank holding company, is a commercial bank offering a range of banking and investment services. The Bank
of New York acts as the custodian for each of the Funds.
3. Cash Management invests in short-term money market obligations, including repurchase agreements with respect
to such securities with registered or unregistered securities dealers or banks that have total assets in excess of
$1 billion. Money Market is divided into two separate portfolios, the Money Market Series and the Government Series
(each of which is referred to as a ``Fund''). The Money Market Series invests in short-term money market obligations,
including repurchase agreements with banks or primary government securities dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York. The Government Series invests only in short-term securities issued or guaranteed as to principal
and interest by the U.S. Government, and repurchase agreements with respect to such securities with selected registered
or unregistered securities dealers or banks that have total assets in excess of $1 billion. Treasury Cash Management
invests at least 65% of the value of its net assets in U.S. Treasury securities and repurchase agreements in respect
thereof and the remainder of its net assets in other securities guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S.
Government and repurchase agreements in respect thereof with registered or unregistered securities dealers or
banks that have total assets in excess of $1 billion.
4. Each Fund's shares are purchased primarily by clients of FNBC and its affiliates, including qualified custody,
agency, and trust accounts, through their accounts with FNBC and its affiliates. Each Fund's shares may be purchased
through automatic investment transactions. In these transactions, FNBC, as agent, follows the standing instructions
of such clients and automatically invests excess cash balances in the clients' accounts in shares of one or more of
the Funds.
 Currently, these ``sweep'' transactions are effected automatically by computer each Fund business day as the next
determined net asset value. The machine processing required to tabulate the day's transactions in such clients'
accounts and other shareholder accounts, however, is completed later in the day (normally no earlier than 11 p.m.,
New York time) when the daily processing for FNBC's accounting system is completed (the ``Completion Time''). Therefore,
total assets to be invested in each Fund through the ``sweep'' program each day are not known until that evening and
are invested in each Fund at the respective net asset values determined on the following day.




5. The current operation of the ``sweep'' program makes the Funds materially less attractive to FNBC's clients because
they lose a day's income on funds invested through the program and, for ``sweeps'' accomplished on a Friday, lose a
weekend's income.
6. To correct this problem, Money Market and FNBC (the ``original Applicants'') applied for and received an order
(the ``Order'') of the SEC under section 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act on January 26, 1993, exempting them from section 17(a)
of the Act to permit Money Market to enter into repurchase agreements with FNBC or an affiliate subject to certain conditions.
 To date, however, Money Market has not entered into repurchase agreements with FNBC and therefore is not relying on
the Order. The application seeks to amend the Order to: (1) Add additional Funds with investment policies and procedures
similar to those of Money Market as applicants; and (2) amend condition seven to the Order.






7. Condition seven to the Order provides that, during the operation of the ``sweep'' program, collateral maintained
in a subcustodian account in the name of each Fund shall be ``comprised only of U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes or Bonds,


with remaining maturities of one year or less

, and valued at least equal to 

102% of the Maximum Purchase Amount

'' (emphasis added). The ``Maximum Purchase Amount'' is the amount of a Fund's net assets that may be invested pursuant
to the Order. This amount is based on a percentage that may change from time to time, subject to the agreement of the applicants,
but may not exceed 15% of a Fund's net assets.
8. Applicants propose to amend condition seven to eliminate the requirement that the securities comprising the collateral
have ``remaining maturities of one year or less.'' Applicants believe that the provisions of rule 2a-7 relating
to remaining maturity are not applicable to securities underlying fully collateralized repurchase agreements.
 FNBC's experience is that the Funds will be able to obtain a higher yield on repurchase agreements using collateral
with remaining maturities of greater than one year than otherwise would be the case.

9. Applicants also propose to amend condition seven to eliminate the requirement that the securities comprising
the collateral be valued at least equal to ``102% of the Maximum Purchase Amount.'' Applicants believe that neither
rule 2a-7 nor relevant regulatory pronouncements require the collateral for the repurchase agreements to
be valued at 102% of the Maximum Purchase Amount. Applicants propose to substitute the requirement that the collateral
be at least equal to the amount (the ``Required Collateral Amount'') necessary to collateralize fully (within the
meaning of rule 2a-7) a repurchase agreement in an amount equal to the Maximum Purchase Amount. Applicants believe
that maintaining additional collateral beyond that necessary to collateralize fully a repurchase agreement reduces
the relevant Fund's yield on the repurchase agreement to the detriment of the Fund's shareholders.

10. To permit FNBC, as each Fund's investment adviser, to invest anticipated net assets attributable to the ``sweep''
program on the same day that they are available for investment (despite the fact that the exact amount thereof will
not be known until after the time for investment that day), FNBC or an affiliate proposes to enter into overnight repurchase
agreements with each Fund. Such assets would be invested in shares of a Fund as of the time the Fund determined its net
asset value (the ``Pricing Time'') on the same day the sweep occurs.

11. Each Fund proposes to enter into a master repurchase agreement with FNBC or one of its affiliates, which is substantially
the same as the industry standard master repurchase agreement promulgated by the Public Securities Association,
covering all repurchase agreement transactions (the ``Master Repurchase Agreement'').

12. To facilitate the repurchase transaction where the exact amount of the overnight repurchase agreement and, consequently,
the required collateral is not known until the following day, FNBC, at no cost to the Funds, will maintain at all times
in a segregated sub-custodian account in the name of each Fund the Required Collateral Amount. Each Fund will promptly
notify FNBC of any increase or decrease in its net asset value and FNBC will adjust the amount of collateral maintained
in the segregated account daily so that it at least equals the Required Collateral Amount for each Fund. The relevant
Fund will have a perfected security interest in the repurchase agreement collateral held in such account.

13. If the cash balances swept into a Fund equalled the Maximum Purchase Amount, the required amount of collateral
already would be held in the Fund's segregated sub-custodian account with FNBC's Trust Department and the Fund would
have a perfected security interest in all such collateral notwithstanding the fact that the actual amount of the repurchase
transaction would not be known until the computer records were received the next morning. If such cash balances were
less than the Maximum Purchase Amount, the repurchase transaction would be over-collateralized. If such cash balances
swept exceeded the Maximum Purchase Amount, the excess amount would remain uninvested. FNBC, however, believes
that its experience in operating the ``sweep'' program and its daily consultations with other departments should
limit the amount of funds being swept and thus potentially held uninvested.

14. FNBC's Trust Department will act as each Fund's sub-custodian pursuant to a sub-custodian agreement approved
by each Fund's Board of Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees who are not '`interested persons,'' as defined
in the Act, of either FNBC or the Fund.
 Each Fund's assets held by FNBC's Trust Department will be maintained in a segregated custodial account established
on its behalf in accordance with the rules and standards of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Act. FNBC's Trust
Department would receive the eligible securities transferred to it in its capacity as sub-custodian for each Fund
and hold them in a manner complying with the requirements of section 17(f) of the Act. After the Completion Time that
evening, for a particular fund, the records maintained by FNBC for its clients' accounts and by FNBC's Trust Department
in its capacity as the Fund's sub-custodian would show:

(i) For FNBC's client accounts, a cash entry for the amount of Fund shares purchased or redeemed and a corresponding
entry to the client accounts for the number of Fund shares purchased or redeemed as of the Pricing Time through operation
of the computer ``sweep'' program; and 
(ii) For the Fund's sub-custodian account, all purchase and sale transactions and the net cash proceeds, if any, received
by the Fund through the operation of the ``sweep'' (or, conversely, the net redemption proceeds paid or payable by
the Fund if there were net redemptions). In addition, the Fund's sub-custodian account would reflect the specific
amount in fact invested in the particular transaction (including the ownership of the securities securing the repurchase
agreement). If the ``sweep'' had resulted in unanticipated net redemptions for the Fund, the relevant sub-custodian
account would reflect this fact and show no ownership of any of such securities transferred by FNBC or its affiliates
to the account, since (contrary to expectations) none of the Fund's assets had been used to purchase the securities.
To the extent that transferred securities exceeded the Fund's assets that were available for investment (as shown
by the results of the day's computer processing), FNBC or the appropriate affiliate would be shown to be owner of such
securities. 

15. After the Completion Time, FNBC would transmit to the Fund's transfer agent records relating to these automatic
investment transactions. The transfer agent's records would show an entry to each of the corresponding shareholder
accounts for the number of Fund shares automatically purchased or redeemed as of the Pricing Time through operation
of the ``sweep.''

16. Each Fund will purchase only securities in which it may invest as described in its prospectus and statement of additional
information and as limited by rule 2a-7. The Master Repurchase Agreement into which each Fund proposes to enter
will be collateralized only by U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds. The transactions will comply with the guidelines
set forth in Investment Company Act Release No. 13005 (February 2, 1983) and will be collateralized fully as that term
is defined in rule 2a-7. The Master Repurchase Agreement will be subject to annual approval, with respect to
each Fund, by the Fund's Board of Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees who are not ``interested persons''
(as defined in the Act) of the Fund or FNBC or its affiliates. 

17. The transactions would be ``repurchase agreements'' for purposes of Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy
Code and the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989. These statutes provide that, if
the bankruptcy of the counterparty occurs, the repurchase agreement can be liquidated without being subject to the
potential delay associated with the automatic stay or similar provisions of these statutes. If the transactions
were not ``repurchase agreements'' as defined under those statutes, the Fund might encounter significant liquidity
problems if a large percentage of its assets were invested in repurchase agreements with a bankrupt counterparty.

18. Cash Management, the Money Market Series, the Government Series, and Treasury Cash Management currently invest
approximately 33%, 33%, 25%, and 50%, respectively, of their net assets on an overnight basis. Each Fund's average
daily portfolio maturity customarily is between 40 and 60 days. Applicants intend to limit the Maximum Purchase Amount
at a level that they believe should avoid reducing average daily portfolio maturity and thus the yield for a Fund.


19. FNBC will continue to solicit independent quotes from third parties for the proposed ``sweep'' transactions,
but to date FNBC has been unable to find any unaffiliated entity willing to engage in such transactions on a basis as
favorable to the Funds as the proposed arrangement with FNBC. The repurchase agreement counterpart will not know
until the next day the amount, if any, of such transactions. This delay results because the daily processing for FNBC's
accounting system normally is completed well into the night of the day the order is placed and the actual amount to be
invested in the repurchase transaction is not known and, thus, monies in respect thereof cannot be transmitted until
the next morning. Unaffiliated third parties will not agree to operate in this ``look back'' manner with the Fund on
a basis as favorable to the Fund as the proposed arrangement with FNBC.

20. Before any repurchase agreements are entered into pursuant to the exemption, the participating Fund or FNBC must
obtain and document competitive quotations from at least two other dealers with respect to repurchase agreements
that are comparable in terms of size, maturity, and collateral, except that if quotations are unavailable from two
such dealers only one other competitive quotation is required. In addition, the transactions for which quotations
are sought will be conventional overnight repurchase agreements in which the funds would be transferred by the participating
Fund on the same day that the transaction is entered into, and then returned by the counterpart on the following day.
Before entering into a transaction pursuant to the exemption, a determination will be required that the income to
be earned from the repurchase agreement is at least equal to that available from the other dealers from which quotes
were obtained. As set forth in the application, applicants enter into repurchase agreements on an ongoing basis and,
therefore, believe they are capable of obtaining such quotes.




Applicants' Legal Analysis




1. Section 17(a) of the Act, among other things, generally prohibits certain entities affiliated with an registered
investment company, when acting as principal, from knowingly selling to or purchasing from the investment company,
any security. Among the entities precluded from dealing as principal with a registered investment company under
section 17(a) are any affiliated person of the investment company and any affiliated person of an affiliated person
of the investment company. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act defines the term ``affiliated person'' of an investment company
to include any investment adviser of such company. Therefore, FNBC, as each Fund's investment adviser, and its affiliates
are subject to the prohibitions contained in section 17(a) with respect to the Fund.



2. Section 6(c) of the Act provides in relevant part that ``the Commission, * * * by order upon application,
may * * * exempt any person, security, or transaction * * * from any provision or provisions
of [the Act] or of any rule or regulation thereunder, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of [the Act].''


3. Section 17(b) of the Act provides that ``notwithstanding [section 17(a)], any person may file with the Commission
an application for an order exempting a proposed transaction * * * from one or more provisions of that
subsection. The Commission shall grant such application and issue such order of exemption if evidence establishes
that * * * (1) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received,
are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (2) the proposed transaction
is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement
and reports filed under [the Act]; and (3) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of [the
Act].''


4. Each Fund believes that the relief requested is appropriate and in the public interest because it will permit the
Fund to invest at a favorable price net assets attributable to the ``sweep'' program on the same day that such assets
are available for investment. Applicants believe that a more attractive ``sweep'' program will result in increased
assets for the Funds. A larger asset base for a Fund will benefit all Fund shareholders by reducing the amount of Fund
expenses indirectly borne by each shareholder, thereby increasing investors' returns. 


5. FNBC and its affiliates are aware of the potential conflict of interest inherent in the operation of the ``sweep''
program if the proposed relief is granted. FNBC, therefore, has established procedures and conditions to be followed
by its employees and agents to prevent any overreaching on the part of any person that could act to the detriment of the
Funds and to ensure that each transaction is effected on a reasonable and fair basis.




6. A Fund's overnight position should not necessarily reduce its yield. If the operation of the proposed ``sweep''
program shortens a Fund's average daily portfolio maturity, the effect of such reduction would be minimal because:
(i) the Fund currently maintains a relatively short average daily portfolio maturity; (ii) as FNBC develops more
experience operating the ``sweep'' program, FNBC will be able to manage the maturity of that portion of the Fund's
assets held outside the sub-custodian account for the program so as to provide optimal liquidity levels; and (iii)
upon receipt of such assets currently, the Fund has invested such assets in overnight or very short-term obligations
in any event, but such investment occurs one day later. Thus, applicant believe that any effect on yield as a result
of the proposed relief would be negligible. In addition, operation pursuant to the independent pricing mechanism
set forth in condition 8 should provide yields from ``sweep'' investments that are no lower than similar non-sweep
Fund investments. 


7. Based on the arguments set forth above, applicants believe that the requested relief is necessary and appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the Act. Applicants also believe that the terms of the proposed transactions, including the consideration
to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned,
that the proposed transactions are consistent with the policy of each Fund, as set forth in the Fund's registration
statement and reports filed under the Act, and that the proposed transactions are consistent with the general purposes
of the Act.





Applicants' Conditions






Applicants agree that the order of the Commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following
conditions:



1. No. FNBC or affiliate ``sweep'' account client will be permitted to affect a transaction for a Fund after the sweep
has occurred and the Fund's net assets value has been computed for that day.

2. The legal or compliance department of, and internal and outside auditors for, FNBC or its affiliates will prepare
guidelines for FNBC and affiliate personnel to ensure that the transactions described herein comply with the conditions
set forth herein and that the integrity of the program is maintained. Each Fund's independent public accountants
will verify assets held in each sub-custodian account in accordance with rule 17f-2 under the Act. The legal
or compliance department and auditors will periodically monitor the activities of FNBC and its affiliates in connection
with the operation of the ``sweep'' program to ensure that the conditions set forth in the application are adhered
to.
3. The terms of the relief will be disclosed fully in each Fund's prospectus and statement of additional information.
A schedule of all transactions with FNBC and its affiliates will be filed with each semi-annual report filed by a Fund
with the Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. FNBC will provide each Fund's Board of Trustees
with a full report of the transactions under the ``sweep'' program, as described herein, no less frequently than quarterly.
FNBC also will provide each Fund's Board of Trustees with a statement that, as the Fund's investment adviser, it determined
the principal transactions to be necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.
4. The Funds and FNBC will maintain such records with respect to those transactions conducted pursuant to the exemption
as may be necessary to confirm compliance with the conditions to the requested relief. In this regard, each Fund will
maintain an itemized daily record of repurchase agreement transactions entered into pursuant to the exemption,
showing for each transaction: that it has entered into the transaction; the entity with which it has entered into the
transaction; the purchase and repurchase prices; the type and amount of collateral; the date fixed for termination
of the transaction; and the time and date of the transaction. For each transaction, such records also shall document
the quotations received from other dealers in accordance with condition no. 8, including: The names of the dealers;
the prices quoted; and the times and dates the quotations were received. The records required by this condition will
be maintained and preserved in the same manner as records required under rule 31a-1(b)(1).
5. The Maximum Purchase Amount will be the percentage of each Fund's net assets upon which the applicants from time
to time may agree, which percentage may fluctuate but shall not exceed 15%. As to a particular Fund on a particular day,
the amount invested pursuant to the exemption will not exceed the amount swept into such Fund on such day.
6. All records pertaining to the sweep program will be preserved for a period of not less than six years, the first two
years in an easily accessible place, from the end of the fiscal year in which any sweep transaction occurred.

7. In connection with overnight repurchase agreement transactions pursuant to the Master Repurchase Agreement,
FNBC will maintain at all times during operation of the ``sweep'' program in a segregated sub-custodian account in
the name of each Fund collateral comprised only of U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes or Bonds valued at least equal to the Required
Collateral Amount. In addition, FNBC or its affiliates will transfer such collateral through the book entry system
of the Federal Reserve and, in connection therewith, the Fund's sub-custodian account with FNBC's Trust Department
will be designated by Fedwire as the recipient of such securities and FNBC's internal records and written confirmations
will indicate that the collateral is being held on behalf and in such Fund's name. The relevant Fund thereby will acquire
a security interest in the collateral.
8. Before any transaction may be conducted pursuant to the exemption, the participating Fund or FNBC must obtain such
information as it deems necessary to determine that the price test set forth below has been satisfied. Before any repurchase
agreements are entered into pursuant to the exemption, the participating Fund or FNBC must obtain and document competitive
quotations from at least two other dealers with respect to repurchase agreements comparable to the type of repurchase
agreement involved (including size, which would be at least equal to the Maximum Purchase Amount, maturity and collateral),
except that if quotations are unavailable from two such dealers only one other competitive quotation is required.
In addition, the transactions for which quotations are sought will be conventional overnight repurchase agreements
in which the funds would be transferred by the participating Fund on the same day that the transaction is entered into,
and then returned by the counterparty on the following day. Before entering into a transaction pursuant to the exemption,
a determination will be required in each instance, based upon the information available to the participating Fund
and FNBC, that the income to be earned from the repurchase agreement is at least equal to that available from the other
dealers from which quotes were obtained.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Notice of this meeting is provided in accordance with the consensus standard development approach outlined in the
Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 9, 1993 (58 FR 59420). If a standard is developed which provides a suitable basis for the regulation of inflatable
PFDs for use in recreational boating, a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), in which the Coast Guard discusses and
proposes adoption of all or part of it, will be published in the 

Federal Register.

 




The agenda for the March 7, 1994 meeting will include discussion of the following topics:

(1) Issues identified after publication of the ANPRM, as they relate to the draft standard.

(2) Inflation system status indicator needs/requirements.

Correction to notice of eligibility.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document corrects the notice of eligibility published on Thursday, January 6, 1994 (59 FR 792) concerning the
Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Need for Correction



As published, the notice of eligibility (CGD 93-092) contains an error which requires correction. In describing
to which vessels certain requirements of the Passenger Vessel Safety Act apply, the word ``and'' was used rather than
the correct word ``or''.



Correction of Publication



Accordingly, the publication on January 6, 1994, of the notice of eligibility (CGD 91-035), which is the subject
of FR document 94-262, is corrected as follows:

1. On page 793, under the subtitle ``Possible Modified Regulations for Certain Existing Passenger Vessels'' in the
first paragraph of the second column, ``(a) At least 100 gross tons but less than 300 gross tons, and;'' is corrected
to read ``(a) At least 100 gross tons but less than 300 gross tons; or''.

<USBUREAU>Federal Railroad Administration</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Petition for Waivers of Compliance </DOCTITLE>



In accordance with 49 CFR 211.9, 211.41 and 211.45, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration
(FRA) has received a request for a waiver of compliance with certain requirements of the Federal safety laws and regulations.
The individual petition is described below, including the party seeking relief, the regulatory provisions involved,
the nature of the relief being requested and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief. 



Renfe Talgo of America, Incorporated 



Docket Numbers RSGM-94-2 and SA-94-1 



Renfe Talgo of America, Incorporated (RTAX) requests waivers of compliance with certain provisions of the Railroad
Safety Glazing Standards (49 CFR part 223) under Docket Number RSGM-94-2 and Railroad Safety Appliance
Standards (49 CFR part 231), under Docket Number SA-94-1. 

RTAX seeks these waivers in order to permit operation of the 
TALGO Pendular Train (TALGO) under two conditions. It is intended that the train will be operated (1) in non-revenue
demonstration runs and (2) in revenue service as part of a regularly scheduled service operated by National Railroad
Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) in the Pacific Northwest High Speed Rail Corridor. The non-revenue demonstration
runs of the TALGO train will involve a cross-country movement from its assembly point in Washington, DC to Seattle,
Washington, in March 1994. It is anticipated that the train will be on public display in Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago,
St. Louis, and Seattle. The revenue operations in passenger service are to be conducted as part of Amtrak's regularly
scheduled service between Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon, which are scheduled to begin in April 1994.



The trainset would be comprised of 12 TALGO Pendular cars. The 12 cars will include 1 head-end power car which will not
carry passengers, 8 passenger coach cars, 1 cafeteria car, 1 dining car, and 1 rear-end service car which will not carry
passengers. The TALGO equipment has a total weight of approximately 400,000 pounds. With the Amtrak locomotive,
the total length of the train will be approximately 575 feet. 

RTAX petition seeks a waiver from compliance with the Railroad Glazing Standards, (49 CFR 223.15(b)), which requires
that all side facing glazing on passenger cars must meet the FRA Type II testing criteria. RTAX states that the side
facing glazing of the TALGO train may in fact meet the FRA requirements for FRA Type II, but it has not been subjected
to the test specified in the regulation. The windows in the sides of the cars are double glazed with tempered safety
glass. Each layer is 6 mm. (.24 inches) thick with an air space in between the two layers. RTAX says that there is not sufficient
time to retrofit windows in the TALGO train prior to shipment from Spain. 

RTAX petition seeks a waiver from compliance of the Railroad Safety Appliance Standards, (49 CFR 231.14) and sections
2 and 4 of the Safety Appliance Act (45 U.S.C. 2 and 4), which requires that each passenger car must be equipped with side
handholds, end handholds, and uncoupling levers. The passenger cars have side handholds at the doors for the assistance
of passengers, but there are no side handholds or end handholds which the rules contemplate for use in switching operations
or coupling and uncoupling. RTAX states that the 12 cars in the TALGO train constitute a single unit, in that the cars
will not be uncoupled from one another, except at specified maintenance facilities. The individual cars are joined
by swivel type traction couplers which will not uncouple in normal operations and because of this configuration there
is no need for uncoupling levers. Standard AAR Type E couplers will be installed at the ends of the front and rear service
cars.

Interested parties are invited to participate in this proceeding by submitting written views, data, or comments.
FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with this proceeding since the facts do not appear
to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing,
before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. 

All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition
Docket Number SA-94-1) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel,
Federal Railroad Administration, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Communications
received before March 17, 1994 will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that
date will be considered as far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available
for examination during regular business hours (9 a.m.-5 p.m.) in room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street
SW., Washington, DC 20590.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces that a two-day public meeting will be held in the Department of Commerce Auditorium in Washington,
DC, commencing at 10:00 a.m. on Wednesday, March 8, 1994. The purpose of this meeting is to (1) provide the public with
a general briefing on the entire ``Mod Act,'' (2) give senior Customs managers an opportunity to share ``strawmen''
implementation proposals, and (3) give participants an opportunity to ask questions, make suggestions, and provide
the Customs Service with informal input relative to implementation of Title VI of the North American Free Trade Agreement
Implementation Act (Public Law 103-182, 107 Stat. 2057, codified at 19 U.S.C. 3301 note). To facilitate building

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On December 8, 1993, the President signed the ``North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation 
Act.'' The Customs modernization portion of this Act (Title VI of Public Law 103-182), popularly known as the
Customs Modernization 
Act or ``Mod Act,'' became effective when it was signed. To 
provide the public with a general ``Mod Act'' briefing, share ``strawmen'' implementation proposals, and invite
informal dialogue relative to implementation plans and issues, Customs will hold an open meeting in Washington on
March 8-9, 1994. Between 10 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. on March 8, a general briefing covering operational, automation
and enforcement issues will be conducted. This general briefing will be similar to those conducted in Washington
on February 9 and 10, 1994. Following the general briefing, senior Customs managers will conduct a series of presentations
focussing on their proposals for implementing specific Mod Act provisions. Among the topics to be discussed in these
focussed sessions will be regulatory audit, drawback, penalties, carriers, importer activity summary statements
and reconciliation. Participants will be given ample opportunity to ask questions and provide suggestions during
each session. Persons planning to attend are requested to pre-register by FAX with Mr. Dale Snell at 202-482-6994.
Individuals not having access to facsimile equipment may pre-register by calling Mr. Snell at 202-482-6990.
To meet Commerce Department building access requirements, attendees are encouraged to arrive approximately 30
minutes in advance of the meeting. Each individual attending Customs Mod Act Implementation meeting on March 8 and
9, 1994, will be required to sign a Commerce Department register and present photo-identification.

<DOCTITLE>Public Comment Regarding Operating Subsidiary Notices </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Treasury. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Request for public comment. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) requests public comment concerning two notices filed by national
banks of their proposed establishment of operating subsidiaries that will engage in mutual fund activities. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



First Union National Bank of North Carolina; Notice of Intent to Establish Three Operating Subsidiaries Which Will
Acquire the Partnership Interests of Lieber & Company and the Assets and Liabilities of Evergreen Asset Management
Corporation. [OCC Control No. 93-ML08023.] 
Mellon Bank, N.A.; Notice of Intent to Establish Certain Operating Subsidiaries Which Will Acquire Most of the Assets,
Operations, and Activities of the Dreyfus Corporation. [OCC Control No. 93-NE-08043.] 



First Union National Bank of North Carolina, Charlotte, North Carolina (First Union) filed a notice with the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on November 1, 1993 (First Union Notice), pursuant to 12 CFR 5.34,

1

 advising the OCC of First Union's intent to establish three operating subsidiaries. The First Union Notice describes
First Union's intent to acquire, through First Union's proposed operating subsidiaries, two affiliated investment
advisory companies, Lieber & Company, a New York general partnership, and Evergreen Asset Management Corp.,
a Delaware corporation, (collectively referred to as ``Lieber''). 




Mellon Bank, N.A., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Mellon) filed a notice with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(OCC) on December 30, 1993 (Mellon Notice), pursuant to  5.34, advising the OCC of Mellon's intent to establish
certain operating subsidiaries. The Mellon Notice describes Mellon's intent to acquire, through operating subsidiaries,
most of the assets, operations and activities of The Dreyfus Corporation, a New York corporation (Dreyfus). 
The First Union and Mellon Notices propose activities for operating subsidiaries that have been approved for national
banks. The magnitude of the Mellon transaction, however, is significant. Because the First Union Notice involves
the acquisition of entities that engage in activities similar to Dreyfus, the OCC considers it appropriate to consolidate
the two notices for the purpose of soliciting public comment. 
Although notices filed pursuant to  5.34 do not require public comment under existing OCC regulations, the
OCC has reserved the right, pursuant to  5.2(b), to adopt procedures different from those specifically provided
in its corporate applications regulations if the OCC deems such actions appropriate in acting on a particular application
or filing. The OCC considers it appropriate to seek comments from the public concerning the First Union and Mellon
Notices. 
First Union has assets of approximately $20 billion. Both First Union and its holding company, First Union Corporation
(FTU), which has assets of approximately $71 billion, already have substantial involvement in trust and investment
activities, including mutual fund administration, brokerage, master trust and custody, institutional investment
management and personal trust. FTU currently administers approximately $43 billion in assets and manages approximately
$27 billion in assets. The Evergreen family of 15 mutual funds currently has assets of approximately $3.6 billion.
Lieber principally provides investment advice and administrative services to the Evergreen funds, several large
institutional investors and a number of high net worth individuals. The First Union Notice details the functions
currently performed by Lieber for its clients. 
Mellon has assets of approximately $28 billion. Both Mellon and its holding company, Mellon Bank Corporation (MBC),
which has assets of approximately $36 billion, already have substantial involvement in trust and investment activities,
including mutual fund administration, brokerage, master trust and custody, institutional investment management
and personal trust. MBC currently administers approximately $615 billion in assets and manages approximately $135
billion in assets. Dreyfus, the sixth-largest mutual fund company in the United States, provides investment advice
and administrative services to over 130 mutual funds with approximately $80 billion in assets. 
The Mellon Notice details the function of each of the existing Dreyfus corporations and subsidiaries and sets forth
which entities will be acquired as operating subsidiaries of Mellon, which will be acquired as operating subsidiaries
of MBC, and which will be sold or liquidated. Pursuant to Mellon's proposal, several of the Dreyfus entities will become
operating subsidiaries of Mellon. The Dreyfus operations currently include subsidiaries which provide investment
advisory, brokerage, and administrative services to registered investment companies which are known to the public
as the Dreyfus family of mutual funds. 
The OCC invites public comment on the First Union and Mellon Notices in order to provide interested parties with an
opportunity to express their views concerning the proposed acquisitions that may assist the OCC in making a final
determination concerning the First Union and Mellon Notices. 
The First Union and Mellon Notices and any public comments submitted are available for inspection by appointment
at the OCC headquarters in Washington, DC. Appointments may be made by calling the Disclosure Unit at the telephone
number listed in the 

ADDRESSES 

section of this request for public comment. Photocopies of the First Union and Mellon Notices and any public comments
submitted are available upon written request from the Disclosure Unit at the address indicated in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this request for public comment. Pursuant to 12 CFR 4.17, a fee may be assessed to cover duplication costs.


Interested persons are encouraged to express their views in writing to the OCC concerning the First Union and Mellon
Notices.

market participant which had more than $50 billion equivalent in foreign exchange contracts on the last business
day of any calendar quarter during the previous year (ending March, June, September, or December) calculated using
then prevailing exchange rates. The quarterly FC-3 reports must be filed throughout the calendar year by each
foreign market participant which had more than $1 billion equivalent in foreign exchange contracts on the last business
day of any calendar quarter during the previous year (ending March, June, September, or December) calculated using
then prevailing exchange rates. Such contracts include the amounts of foreign exchange spot contracts bought and
sold, foreign exchange forward contracts bought and sold, foreign exchange futures bought and sold, and one half
the notional amount of foreign exchange options bought and sold. 
Institutions required to report include all banks and banking institutions in the United States; the agencies, branches,
and subsidiaries located in the United States of foreign banks and banking institutions; business concerns and nonprofit
institutions; brokers; dealers; mutual fund, foreign exchange, and hedge fund managers, and other concerns located
in the United States, whether sole proprietorships, partnerships, groups, associations, syndicates, trusts,
or corporations, including the U.S. branches and subsidiaries of foreign nonbanking concerns. U.S. reporters should
include data for all domestic and foreign branches and subsidiaries. U.S. subsidiaries of foreign entities should
file for themselves and their subsidiaries, but not for their parents. In determining whether exemptions apply and
in filing reports, reportable items of direct and indirect subsidiaries_including banks, Edge Acts, and nonbanks_should
be consolidated with those of the parent. Inter- and intra-company off-balance sheet contracts should be reported
on a gross basis. 
Banks which file the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) 035 report (``Monthly Consolidated
Foreign Currency Report'') are not required to file the FC-2 or FC-3 reports. Holding companies whose
subsidiaries file FFIEC 035 reports are not required to file the FC-2 report unless, directly or indirectly,
the holding company has foreign exchange contracts of $10 billion or more which are not reflected in FFEIC 035 reports.
In such cases, the holding company should report all foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency-denominated
assets and liabilities on FC-2 which are not included on FFIEC 035 reports. 


How to Report


The reports are to be submitted on forms provided by the Department of the Treasury and the district Federal Reserve
Banks. Computer printouts in the same format as the form may be used if approved in writing by the district Federal Reserve
Bank to which it is submitted. The use of a facsimile machine is recommended for weekly reports, optional for monthly
and quarterly reports. 


Enforcement Provided by Law 


United States persons who meet the reporting requirements are advised that failure to report can result in a civil
penalty up to $10,000 (31 U.S.C. 5321(a)(3); 31 CFR 128.4(c)).

<DOCTITLE>Survey of Selected Foreign Financial Assets as of March 31, 1994</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Departmental Offices, Department of the Treasury.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of reporting requirements and availability of survey forms and instructions.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

By this Notice the Department of the Treasury is informing the public that it is conducting a mandatory survey of United
States residents' ownership and/or custody of selected financial claims on foreigners other than long-term debt
or equity securities. The purpose of this survey is to reassess the value of various classes of portfolio capital positions
on foreigners as currently reported by United States persons under the Treasury International Capitol reporting
system. The data will be used to ensure the quality and completeness of international financial statistics which
are vital components used in determining the international investment position and in compiling the official balance
of payments accounts of the United States. These data are also important in the formulation of the U.S. Government's
international financial and monetary policies. The survey has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget
pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act under OMB Control No. 1505-0150.



This survey has been designed to collect systematic and consistent information on selected classes of financial
claims on foreigners owned by U.S. persons as of March 31, 1994, while holding the reporting requirements to a minimum.
The survey's approach is to collect data from global custodians located in the United States to the extent possible.
Data are requested only by type of instrument. Data are not required on individual claims and financial instruments,
nor on the geographical distribution of such assets. The survey collects data on certain types of claims on foreigners
owned by U.S. persons that represent portfolio investment. Reportable claims include deposits with foreign institutions,
financial instruments with an original maturity of one year or less, and loans to foreigners. Excluded are direct
investments, equity holdings, debt securities with an original maturity of more than one year, contingent claims,
and off-balance sheet contracts, including unsettled spot and forward foreign exchange contracts, options, and
warrants. More detailed information on the categories of claims and financial instruments to report is provided
in the survey form and instructions.

This Notice constitutes legal notification to all United States persons that they must respond to, and comply with,
this survey if they are subject to the reporting requirements set forth below in Who Must Report. United States persons
who are required to report but who do not receive a set of the ``Survey of Selected Foreign Financial Assets ``forms
and instructions, should obtain copies by contacting the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at (212) 720-8238,
or the Department of the Treasury at (202) 622-2250.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The International Investment and Trade in Services Act (22 U.S.C. 3101

while minimizing the reporting burden on respondents. The Act specifies that regular data collection programs and
surveys, as outlined in the Act, or as deemed necessary by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Executive Order
(E.O.) 11961, shall be conducted to secure information on international capital flows and other information related
to international portfolio investment, including information that may be necessary for computing and analyzing
the U.S. balance of payments. Regulations governing the current survey, 31 CFR part 128, were published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 2, 1993, 58 FR 58494-58497. The preamble to the regulations stated that notice of specific report
forms and instructions would be published separately in the 

Federal Register

.

TITLE:

 Labor, Conflict Resolution, and Economic Development: Strategies To Address Human Resource Management Problems
in Brazil.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Citizen Exchanges (E/P) announces a competitive grants program for non-profit organizations to develop
programs in the area of labor/management relations and human resource management. The project should link the U.S.
organization's international exchange interests with counterparts in the American Republics.



Interested applicants are urged to read the complete 

Federal Register

 announcement before addressing inquiries to the Office or submitting their proposals. After the deadline for submitting
proposals, USIA officers may not discuss this competition in any way with applicants until final decisions are made.




ANNOUNCEMENT NAME AND NUMBER:

 All communications concerning this announcement should refer to the AR Local Government Project. This announcement
number is 

E/P-94-25

. Please refer to this title and number in all correspondence or telephone calls to USIA.

Labor-management human resource development in the U.S. telecommunications, automobile, construction and steel
industries provides practical models for the situation in Brazil. The following case studies are suggested as sources:
The AT&T/CWA Alliance project; the pioneering work of the UAW and the automobile industry; and the entry level
programs of the construction industry in tandem with the building trades organizations of the AFL-CIO.

The research of former Labor Secretary Ray Marshall and Dr. Barry Bluestone could also be consulted, in addition to
more recent efforts by U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich. Other sources include labor studies centers such as those
at George Washington University and the University of the District of Columbia; the AIFLD education program at the
George Meany Center for Labor Studies; the AFL-CIO's Human Resource Institute; the National Association of
Manufacturers; and the Conference Board.

Models used to illustrate effective labor-management-government relations must include those involving currently-employed
individuals, the chronically unemployed, and new entrants into the labor pool.

The decisive and expanding role of labor-management cooperation should be emphasized as a key element in meeting
the competitive challenges of the global economy. The program should also emphasize the coordination between human
resource development delivery methods and the constant change that occurs in business and industry.



Selection of Participants



Participants must be policymakers who can influence changes in Brazil, not management experts and professionals.
Participants will be selected by the grantee, or its local co-sponsoring organization, in consultation with USIS
posts. This two-way support will ensure effective discussion of new models for cooperation and innovation; these
models should encourage more participation between labor and management, supporting Brazil's effort to secure
more private sector initiative resulting in a more competitive market economy.

This project will be executed by a U.S. not-for-profit institution that, through its proposal, illustrates extensive
experience and success in coordinating international exchange programs. U.S. organizations with established
working relationships with counterpart institutions in Brazil will receive priority under this competition.

At the conclusion of the exchange, the grantee will conduct participant evaluations and submit a final report to USIA.



Funding



Competition for USIA funding support is intense. Selection of a grantee institution is based on the substantive nature
of the program proposal; the applicant's professional capability to carry the program through to successful conclusion;
the cost effectiveness such as in-kind contributions and the ability to keep overhead costs at a minimum. USIA can
devote up to $175,000 for this project; however, organizations with fewer than four years of successful experience
in managing international exchange programs are limited to $60,000, and their budget submission should correspond
to this limitation.

All proposals should demonstrate in-depth, substantive knowledge of the relevant issues, established connections
with partner institutions, and the capacity to organize and conduct the program. Organizational abilities include:
appropriate orientation activities for the participants; detailed work plan for all phases of the project; tentative
agendas for study tours, workshops, and internships; letters of commitment from internship hosts; and selection
procedures.

Note:

 Applicants may wish to consult the USIS office at the appropriate U.S. Embassy before submitting proposals.




USIA will give priority to proposals from U.S. organizations with partner organizations in the American Republics
that can help ensure the program meets its goals and objectives. Applicants are encouraged to demonstrate partner
relationships by providing copies of correspondence or other materials as appendices to proposals.

Moreover, these partner institutions are encouraged to provide cost-sharing or significant in-kind contributions
such as local housing, transportation, interpreting, translating and other local currency costs and to assist with
the organization of projects.



Materials Development



USIA encourages the development, where needed, of written, audio and video materials in the local language to enhance
the programs. For example, if not already available, glossaries of specialized terms in local government or public
administration might be developed.



Scope



Proposals should limit their focus to local governance. Proposals for programs that are broader in scope will be eligible,
but are less likely to receive USIA support. USIA encourages proposals that feature ``train the trainers'' models;
the creation of indigenous training centers; schemes to create professional networks or professional associations
to disseminate information; and other enduring aspects.



Participant Selection



All grant proposals must clearly describe the type of persons who will participate in the program as well as the process
by which participants will be selected. Programs in support of internships in the U.S. must include letters tentatively
committing host institutions to support the internships.

In the selection of all foreign participants, USIA and USIS Posts retain the right to nominate participants and to
accept or deny participants recommended by the program institution.

While applicants must provide an all-inclusive budget with the proposal, they may also include separate sub-budgets
for each program component, phase, location, or activity. Competition for USIA funding support is keen.






Note:

 All participants will be covered under the terms of a USIA-sponsored health insurance policy. The premium is paid
by USIA directly to the insurance company.




The following costs are eligible for funding:

1. 

Transportation costs.

 International and domestic air fares, visas, transit costs, and ground transportation costs are eligible for funding.

2. 

Per Diem.

 For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat $140/day for program participants or the published
U.S. Federal per diem rates for individual American cities. For activities outside the U.S., the published federal
per diem rates must be used.






Note:

 Grantee staff must use the published federal per diem rates, not the flat rate.




3. 

Interpreters.

 Interpreters for the U.S. program are provided by the U.S. State Department Language Services Division. Generally,
two simultaneous interpreters are provided for every four visitors who need interpretation. USIA grants do not pay
for foreign interpreters to accompany delegations from their home country.

Grant proposal budgets should contain a flat $140/day per diem for each Department of State (DOS) interpreter, as
well as home-program-home air transportation of $400 per interpreter plus any U.S. travel expenses during the program.






Note:

 Salary expenses for interpreters are covered elsewhere and should not be part of an applicant's proposed budget.




4. 

Book and cultural allowance.

 Participants are entitled to a one-time cultural allowance of $150 per person, in addition to a book allowance of $50.
Escorts are reimbursed for actual cultural expenses up to $150. U.S. staff do not receive these allowances.

5. 

Consultants.

 Consultants may be employed to provide specialized expertise or to make presentations. Generally, honoraria should
not exceed $250 per day.

Subcontracting organizations may also be used, in which case the written agreement between the prospective grantee
and subcontractor should be included with the proposal.

6. 

Room rental.

 Room rental should not exceed $250 per day.

7. 

Materials development.

 Proposals may contain costs to purchase, develop, and translate materials for participants.

8. 

One working meal per project.

 Per capita costs may not exceed $5-$8 for a lunch and $14-$20 for a dinner; this amount includes room rental
if applicable. The number of invited guests may not exceed participants by more than a factor of two to one.

9. 

A return travel allowance of $70 for each participant.

 This allowance is for incidental expenditures incurred during international travel.

10. 

Costs for an audit.

 The proposal MUST include the cost of an audit that:

a. Complies with the requirements of OMB circular No. 1-133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and
Other Nonprofit Institutions;

b. Complies with the requirements of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of
Position (SOP) No. 92-9; and

c. Includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of a recipient-prepared supplemental schedule of indirect
cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed.

The audit costs shall be identified separately for:

a. Preparation of basic financial statements, and other accounting services; and

b. Preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular No. A-133, AICPA SOP 92-9,
and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation.

11. 

Cost-sharing.

 Cost-sharing in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs is encouraged. The recipient must maintain written
records to support all allowable costs claimed as being its contribution to cost participation, as well as costs to
be paid by the U.S. government. Such records are subject to audit.

The basis for determining the value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A-110,
Attachment E, ``Cost-sharing and Matching'' and should be described in the proposal. In the event the recipient does
not provide the minimum amount of cost sharing as stipulated in the recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution
will be reduced in proportion to the recipient's contribution.



Application Requirements



Proposals must be structured in accordance with the instructions contained in the application package.



Review Process



USIA will acknowledge receipt of all proposals and will review them for technical eligibility. Proposals will be
deemed ineligible if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines established herein and in the application packet.
Eligible proposals will be forwarded to panels of USIA officers for advisory review. Proposals are reviewed by USIS
posts and by USIA's Office of American Republics. Proposals may also be reviewed by the Office of General Counsel or
other Agency offices. Funding decisions are at the discretion of the Associate Director for Educational and Cultural
Affairs. Final technical authority for grant awards resides with USIA's contracting officer.

The award of any grant is subject to availability of funds. The U.S. Government reserves the right to reject any or all
applications received. USIA will not pay for design and development costs associated with submitting a proposal.
Applications are submitted at the risk of the applicant; should circumstances prevent award of a grant all preparation
and submission costs are at the applicant's expense.

USIA will not award funds for activities conducted prior to the actual grant award.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Regional Conflict Resolution in Sub-Saharan Africa



USIA will accept proposals to conduct a two-way exchange program to encourage and support the development of conflict
resolution capability in African regional or subregional institutions. The amount requested from USIA should not
exceed $125,000. For technical information, interested organizations may contact E/P Program Specialist Charlotte
Peterson at (202) 619-5319.



Project Themes and Objectives



This project will encourage Africans to support conflict resolution within the region as an activity in the common
interest of all, fostering stability and economic development in the region as a whole. The project should help strengthen
relevant regional organizational capabilities, and the grantee is expected to work closely with an Africa-based
multilateral organization interested in conflict resolution for this purpose. Together with that body and area
U.S. Information Service (USIS) posts, the grantee will identify key government, military and NGO leaders to participate
in the exchanges; these participants should represent several African countries as well as the regional organization.

The project will include at least two phases: (1) A U.S. phase designed to introduce African participants to American
specialists and approaches to local and international conflict resolution and (2) one or more visits of American
specialists to Africa to conduct consultations, workshops or other activities with local counterparts.

The project should be designed to:




_Help develop resources and skills for conflict management/resolution in an Africa-based international or multilateral
organization whose goals include management/resolution of conflicts in the region;

_Introduce African participants to principles of American pluralism and American institutions and modalities
for peaceful management and resolution of differences among ethnic and interest groups;

_Emphasize U.S. commitment to peaceful resolution of conflicts at home and abroad;

_Arrange meetings of African participants with leading American authorities on international and regional conflict
resolution theories and techniques;

_Provide opportunities for African participants to engage in substantive discussions with American specialists,
with representatives of an African regional organization, and with one another on conflict resolution in the African
area;

_Facilitate cross-disciplinary and cross-national networking among African participants to help form constituencies
in support of multilateral efforts to prevent, manage, and resolve conflicts in Africa.



Conflict Resolution in South Africa



USIA will accept proposals for the development of an exchange program to support conflict resolution in South Africa.
The amount requested from USIA should not exceed $125,000. Applicants are encouraged to present their own creative
program ideas within the general theme of conflict resolution in South Africa. For technical information, interested
organizations may contact E/P Program Specialist Charlotte Peterson at (202) 619-5319.



Promoting Cooperation and Understanding Between Arab and Jewish Municipal Government Inside Israel



USIA will accept proposals for the development of a two-way exchange program to reduce tensions and increase cooperation
between municipal governments in the Jewish and Arab sectors inside Israel. The amount requested from USIA should
not exceed $125,000. For technical information, interested organizations may contact E/P Program Specialist Charlotte
Peterson at (202) 619-5319.



Background/Objectives



As Israelis and Palestinians work toward implementing the declaration of principles, the U.S. Mission in Israel
is encouraging greater cooperation among Israeli-Arabs and Jews. This project will contribute to the overall peace
process and resolution of conflict between the two ethnic groups by encouraging interaction and advancing successful
Arab integration into Israeli society. Bringing mayors and municipal officials from both sides together with American
counterparts, the program will enhance leadership skills, including the skills of negotiation and conflict resolution,
and emphasize the economic and social benefits of increased intermunicipal cooperation.

_Introduce participants to theories and practice of conflict prevention and conflict resolution at the local level;
_Demonstrate pluralism in the United States and the interaction of interest groups representing various ethnic
and other minorities;
_Provide opportunities for members of the group to discuss, among themselves and with American specialists, how
American models might pertain to their situation at home. 


Recommended Structural/Procedural Objectives 


_At least one exchange visit in each direction. The U.S. visit might be organized as a study tour of at least three weeks'
duration, allowing a group of 8-12 Jewish and Arab mayors and municipal officials to visit several U.S. cities.
_American participants should also travel to Israel for consultations, workshops or other activities with their
local counterparts.
_Knowledge of English on the part of the participants from Israel will not be required.


Arbitration: Building Dispute Resolution Mechanisms in Palestinian Society


USIA will accept proposals designed to support the development of a two-way exchange program to assist Palestinian
lawyers and legal institutions in establishing internationally credible dispute and conflict resolution mechanisms
in the fields of commerce, labor, and civil matters. The amount requested from USIA should not exceed $125,000. For
technical information, interested organizations may contact E/P Program Specialist Charlotte Peterson at (202)
619-5319.


Background/Objectives


Palestinian society has traditionally depended on a dispute arbitration mechanism centered on prominent figures,
such as clan or village leaders, to mediate and resolve commercial, social, and family disputes. While other Middle
Eastern societies have moved beyond this traditional process of mediation_at least for resolution of commercial
and legal disputes_Palestinians have, in the absence of a rational legal structure in the occupied territories,
continued to rely almost exclusively on this informal, consensual process. As the peace process evolves toward Palestinian
autonomy, it has become critical that Palestinians adopt internationally credible models of dispute resolution
as a 

sine qua non 

for attracting the international investment essential to bolster Palestinian autonomy.
The project should be designed to:



_Familiarize Palestinian legal experts_many of whom are now working on the general outlines of a constitution and
legal framework to govern the autonomous regions_with the types of arbitration organizations and mechanisms Americans
rely on to resolve commercial, labor, and other disputes. This introduction should be squarely placed within a framework
of the judicial system in the United States.
_Promote cooperation between Palestinian and American experts in formulating and proposing specific dispute resolution
mechanisms for the Palestinian autonomous regions.
_Provide, as a third exchange component, internships with an American arbitration group for a small group of Palestinians
closely involved with the evolution of dispute resolution mechanisms within the autonomous authority, so that they
might learn how arbitration mechanisms actually work in American society. 



Recommended Structural/Procedural Objectives 



_A visit to the United States, to take place as early as possible, for six to eight Palestinian legal experts to become
familiar with arbitration organizations and conflict resolution mechanisms. A three-week program, with visits
to at least three cities.
_Travel of three or four American legal experts involved in the first component of the exchange, to take place after
a lapse of several months, to work for four to six weeks in Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza with legal experts on formulating
dispute resolution mechanisms for the Palestinian autonomous regions.

_Three Palestinians involved with the evolution of dispute mechanisms within the autonomous authority would travel
to the United States for a one-semester internship with an American arbitration group.



American Republics (AR)_Nicaragua and Guatemala Only



USIA will accept separate proposals designed to support conflict resolution in Nicaragua and Guatemala. Proposals
targeting other countries in the region will not be accepted. The amount requested from USIA should not exceed $65,000
for Nicaragua or $35,000 for Guatemala. For technical information, interested organizations may contact 


E/P Program Specialist Ben Cromer at (202) 619-5326. USIS post consultation by applicants, prior to submission
of proposals, is recommended.



Background for Nicaragua



Nicaraguans historically have found it hard to resolve their own conflicts. They have often tried to enlist outsiders,
frequently from the U.S., as partisans in their disputes, or turned to them for mediation and arbitration when all
else has failed. This dynamic has been a source of instability for over 150 years.

Some Nicaraguans recognize this failing and are trying to remedy it. In the past year, two university-linked research
institutes have been formed to study conflict resolution. A local environmental group sponsored a workshop organized
by professional U.S. mediators on resolving environmental disputes, hosted by the new binational center. Still,
if Nicaraguans are to complete this process successfully, they need training and support.

U.S. policy today is to encourage Nicaraguans to resolve their internal conflicts without looking to the U.S. for
assistance and/or intervention. With this in mind, the Post proposes a project to strengthen Nicaraguan conflict
resolution. USIA will work with the grantee and local organizations to identify a bipartisan (the only conceivable
approach) pool of trainees who could conduct conflict resolution training for other Nicaraguans and provide mediation
services and related activities (fact-finding, curriculum development, etc.). This program would respond to a
historic need in Nicaragua.

Background for Guatemala



Guatemala's 33 year-old civil war has cost more than 100,000 lives, has severely hindered democratic and social development
in the country, and has adversely affected the fortunes of every government of Guatemala since the war's inception.
Although heated constitutional and political battles dominate daily headlines, this conflict continues to cast
a long shadow over the country's future.

Media co-sponsorship would be desirable, such as by the centrist daily Siglo XXI and its publisher, Jorge Reuben Zamora;
the issues-oriented talk show ``Libre Encuentro'' and its host, Dionisio Gutierrez; and Guatemala's newest daily,
La Republica, which, though it probably has the smallest readership, is well-written and tightly edited, and is supported
by the media family, Marroquin.

The Post envisions meetings and workshops at a neutral site, such as Miami, which is both easily accessible to Guatemalans
and equipped with the resources necessary to support such a program. A site such as Miami, which is also home base to
many CentAm beat reporters, would likely generate considerable regional coverage and encourage the participation
of key participants such as Rigoberta Menchu and Frank LaRue, as well as younger members of the URNG.

The program must focus on specific issues (i.e. refugee resettlement, land tenure, political participation by the
URNG), and be managed by professionals. Innovation is absolutely necessary to avoid the dry and meaningless ``round
tables'' and seminars that are so common in Guatemala itself.

East Asia and the Pacific (EA)



USIA will accept proposals for the development of exchange programs to support conflict resolution in the East Asia
and Pacific region. Exchange programs may include but not be limited to conferences or symposia. The amount requested
from USIA should not exceed $200,000.

U.S. foreign policy in Asia is receptive to the concept of regional security consultations. The ASEAN-U.S.
dialogue has been expanded to include security discussions through the ASEAN Regional Forum (AFR), for example.
Russia has been invited to participate in ARF, along with China, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea. The USG has also
welcomed the holding of symposia sponsored by the private sector on Northeast Asia security.

<PARENT> FR940224-2-00094 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Applicants are encouraged to view these security dialogues as conflict resolution arrangements where potential
adversaries talk to each other rather than form blocs against a common adversary. Proposals should present ideas
as to how to extend the dialogue to encompass the entire East Asia and Pacific region or how to enhance the evolving subregional
dialogues (e.g. ASEAN, North Asia). Proposals should treat conflict resolution as preventive diplomacy, including
reducing tensions, building confidence, and deterring arms races in addition to contributing to the solution of
specific conflicts or potential specific conflicts.

Security (and thus, conflict resolution) may be broadly defined to include regional issues that directly or indirectly
contribute to security (or the lack thereof), such as economic growth and other conditions affecting trade and social
stability, including environmental and energy issues, and population questions.

A conflict resolution project focussed on Northeast Asia should account for private as well as public sector interests,
and should be aimed toward stimulating participants' appreciation of the benefits to the East Asia and Pacific community
as a whole to be derived from discussions of both the opportunities for cooperation and the potential conflicts in
the subregion.

For projects that focus on Northeast Asia, the area may include Japan, China, Russia, the Korean peninsula, and the
U.S.

For additional information on regionwide or subregional emphases, grant applicants may contact Margaret Eubank,
Cultural Coordinator in USIA's Office of East Asia and Pacific Affairs, at (202) 619-5837. For technical information,
interested organizations may contact E/P Program Specialist Elroy Carlson at (202) 619-5326.



Europe



USIA will not accept proposals for this region.



The Newly Independent States



USIA will not accept proposals for this region.



Additional Guidelines and Restrictions



USIA is interested in supporting programs which will lay the groundwork for new and continuing links between American
and foreign professional organizations and non-governmental organizations in the area of conflict resolution
and in the specific fields mentioned in the above project descriptions. Proposals which are overly ambitious and
those which are very general will not be competitive. Therefore, institutions should provide strong evidence of
their ability to accomplish a few tasks exceptionally well. General structural or procedural objectives for all
of the above projects include the following:




_development of institutional links which continue beyond the duration of USIA funding support, preferably with
funding commitments;

_development and distribution of written, audio and video instructional materials to complement and enhance the
program.

_coordination, in the design of these programs, with U.S. Information Service offices overseas, and with foreign
government officials and private sector leaders with direct knowledge and experience in the thematic area.




Bureau grants are not given to support projects whose focus is limited to technical issues, or for research projects,
developing publications for dissemination in the United States, individual student exchange, film festivals,
or exhibits. Neither does the Office of Citizen Exchanges provide scholarships or support for long-term (a semester
or more) academic studies. Competitions sponsored by other Bureau offices are also announced in the 

Federal Register

 and may have different application requirements as well as different objectives.



Participants



All grant proposals should clearly describe the type of persons who will participate in the program as well as the process
by which participants will be selected. However, USIA and USIS posts retain the right to nominate all foreign participants
and to accept or deny participants recommended by grantee institutions. Grantee institutions will often provide
support, as requested by USIA, in the nomination of participants.

The grantee should provide the names of American participants and brief, relevant biographical data. American participants
should be selected on the basis of their experience and expertise in the thematic field. Relevant language ability,
experience in communicating to foreign audiences and general knowledge of the regions and countries involved in
the respective projects are highly desirable.

<PARENT> FR940224-2-00094 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The USIS offices will facilitate the issuance of visas and other program-related materials.



Programmatic Considerations



Pursuant to the legislation authorizing the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, programs must maintain
a nonpolitical character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social
and cultural life.

USIA will give priority to proposals from U.S. organizations with relevant institutional contacts in the countries
involved in the various projects described above. Partner institutions are encouraged to provide cost-sharing
or significant in-kind contributions such as local housing and transportation, interpreting, translating and
other local currency costs. These institutions are also encouraged to assist with the organization of various program
activities.

The grantee will be responsible for most arrangements associated with this program. These include selecting speakers,
themes, and topics for discussion; organizing a coherent progression of activities; providing international and
domestic travel arrangements for all foreign participants and U.S. domestic travel for escort-interpreters; making
lodging and local transportation arrangements for visitors; orienting and debriefing participants; preparing
any necessary support materials; and working with host institutions and individuals to achieve maximum program
effectiveness.

At the start of the U.S. portion of a program, the grantee should conduct an orientation session for the visiting delegation
which addresses substantive details of the program as well as geographic, historical, and cross-cultural factors
which they should consider to enhance program success.

Upon conclusion of the program the grantee will be required to submit a report to E/P summarizing results of the entire
program.



Other Logistical Considerations



Program monitoring and oversight will be provided by appropriate USIA elements. Per Diem support from host institutions
during an internship component is strongly encouraged. However, for all programs which include internships, a nonprofit
grantee institution which receives funds from corporate or other cosponsors should then use those monies to provide
food, lodging, and pocket money for the participants. In no case could the intern receive a wage or ``be hired'' by the
sponsoring institution. Internships should also have an American studies/values orientation component at the
beginning of the exchange program in the U.S. Grantee institutions should try to maximize cost-sharing in all facets
of their program design, and to stimulate U.S. private sector (foundation and corporate) support.



Funding



Organizations with less than four years of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are
limited to $60,000.

Competition for USIA funding support is keen. The final selection of a grantee institution will depend on assessment
of proposals according to the review criteria delineated below.

While applicants must provide on all-inclusive budget with the proposal, they are also encouraged to include separate
sub-budgets for each program component, phase, location or activity.

The recipient's proposal shall include the cost of an audit that: (1) Complies with the requirements of OMB Circular
No. A-133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit Institutions; (2) complies with
the requirements of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) No.
92-9; and (3) includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of a recipient-prepared supplemental
schedule of indirect cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed.

The audit costs shall be identified separately for: (1) Preparation of basic financial statements and other accounting
services; and (2) preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular No. A-133,
AICPA SOP 92-9, and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation.

USIA will consider funding the following project costs: 

1. International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs (e.g., airport taxes); ground transportation costs.


2. Per diem: For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat $140/day for international participants
or the published Federal Travel Regulations per diem rates for individual American cities. NOTE: U.S. escorting
staff must use the published federal per diem rates, not the flat rate. For activities overseas, the Standard Government
Travel Regulations per diem rates must be used. 

3. Interpreters: For the U.S. program interpreters are provided by the U.S. State Department Language Services Division.
Typically, a pair of simultaneous interpreters is provided for every four visitors who need interpretation. USIA
grants do not pay for foreign interpreters to accompany delegations from their home country. Grant proposal budgets
should contain a flat $140/day per diem for each DOS interpreter, as well as home-program-home air transportation
of $400 per interpreter plus any U.S. travel expenses during the program. Salary expenses are covered centrally and
should not be part of an applicant's proposed budget. 

4. Book and cultural allowance: Participants are entitled to a one-time cultural allowance of $150 per person, plus
a book allowance of $50. Escorts are reimbursed for actual cultural expenses up to $150. U.S. staff do not get these
benefits. 

5. Consultants: May be used to provide specialized expertise or to make presentations. Honoraria generally do not
exceed $250 per day. Subcontracting organizations may also be used, in which case the written contract(s) must be
included in the proposal. 

6. Room rental: Generally should not exceed $250 per day. 

7. Materials Development: Proposals may contain costs to purchase, develop and translate materials for participants.
USIA reserves the rights to these materials for future use. 

8. One working meal per project: Per capita cost may not exceed $5-8 per lunch and $14-20 per dinner, excluding
room rental. The number of invited guests may not exceed the number of participants by more than a factor of two to one.


9. Return travel allowance: $70 for each participant which is to be used for incidental expenditures incurred during
international travel. 

10. Other costs necessary for the effective administration of the program, including salaries for grant organization
employees, benefits, and other direct and indirect costs per detailed instructions in the application package.


E/P encourages cost-sharing, which may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The Recipient must maintain
written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation,
as well as costs to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the
value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A-110, Attachment E, ``Cost-sharing
and Matching,'' and should be described in the proposal. In the event the Recipient does not meet the minimum amount
of cost-sharing as stipulated in the Recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution will be reduced in proportion
to the Recipient's contribution. 

Please note: All delegates will be covered under the terms of a USIA/sponsored health insurance policy. The premium
is paid by USIA directly to the insurance company. 



Application Requirements



Proposals must be structured in accordance with the instructions contained in the Application Package. Confirmation
letters from U.S. and foreign co-sponsors noting their intention to participate in the program will enhance a proposal.




Review Process



USIA will acknowledge receipt of all proposals and will review them for technical eligibility. Proposals will be
deemed ineligible if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines established herein and in the Application Package.


Eligible proposals will be forwarded to panels of USIA officers for advisory review. All eligible proposals will
be reviewed by the appropriate geographic area offices and the budget and contract offices. Proposals may also be
reviewed by the Office of General Counsel or other Agency offices. Funding decisions are at the discretion of the Associate
Director for Educational and Cultural Affairs. Final technical authority for grant awards resides with USIA's contracting
officer. The award of any grant is subject to availability of funds. 

The U.S. Government reserves the right to reject any or all applications received. USIA will not pay for design and
development costs associated with submitting a proposal. Applications are submitted at the risk of the applicant;
should circumstances prevent award of a grant, all preparation and submission costs are at the applicant's expense.
USIA will not award funds for activities conducted prior to the actual grant award.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Citizen Exchanges (E/P) of the United States Information Agency's Bureau of Educational and Cultural
Affairs announces a competitive grants program for nonprofit organizations to develop multi-phased exchange programs
for journalism educators. There will be two separate exchange programs, and American organizations are invited
to submit proposals for one or both. One program will be for 10 to 12 educators from the Middle East and North Africa;
the other program will be for 10 to 12 educators from South Asia. The journalism educators will come to the United States
for an intensive, six-week study program in American journalism education, with emphasis on curriculum development,
the relationship of education to the practice of journalism, the development of professionalism in journalism,
and an introduction to American print media, from student publications at the university and secondary school levels
to substantive contact with newspapers. During the second phase of each exchange program, two teams of two American
journalism educators will travel to selected countries for consultations with phase one participants and their
colleagues. Each team will visit two or three countries and will focus on curriculum development and the establishment
of student publications as an educational device. These target countries will be selected through consultations
among USIA, USIS posts and the program organizer after completion of the first program component.


Interested applicants are urged to read the complete 

Federal Register

 announcement before addressing inquiries to the Office or submitting their proposals. After the RFP deadline, the
Office of Citizen Exchanges may not discuss this competition in any way with applicants until the final decisions
are made.

Background/Objectives of This Program



The end of colonialism and the consequent dramatic rise in the number of sovereign states in the developing world have
produced an equally dramatic rise in the scope and diversity of available news media, both print and broadcast. However,
much of the reporting disseminated through these media is flawed by the absence of journalistic skills, appropriate
educational background, and appreciation for professional standards among those employed as journalists. In addition,
media throughout the Near East, North Africa, and South Asia are often utilized to mold public opinion, rather than
to provide objective information, and to rally support for the policies of parties holding or seeking power, rather
than to present an independent, credible account or a responsible analysis of social and political phenomena.

The primary objective of this program is to further the development of journalism education as an independent academic
discipline in North Africa, the Near East, and South Asia, and thereby to strengthen substantive, responsible, and
objective media reporting, reflecting international recognized standards of journalistic professionalism.

Project proposals should focus on the cultivation of a cadre of journalism educators_both professors and deans of
schools of journalism_from the Near East and North Africa, or from South Asia, who are persuaded of the need for curricular
reform and development in order to train well educated, responsible journalists and who are able and willing to translate
their convictions into efforts to bring about such reform and development.



Participants



Journalism educators from the Middle East and North Africa who will participate in the U.S. phase of this program will
be provided the service of bilingual escort-interpreters in Arabic, with one interpreter for each five/six participants
and one language-fluent escort for the group (to be facilitated by USIA through the U.S. Department of State). For
American consultants participating in the second component of the Near East/North African exchange, fluency in
Arabic or French, depending on the countries visited and the language preference of the anticipated audiences, would
be desirable. In the absence of language fluency, arrangements should be made by the grantee organization, in consultation
with USIS posts, for interpretation. Participating educators in the South Asian exchange must possess strong English
language skills. American consultants traveling to South Asia during the second component of the program may require
the service of interpreters, depending upon the language facility of the South Asian educators with whom they will
work in the region. Again, the grantee organization should coordinate arrangements for in-country interpreters
with the appropriate USIS posts.

Participants will be nominated through coordination among USIA, U.S. Information Service personal in the region,
and overseas partner institutions. USIA and the participating USIS posts retain the right to nominate all participants
and to accept or reject participants recommended by grantee institutions. The U.S. consultants who will travel abroad
will be selected by the grantee institution in consultation with USIA.

USIS officers in participating countries will facilitate the issuance of visas and other program-related material.



Programmatic Considerations



Thematically, each program should:




_Analyze the current status of professional journalism and journalism education in the participants' countries
of origin and determine, in conjunction with USIS posts in these countries and with the journalism educators selected
as participants, the needs to be addressed by the exchange;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940224-2-00161 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940224-2-00095 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

_Provide the participants both a general and a specific overview of journalism education and the practice of journalism
in the United States, beginning with an historic perspective and a survey of the evolution of the public media in the
context of a socially diverse and politically democratic country;

_Conduct for the participants short, intensive, lecture-seminary-discussion courses in journalism education,
focussing primarily on curriculum development, the structuring of apprenticeships or internships as an integral
component of the journalist's training, and the development of student publications as essential to journalism
education.

_And arrange one-week, intensive, participant/observer placements for the journalism educators as a group in the
journalism departments of three universities, preferably reflecting diversity of size, orientation, and geographic
location. These placements should include, in each case, classroom observation, first-hand experience in producing
a student publication, visits to at least one medium-to-large newspaper which features both national and international
reporting, and, if possible, observation of high-school level student journalism classes and publications.




Pursuant to the legislation authorizing the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, programs must maintain
a nonpolitical character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social
and cultural life.

Beyond the immediate goals of this exchange, USIA is also interested in supporting programs which will lay the groundwork
for new and continuing links between American and Middle Eastern, North African, and South Asian educational institutions
and professional organizations and which will encourage the further growth and development of democratic institutions.

The grantee organization will be responsible for most arrangements associated with this program. These include
organizing a coherent progression of activities, providing international and domestic travel arrangements for
all participants, making lodging and local transportation arrangements for visitors, orienting and debriefing
participants, preparing any necessary support material, and working with host institutions and individuals to
achieve maximum program effectiveness.

To prepare foreign journalism educators for this project prior to their arrival in the United States, E/P encourages
the grantee organization to develop material that would be sent to USIS offices overseas for distribution to participants.
This material might include a tentative project outline with suggested goals and objectives, relevant background
information, and information about American institutions and individuals involved in the exchange.

At the beginning of the program, the grantee organization should conduct an orientation session for the visiting
participants which addresses administrative details of the program and provides general information about American
society and culture which will facilitate the participants' understanding of and adjustment to daily life in the
United States.

At the conclusion of the program, the group should meet in a one-day evaluation and planning session to review what
has been presented to and experienced by the participants and to consider how that which has been learned can most effectively
be applied upon the participants' return to their home countries.



Additional Guidelines



Program monitoring and oversight will be provided by appropriate USIA elements. The U.S. grantee institution should
try to maximize cost-sharing in all facets of the program and to stimulate U.S. private sector (foundation and corporate)
support.

Proposals incorporating participant/observer site visits will be more competitive if letters committing prospective
host institutions to support these efforts are provided.



Funding



Competition for USIA funding support is keen. The final selection of a grantee institution will depend on assessment
of proposals according to a the review criteria delineated below.

The amount requested from USIA should not exceed $165,000 for each of these programs. However, organizations with
less than four years of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are limited to $60,000.
While applicants must provide an all-inclusive budget with the proposal, they are also encouraged to include separate
sub-budgets for each program component, phase, location or activity.
The recipient's proposal shall include the cost of an audit that: 
(1) Complies with the requirements of OMB Circular No. A-133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and
Other Nonprofit Institutions;
(2) Complies with the requirements of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position
(SOP) No. 92-9; and 
(3) Includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of a recipient-prepared supplemental schedule of indirect
cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed.
The audit costs shall be identified separately for:
(1) Preparation of basic financial statements and other accounting services; and 
(2) Preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular No. A-133, AICPA SOP 92-9,
and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation.
USIA will consider funding the following project costs:
1. International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs (e.g., airport taxes); ground transportation costs.
2. Per diem: For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat rate of $140/day for international
participants or the published Federal Travel Regulations per diem rates for individual American cities.





Note:

 U.S. escorting staff must use the published federal per diem rates, not the flat rate. For activities in the Middle
East, North Africa and South Asia, the Standard Federal Travel Regulations per diem rates must be used.



3. Escort-interpreters: Interpretation for U.S.-based programs is provided by the State Department's Language
Services Division. USIA grants do not pay for foreign interpreters to accompany delegations during travel to or from
their home country. Grant proposal budgets should contain a flat $140/day per diem rate for each State Department
interpreter, as well as home-program-home air transportation of $400 per interpreter and any U.S. travel expenses
during the program itself. Salary expenses are covered centrally and are not part of the applicant's budget proposal.
For the second component of the program, a limited amount of grant funds would be available for interpreters, should
interpretation be required. The grant applicant is encouraged to confirm with the appropriate USIS posts the local
costs for interpreters. Grant proposals should reflect these costs.
4. Book and cultural allowance: Participants are entitled to a one-time cultural allowance of $150 per person, plus
a book allowance of $50. Escorts are reimbursed for actual cultural expenses up to $150. U.S. staff do not get these
benefits.
