Importation of Apples, Apricots, Peaches, Persimmons, Pomegranates, and Citrus From Sonora 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the Fruits and Vegetables regulations by 
adding San Luis Rio Colorado to the list of definite areas in Sonora, Mexico, 
determined to be free from certain injurious insect pests and from which 
apples, apricots, grapefruit, oranges, peaches, persimmons, pomegranates, and tangerines may be imported without
treatment for these pests. We have determined that this municipality is free from certain injurious insect pests
known to occur in Mexico and known to attack these fruits. This action allows the importation of these fruits into the
United States from San Luis Rio Colorado, in accordance with the regulations. We also are making other nonsubstantive
changes for clarity. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


The regulations in 7 CFR 319.56 through 319.56-8 (referred to below as the regulations) restrict the importation
of fruits and vegetables to prevent the introduction and dissemination of certain injurious insects, including
fruit and melon flies, that are new to or not widely distributed within and throughout the United States. Paragraphs
(e) and (f) of  319.56-2 contain requirements for the importation of certain fruits and vegetables based
on their origin in a definite area or district. The definite area or district must meet certain criteria, including
criteria designed to ensure that the area or district is free from all or certain injurious insects. Paragraph (h)
of  319.56-2 lists municipalities in Sonora, Mexico, that are considered free of five listed insect pests:


Ceratitis capitata, Anastrepha ludens, A. serpentina, A. obliqua, 

and 

A. fraterculus. 

Apples, apricots, grapefruit, oranges, peaches, persimmons, pomegranates, and tangerines from municipalities
in Sonora, Mexico, listed in paragraph (h) may be imported into the United States without treatment for these five
insect pests. 


In a document published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 25, 1993 
(58 FR 44779-44780, Docket No. 93-095-1), we proposed to add San Luis Rio Colorado to the list of municipalities
in Sonora, Mexico, determined to be free from the five listed insect pests and from which apples, apricots, grapefruit,
oranges, peaches, persimmons, pomegranates, and tangerines may be imported into the United States without treatment
for these pests. We have determined that San Luis Rio Colorado meets all the criteria contained in 
 319.56-2 (e)(4) and (f). 
We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 30-day comment period ending September 24, 1993. We received
one comment by that date from a State agency. The commenter expressed concern regarding Mexican Government enforcement
efforts to prevent the introduction of fruit flies into San Luis Rio Colorado and requested any pertinent information
that we used in formulating the proposed rule. 
We have since responded to the commenter and have provided him with the pest risk assessment we used in adding San Luis
Rio Colorado to the list of Sonoran municipalities considered to be free of fruit flies. As indicated in the pest risk
assessment, the Mexican Government performs fruit fly trapping surveys adequate to detect any fruit fly infestation
in San Luis Rio Colorado. The Mexican Government also maintains roadside inspection stations to prevent the introduction
of fruit flies through incoming produce. 
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions
of the proposal as a final rule without change. 


Effective Date 


This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective
less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. Immediate implementation of this rule is necessary to provide relief to those persons who are adversely affected
by restrictions we no longer find warranted. Making this rule effective immediately will allow interested producers
and others in the marketing chain to benefit from this additional source of fruit. Therefore, the Administrator of
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this rule should be effective upon publication
in the 

Federal Register

.

Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
The action allows the importation of apples, apricots, grapefruit, oranges, peaches, persimmons, pomegranates,
and tangerines from San Luis Rio Colorado into the United States without treatment for the five listed insect pests.
This action could increase imports of these articles into the United States, since import costs will be lowered through
the elimination of treatment costs. The small entities that could be affected by this action include fumigators at
the Mexican border, importers of the above-listed fruits, and domestic growers, distributors, and retailers of
these fruits. 
The economic impact on these entities should be insignificant since the amount of fruit imported into the United States
from San Luis Rio Colorado is expected to be very small. 
Based on available information, we anticipate that only imports of oranges, peaches, and possibly grapefruit may
increase as a result of this rule. Further, if imports of oranges and peaches from Sonora and imports of grapefruit
from Mexico in general were to increase 10 percent from 1992 levels, this increase would amount to less than one percent
of total U.S. production and less than one percent of total U.S. imports of these commodities. Consequently, we do
not estimate any changes in prices or costs of fresh oranges, peaches, or grapefruit as a result of this rule. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12778 


This rule allows fruit to be imported into the United States from San Luis Rio Colorado, Mexico. State and local laws
and regulations regarding fruit imported under this rule will be preempted while the fruit is in foreign commerce.
Fresh fruits are generally imported for immediate distribution and sale to the consuming public, and will remain
in foreign commerce until sold to the ultimate consumer. The question of when foreign commerce ceases in other cases
must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. No retroactive effect will be given to this rule, and this rule will not require
administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


The regulations in this subpart contain no new information collection or 
recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 
U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). 


List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 319 


Bees, Coffee, Cotton, Fruits, Honey, Imports, Nursery stock, Plant Diseases and pests, Quarantine, Reporting and
recordkeeping requirements, Rice, Vegetables. 



Accordingly, 7 CFR part 319 is amended as follows: 


PART 319_FOREIGN QUARANTINE NOTICES

General Crop Insurance Regulations; Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) hereby adopts regulations for specific crop provisions to insure
Small Grains (wheat, barley, flax, oats, and rye), and options for increased coverage on Winter Wheat and Malting
Barley. This rule consolidates the provisions for insuring small grains into one policy and provides for late planting,
prevented planting, and wheat winter coverage.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established by Departmental Regulation 1512-1. This action
constitutes a review as to the need, currency, clarity, and effectiveness of these regulations under those procedures.
The sunset review date established for these regulations is July 1, 1998. 




Kenneth D. Ackerman, Manager, FCIC, has determined that this action is in conformance with Executive Order 12866
and is not a ``significant regulatory action.'' Based on information compiled by the Department, it has been determined
that this final rule: (1) Would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities;
(2) would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
(3) would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees or loan programs or rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; and (4) would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.


In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), the information collection or record-keeping requirements included in this final rule have been submitted for
approval to the Office of Management and Budget.



This action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. The insurance companies
delivering these policies will not increase the amount of work required over the previous policy delivery. In fact,
the combination of a number of previously independent policies into one policy should reduce confusion and increase
efficiency. Therefore, this action is determined to be exempt from the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act and no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared.


This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.450.

This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation
with state and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115, June 24,
1983.

This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment, health, and safety.
Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed.

The small grains crop provisions were developed to provide one policy form for insuring wheat, barley, flax, oats,
and rye. Using one policy for these five crops will: (1) Substantially reduce paperwork by issuing one policy form
rather than the five separate policies previously used; (2) substantially reduce the number of crop handbooks and
administrative procedures because separate handbooks and procedures will no longer be required for each of the small
grain crops; (3) reduce the time involved to amend or revise the Provisions by eliminating repetitious review processes;
and (4) continue to allow insureds the flexibility to elect any of the five small grain crops they wish to insure.



By separate rule, FCIC will remove and reserve the present sections for these crop endorsements.


On Thursday, June 10, 1993, FCIC published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 at 58 FR 32458 proposing to revise the Common Crop Insurance Regulations by adding new provisions for oats, wheat,
winter wheat, flax, barley, malting barley, and rye crop insurance.


Following publication of the proposed rule, the public was afforded 30 days to submit written comments, data, and
opinions. Comments were received from various representatives of farm and commodity groups, the crop insurance
industry, and FCIC. The comments received and FCIC responses are as follows:

Comment: 

Six comments suggested that the Crop Provisions should be delayed until after the 1994 crop year because:

(1) Timeliness_Implementation of this program for the 1994 crop would cause confusion and disruption because companies
had insufficient time for training and marketing of the program to agents and insureds;

(2) Program Integrity_The effect upon the overall public acceptance and program integrity will be negative as a result
of the inevitable service problems associated with ``rushing'' a program of such national scale; and

(3) Changes_To a large degree, most of the proposed provisions are positive and will improve the program; however,
by delaying implementation until the 1985 crop year specific provisions can be studied.



Response: 

FCIC delayed implementation until the 1995 crop year.



Comment: 

Two comments suggested the proposed Small Grains Crop Provisions undergo a pilot test in two to three county groupings
located in (1) a predominantly spring wheat only area, (2) a winter wheat only area, and (3) an area having significant
acreage of both winter and spring wheat. The comments stated that this approach would avoid undue risk of adverse effects
to a wheat program currently working well for thousands of policyholders. An additional comment recommended that
the proposal be tabled for further study and discussion to give all parties sufficient time to adequately assess the
effects of the proposed changes.




Response: 

The Small Grains Crop Provisions permit farmers to choose the same or nearly the same coverage as currently offered.
FCIC does not anticipate significant problems with the proposed provisions, and sees no need to create a pilot program
to test effectiveness.



Comment: 

Two comments recommended that the term ``initially planted'' be defined for the purposes of unit division. Current
farming practices are such that more than one use/interpretation of this term is possible. Another comment recommended
that ``initially planted'' be defined as ``the first occurrence of planting the crop to the acreage for the crop year''.



Response: 

FCIC agrees that the term ``initially planted'' should be defined and has done so.



Comment: 

One comment stated that the definition of ``practical to replant'' contained in the Common Crop Insurance Policy
conflicts with the Small Grains Crop Provisions. The Common Crop Insurance Policy indicates it is practical to replant
until 20 days after the final planting date. The Small Grains Crop Provisions indicate that any acreage of the insured
crop damaged before the final planting date must be replanted unless FCIC agrees that replanting is not practical.
It was recommended that a definition of ``practical to replant'' be added to the Small Grains Crop Provisions that
will override the definition contained in the Common Crop Insurance Policy.




Response: 

The comment misapplies the definition of ``practical to replant'' in the Common Policy. That policy does not indicate
that it is practical to replant until 20 days after the final planting date but, to the contrary, states that it is not
practical to replant after that date. The provisions do not conflict. A new definition has not been added due to this
comment. However, a new definition has been added that is compatible with the new 25 day late planting period.



Comment: 

One comment noted that the definition of ``swathed'' indicates that a wheat crop that has been cut but not placed in
windrows is considered ``swathed.'' The comment suggested rewording the definition to require that the crop be placed
in a windrow.




Response: 

FCIC agrees with the comment and has appropriately modified the definition.



Comment: 

One comment stated that the wording in the unit division section has significantly changed as has the unit division
wording in the ``draft'' 1994 Crop Insurance Handbook (CIH). The comment recommended corresponding policy language
with that in the CIH.




Response: 

Language contained in the Crop Insurance Handbook is interpretive and procedural in nature. The Crop Insurance Handbook
details unit division for various crops, and is intended for use by insurers and their agents to interpret the crop
provisions. In the event of conflict the provisions control. The Small Grains Crop Provisions outline the unit structure
for small grains in a concise manner and are controlling.



Comment: 

One comment disagreed with requiring insureds to furnish records for each optional unit for at least the last crop
year the unit was planted. According to current procedure, ``in order for optional units to apply, the insured must
have provided production reports for the most recent year in the base period which support the optional units proposed
by the insured.'' The comment asserts that unless all optional units are planted every year, the new policy could require
an insured to furnish records for several years to qualify for optional units. This places an increased burden on all
producers, particularly on those practicing crop rotation. The comment recommended revising the provision to ``You
must have verifiable records of production for at least the last crop year used to determine your production guarantee.''




Response: 

FCIC agrees with the comment and has modified the provision with language similar to that recommended.



Comment: 

A comment inquired if the process of raising the planter for a few feet and then resuming planting, or leaving a space
unplanted is sufficient for a ``clear and discernible break in the planting pattern''. The comment suggested further
clarification of the term, ``clear and discernible break in the planting pattern''.



Response: 

Requirements for separate units have been met if the break in the planting pattern is adequate to allow measurement
of individual insurance units, and allow separate harvest of the units. The terms are self explanatory. Whether a
break exists depends on whether these functions can occur. No changes in policy language are needed to clarify boundary
requirements.



Comment: 

Four comments supported initially planted spring wheat being treated as a separate unit. Each comment also indicated
that there should not be a mandatory replant provision for damaged winter wheat. One of the four comments indicated
that any premium increase caused by the separate optional units for spring and winter wheat should be minimal.




Response: 

Separate optional units for initially planted winter and spring wheat are allowed by this regulation, although farmers
who elect this choice will forgo the premium discount for maintaining a single unit. These terms are consistent with
those terms given to a producer who elects to plant spring and winter wheat into separate sections.

The Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement provides optional coverage for those growers who may not wish to replant damaged
winter wheat. However, the Basic Policy requires that crops damaged prior to the final planting date be replanted
when practical. This requirement helps FCIC maintain lower premium rates.



Comment:

 Some comments were in disagreement with the provision allowing insureds to select optional units for initially planted
winter wheat and initially planted spring wheat for the following reasons:

a. Currently, production from winter wheat acreage often off-sets losses on spring wheat acreage. Allowing optional
units by type can only increase the loss ratio in those areas where both winter and spring types wheat are planted and
insured. To increase risk exposure by allowing winter and spring wheat units when other changes are concurrently
being implemented in the program to decrease the loss ratio seems to create a conflict.

b. There is no appreciable difference in harvesting and marketing the soft white winter wheat and the soft white spring
wheat grown in the northwest. Although a yield difference does exist between the two types of wheat, yield differences
also exist for many other crop practices and types not allowed separate optional units.

c. If optional units are allowed by type, a significant increase in losses could result. According to information
from some member companies who have analyzed prior year losses by type, loss ratios for wheat would have been substantially
higher if winter and spring wheat could have been insured as a separate optional units.

d. One organization had not received any requests for optional units by type from companies, agents, or insureds,
and therefore did not see the need for the provision.

Other comments provided the following observations and inquiries:

a. Will the cost of the options in provisions governing Unit Division be prohibitive?

b. Production of spring wheat and winter wheat is commingled more often than not.

c. Allowing winter and spring optional units may significantly increase risk. FCIC should analyze winter and spring
statistics to determine if an additional rate should be charged.

d. The provision allowing optional units for initially planted Winter Wheat and initially planted Spring Wheat will
permit growers who have insufficient acreage to plant in separate sections and declare separate optional units.
Large producers will also be able to declare separate optional units, and the net effect will increase the number of
wheat units. This may have a negative effect on FCIC's loss ratio. The provision will also increase the paperwork burden
of the already overburdened claims adjuster.

e. Changes or adjustments to the program should be sensitive to rating adequacy and reduction of excess of loss ratios.
Some of the provisions of the program contradict these goals. For instance, analyses by companies and industry trade
associations do not support the notion that no additional rate is required for optional units by type. As proposed,
optional units by type can only be justified as a marketing tool in some areas of the country. 



Response:

 Separate units for winter and spring wheat have been requested by grower groups in Washington, Idaho, and Oregon.
FCIC agrees that farmers should have the opportunity to designate initially planted spring and winter wheat as separate
optional units because they are planted several months apart and are normally harvested separately. FCIC also agrees
that soft white wheat types may be marketed together. However, there are substantial price penalties for commingling
production of spring and winter wheat of other types.

FCIC has analyzed types of wheat reported by unit for the states in which both winter and spring types are insured. An
average of only 7 percent of all units in these states reported both winter and spring types within the same unit. The
majority, or 93 percent of all units, reported only a single type within the unit. These results suggest that most farmers
already manage their land in a manner that permits them to put the winter and spring types into separate optional units.
This is accomplished by planting the types within different legally defined sections of land. Thus, FCIC believes
that the potential for increases in the number of optional units is not substantial. Most farmers who have enough land
and who wish to designate separate optional units already do so.

Farmers who designate separate optional units by type within the same section will forgo the premium discount that
is currently allowed if a basic unit is not separated into optional units. Thus, farmers who elect to designate units
by type of wheat within the section will pay more premium than a farmer who elects to retain all acreage within a basic
unit.

The comments concerning additional paperwork are overstated. Farmers already are required to report separately
any acreage planted to the spring and winter types within section because different premium rates, insurance guarantees,
or both, apply to such acreage. The only difference in the acreage report under the new provision is that two distinct
unit numbers will be used by the insurer rather than one as at present. Farmers will be required to report the production
of the two types separately, which they already may do in many cases. FCIC cannot estimate the number of cases in which
a new report may be required. The former wheat endorsement required only that insured persons report the total production
of all the insurable crop produced on the unit. If a farmer elects to report only total production under the present
arrangements, the accuracy of the guarantees for the types is reduced because the insurer must allocate the production
in some manner to establish a guarantee by type. If farmers who now report the combined production of the two types within
section do designate separate optional units, the change may enhance the precision of guarantees for the separate
types, thereby benefiting the insurer. If the farmer already reports production of the two types separately, there
will be no change in the paperwork required.

Insured persons who wish to take advantage of the opportunity to designate separate optional units within a section
must comply with all other requirements for unit division. Thus, if a producer commingles production of the winter
and spring types, separate optional units may not be elected. If a producer plants spring wheat into a failed winter
stand, separate optional units may not be elected. If planting patterns do not permit separate identification of
the acreage, optional units may not be elected. If a producer wishes to reduce the premium paid for the insurance, he
or she can elect to retain all the acreage in a basic unit. The new provisions do not mandate separate optional units.


Finally, much of the research about units referenced in the comments relates to size of acreage, not specifically
to unit division. Results of such research suggests that small farmers should pay higher premiums than large farmers
because small acreage may have higher losses on average. Although the issues is related, FCIC believes that the issues
should be treated separately. If it is ultimately demonstrated that small acreage should be subject to a surcharge
due to actuarial considerations, the surcharge should be assessed against small acreage regardless of whether these
result from small farming operations or from unit division.

In summary, FCIC does not find these comments persuasive.



Comment:

 One comment took issue with winter wheat vs. spring wheat Transitional Yields (T-yields) and factors in many Pacific
Northwest counties. The comment suggested that the uncoupling of winter wheat and spring wheat into separate units
be preceded by a major rework of T-yield factors to prevent potential over-payments on spring wheat units.



Response:

 FCIC agrees that T-yields should reflect any significant differences in yields. Evaluations will be performed and
any necessary changes will be made as soon as practicable. However, those changes will not require a change in this
rule.



Comment:

 The last paragraph under section 2. (Unit Division) indicates that optional units not in compliance with the provisions
of the section will be combined into the basic unit from which they were formed. A comment suggested that this language
be clarified to separate this combination from that which occurs at loss time if production is commingled between
optional units. The comment recommended the following language: ``If you do not comply fully with these conditions,
we will combine all optional units which are not established in compliance with this section into the basic unit from
which they were formed.''



Response:

 FCIC agrees with the comment and has modified the provision as recommended.

Comment: 

One comment suggested that Harding and Perkins counties, South Dakota, be added to the list of wheat counties that
have an April 15 cancellation and termination date. Statistics indicate that over 80 percent of the wheat in these
counties is initially planted spring wheat. In order to maintain the line of counties which separates the April 15
counties from counties with earlier dates, Harding and Perkins counties should be listed with the other South Dakota
counties with the April 15 date.



Response: 

FCIC agrees with the comment and has modified the provision as recommended.



Comment: 

Four comments agreed with changing the wheat sales closing and cancellation dates for Idaho, Oregon, and Washington
from October 31, to September 30. However, they recommended the dates not be changed until the 1995 crop year due to
the late publication of the proposed rule. One of the four comments indicated the change would cause the production
reporting date to occur at an earlier date. In some areas of the Northwest, harvest may not be completed by that new production
reporting date.



Response: 

The effective date of these regulations has been postponed until the 1995 crop year, therefore, the wheat sales closing
and cancellation dates for Idaho, Oregon, and Washington from October 31 to September 30 has been postponed to 1995.
FCIC will take action to change the production reporting date if problems occur.



Comment: 

One comment stated that the change of the wheat sales closing and cancellation dates from October 31 to September 30
for Idaho, Oregon, and Washington is favorable and inquired as to the reason that Nevada and Utah remain at the 10/31
date.



Response: 

FCIC changed the sales closing and cancellation in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington due to an allegation that the previous
dates posed a potential for adverse selection. FCIC has not received any comments or recommendations regarding the
dates in Nevada or Utah. It is FCIC's intent to allow the maximum sales period possible as long as program integrity
is not compromised. FCIC will not change the proposed rule.



Comment: 

A comment recommended that the cancellation and termination dates be changed from April 15 to February 28 for barley
and oats in all Pacific Northwest states.



Response: 

FCIC plans an overall assessment of program dates for all crops. The recommendation will be considered in that review.



Comment: 

A comment recommended moving the cancellation and termination dates from the Crop Provisions to the Special Provisions.
The comment suggested that any information specific to a state, county or group of counties be located in the Special
Provisions where the appropriate parties have access to it.



Response: 

These dates must remain in the Common Crop Insurance Policy due to the requirements of  457.8. However, FCIC
will consider also placing them in the Special Provisions.



Comment: 

One comment stated that as proposed, policy language in subsection 6.(a) could lead the reader to believe that the
insured has the option of insuring only a portion of their insurable acreage.



Response: 

FCIC agrees that this language should be clarified. The provision has been modified to indicate the crop insured is
each small grain the producer elects to insure, that is grown in the county on insurable acreage, and for which premium
rates are provided by the actuarial table.



Comment: 

One comment recommended requiring that requests for written agreements be received by FCIC within 15 days of the acreage
reporting date and that the requirement be added to section 6. Insured Crop.



Response: 

The Crop Insurance Handbook now indicates that these types of written agreements must be sent to FCIC, and be postmarked
no later than 15 days after the acreage reporting date. Since reinsured insurance contracts are between the reinsured
company and the insured, the contract should not contain obligations that exist between FCIC and the reinsured company.
Therefore, language indicating that requests must be received by FCIC within 15 days of the acreage reporting date
will not be included in the crop provisions.



Comment: 

Three comments were received regarding the provision that allows the insured to designate wheat acreage that will
be destroyed before harvest as uninsurable acreage, or acreage eligible for a reduced premium rate. The comments
suggested that applicability of the provisions not be limited to wheat, and that the reduced premium rate should only
be provided in counties where early destruction of crops has been a problem.



Response: 

FCIC agrees that applicability of the provisions should not be limited to wheat. Only acreage intended to be harvested
for grain qualifies as an insurable crop. Therefore, if it is known at the acreage reporting date that the acreage will
be destroyed, it is not insurable. The provision that allows an insured to designate only wheat acreage as uninsurable
acreage has been changed to apply to all covered crops. The provision that provides for a reduced premium rate if acreage
is destroyed by a certain date, has been changed so that it applies only in those counties for which such a reduced rate
is included on the actuarial table. This change will allow FCIC to provide a ``short rate'' only in areas where small
grain crops are most commonly used for multiple purposes, e.g., grazing and harvest for grain.



Comment: 

One comment questioned the benefit of using the under-reported premium factor as opposed to current procedure whereby
production from unreported acreage is counted against the guarantee for reported acreage, or the acreage report
is revised if acreage is over-reported.



Response: 

Current procedure is not altered if under-reported acreage is the only problem. The under-reported premium factor
reduces the guarantee when share, practice, type, or other material information is under-reported.



Comment: 

One comment noted that it is extremely important that shifting liability procedure be reinstated. Acreage is reported
by unit and the insurance company requires the insured to indicate on the acreage report the acreage he plans to destroy,
however, insureds often do not know at acreage report time exactly which acres will be destroyed. Therefore, the company
is asking for information that is often unknown at the time the acreage report is filed. Shifting liability procedure
is an equitable method of addressing the situation.



Response: 

If an insured indicates that acreage will be destroyed and then does not destroy the acreage, the unit will be subject
to the under-reporting provisions of subsection 6.(f) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy ( 457.8).

Comment: 

Two comments indicated that the wheat provision will allow any insured producer whose wheat sustains early damage
to destroy any remaining wheat, pay a reduced premium rate, and receive a full indemnity. The comments suggested that
the provision should be changed to prohibit this practice, and to require the insured to notify the insurer prior to
destroying any insured wheat.


Response: 

FCIC agrees that the reduced premium should apply only when there is no insurable damage. FCIC also agrees that the
insured should notify the insurer prior to and after destruction of any acreage of the insured crop. This notification
will allow the insurer to make any necessary inspections and adjustments to the Acreage Report. The provision has
been revised accordingly.


Comment: 

Two comments indicated that the provisions for destroyed acreage are difficult to assess without seeing the proposed
prorata premium charges, or the deadlines which will be designated in the Special Provisions. The comments asked
if the expense reimbursement to reinsured companies for acreage destroyed by the deadline in the Special Provisions
would be calculated using the total premium or the reduced premium.


Response: 

Premium rates for destroyed acreage will vary in accordance with the probability of loss in individual geographic
areas. If insurable damage occurs prior to the crop being destroyed by the grower, the loss will be processed in the
normal manner and 100 percent of the premium will be due. Expense reimbursement will also be calculated on this basis.
If the insured destroys the acreage by the date designated in the Special Provisions and does not claim insurable damage
on such acreage, the reduced rate will be used to determine the premium and the reduced premium will be used to determine
the expense reimbursement.


Comment: 

One comment recommended that if the terms of the Late Planting Agreement Option are added to the Small Grains Policy,
an option should be allowed for insureds to decline this coverage. The comment supported giving insureds the opportunity
to make a management decision on whether their late planted acreage has coverage.


Response: 

Provisions for late planting coverage have been added to these provisions in order to provide more complete coverage
for insureds. If insureds are allowed to opt out of the coverage it may result in adverse selection against the insurer.
When agronomic conditions are good many insureds would tend to opt out of the coverage, but if growing conditions are
poor, insureds would tend to keep the coverage.


Comment: 

One comment inquired about the lack of availability of the late planting option for late planted winter wheat. The
comment pointed out that the option is available for both fall and spring planted barley, and suggested that it be available
for winter wheat.


Response: 

FCIC has received comments indicating that the wheat final planting dates are now set as late as it is normally practical
to plant. The additional planting period allowed by the Late Planting Agreement Option (LPAO) permits planting too
late in the year to expect production equal to or in excess of the insurance guarantee provided by the Option. Although
coverage similar to that provided by the current LPAO will no longer be available, coverage for winter wheat planted
after the final planting date will be available under the prevented planting provisions (section 12). FCIC received
no comments opposed to removing the LPAO for winter wheat.


Comment: 

One comment recommended changing the wording in subsection 6.(d) to: ``If you do not select one of the options for alternate
coverage, you agree that in counties for which the special provisions designate both a fall final planting date and
a spring final planting date, any damage to fall planted wheat which occurs between the fall final planting date and
the spring final planting date due to any cause is not insured.''


Response: 

Subsection 6.(d) (renumbered as 6.(c) in this final rule) is intended solely to inform the insured of the availability
of the Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement. Section 7 (Insurance Period) clearly indicates the coverage limitations
for fall planted wheat in counties with both fall and spring final planting dates. Additional language in subsection
6.(d) is not necessary.


Comment: 

A comment suggested that FCIC provide a deadline for selecting Option A or B under the Winter Coverage Option.


Response: 

The sales closing date will be the last date an insured can select either Option A or B under the Winter Coverage Option.
FCIC agrees that the Option should indicate this date and has revised it accordingly.


Comment: 

One comment stated that if wheat insurance attaches at different times depending on which style of insurance a grower
has purchased, it will lead to administrative problems. The comment suggested that insurance on wheat attach on the
day the acreage is planted or the date the application is accepted_whichever is later.


Response: 

The insurance provisions attach on the later of the date the application is accepted or the date the crop is planted.
This does not vary based on the insurance options chosen by the insured.

Comment:

 One comment indicated concern that the replant provision could be interpreted to mean that a crop that had sustained
1% damage before the final planting date must be replanted. The comment recommended ``damage'' be defined to mean
damaged to the extent that the crop will not be further cared for, will not be harvested, or will be abandoned.



Response:

 FCIC agrees that the amount of damage should be clarified. Language has been added clarifying that any acreage damaged
to the extent that growers in the area would not further care for the crop must be replanted unless replanting is not
practical. The same change has been made to similar provisions for barley and wheat acreage (subparagraphs 7.(a)(2)(ii),
7.(a)(2)(iii), and 7.(a)(2)(iv)).



Comment:

 One comment stated that clarification is needed regarding the definition of ``practical to replant.''


Response:

 FCIC agrees with the comment and has clarified the definition. The new definition clarifies that it is practical to
replant if it is ``our determination, after loss or damage to the insured crop, based on factors, including but not
limited to moisture availability, condition of the field, time to crop maturity, etc., that a replanting of the insured
crop will attain maturity in the remainder of the crop year.''



Comment:

 A comment inquired as to the practicality of replanting wheat before the fall planting date.


Response:

 Replanting wheat before the fall final planting date is considered practical if certain conditions are met.



Comment:

 Three comments suggested that coverage limitations applicable to winter wheat also apply to winter barley. One of
the comments also inquired if the requirement that a written request be made to insure fall planted wheat in counties
with only a spring final planting date would result in extra paperwork.





Response:

 FCIC agrees that the limitations that apply to wheat should also apply to barley. The provisions have been modified
accordingly. A written request to insure the fall planted acreage will serve to notify the insurer that a crop inspection
is necessary in the spring to determine whether or not an adequate stand exists in the spring.






Comment:

 One comment noted that the provisions of section 7 specifically state that spring wheat damaged prior to the spring
final planting date must be reseeded. The comment recommended that specific wording be added to state that damaged
fall wheat must be reseeded prior to the fall final planting date and that no replanting payment applies.








Response:

 FCIC agrees that this clarification should be made. The provisions have been modified to state that any acreage damaged
prior to the fall final planting date must be replanted to winter wheat unless FCIC agrees it is not practical. Paragraph
9.(a)(4) clearly indicates that a replanting payment for damage occurring prior to the fall final planting date is
not allowed. Therefore, language regarding replanting payments was not added.






Comment:

 The following questions regarding winter wheat were submitted:




a. When winter wheat is planted in a county that has only a spring final planting date, will the winter wheat be insured
using the spring wheat yield or will the RSO set a winter wheat yield on the written agreement?




b. Will the winter wheat production be considered spring wheat for APH purposes or must winter wheat APH yield be established?

<PARENT> FR940228-0-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

c. What production guarantee is used to determine if the winter wheat has an adequate stand?






Response:

 The provision that applies to these questions is unchanged from the present wheat endorsement. Actuarial tables
for the counties in question do not designate a wheat type. When a type is not designated, the guarantee is based on wheat
production without regard to the type. This guarantee is used for APH purposes and is also used to determine whether
or not an adequate stand exists.






Comment:

 For winter wheat in counties that only have a spring final planting date, the policy states that insurance will attach
on the earlier of the spring final planting date or the date the insurer agrees to accept the acreage. The policy also
requires insureds planting winter wheat in these counties to request insurance for winter planted wheat. One comment
suggested that because the insurer must inspect the crop to determine if an adequate stand exists, insurance should
attach when the insurer agrees to accept liability (not on the spring final planting date). The comment suggested
that the applicable sentence in subparagraph 7.(a)(2)(v) should be revised to read as follows: ``* * *
Insurance will attach to acreage having an adequate stand on the date we agree to accept the acreage for insurance.''






Response:

 The policy language was written to set a specific date by which the insurer must accept liability. The language requires
insurers to inspect acreage in a timely manner so that the insured can be advised about the coverage level prior to the
spring final planting date. No changes have been made in the provisions.






Comment:

 Under the winter coverage endorsement, FCIC is giving producers two additional coverage options for losses on winter
wheat that is damaged prior to the spring final planting date. A Montana producer expressed concern that the new provisions
may change the current basic winter wheat coverage and premium levels.






Response:

 The basic coverage under the wheat provisions is similar to the existing wheat endorsement. The changes (primarily
replanting payments in certain instances) may have a small impact on the rate charged for the base coverage. The new
basic policy (without the Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement) clearly states that winter wheat damaged prior to the
spring final planting date must be replanted in counties with both winter and spring final planting dates.






Comment:

 One comment recommended that the calendar dates for the end of the insurance period be moved to the Special Provisions.
The comment also indicated that it is incorrect to state that the end of the insurance period is ``October 31 following
planting in all other states'' because, in many states, the crop is planted prior to October 31.






Response:

 FCIC agrees that language regarding the end of the insurance period is incorrect and has made appropriate corrections.
The Common Crop Insurance Policy ( 457.8), to which the Small Grains Crop Provisions attaches, requires that
the calendar date for the end of the insurance period be indicated in the crop provisions. FCIC will consider placing
this date in the Special Provisions at a later date.






Comment:

 One comment expressed concern that the provisions pertaining to sufficient or improper application of insect or
disease control measures could lead FCIC towards micro-management. The comment also indicated that an over-zealous
appraiser could unjustly claim that a producer did not use the right timing, kind of pesticide, or the equipment for
application.

<DOCNO> FR940228-0-00011 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940228-0-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response: 

Language indicates that crop damage caused by insects or disease is covered unless the damage is due to insufficient
or improper application of control measures. It has always been the loss adjustor's responsibility to determine
if good farming practices are carried out by the producer. This responsibility includes determining if cultural
practices necessary to control insects and disease are followed. The new language does not change current loss adjustment
procedures, or give loss adjustors the latitude to require unreasonable control measures. The language is intended
to clearly advise insureds that they are expected to take control measures that typically would be used in the area.






Comment: 

One comment recommended adding the following language under failure of water supply as an insured cause of loss: ``(water
source and means for supplying irrigation water, without regard to equipment or facilities). This includes the water
source, dams, canals, ditches, pipelines, etc., necessary to supply water for movement from the source to the acreage
but does not include any irrigation equipment or facilities.''






Response: 

Failure of the irrigation water supply during the insurance period is a covered cause of loss. The ``supply'' includes
several items not included in the recommendation, e.g., aquifers, precipitation, etc. Also covered are off-farm
irrigation facilities and equipment used by water regulators and suppliers. The recommended language would not
provide coverage when such facilities failed. Language in the proposed rule will remain unchanged.






Comment: 

One comment inquired if the provision concerning wheat replant payments includes replant payments for winter wheat
as well as spring wheat.






Response: 

The provisions provide a replant payment for winter wheat in counties with both a fall and spring final planting date,
only if the winter wheat is damaged after the fall final planting date. A replant payment is also provided to replant
spring wheat in counties with a spring final planting date.






Comment: 

Five comments were received opposing paying replant payments for wheat. The comments stated that: (a) Insureds have
not requested replant payments for spring wheat; (b) insureds are currently replanting or ``sweetening'' stands
at their own minimal expense; (c) replant payments for spring wheat will not reduce indemnity payments because insureds
already replant at their own expense; (d) the cost of replanting wheat is much less than other spring crops; (e) unnecessary
increased loss adjustment expense will result; (f) if FCIC persists with implementation of this proposal, provisions
addressing these increased expenses should be made; (g) without a commensurate increase in rates, adding a replant
payment has the net effect of increasing the loss ratio; (h) this provision will tremendously impact the loss adjustment
expense; (i) the replant provisions are extremely hard to react to on a timely basis and very expensive to administer;
and (j) replants on row crops are normally confined to smaller areas with fewer miles to travel. The same is not applicable
to other small grains. 



Response: 

The intended effects of replanting payments are to: (1) Provide coverage requested by wheat growers; (2) provide
reimbursement to insureds for replanting expenses; (3) reduce indemnities by encouraging replacement of damaged
or destroyed crops; and (4) provide equity among the various crops. FCIC understands that administrative costs will
be associated with this coverage, however, replant payments are a loss control mechanism and may outweigh any additional
administrative costs. Comments received did not establish findings that all damaged acreage is presently replanted
in the absence of a payment.

Comment:

 One comment recommended revising language concerning wheat replant payments to specify that damage must be due to
an insurable cause of loss in order for a replay payment to be made.



Response:

 FCIC agrees with the comment and has revised the language accordingly.



Comment:

 The provisions require that wheat be damaged to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent
of the production guarantee for the unit to qualify for a replant payment. One comment stated that these provisions
conflict with the winter coverage options because the options indicate a replant payment can be made on a portion of
a unit. The comment recommended changing the language to allow a replant payment if the remaining stand will not produce
at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage as opposed to the unit.



Comment:

 FCIC agrees that changing the language as recommended makes replanting payment provisions consistent between the
Basic Policy and Winter Wheat Coverage Endorsement. Changes have been made accordingly.



Comment:

 The provisions do not include any limitation regarding the date an insured can replant and be eligible for a replanting
payment. One comment recommended adding a provision requiring that acreage be replanted within 25 days after the
spring final planting date to remain eligible for a replant payment. The comment also recommended clarifying if ``sweetening''
is considered replanting.



Response:

 FCIC agrees that replanting should take place within 25 days after the spring final planting date and has added appropriate
language. The provision has been changed to indicate that planting new seed into an existing damaged stand at a reduced
seeding rate will not be considered replanting.



Comment:

 One comment stated that the replant payment provisions do not indicate the consequences when wheat is replanted using
a practice that is uninsurable for an original planting. The comment recommended the following language be added
to clearly indicate what happens in such a situation: ``When wheat is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable
for an original planting, the liability for the unit will be reduced by the amount of the replanting payment. The premium
amount will be based on the original liability.''



Response:

 FCIC agrees with the comment and has added the language as recommended.



Comment:

 One comment recommended that replant payments apply onto wheat. In addition, the comment recommended clarification
that no replant payment for barley, oats, rye or flax will be provided.



Response:

 The provisions already clearly state that a replant payment is allowed only for wheat. Further clarification is not
necessary. After loss experience with wheat replanting payments is analyzed, replanting payment coverage may be
extended to barley, oats, rye and flax.



Comment:

 One comment inquired why the number of days a representative sample must be left unharvested has been changed from
15 to 30.



Response:

 The provisions have been revised to require that representative samples be left until the earlier time the insurer
gives consent to destroy the samples or 15 days after harvest.



Comment:

 One comment stated that the proposed provisions do not link the time notice is given with the requirement to leave representative
samples of the insured crop. In addition, the provisions do not clearly indicate that a sample is required for each
field in the unit. The comment recommended that there be some indication that the requirements in this provision are
in addition to the insured's duties contained in the Common Crop Insurance Policy. The comment also recommended that
the following language be used: ``In addition to your duties contained under section 14 of the Common Crop Insurance
Policy ( 457.8), if you initially discover damage to any insured crop within 15 days of, or during harvest, you
must leave representative samples of the unharvested crop for our inspection. The samples must be at least 10 feet
wide and the entire length of each field in the unit, and must not be harvested or destroyed until the earlier of our inspection
or 30 days after harvest is completed on the unit.''



Response:

 FCIC agrees with the comment and has changed the provisions as recommended with the exception of the 30 day requirement.



Comment:

 One comment inquired about the intent of the provisions under the heading, ``Duties in the Event of Damage or loss.''



Response:

 This provision requires that representative samples be left when notice of damage is given within 15 days of, or during
harvest. It does not apply only when the producer is going to destroy the acreage. The intent of this provision is to
enable the loss adjustor to have a reasonable amount of time to inspect a portion of the undisturbed crop and determine
the extent of insurable damage. After the crop is harvested it can be extremely difficult to accurately determine
the extent of insurable damage.

Comment:

 One comment suggested clarifying the provisions under section 11, ``Settlement of Claim'', by indicating that mixed
grains will be graded based on a sample of the insured (predominant) grain.


Response:

 According to current procedure, mixed grains may be quality adjusted if the predominant grain is separable from other
grains in the mix. Additionally, the predominant grain must meet policy requirements for quality adjustment. This
is a procedural matter and will remain in loss adjustment procedure handbooks.


Comment:

 Two comments recommended that the provisions be revised to state that only those optional units on which production
is commingled will be combined. As proposed, the provisions require that all optional units within a basic unit be
combined when production is commingled between any optional units.


Response:

 FCIC agrees with the comment and has revised the provisions accordingly.


Comment:

 One comment stated that language under section 11, ``Settlement of Claim'', is misleading because it indicates that
``All appraised production which is: Not less than the production guarantee will be counted for acreage that is abandoned
* * *'' This could lead the reader to believe that only appraised production in excess of the production
guarantee will be counted. The comment recommended revising the language as follows: ``All appraised production
as follows: Not less than the production guarantee for acreage which is abandoned * * *.''


Response:

 FCIC agrees with the comment and has revised the language as recommended.


Comment:

 One comment suggested that ``appraised production'' be defined in the policy. The comment also inquired if FCIC intends
to include definitions of ``appraised production,'' ``harvested production'' and ``uninsured causes'' in the
small grains policy?


Response:

 The term ``appraised production'' is defined in the provisions. ``Harvested production'' and ``uninsured causes''
are definitive terms and do not require specific definitions.


Comment:

 One comment suggested clarifying the provisions under section 11, ``Settlement of Claim'', by revising the language
to read as follows: ``(i) not less than the production guarantee for: (a) acreage which is abandoned, (b) put to another
use without our consent, (c) damaged solely by uninsured causes, or (d) for which you fail to provide records of production
that are acceptable to us.''


Response:

 FCIC agrees that separating the items in the language makes it easier to read and revisions have been made accordingly.


Comment:

 One comment recommended that the provisions under section 11, ``Settlement of Claim'', be revised to allow adjusting
production for both (1) moisture exceeding the requirements in the policy and (2) quality deficiencies exceeding
the grade requirements stated in the policy for each small grain crop. The comment also recommended that an adjustment
for moisture should be addressed using moisture charts in the handbook.


Response:

 FCIC agrees with the comment and has revised the provisions so that adjustments for moisture and quality are determined
separately.


Comment:

 One comment inquired if individuals licensed under the United States Warehouse Act are qualified to determine grade
due to damaged kernels, shrunken or broken kernels, defects, sound barley, thin barley, sound oats, etc. The comment
also inquired if tests for vomitoxin by state university labs and commercial labs licensed by the state will continue
to be acceptable.


Response:

 Grain graders licensed under the United States Warehouse Act are authorized to inspect, weigh, and grade grain for
the purposes of warehouse receipts. Ability to grade grain varies considerably. When grade problems exist and elevator
personnel are unable to adequately establish the quality, samples are generally sent to Federal Grain Inspection
Service (FGIS) for a grade determination. FGIS has the authority to make final grade determinations. Insurers who
are uncomfortable with grade determinations made by individuals licensed under the United States Warehouse Act
should send samples to FGIS for final grade determination. Specialized tests, such as tests for vomitoxin, must be
performed by a qualified laboratory. Language specifying that specialized tests must be performed by a laboratory
approved by the insurer has been added to the provisions.


Comment:

 One comment recommended clarifying the definition of ``local market price''.


Response:

 FCIC agrees that the definition should be clarified and has done so.


Comment:

 Two comments recommended changing the term ``final inspection'' under section 11, ``Statement of Claim'', to either:
``final settlement'' or ``the date the loss is adjusted.''


Response:

 The date of the final inspection is used to determine values used in quality adjustment. This is the date the claim is
completed. Changing the term to either of the above suggestions does not significantly clarify the provision.

Comment:

 One comment recommended revising the provisions concerning quality adjustment under section 11, ``Statement of
Claim'', to the following: ``The value we use for the damaged production will reflect only reduction in value to the
requirements outlined in 11(d). It will not reflect any reduction in value due to moisture content, uninsured causes,
charges for drying, handling or processing or any other reduction.''



Response:

 FCIC agrees with the comment and has revised the language accordingly.



Comment:

 One comment expressed concern over FCIC's option to utilize prices of outside markets as opposed to local markets
to establish the value for local grain.



Response:

 This provision allows insurers to seek higher prices for damaged grain which may result in the insured receiving compensation
from a buyer rather than from an insurance indemnity. This provision should help reduce indemnities and keep premiums
lower.



Comment:

 One comment suggested requiring damaged grain with zero value be destroyed prior to paying any indemnity.



Response:

 Once a loss adjuster determines a crop has no value it should remain the insured's choice how to handle its disposition.
Loss adjustors are trained to make accurate evaluations of crop potential and any determinations made by them should
be accepted by the insurer. The suggested language has not been added.



Comment:

 One comment recommended that a provision be added to clarify that any discount used to establish the net price of damaged
production be usual, customary, and reasonable.



Response:

 FCIC agrees with the comment and has revised the provision accordingly.



Comment:

 One comment recommended revising paragraph 11.(d)(3) regarding moisture reduction to read as follows: ``Production
eligible for moisture adjustment will be reduced by .12 percent for each .1 percentage point of moisture in excess
of * * *.''



Response:

 FCIC agrees with the comment and has revised the paragraph accordingly.



Comment:

 Four comments indicated that it is difficult to assess provisions of the Winter Coverage Endorsement without knowing
the premium rates. One of the comments points out that dissatisfaction would occur with the Endorsement when premium
rates are published. The author of another comment expressed concern that the proposed Options may erode the affordable
value of the insurance product in counties currently covered by the Winter Coverage Option/Fall Seeded Endorsement.
If Option B is priced too high, it may cause a migration of business to the less expensive Option A or the basic endorsement.
The result would be less significant protection, on an affordable basis, and an overall devaluation of the effectiveness
of the insurance product in counties that currently have the Winter Coverage Option.



Response:

 Final rate determinations cannot be made until the endorsement provisions are finalized. Any premium rate changes
will reflect the coverage provided by regulations published in this final rule. Adequate time will be allowed to inform
insureds of coverage and rate changes, and for insureds to make choices regarding their insurance protection.



Comment:

 Three comments stated that it will be necessary to provide extra training to insurance agents before they sell the
Winter Coverage Endorsement.

Response: 

FCIC agrees that it is imperative to properly train insurance agents regarding program changes. Adequate training
will be provided prior to implementing program changes contained in the new Winter Coverage Endorsement.


Comment: 

One comment stated that ``conservation compliance requirements are encouraging more intensive rotational systems.
Producers throughout South Dakota are opting to use both Spring wheat and Winter wheat within their rotational systems.
Unfortunately for many producers, they are unable to buy winter wheat coverage in a large portion of the state.'' The
comment suggested that serious consideration be given to allowing insurance coverage for both wheats on a state wide
basis.


Response: 

The Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement will be available in all South Dakota counties that currently have both fall
and spring final planting dates. Research is being done by FCIC to determine if the Endorsement should be available
in other counties. Expanded availability will depend on the outcome of this research.


Comment: 

One comment submitted the following questions: If an insured chooses to destroy damaged acreage covered by the Wheat
Winter Coverage Endorsement, can they destroy only damaged acres, or do they have to destroy all the remaining acres
in the unit? Is spring wheat insurable on acres indemnified under Winter Wheat Option A? Will the insured qualify for
a replant payment on those acres?


Response: 

The insured may destroy only the damaged acres on the unit and qualify for coverage as long as at least 20 acres or 20 percent
of the acreage in the unit does not have an adequate stand to produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee
for the acreage. Under Option A, an insured may choose to have the acreage appraised, destroy damaged winter wheat,
or plant spring wheat on the acreage and insure it separately. If the insured chooses to accept an appraisal of the remaining
potential, a replant payment is not allowed, even if the acreage is replanted to spring wheat.


Comment: 

One comment recommended adding the following to the last sentence in paragraph 3 of the Winter Coverage Endorsement:
``* * * unless we agree in writing that it is practical to replant after the spring final planting date.''


Response: 

The provisions of paragraph 3 do not prevent a replant payment for acreage replanted after the spring final planting
date. It is not necessary to extend coverage after the period covered by the Winter Coverage Endorsement.


Comment: 

One comment stated that the word ``damage,'' used in the Winter Coverage Endorsement, can be interpreted to mean that
a crop which has suffered one percent damage can either be replanted, carried to harvest or destroyed. The comment
recommended that ``damage'' be qualified to mean damaged to the extent that the crop does not have the potential to
produce the yield used to determine the production guarantee, will not be further cared for, will not be harvested
or will be abandoned.


Response: 

Coverage under both Options A and B is limited to situations in which at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the acreage in
the unit, whichever is less, is damaged to the extent that it does not have an adequate stand to produce at least 90 percent
of the production guarantee for the acreage (see first paragraphs under Options A and B).


Comment: 

Two comments indicated that since one of the choices the insured has under the Winter Coverage Option is to replant
to spring wheat, the notice of damage should be required by the spring final planting date. The deadline for notice
of loss under the current Fall-Winter Coverage Option is the spring final planting date.


Response: 

FCIC agrees that notice of damage under the Endorsement should be provided by the spring final planting date. The provisions
have been revised accordingly.


Comment: 

Eight comments were received regarding coverage limitations under Option A of the Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement.
The comments stated that limiting coverage for damaged wheat to 30 percent of the production guarantee, after the
time period covered by the Endorsement, is inappropriate. A crop carried on after the winter coverage period would
have a potential much greater than 30 percent of the production guarantee. Two of the comments recommended allowing
coverage to remain at the full production guarantee when the insured continues to care for the crop. One comment recommended
allowing coverage to remain in place at the actual crop potential.


Response: 

Option A limited coverage to 30 percent of the production guarantee even if the insured elected to carry the damaged
wheat to harvest. FCIC has revised Option A to allow coverage to continue based on the full guarantee if the production
potential on the spring final planting date is such that growers in the area continue to maintain the crop.


Comment: 

The author of one comment submitted the following questions: Under Option A of the Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement,
is 70 percent of the production guarantee levied against total production on damaged acres only? What if there is winter
damage and the insurer was not informed until after harvest?


Response: 

Option A clearly indicates that the amount of production to count will not be less than 70 percent of the production
guarantee for the damaged acreage. If notice of damage is not given in accordance with policy provisions, and such
lack of notice interferes with determination of covered damage, a claim may not be payable for the unit.


Comment: 

One comment outlined concerns that the coverage under Option A will not be sufficient to cover production costs incurred
before the crop must be destroyed. The comment also inquired about the actual premium costs.


Response: 

Option A of the Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement is designed as a lower cost alternative to the full coverage of Option
B. Although full production costs may not be covered, there is a significant increase in coverage over the base policy
which does not provide protection unless the crop is replanted. Rate determinations cannot be made until the Endorsement
provisions are finalized. The premium rates for Option A will reflect the coverage provided by regulations published
in this final rule.


Comment: 

One comment recommended adding language to the Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement that would state that when damaged
winter wheat is replanted to spring wheat, the spring wheat will have the winter wheat guarantee.


Response: 

FCIC agrees that clarification is needed and has revised the language accordingly.

Comment: 

Two comments were received regarding the provisions in the Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement that allow an insured
to destroy damaged wheat acreage, replant the acreage to spring wheat, and consider such replanted acreage as a separate
crop. One comment indicated that the endorsement may cause program abuse by encouraging an insured to gamble and seed
winter wheat if he is normally a spring wheat producer. If there is not a good stand in the spring, the insured could destroy
the crop, collect an indemnity, and plant spring wheat as is normally done. The second comment indicated that the provision
will cause FCIC to insure two different crops of wheat on the same acreage during one crop year, which could cause a myriad
of administrative problems.


Response: 

As written, both Option A and B allow an insured to destroy damaged winter wheat, receive any applicable indemnity
payment, and then replant to spring wheat. The spring wheat can then be insured separately for a separate premium.
If the insured is forced to include acreage replanted to spring wheat as part of the winter unit, a significant coverage
provided by the options is eliminated. FCIC does not anticipate the administrative difficulties will be unmanageable.



Comment: 

The following question was submitted: ``Under Option A, if damaged winter wheat is replanted to spring wheat, does
the harvested spring wheat production count against the winter wheat unit production guarantee?''


Response: 

Yes.



Comment: 

The following question was submitted: ``Does the winter wheat guarantee continue on the replanted spring wheat crop
under paragraph b of Option B.''


Response: 

Yes.



Comment: 

One comment stated that Option B provides better coverage than Option A and will be more attractive to insureds. The
comment found no appreciable differences between the new Option B and former Winter Coverage Option for wheat.


Response: 

Option B is not similar to the current Winter Coverage Endorsement. Option B allows spring wheat (planted to replace
damaged winter wheat) to be treated as a separate crop. The current Endorsement requires that spring wheat in this
situation be a part of the winter wheat unit. This new choice provides more comprehensive coverage than the current
Endorsement.



Comment: 

One comment inquired if FCIC is aware of the recommendations from the meeting of the Montana Committee and the Billings
RSO regarding clarification of the Malting Barley Option.


Response: 

FCIC has considered and incorporated the recommendations of the Billings Regional Service Office and the Montana
Committee. The recommendations were to: (1) Include a clearer definition of the entity (i.e., a brewery or business
that makes or sells malt or processed mash to a brewery) contracting with the insured to produce malting barley; and
(2) clearly state that the insurer's liability under the Option is limited to the lesser of the number of contracted
bushels or the production guarantee.



Comment: 

One comment inquired if malting barley basic units can be divided into optional units by section/ASCS FSN and/or irrigated/non-irrigated
acreage. The comment stated that if this division is possible, paragraph 4 of the Malting Barley Option needs to be
revised to refer to the Small Grains Crop Provisions, not the Basic Provisions.


Response: 

Paragraph 4 of the Malting Barley Option refers to the ``Basic Policy,'' not the ``Basic Provisions.'' The ``Basic
Policy'' includes all provisions applicable to small grains (both the Common Crop Insurance Policy, and the Small
Grains Crop Provisions). Revision is not necessary.



Comment: 

A comment recommended that the approved malting barley varieties be specified in the Special Provisions.

<PARENT> FR940228-0-00002 </PARENT>

Response:

 FCIC agrees with the comment and has specified the varieties in the Special Provisions.



Comment:

 A comment suggested that the ``date of the final inspection for the unit'' be clarified.



Response:

 The date of the final inspection is the date that the loss adjustor completes the claim.



Comment:

 One comment recommended that the Malting Barley Option be revised to allow adjusting production for both (1) moisture
exceeding the requirements in the policy and (2) exceeding the grade requirements stated in the Option.



Response:

 FCIC agrees with the comment and has modified the paragraphs so that adjustments for moisture and quality are determined
separately.

During the interim between publication of the Small Grains Crop Provisions as a proposed rule and preparation of this
final rule, provisions providing coverage for Late and Prevented Planting were added to the current Wheat Endorsement
( 401.101), Barley Endorsement ( 401.103), and Oat Endorsement ( 401.105). These provisions
for Late and Prevented Planting Coverage, which were published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 22, 1993, have been incorporated into this final rule to continue the coverage provided by the current
endorsements for barley, oats, and wheat, and to provide the same coverage benefits to those insuring flax or rye.
In addition, FCIC has determined that revised language is needed in subparagraph 11.(c)(1)(iv) regarding acreage
an insured wants to put to another use prior to harvest. These provisions now allow an insured to destroy such acreage
when an appraisal amount is not agreed upon, if the insured agrees to leave representative samples of the crop in place.
The samples will be used to later determine the amount of production to count.

Accordingly, the rule, ``General Crop Insurance Regulations; Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions'' published
at 58 FR 32458 as revised as set out below is hereby adopted as final rule.



List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 457



Crop insurance; Barley, Flax, Malting barley, Oats, Rye, Wheat, Winter wheat.

1. Definitions



(a) 

Adequate stand

_A population of live plants per unit of acreage which will produce at least the yield used to establish your production
guarantee.

(b) 

Days

_Calendar days.
(c) 

Final planting date

_The date contained in the Special Provisions by which the insured crop must initially be planted in order to be insured
for the full production guarantee.

(d) 

Good farming practices

_The cultural practices necessary for the insured crop to make usual and normal progress toward maturity and which
can be expected to produce at least the yield used to determine the production guarantee. Good farming practices are
generally those in use in the county for production of the insured crop and are recognized by the Cooperative Extension
Service as compatible with agronomic and weather conditions in the area.

(e) 

Harvest

_Combining or threshing the insured crop for grain or cutting for hay or silage on any acreage. A crop which is swathed
prior to combining is not considered harvested.

(f) 

Initially planted

_The first occurrence of planting the insured crop on insurable acreage for the crop year.

(g) 

Interplanted

_Acreage on which two or more crops are planted in a manner that does not permit separate agronomic maintenance or harvest
of the insured crop.

(h) 

Irrigated practice

_A method of producing a crop by which water is artificially applied during the growing season by appropriate systems,
and at the proper times, with the intention of providing the quantity of water needed to produce at least the yield used
to establish the production guarantee on the irrigated acreage planted to the insured crop.

(i) 

Late planted

_Acreage planted during the late planting period.

(j) 

Late planting period

_(not applicable for fall-planted wheat)_The period that begins the day after the final planting date for the insured
crop and ends twenty-five (25) days after the final planting date.

(k) 

Latest final planting date

_

(1) The final planting date for spring-planted acreage in all counties for which the Special Provisions designate
a final planting date for spring-planted acreage only;

(2) The final planting date for fall-planted acreage in all counties for which the Special Provisions designate a
final planting date for fall-planted acreage only; or

(3) The final planting date for spring-planted acreage in all counties for which the Special Provisions designate
final planting dates for both spring-planted and fall-planted acreage.

(l) 

Local market price

_The cash grain price per bushel for the U.S. No. 2 grade of the insured crop offered by buyers in the area in which you
normally market the insured crop. The local market price will reflect the maximum limits of quality deficiencies
allowable for the U.S. No. 2 grade of the insured crop. Factors not associated with grading under the Official United
States Standards for Grain, including but not limited to protein, oil or moisture content, or milling quality will
not be considered.

(m) 

Nurse crop 

(companion crop)_A crop planted into the same acreage as another crop, that is intended to be harvested separately,
and which is planted to improve growing conditions for the crop with which it is grown.

(n) 

Planted acreage

_Land in which seed has been placed by a machine appropriate for the insured crop and planting method, at the correct
depth, into a seedbed which has been properly prepared for the planting method and production practice. Except for
flax, land on which seed is initially spread onto the soil surface by any method and subsequently is mechanically incorporated
into the soil in a timely manner and at the proper depth will be considered planted. Flax seed must initially be placed
in rows to be considered planted.

(o) 

Practical to replant_

(subsection 1.(ff) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy ( 457.8) does not apply to small grains.) Our determination,
after loss or damage to the insured crop, based on factors, including but not limited to moisture availability, condition
of the field, time to crop maturity, etc., that a replanting of the insured crop will attain maturity in the remainder
of the crop year. It will not be considered practical to replant after the end of the late planting period or the final
planting date if a late planting period is not applicable (see section 7) except that it may be determined practical
to replant after the end of the late planting period or the final plant date if such procedure is generally occurring
in the area.

(p) 

Prevented planting_

Inabiltiy to plant the insured crop with proper equipment by:

(1) The latest final planting date for the insured crop in the county; or

(2) The end of the late planting period.

You must have been unable to plant the insured crop due to an insured cause of loss that is general in the area (i.e., most
producers in the surrounding area are unable to plant due to similar insurable causes) and that occurs between the
sales closing date and the latest final planting date for the insured crop in the county or within the late planting
period.

(q) 

Production guarantee_

The number of bushels determined by multiplying the approved yield per acre by the coverage level percentage you elect.

(r) 

Replanting_

Swathed_

Severance of the stem and grain head from the ground without removal of the seed from the head and placing into a windrow.

(u) 

Timely planted_

Planted on or before the final planting date designated in the Special Provisions.



2. Unit Division



Unless limited by the Special Provisions, a unit as defined in subsection 1.(tt) of the Common Crop Insurance policy
( 457.8) may be divided into optional units if, for each optional unit you claim, all the conditions of subsections
2.(a), (b), and (c), and the conditions of paragraph 2.(d)(1), (d)(2, or (d)(3) are met, or if we agree to such division
in writing. Optional units must be established at the time you file your report of acreage for each crop year.

(a) You must have verifiable records of planted acreage and production for each optional unit for at least the last
crop year used to determine your production guarantee.

(b) You must plant the crop in a manner which results in a clear and discernable break in the planting pattern at the boundaries
of each optional unit.

(c) You must have measurements of stored production or market production from each optional unit in a manner that permits
us to verify the production from the optional unit.

(d) Each optional unit must meet one or more of the following:

(1) 

Optional Units by Section, Section Equivalent, or ASCS Farm Serial Number: 

Optional units may be established if each optional unit is located in a separate section. In the absence of sections,
we may consider parcels of land legally identified by other methods of measure including, but not limited to: Spanish
grants, railroad surveys, leagues, labors, or Virginia Military Lands. In areas which have not been surveyed using
the systems identified above or another system approved by us, and in areas where boundaries are not readily discernable,
each optional unit must be located in separate ASCS Farm Serial Number.

(2) 

Optional Units on Acreage Including Both Irrigated and Non-Irrigated Practices: 

In addition to or instead of establishing optional units by section, section equivalent, or ASCS Farm Serial Number,
optional units may be established if each optional unit contains only irrigated acreage or only non-irrigated acreage.
The irrigated acreage may not extend beyond the point at which your irrigation system can deliver the quantity of water
needed to produce the yield on which your guarantee is based. You must plant, cultivate, fertilize, or otherwise care
for the irrigated acreage and the non-irrigated acreage in an appropriate manner.

(3) 

Optional Units by Initially Planted Winter Wheat or Initially Planted Spring Wheat: 

For wheat only, in addition to or instead of establishing optional units by section, section equivalent, or ASCS Farm
Serial Number as described in paragraph 2.(d)(1) or by irrigated and non-irrigated practices as described in paragraph
2.(d)(2), optional units maybe established if each optional unit contains only initially planted winter wheat or
only initially planted spring wheat. Optional units may be established in this manner only in counties having both
fall and spring final planting dates as designated by the Special Provisions.

Basic units may not be divided into optional units on any basis (production practice, type, variety, planting period,
etc.) other than as described under this section. If you do not comply fully with these conditions, we will combine
all optional units which are not established in compliance with these provisions into the basic unit from which they
were formed. We may do this at any time we discover that you have failed to comply with these conditions. If failure to
comply with these provisions is determined to be inadvertent, and if the optional units are combined, the premium
paid for electing optional units will be refunded to you.



3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities



In addition to the requirements under section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for determining
Indemnities) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy ( 457.8) you may select only one price election for each crop
insured under this policy in the county.

4. Contract Changes



The contract change date is December 31 preceding the cancellation date for counties with an April 15 cancellation
date and June 30 preceding the cancellation date for all other counties (see the provisions under section 4. (Contract
changes) in the Common Crop Insurance Policy  457.8). 



5. Cancellation and Termination Dates



The cancellation and termination dates are: 






6. Insured Crop



(a) The crop insured will be each small grain you elect to insure, that is grown in the county on insurable acreage, and
for which premium rates are provided by the actuarial table: 

(1) In which you have a share; 

(2) That is planted for harvest as grain (a grain mixture in which barley or oats is the predominate grain may also be
insured if allowed by the Barley or Oat Special Provisions, or if we agree in writing to insure such mixture. The crop
insured will be the grain which is predominate in the mixture. The production from such mixture will be considered
as the predominate grain on a weight basis);

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940228-0-00021 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940228-0-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) That is not: 

(i) Interplanted with another crop except as allowed in paragraph 6.(a)(2); 

(ii) Planted into an established grass or legume; or 
(iii) Planted as a nurse crop, unless planted as a nurse crop for new forage seeding, but only if seeded at a normal rate
and intended for harvest as grain. 

(4) We may agree, in writing, to insure a crop prohibited under paragraph 6.(a)(3) if you so request. Your request to
insure such crop must be in writing, and submitted to your agent not later than 15 days after the acreage reporting date.


(b) If you anticipate destroying any acreage prior to harvest you: 

(1) May report all planted acreage when you report your acreage for the crop year and specify any acreage to be destroyed
as uninsurable acreage. (By doing so, no coverage will be considered to have attached on the specified acreage and
no premium will be due for such acreage. If you do not destroy such acreage, you will be subject to the under-reporting
provisions contained in subsection 6.(f) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy ( 457.8)); or 

(2) If the actuarial table provides a reduced premium rate for acreage destroyed by a date designated in the Special
Provisions, you may report all planted acreage as insurable when you report your acreage for the crop year. Premium
will be due on all the acreage. Your premium amount will be reduced by the amount shown on the Actuarial Table for any
acreage you destroy prior to a date designated in the Special Provisions if you do not claim an indemnity on such acreage.
In accordance with subsection 14.(b) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy ( 457.8), you must obtain our consent
before and give us notice after you destroy any of the insured crop so your acreage report can be revised to make you eligible
for this reduction in premium. 

(c) In counties for which the Wheat Special Provisions designate both fall and spring final planting dates, you may
elect a winter coverage endorsement for wheat. This endorsement provides two options for alternative coverage for
wheat that is damaged between the fall final planting date and the spring final planting date. Coverage under the endorsement
will be effective only if you designate the coverage option you elect by executing the endorsement by the sales closing
date for winter wheat in the county. 



7. Insurance Period 



In lieu of the requirements under section 11 (Insurance Period) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy ( 457.8),
and subject to any provisions provided by the Wheat crop insurance winter coverage endorsement ( 457.102)
if you have elected such endorsement, the insurance period is as follows: 

(a) Insurance attaches on each unit or part thereof on the later of the date we accept your application or the date the
insured crop is planted. 

(1) For oats, rye and flax, the following limitations apply: 

(i) The acreage must be planted on or before the final planting date designated in the Special Provisions for the insured
crop except as allowed in subsection 12.(c). 

(ii) Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would
normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted unless we agree that replanting is not practical (see subsection
1.(o)). 

(2) For barley and wheat, the following limitations apply: 

(i) The acreage must be planted on or before the final planting date designated in the Special Provisions for the type
(winter or spring) except as allowed in subsection 12.(c). 

(ii) Whenever the Special Provisions designate only a fall final planting date, any acreage of winter barley or wheat
damaged before such final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further care for
the crop, must be replanted to a winter type of the insured crop unless we agree that replanting is not practical. 

(iii) Whenever the Special Provisions designate both fall and spring final planting dates, winter barley or wheat
planted on or before the final planting date which is damaged: 

(A) Before the fall planting final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further
care for the crop, must be replanted to a winter type of the insured crop unless we agree that replanting is not practical.


(B) On or after the fall final planting date, but before the spring final planting date, to the extent that growers in
the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to an appropriate variety of the insured crop
unless we agree that replanting is not practical. 

If you have elected coverage under one of the available wheat winter coverage options available in the county, the
insurance period for wheat will be in accordance with the selected options. 

(iv) Whenever the Special Provisions designate a spring final planting date, any acreage of spring barley or wheat
damaged before such final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further care for
the crop, must be replanted to a spring type of the insured crop unless we agree that replanting is not practical. 

(v) Whenever the Special Provisions designate only a spring final planting date, any acreage of fall planted barley
or wheat is not insured unless you request such coverage and we agree in writing that the acreage has an adequate stand
in the spring to produce the yield used to determine your production guarantee. Insurance will then attach to acreage
having an adequate stand on the earlier of the spring final planting date or the date we agree to accept the acreage for
insurance. If such fall planted acreage is not to be insured it must be recorded on the acreage report as an uninsured
fall planted crop. 

(b) Insurance ends on each unit at the earliest of: 
(1) Total destruction of the insured crop on the unit;

<DOCNO> FR940228-0-00022 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940228-0-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) Harvest of the unit;

(3) Final adjustment of a loss on the unit;

(4) September 25 following planting in Alaska, or October 31 of the calendar year in which the crop is normally harvested
in all other states; or

(5) Abandonment of the crop on the unit.



8. Causes of Loss



In addition to the provisions under section 12 (Causes of Loss) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy, any loss covered
by this policy must occur within the insurance period.

The specific causes of loss for small grains are:

(a) Adverse weather conditions;

(b) Fire; 

(c) Insects, but not damage allowed because of insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;

(d) Plant disease, but not damage allowed because of insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;

(e) Wildlife;

(f) Earthquake;

(g) Volcanic eruption; or 

(h) Failure of the irrigation water supply.



9. Replanting Payments



(a) A replant payment for wheat only is allowed as follows:

(1) You comply with all requirements regarding replanting payments contained under section 13 (Replanting Payment)
of the Common Crop Insurance Policy and in any winter coverage endorsement for which you are eligible and which you
have elected;

(2) The wheat must be damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at
least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage;

(3) The acreage must have been initially planted to spring wheat in those counties with only a spring final planting
date;

(4) The damage must occur after the fall final planting date in those counties where both a fall and spring final planting
date are designated;

(5) Replanting must take place not later than 25 days after the spring final planting date; and

(6) The replant wheat must be seeded at a rate that is normal for initially planted wheat (if new seed is planted at a reduced
seeding rate into a partially damaged stand of wheat, the acreage will not be eligible for a replanting payment).

(b) No replanting payment will be made for acreage initially planted to winter wheat in any county for which the Special
Provisions contain only a fall final planting date.

(c) In accordance with subsection 13.(c) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy ( 457.8), the maximum amount of
the replanting payment per acre will be the lesser of 20 percent (20%) of the production guarantee or 3 bushels, multiplied
by your price election multiplied by your share.

(d) When wheat is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable for an original planting, the liability for the unit
will be reduced by the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be reduced.



10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss



In addition to your duties under section 14 of the Common Crop Insurance Policy ( 457.8), if you initially discover
damage to any insured crop within 15 days of, or during harvest, you must leave representative samples of the unharvested
crop for our inspection. The samples must be at least 10 feet wide and the entire length of each field in the unit, and
must not be harvested or destroyed until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the
unit is completed.



11. Settlement of Claim



(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are
acceptable to us for any:

(1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided;
or for any



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940228-0-00023 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940228-0-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested
acreage for each unit. 

(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by: 

(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by the production guarantee; 

(2) Subtracting from this the total production to count; 

(3) Multiplying the remainder by your price election; and 

(4) Multiplying this result by your share. 

(c) The total production (bushels) to count from all insurable acreage on the unit will include: 

(1) All appraised production as follows: 

(i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage: 

(A) Which is abandoned; 

(B) Put to another use without our consent; 

(C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes; or 

(D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are acceptable to us; 

(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes; 

(iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess
moisture in accordance with subsection 11.(d)); 

(iv) Potential production on insured acreage you want to put to another use or you wish to abandon and no longer care
for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage
will end if you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If: 

(A) Agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached, you may elect to continue to care for the crop, or
we will give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for,
representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us. The amount of production to count for such acreage
will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred.
If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal
made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production
to count. 

(B) You elect to continue to care for the crop, we will determine the amount of production to count for the acreage using
the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested. 

(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage. 

(d) Mature wheat, barley, oat, and rye production may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality deficiencies. Flax
production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies only. 

(1) Production will be reduced by .12 percent for each .1 percentage point of moisture in excess of: 

(i) 13.5 percent for wheat; 

(ii) 14.5 percent for barley; 

(iii) 14.0 percent for oats; and 

(iv) 16.0 for rye. 

We may obtain samples of the production to determine the moisture content. 

(2) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if: 

(i) Deficiencies in quality, in accordance with the Official United States Standards for Grain, result in: 

(A) Wheat not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. No. 5 or worse) because of test weight, total
damaged kernels (excluding heat damage), shrunken or broken kernels, or defects (excluding foreign material and
heat damage), or grading garlicky, light smutty, smutty or ergoty; 

(B) Barley not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. No. 5 or worse) because of test weight, percentage
of sound barley, damaged kernels, thin barley, or black barley, or grading smutty, garlicky, or ergoty;

(C) Oats not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grade U.S. sample grade) because of test weight or percentage
of sound oats, or grading smutty, garlicky, or ergoty;
 
(D) Rye not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 3 (grades U.S. No. 4 or worse) because of test weight, percent
damaged kernels or thin rye, or grading smutty, garlicky, or ergoty;
 
(E) Flaxseed not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 2 (grades U.S. sample grade) due to damaged kernels; or
 
(ii) Substances or conditions are present, including mycotoxins, that are identified by the Food and Drug Administration
or other public health organizations of the United States as being injurious to human or animal health.
 
(3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:
 
(i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a cause of loss against which insurance is provided
under these crop provisions;
 
(ii) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions result in a net price for the damaged grain that is less than the local
market price of U.S. No. 2 production;
 
(iii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or conditions are made using samples of the production
obtained by us or by a disinterested third party approved by us; and
 
(iv) The samples are analyzed by a grain grader licensed under the authority of the United States Grain Standards Act
or the United States Warehouse Act with regard to deficiencies in quality, or by a laboratory approved by us with regard
to substances or conditions injurious to human or animal health. Test weight for quality adjustment purposes may
be determined by one loss adjustor.
 
(4) Production of small grains that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in paragraphs 11.(d) (2) and
(3), will be reduced as follows:
 
(i) The market price of the qualifying damaged production and the local market price will be the prices on the earlier
of the date such quality adjusted production is sold or the date of final inspection for the unit. The price for the qualifying
damaged production will be the market price for the local area to the extent feasible. Discounts used to establish
the net price of the damaged production will be limited to those which are usual, customary, and reasonable. Any reduction
in price due to the following factors will not be accepted:
 
(A) Moisture content;
 
(B) Damage due to uninsured causes; or
 
(C) Drying, handling, processing, or any other costs associated with normal harvesting, handling, and marketing
of the grain; except, if the price of the damaged production can be increased by conditioning, we may reduce the price
of the production after it has been conditioned by the cost of conditioning but not lower than the value of the production
before conditioning. We may obtain prices from any buyer of our choice. If we obtain prices from one or more buyers located
outside your local market area, we will reduce such prices by the additional costs required to deliver the production
to those buyers.
 
(ii) The value of the damaged or conditioned production will be divided by the local market price to determine the quality
adjustment factor.
 
(iii) The number of bushels remaining after any reduction due to excessive moisture (the moisture-adjusted gross
bushels (if appropriate)) of the damaged or conditioned production will then be multiplied by the quality adjustment
factor to determine the net production to count.
 
(e) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop may be counted as production of the insured crop
on a weight basis.
 


12. Late Planting and Prevented Planting
 


(a) In lieu of paragraph 8.(b)(2) and subsection 1.(aa) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy ( 457.8), insurance
will be provided for acreage planted to the insured crop during the late planting period (see subsection (c)), and
acreage you were prevented from planting (see subsection (d)). These coverages provide reduced production guarantees.
The reduced guarantees will be combined with the production guarantee for timely planted acreage for each unit. The
premium amount for late planted acreage and eligible prevented planting acreage will be the same as that for timely
planting acreage. If the amount of premium you are required to pay (gross premium less our subsidy) for late planting
acreage or prevented planting acreage exceeds the liability on such acreage, coverage for those acres will not be
provided (no premium will be due and no indemnity will be paid for such acreage). For example, assume you insure one
unit in which you have a 100 percent share. The unit consists of 150 acres, of which 50 acres were planted timely, 50 acres
were planted 7 days after the final planting date (late planted), and 50 acres are unplanted and eligible for prevented
planting coverage. To calculate the amount of any indemnity which may be due to you, the production guarantee for the
unit will be computed as follows:
 
(1) For timely planted acreage, multiply the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by the 50 acres
planted timely;
 
(2) For late planted acreage, multiply the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by 93 percent
(0.93) and multiply the result by the 50 acres planted late; and
 
(3) For prevented planting acreage, multiply the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by 50 percent
(0.50) and multiply the result by the 50 acres eligible for prevented planting coverage.
 
The total of the three calculations will be the production guarantee for the unit. Your premium will be based on the
result of multiplying the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by the 150 acres in the unit.

<PARENT> FR940228-0-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) You must provide written notice to us if you were prevented from planting (see subsection 1.(p)). This notice must
be given not later than three (3) days after:


(1) The final planting date if you have unplanted acreage that may be eligible for prevented planting coverage; and


(2) The date you stop planting within the late planting period on any unit that may have acreage eligible for prevented
planting coverage.


(c) Late Planting:


(1) For spring-planted wheat acreage in counties for which the Special Provisions designate a spring final planting
date, and all barley, flax, oat, and rye acreage which is planted after the final planting date but on or before 25 days
after the final planting date, the production guarantee for each acre will be reduced for each day planted after the
final planting date by:


(i) One percent (.01) for the first through the tenth day; and


(ii) Two percent (.02) for the eleventh through the twenty-fifth day.


(2) In addition to the requirements of section 6 (Report of Acreage) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy ( 457.8),
you must report the dates the acreage is planted within the late planting period.


(3) If planting of the insured crop continues after the final planting date, or you are prevented from planting during
the late planting period, the acreage reporting date will be the later of:


(i) The acreage reporting date contained in the Special Provisions; or


(ii) Five (5) days after the end of the late planting period.


(d) Prevented Planting (Including Planting After the Late Planting Period)


(1) If you were prevented from planting the insured crop (see subsection 1.(p)), you may elect:


(i) To plant the insured crop during the late planting period (The production guarantee for such acreage will be determined
in accordance with paragraph 12.(c)(1));


(ii) Not to plant this acreage to any crop that is intended for harvest in the same crop year (The production guarantee
for such acreage which is eligible for prevented planting coverage will be 50 percent (50%) of the production guarantee
for timely planted acres. In counties for which the Special Provisions designates a spring final planting date, the
prevented planting guarantee will be based on your approved yield for spring-planted acreage of the insured crop.
For example, if your production guarantee for timely planted acreage is 30 bushels per acre, your prevented planting
production guarantee would be equivalent to 15 bushels per acre (30 bushels multiplied by 0.50). This subparagraph
does not prohibit the preparation and care of the acreage for conservation practices, such as planting a cover crop,
as long as such crop is not intended for harvest); or


(iii) To plant the insured crop after the late planting period (The production guarantee for such acreage will be 50
percent (50%) of the production guarantee for timely planted acres. For example, if your production guarantee for
timely planted acreage is 30 bushels per acre, your prevented planting production guarantee would be equivalent
to 15 bushels per acre (30 bushels times 0.50). Production to count for such acreage will be determined in accordance
with subsections 11.(c) through (e)).


(2) In addition to the provisions under section 11 (Insurance Period), of the Common Crop Insurance Policy ( 457.8)
the beginning of the insurance period for prevented coverage is the sales closing date designated in the Special Provisions
for the insured crop in the county.


(3) Unless we agree in writing, prior to the sales closing date, the acreage to which prevented planting coverage applies
will be limited as follows:


(i) Eligible acreage will not exceed the greater of:


(A) The number of acres planted to the insured crop on each ASCS Farm Serial Number during the previous crop year (adjusted
for any reconstitution which may have occurred prior to the sales closing date);


(B) The ASCS base acreage for the insured crop reduced by any acreage reduction applicable to the farm under any program
administered by the United States Department of Agriculture; or


(C) One hundred percent (100%) of the simple average of the number of acres planted to the insured crop during the crop
years that were used to determine your yield;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940228-0-00026 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940228-0-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Unless we agree in writing, prior to the sales closing date, to approve acreage exceeding this limit.

(ii) Acreage intended to be planted under an irrigated practice will be limited to the number of acres properly prepared
to carry out an irrigated practice.

(iii) A prevented planting production guarantee will not be provided for:

(A) Any acreage that does not constitute at least 20 acres or 20 percent (20%) of the acres in the unit, whichever is less;

(B) Land for which the actuarial table does not designate a premium rate unless you submit a written request for coverage
for such acreage prior to the sales closing date for the insured crop in the county and we provide a written insurance
offer for such acreage;

(C) Land used for conservation purposes or intended to be or considered to have been left unplanted under any program
administered by the United States Department of Agriculture;

(D) Land on which any crop, other than the insured crop, has been planted and is intended for harvest, or has been harvested
in the same crop year; or

(E) Land which planting history or conservation plans indicate would remain fallow for crop rotation purposes.

(iv) For the purpose of determining eligible acreage for prevented planting coverage, acreage for all units will
be combined and reduced by the number of acres of the insured crop that are timely planted and late planted. For example,
assume you have 100 acres eligible for prevented planting coverage in which you have a 100 percent (100%) share. The
acreage is located in a single ASCS Farm Serial Number which you insure as two separate optional units consisting of
50 acres each. If you planted 60 acres of the insured crop on one optional unit and 40 acres of the insured crop on the second
optional unit, your prevented planting eligible acreage would be reduced to zero (i.e., 100 acres eligible for prevented
planting coverage minus 100 acres planted equals zero). If you report more acreage of the insured crop under this contract
than is eligible for prevented planting coverage, we will allocate the eligible acreage to insured units based on
the number of prevented planting acres and share you report for each unit.

(4) When the ASCS Farm Serial Number covers more than one unit, or a unit consists of more than one ASCS Farm Serial Number,
the covered acres will be pro-rated based on the number of acres in each unit or ASCS Farm Serial Number that could have
been planted to the insured crop in the current crop year.

(5) In accordance with the provisions of section 6 (Report of Acreage) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy ( 457.8),
you must report any insurable acreage you were prevented from planting. This report must be submitted on or before
the acreage reporting date for spring-planted acreage of the insured crop in counties for which the Special Provisions
designates a spring final planting date, or the acreage reporting date for fall-planted acreage of the insured crop
in counties for which the Special Provisions designates a fall final planting date only, even though you may elect
to plant the acreage after the late planting period. Any acreage you report as eligible for prevented planting coverage
which is not eligible will be deleted from prevented planting coverage.

Wheat Crop Insurance Winter Coverage Endorsement



(This is a Continuous Endorsement)



(a) In return for payment of the additional premium designated in the Actuarial Table, this endorsement is attached
to and made part of your Small Grains Crop Provisions subject to the terms and conditions described herein.

(b) This endorsement is available only in counties for which the Special Provisions designate both a fall final planting
date and a spring final planting date.

(c) This endorsement modifies the provisions of sections 7 and 11 of the Small Grains Crop Insurance policy ( 457.101).

(1) You must have a Small Grains Crop Insurance policy in force and elect to insure wheat under that policy. 
(2) You may select either Option A or Option B. Failure to select either Option A or Option B means that you have rejected
both Options and this endorsement would be void. 
(3) Insurance Period. Coverage under this endorsement begins on the later of the date we accept your application for
coverage or on the fall final planting date designated in the Special Provisions. Coverage ends on the spring final
planting date designated in the Special Provisions.
(4) The provisions under section 14 of the Common Crop Insurance Policy ( 457.8) are amended to require that
all notices of damage must be provided to us by the spring final planting date designated in the Special Provisions.


 


Option A (30 Percent Coverage and Acreage Release) 


Whenever any winter wheat is damaged during the insurance period (see section 3, above), and at least 20 acres or 20
percent of the acreage in the unit, whichever is less, does not have an adequate stand to produce at least 90 percent
of the production guarantee for the acreage, you may take any one of the following actions: 
(a) Destroy the remaining crop on such acreage. By doing so, you agree to accept an amount of production to count against
the unit production guarantee equal to 70 percent of the production guarantee for the damaged acreage, or an appraisal
determined in accordance with paragraph 11.(c)(1) of the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions ( 457.101)
if such an appraisal results in a greater amount of production. This amount will be considered production to count
in determining any final indemnity on the unit and will be used to settle your claim as described in the provisions under
section 11. (Settlement of Claim) of the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions ( 457.101). You may use such
acreage for any purpose, including planting and separately insuring any other crop. If you elect to utilize such acreage
for the production of spring wheat, you must: 
(1) Plant the spring wheat in a manner which results in a clear and discernible break in the planting pattern at the boundary
between it and any remaining winter wheat; and 
(2) Store or market the production from such acreage in a manner which permits us to verify the amount of spring wheat
production separately from any winter wheat production. 
In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us, the spring wheat acreage will
be considered to be a part of the original winter wheat unit. If you elected to insure the spring wheat acreage as a separate
optional unit, any premium amount for such acreage will be considered earned and payable to us. 
(b) Continue to care for the damaged crop. By doing so, coverage will continue under the terms of the Common Crop Insurance
Policy ( 457.8), the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions ( 457.101), and this Option. 
(c) Replant the acreage to an appropriate variety of wheat, if it is practical, and receive a replanting payment in
accordance with the terms of section 9. (Replanting Payments) of the Small Grains Crop Provisions ( 457.101).
By doing so, coverage will continue under the terms of the Common Crop Insurance Policy ( 457.8), the Small Grains
Crop Insurance Provisions ( 457.101), and this Option, and the production guarantee for winter wheat will
remain in effect. 


Option B (

With Full Winter Damage Coverage

) 


Whenever any winter wheat is damaged during the insurance period and at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the acreage in
the unit, whichever is less, does not have an adequate stand to produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee
for the acreage, you may, at your option, take one of the following actions: 
(a) Continue to care for the damaged crop. By doing so, coverage will continue under the terms of the Common Crop Insurance
Policy ( 457.8), the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions ( 457.101), and this Option. 

(b) Replant the acreage to an appropriate variety of wheat, if it is practical, and receive a replanting payment in
accordance with the terms of section 9. (Replanting Payments) of the Small Grains Crop Provisions ( 457.101).
By doing so, coverage will continue under the terms of the Common Crop Insurance Policy ( 457.8), the Small Grains
Crop Insurance Provisions ( 457.101), and this Option, and the production guarantee for winter wheat will
remain in effect.

(c) Accept our appraisal of the crop on the damaged acreage as production to count against the production guarantee
for the damaged acreage, destroy the remaining crop on such acreage, and be eligible for any indemnity due under the
terms of the Common Crop Insurance Policy ( 457.8) and the Small Grains Crop Provisions ( 457.101). The
appraisal will be considered production to count in determining any final indemnity on the unit and will be used to
settle your claim as described in the provisions of section 11. (Settlement of Claim) of the Small Grains Crop Insurance
Provisions ( 457.101). You may use such acreage for any purpose, including planting and separately insuring

Official Brucellosis Tests 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the brucellosis regulations by adding the D-Tec

 

 
Brucella A test to the list of official tests for determining the brucellosis 
disease status of test-eligible cattle and bison. We are taking this action 
because the D-Tec

 

 Brucella A test has exhibited a high degree of specificity 
in identifying 

Brucella abortus 

antibodies. Adding the D-Tec

 

 Brucella A test 
to the list of official tests for brucellosis in cattle and bison will help 
prevent the spread of the disease by making available an additional means by 
which animal health personnel may obtain timely and accurate diagnoses of 
brucellosis. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Brucellosis is an infectious disease of animals and humans caused by 
bacteria of the genus 

Brucella. 

In its principal animal hosts_cattle, 
bison, and swine_brucellosis is characterized by abortion and impaired 
fertility. The regulations in 9 CFR part 78 (referred to below as the 
regulations) govern the interstate movement of cattle, bison, and swine in 
order to help prevent the spread of brucellosis. 

Official brucellosis tests are used to determine the brucellosis disease 
status of cattle, bison, and swine. The regulations stipulate that certain 
cattle, bison, and swine must, among other requirements, test negative to an 
official brucellosis test prior to interstate movement. Official brucellosis 
tests are also used to determine eligibility for indemnity payments for 
animals destroyed because of brucellosis. In  78.1 of the regulations, the 
definition of official test lists those tests that have been designated as 
official tests for determining the brucellosis disease status of cattle, 
bison, and swine. 

On September 27, 1993, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 
50290-50291, Docket No. 93-044-1) a proposal to amend the regulations by 
adding the D-Tec

 

 Brucella A test to the list of official tests for 
determining the brucellosis disease status of test-eligible cattle and bison. 

We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 30-day comment 
period ending October 27, 1993. We received one comment by that date, from a 
veterinary medical association. The commenter supported our proposed rule. 

Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are 
adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule without change. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.

The rule change will not add any costs for agricultural producers. It 
will, however, benefit farmers and ranchers who, without access to this or the 
other available diagnostic tests, quarantine or destroy animals on the basis 
of ``false positive'' reactions to presumptive tests. We estimate that between 
200 and 300 animals are unnecessarily slaughtered or quarantined each year 
after having falsely tested positive on presumptive tests. These losses could 
be prevented by the use of diagnostic tests. The addition of the D-Tec

 

 
Brucella A test as an official test will prevent losses to farmers and 
ranchers if they opt to use it. While losses resulting from false positives 
affect only a few farmers and ranchers each year, this rule could modestly 
benefit all those entities that avail themselves of the D-Tec

 

 Brucella A 
test. 

This rule is expected to have a beneficial effect on the producer of the 
D-Tec

 

 Brucella A test and a negligible negative impact on the only other 
producer of diagnostic tests. Both producers are small entities. 

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Executive Order 12372 



This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic 
Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which 
requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See

Importation of Hoofs 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the animal byproduct importation regulations to allow hoofs that have been disinfected in their country
of origin to be imported into the United States without further processing. Currently, certain hoofs imported into
the United States must be consigned from the port of first arrival to an approved establishment having facilities
for their disinfection. We have determined, however, that hoofs that have been adequately disinfected in their country
of origin may be imported into the United States without risk of introducing disease. This change in the regulations
will give importers of hoofs that require disinfection a choice between importing disinfected hoofs and importing
unprocessed hoofs for disinfection in the United States.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The regulations in 9 CFR part 95 (referred to below as ``the regulations'') contain restrictions on the importation
into the United States of certain animal byproducts and hay and straw in order to prevent the introduction of certain
animal diseases. Among the regulated animal byproducts are animal hoofs, which, along with bones and horns, may be
imported subject to the restrictions contained in   95.11 and 95.12. 

On July 13, 1993, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 37669-37670, Docket No. 92-135-1) a proposal to amend the regulations to allow hoofs that
have been disinfected in their country of origin, using one of five approved disinfection methods specified in the
proposed rule, to be imported into the United States without additional treatment. We proposed to require that the
hoofs be accompanied by a certificate issued by the national government of the country of origin and signed by an official
veterinary inspector of that country stating that the hoofs have been disinfected and describing the manner in which
the disinfection was accomplished. 

We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 60-day comment period ending September 13, 1993. We received
one comment by that date, from a veterinary medical association. The comment fully supported our proposed rule.

Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as
a final rule without change. 



Effective Date 



This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective
less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. This rule removes restrictions on the importation of hoofs by allowing hoofs that have been processed in their country
of origin to be imported into the United States without further processing. We have determined that approximately
2 weeks are needed to ensure that Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service personnel at ports of entry receive official
notice of this change in the regulations. Therefore, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service has determined that this rule should be made effective 15 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. Based on information compiled by the Department,
we have determined that this rule: (1) Will have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; (2) will not adversely
affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (3) will not create a serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (4) will not alter the budgetary impact of
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof; and (5) will not
raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth
in Executive Order 12866. 

We have required certain hoofs imported into the United States to be consigned directly from the port of entry to an
approved establishment that has facilities for their disinfection. This rule will allow hoofs to be imported into
the United States without further processing if the hoofs have been disinfected using an approved method in their
country of origin. We believe that adding this option will have little or no economic impact on U.S. importers of hoofs
because it will not significantly decrease their cost of doing business. The primary impact on these importers will
be the added convenience of having two importation options from which to choose. 

The primary use of disinfected hoofs appears to be in the production of dog chews, but that industry is still in its infancy
and is rather small in terms of production and numbers of producers. Based on information available to the Department,
we estimate that there are currently fewer than 10 importers of hoofs and approximately 6 producers of dog chews made
from hoofs. Using the Small Business Administration's size criteria of fewer than 100 employees, all of these businesses
would be considered small entities. 

We believe that a few of these businesses receive hoofs from both foreign and domestic sources. Because the industry
is small and relatively new, however, there are no records available concerning the number of hoofs imported into
the United States or the levels of dog chew production. 

The facilities in which hoofs are disinfected handle a variety of items, with hoofs making up only a small percentage
of the total volume of products processed. Therefore, we anticipate that allowing hoofs to be processed in their country
of origin will have little, if any, economic impact on domestic processors in terms of lost volume and revenue. 

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Executive Order 12778 



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State
and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not
require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this final rule will be submitted for approval
to the Office of Management and Budget.

Airworthiness Directives; British Aerospace Model ATP Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain British Aerospace Model ATP
airplanes. This action requires inspections to detect damaged main landing gear (MLG) wheel bearings and replacement
of discrepant parts. This amendment is prompted by reports of failure of the MLG wheel bearings. The actions specified
in this AD are intended to prevent detachment of a MLG wheel from the airplane.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain British Aerospace Model ATP airplanes. The CAA advises that reports
have been received of failure of the main landing gear (MLG) wheel bearings on Model ATP airplanes. Investigations
are under way to determine the cause of these failures. This condition, if not corrected, could result in detachment
of a MLG wheel from the airplane. 


Jetstream has issued Service Bulletin ATP-32-48, Revision 1, dated January 28, 1994, that describes
procedures for performing daily and pre-flight detailed visual inspections to detect damage or discoloration of
the main wheel hub caps and of the outer side of the inflation valve side hubs on the MLG wheels. (This service bulletin
references Dunlop Service Bulletin AHA 1663-32-1088, Revision 1, dated January 13, 1994, as the appropriate
source of service information.) The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued CAA Airworthiness
Directive 007-12-93, dated December 22, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these
airplanes in the United Kingdom. 
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent failure of the MLG wheel bearings, which
could result in detachment of the MLG wheel from the airplane. This AD requires daily and pre-flight detailed visual
inspections to detect damage or discoloration of the main wheel hub caps and of the outer side of the inflation valve
side hubs on the MLG wheels. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the Jetstream service bulletin
described previously. 
This AD also requires replacement of the entire MLG wheel assembly and bearings with a serviceable wheel assembly
and bearings, if any damage or discoloration is detected during any inspection. The replacement is required to be
accomplished in accordance with the airplane maintenance manual. 
Operators should note that, although Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP-32-48, 
Revision 1, dated January 28, 1994, specifies that certain pilots may perform both the daily and pre-flight inspections,
it is the FAA's determination that both inspections must be performed by appropriately certificated maintenance
personnel, as specified in  43.3 of the FAR (14 CFR 43.3). 
This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider further
rulemaking. 
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

Comments Invited 



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ``

ADDRESSES

.'' All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be
amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions
is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking
action would be needed. 



Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-16-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ``

Revisions to the Export Administration Regulations; Elimination of the Certification Requirements for General
License GLR



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Export Administration, Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), by eliminating
the Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) certification requirements for exports and reexports of replacement parts
and equipment under General License GLR to Country Groups Q, T, V, W, and Y. These reporting requirements were originally
imposed as a tracking system to help determine how well the replacement provisions of General License GLR were working.
BXA has determined that placing the symbol GLR on the SED is in itself a certification that the conditions of the general
license are understood and that the exporter will comply with the terms of the general license. However, the removal
of the certification requirement does not relieve the exporter of any recordkeeping obligations or other export
clearance provisions contained in the EAR.



This rule also eliminates the reporting requirement regarding servicing commodities imported from Country Groups
Q, W, or Y and eliminates the reporting requirements regarding certain reexports of one-for-one replacements and
replacement equipment.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Exporters are reminded that listing General License GLR on the Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) and the presentation
of such a SED to the U.S. Government under the clearance procedures of part 786 constitutes a declaration that the export
is authorized under General License GLR and that the exporter is committed to the terms and conditions of the one-for-one
replacement authority of General License GLR, including, but not limited to, the duty to destroy abroad or return
the part to be replaced.




Rulemaking Requirements



1. This rule involves a collection of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0694-0018 and 0694-0047. This
rule will reduce the reporting burden on the public.

2. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
assessment under Executive Order 12612.

3. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this
rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under section 3(a) of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has
to be or will be prepared.

4. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the
opportunity for public participation, and a delay in effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation involves
a foreign and military affairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the Export Administration Act (EAA)
does not require that this rule be published in proposed form because this rule does not impose a new control. No other
law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule.

Accordingly, it is issued in final form. However, comments from the public are always welcome. Comments should be
submitted to Patricia Muldonian, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department
of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.

Implementing Regulations for the Government Securities Act of 1986 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Under Secretary for Domestic Finance, Treasury. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of the Treasury (``Department'') is issuing in final form amendments to the regulations issued under
the Government Securities Act of 1986, as amended (the ``Government Securities Act'' or ``GSA''). The amendments
implement a buy-in requirement for mortgage-backed securities that are in a fail to receive status for more than 60
calendar days; and all government securities that are needed to complete a customer sell order (other than a short
sale) if the securities have not been received from the customer within 30 calendar days after the settlement date
for all government securities except mortgage-backed securities, or 60 calendar days after the settlement date
for mortgage-backed securities. The final rule adopts without substantive change the buy-in requirements for mortgage-backed
securities in a fail to receive status that were prescribed in the proposed rules published for comment on April 17,
1991. However, the time frames for buy-ins of customer sell orders have been revised in the final rule in response to
comments received on the proposed rules. These requirements apply to all entities that are required to register or
provide notice of their status as government securities brokers and dealers. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


 
I. Background 



The GSA regulations currently require a government securities broker or dealer to take prompt steps to obtain possession
or control of customers' fully paid or excess margin securities that have been in a fail to receive status for more than
30 calendar days through a buy-in procedure or otherwise. However, mortgage-backed securities are not subject to
this buy-in requirement since the Department suspended the application of this rule to such securities in the GSA
regulations that were issued in July 1987.

1

 In addition, the current GSA regulations do not impose a buy-in requirement for customer sell orders where the government
securities broker or dealer has not obtained the securities from its customer. A temporary rule imposing such a requirement
on registered government securities brokers and dealers was suspended in the July 1987 GSA regulations issued by
the Department.

2

 






On April 17, 1991, the Department proposed for comment amendments to sections 403.1, 403.4, and 403.5 of the GSA regulations.

3

 The proposed amendments prescribed buy-in requirements for: (i) Mortgage-backed securities in a fail to receive
status for more than 60 calendar days, and (ii) customer sell orders (other than short sales) in which the securities
were not received from the customer within ten business days after the settlement date. 





The proposed rule was intended to subject mortgage-backed securities to a 60 calendar day buy-in requirement, rather
than the 30 calendar days applicable to other government securities due to the unique nature of the mortgage-backed
market, particularly the lengthy settlement cycle. The reader is referred to the preamble to the proposed rule

4

 for a more detailed discussion of the Department's reasons for adopting a 60 calendar day time frame for buy-ins of
mortgage-backed securities. The proposed rulemaking also included buy-in rules for customer sell orders that would
apply to all government securities brokers and dealers, including financial institutions. Specifically, the provisions
proposed that if a government securities broker or dealer executes a customer sell order (other than a short sale)
and the broker or dealer has not obtained the securities from the customer within ten business days after the settlement
date, then the broker or dealer would be required to close out the transaction with the customer by purchasing securities
of like kind and quantity. The Department specifically requested comments concerning the appropriateness of the
ten-day time frame.

The comment period for the proposed rules closed on June 17, 1991. Only one letter

5

 was received in response to the proposed rule changes. The commenter supported the 60-day buy-in time frame for mortgage-backed
securities in a fail to receive status but opposed the proposed rule for customer sell orders. However, the commenter
suggested modifications to the time frame for buy-ins of customer sell orders if Treasury decided to adopt such a rule.






Treasury did not issue these rules in final form prior to the expiration of its rulemaking authority on October 1, 1991.
Treasury's authority under the GSA was permanently reauthorized on December 17, 1993, hence the long delay in finalizing
these rules. 



II. Section-by-Section Analysis of Proposed Changes 



A. Buy-Ins for Fails To Receive 



The Department is now adopting without significant change amendments to paragraphs 403.1, 403.4(g) and 403.5(c)(1)(iii)
that were proposed in April 1991. These provisions would require all government securities brokers and dealers that
are required to register or file notice pursuant to 15C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act to take prompt steps to obtain possession
or control of mortgage-backed securities that are in a fail to receive status for more than 60 calendar days through
a buy-in procedure or otherwise.

6

 The Public Securities Association (PSA), which was the only commenter on the proposed rules, supported the 60 calendar
day time frame for buy-ins of mortgage-backed securities, stating that ``* * * the proposal is a reasonable
approach.''

7

 This time frame reflects the recommendations made in July 1989 by an industry-wide task force established by the PSA.

8

 







As discussed in more detail in the preamble to the proposed rules, the Department is adopting a longer buy-in time frame
for fails to receive for mortgage-backed securities than the 30-calendar day time frame in place for other government
securities. This longer time period is appropriate given the normally longer settlement cycle for mortgage-backed
securities (which is often as long as 30 days),

9

 the complexities of these instruments and the scarcity in the market of specified pools. To avoid abnormal settlements,

10

 the Department reiterates that any buy-in accomplished pursuant to these rules would be allowed to settle on the next
regularly scheduled settlement date for that particular class or pool of mortgage-backed securities. 






The Department understands that the PSA will implement buy-in procedures for mortgage-backed securities similar
to those in place for other government securities. We believe that reliance on procedures that are already familiar
to the broker-dealers should facilitate the implementation of this rule and view efforts to standardize the operational
procedures as a positive step. 



B. Buy-Ins for Customer Sell Orders 



The Department's proposed rules included a requirement to buy-in customer sell orders (other than a short sale) in
cases where the government securities broker or dealer had not obtained the securities from the customer within ten
business days after the settlement date. For registered government securities brokers and dealers the Department
was proposing to add paragraph 403.4(l) which incorporated by reference paragraph (m) of SEC Rule 15c3-3 (17
CFR 240.15c3-3(m)), with one modification pertaining to the definition of a short sale.

11

 This rule has been suspended by the SEC with respect to exempted securities since 1973, including government securities.

12

 A companion buy-in rule for customer sell orders that would apply to financial institutions that are required to file
notice as government securities brokers and dealers was also proposed in April 1991 by adding new paragraph 403.5(g)
to the GSA regulations.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940228-0-00041 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940228-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In its comment letter, the PSA stated that the ten-day buy-in rule for customer sell orders should not be adopted because
it has minimal customer protection benefits. The PSA noted that improvements in the settlement processes and the
fact that most Treasury, agency and government mortgage-backed securities are now in book-entry form have resulted
in increased deliveries and fewer overall fails. For those few fails that may still occur, the PSA stated that ``[b]roker-dealers
have business incentives to clean up fails to limit their market exposure.''

13

 For mortgage-backed securities, the ten-day buy-in time frame would be problematic since it would require delivery
of securities outside of the regularly scheduled settlement cycles. The PSA suggested that, if Treasury believes
a buy-in rule for customer sell orders must be adopted, the time frame should be consistent with the applicable buy-in
time frames for fails to receive. 




The Department continues to believe that buy-in rules for customer sell orders are needed to strengthen customer
protection because a customer's failure to deliver a security to an executing broker or dealer could result in that
broker's or dealer's failure to deliver to another counterparty. Further, these rules will prevent customers from
taking advantage of market fluctuations by refusing to deliver a security to a broker or dealer when the price rises
after a sell order has been executed. 
In response to the comments made by the PSA, the Department is revising the buy-in time frame for customer sell orders
in new paragraphs 403.4(l) and paragraph 403.5(g), applicable to registered government securities brokers-dealers
and financial institution government securities broker-dealers, respectively, from ten business days to 30 calendar
days for all government securities, except mortgage-backed securities, and to 60 calendar days for all government
mortgage-backed securities.

14

 These time frames are consistent with the buy-in requirements for fails to receive addressed above. The Department
also modified the customer sell order rules to permit the use of alternatives other than purchasing securities (e.g.,
securities may be borrowed, substituted or bought back) in closing out orders. Again, this is consistent with the
buy-in rules for fails to receive. 




The buy-in rules for customer sell orders continue to provide an exemption for short sales, which are the primary cause
for non-deliveries. This should significantly reduce the number of fails subject to these requirements. Similar
to buy-ins of mortgage-backed securities that are in a fail to receive status, broker-dealers will be allowed to effect
buy-ins for customer sell orders of mortgage-backed securities at the next regularly scheduled settlement cycle.

15

 




Finally, the Department is also adopting without change redesignated paragraph 403.5(h), which will now grant the
appropriate regulatory agencies for financial institutions the authority to extend the 30- and 60-calendar day
time frame for buy-ins of customer sell orders if a financial institution broker-dealer requests an extension. No
comments were received on this provision.

C. Effective Dates 


The final rules become effective April 29, 1994. This will provide sufficient time for all government securities
brokers and dealers to become acquainted with the new requirements and to implement operating procedures. Additionally,
the lead time will enable the PSA to finalize and distribute buy-in procedures it is developing for the industry. 
In its comment letter, the PSA requested that the Treasury's buy-in rules be enacted contemporaneously with the Commission's
amendments to Rule 15c3-3(d)(2) and (m). Since Treasury's rules apply to all government securities brokers
and dealers, and given the Department's understanding that the buy-in rules to be proposed by the Commission will
conform to those adopted herein, the Department believes that there is no compelling reason to defer implementation
until the Commission acts. 


III. Special Analysis 


The Department has determined that this action does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action'' for the purposes
of Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, it was not subject to review under the Executive
Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget. 
In the preamble to the proposed rules, the Department certified that these amendments would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. In reviewing the final rules being adopted herein
and after considering the comments received on the proposed rules, the Department has concluded that there is no reason
to alter the previous certification that these rules will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. 
Since these final rules contain no new collections of information, the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act
(44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) are inapplicable.

Exemption of System of Records Under Privacy Act of 1974 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Secretary, HUD.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule exempts a new system of records entitled ``Tenant Eligibility Verification Files'' from compliance
with the applicable provisions of the Privacy Act. This additional exemption is necessary because on July 12, 1993,
the Department created a new system of records entitled ``HUD/PIH-1. Tenant Eligibility Verification Files''
to add to the Privacy Act system of records.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


Except for the Office of Inspector General, the Department's implementation of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) is
set forth in 24 CFR part 16. (The implementation of the Privacy Act for the Office of Inspector General appears in 24
CFR part 2003). The implementation of the Privacy Act includes the publication of a system of records which are exempt
from certain requirements of the Privacy Act, as determined by the Secretary under the specific exemption authority
of the Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k). The specific exemption provision of the Privacy Act authorizes exemption for systems
of records from many of the notice and access requirements of the Privacy Act, but does not affect the applicability
of the remaining Privacy Act requirements. The Department's specific exemptions appear at 24 CFR 16.15. 
The establishment of a new system of records on July 12, 1993 (58 FR 37600), entitled ``HUD/PIH-1. Tenant Eligibility
Verification Files,'' and this rule are necessary as a result of the recent transfer of computer matching/tenant
eligibility verification functions from the Office of Inspector General to the Assistant Secretary for Public and
Indian Housing. (The transfer affects only housing assistance programs administered by the Assistant Secretary
for Public and Indian Housing.) 
The tenant records and other records referenced in the new ``Tenant Eligibility Verification Files'' system of records
notice were previously included in the ``Investigative Files of the Office of the Inspector General'' (HUD/OIG-1,
see 57 FR 25070). The Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing will be adding records to the final new system
based on computer matching results and verification of those results with tenant case files and records supplied
by Federal agencies and private employers. 
This final rule also makes changes to  16.15 to clarify the scope of the exemptions applicable to the Assistant
Secretary for Public and Indian Housing's system of records entitled ``Tenant Eligibility Verification Files,''
and provides reasons for the exemptions from particular subsections of the Privacy Act that are more detailed than
those currently found at 24 CFR 16.15. 


II. Discussion of Public Comments From Proposed Rule


On July 12, 1993 (58 FR 37598), the Department published a proposed rule which would exempt the new system of records
entitled ``Tenant Eligibility Verification Files'' from compliance with applicable provisions of the Privacy
Act. The Department received one public comment from a public housing agency in response to this proposed rule. The
commenter stressed the need to protect a tenant's privacy, and urged strenuous penalties to prevent misuse of the
new system of records. The Department agrees that it is extremely important to prevent the misuse of confidential
material concerning a tenant. However, the Department does not believe any changes to the final rule are necessary
because both the Privacy Act and the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 provide sufficient safeguards
to protect against the unlawful disclosure of material concerning a tenant from this Privacy Act system of records.

III. Other Matters 


A. Environmental Impact 


In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures in this document are determined not to have the potential of having a
significant impact on the quality of the human environment, and, therefore, are categorically excluded from the
requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Accordingly, a Finding of No Significant Impact is
not required. 


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed and approved this
rule, and in so doing certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities because the rule only affects the way the Department implements the Privacy Act. 


C. Executive Order 12612, Federalism 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the order. Specifically,
the requirements of this rule are directed to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and do not impinge upon
the relationship between the Federal Government and State and local governments. 


D. Executive Order 12606, The Family 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under 
Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this final rule does not have potential for significant impact
on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. No
significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies
and programs relate to family concerns. 


E. Regulatory Agenda 


This final rule was listed as item no. 1444 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October
25, 1993 (58 FR 56402, 56410) in accordance with Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 


List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 16

Authority: 

5 U.S.C. 552(a); 42 U.S.C. 3535(d).

 

2. Section 16.15 is amended by adding new paragraphs (c) and (d) as follows: 


 16.15 


Specific exemptions. 


* * * * * 


(c) The system of records entitled ``HUD/PIH-1. Tenant Eligibility Verification Files'' consists in part
of investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes. Relevant records will be used by appropriate Federal,
state or local agencies charged with the responsibility for investigating or prosecuting violations of law. Therefore,
to the extent that information in the system falls within the coverage of subsection (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C.
552a(k)(2), the system is exempt from the requirements of the following subsections of the Privacy Act, for the reasons
stated below. 
(1) From subsection (c)(3) because release of an accounting of disclosures to an individual who may be the subject
of an investigation could reveal the nature and scope of the investigation and could result in the altering or destruction
of evidence, improper influencing of witnesses, and other evasive actions that could impede or compromise the investigation.

(2) From subsection (d)(1) because release of the records to an individual who may become or has become the subject
of an investigation could interfere with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings, constitute an unwarranted
invasion of the personal privacy of third parties, reveal the identity of confidential sources, or reveal sensitive
investigative techniques and procedures. 
(3) From subsection (d)(2) because amendment or correction of the records could interfere with pending or prospective
law enforcement proceedings, or could impose an impossible administrative and investigative burden by requiring
the office that maintains the records to continuously retrograde its verifications of tenant eligibility attempting
to resolve questions of accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness. 
(4) From subsection (e)(1) because it is often impossible 
to determine relevance or necessity of information in pre-investigative early stages. The value of such information
is a question of judgment and timing; what appears relevant and necessary when collected may ultimately be evaluated
and viewed as irrelevant and unnecessary to an investigation. In addition, the Assistant Secretary for Public and
Indian Housing, or investigators, may obtain information concerning the violation of laws other than those within
the scope of its jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, the Assistant Secretary for Public and
Indian Housing, or investigators, should retain this information because it may aid in establishing patterns of
unlawful activity and provide leads for other law enforcement agencies. Further, in obtaining the evidence, information
may be provided which relates to matters incidental to the main purpose of the inquiry or investigation but which may
be pertinent to the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. Such information cannot readily be identified.

(d) The system of records entitled ``HUD/PIH-1. Tenant Eligibility Verification Files'' consists in part
of material that may be used for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal
civilian employment or Federal contracts, the release of which would reveal the identity of a source who furnished
information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence.
Therefore, to the extent that information in this system falls within the coverage of subsection (k)(5) of the Privacy
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), the system is exempt from the requirements of the following subsection of the Privacy Act,
for the reasons stated below. 
(1) From subsection (d)(1) because release would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the
Government under an express promise of confidentiality. Revealing the identity of a confidential source could impede
future cooperation by sources, and could result in harassment or harm to such sources.

Implementation of Section 129 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Secretary, HUD.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule establishes procedures for public housing agencies and Indian housing authorities (HAs) to follow
to permit HAs to retain a portion of certain section 8 fraud recoveries from tenants and owners for use in section 8 programs.
Section 129 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 expands HA retention of section 8 fraud recoveries
to include recoveries obtained through administrative repayment agreements, as well as litigation (including
settlement of a lawsuit) or a court-ordered restitution. This rule applies to the section 8 rental certificate, rental
voucher, moderate rehabilitation programs, and private owner/HA new construction and substantial rehabilitation
projects subject to an Annual Contributions Contract.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background: 


Some tenants receiving section 8 assistance submit false statements which underreport income to obtain excessive
housing assistance. Similarly, some owners also commit fraud in order to receive section 8 rental assistance payments
to which they are not entitled. Examples of owner fraud include billing for vacant dwelling units, charging more rent
for assisted units than unassisted units in the same building, receiving sidepayments from assisted tenants, and
knowingly admitting ineligible tenants into section 8 substantial rehabilitation and new construction projects.
Through various methods, such as direct observation, informants, investigative action and computer matches, HAs
discover that tenants and owners have committed fraud in order to receive either benefits or payments for which they
were not entitled. 
In 1981, Congress enacted legislation aimed at stemming this fraud and abuse. Section 326(d)(1) of the Housing and
Community Development Amendments of 1981 (Pub. L. 97-35; hereafter referred to as ``1981 HCD Act'') allowed
HAs to retain ``out of judgments obtained by them in recovering amounts wrongfully paid as a result of fraud and abuse''
a portion of the fraud recoveries to encourage HAs to recover amounts overpaid as a result of such fraud and abuse. On
August 20, 1986 (51 FR 29633), the Department published a final rule implementing section 326(d)(1) of the 1981 HCD
Amendments. In the final rule, HUD construed the term ``judgments'' to allow HAs to retain amounts recovered by means
of litigation, including a settlement of litigation. 
However, most section 8 fraud recoveries result from administrative repayment agreements between the HA and the
families, or between the HA and the owner. As such, nearly all tenant and owner fraud recoveries have gone to HUD, and
HAs have had little monetary incentive to identify tenant and owner fraud and pursue repayment. 
Section 129 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, (Pub. L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992;
hereafter referred to as ``1992 HCD Act''), allows HAs to retain a portion of rental assistance fraud recoveries obtained
through litigation, court-ordered restitutions, and administrative repayment agreements pursuant to an administrative
grievance procedure except in cases where HUD is the principal party initiating or sustaining the recovery action.
By allowing HAs to retain a portion of the monies recovered under administrative repayment agreements, the Act provides
an additional incentive for HAs to aggressively pursue cases of suspected fraud. 
Under the Act and this regulation, an HA can retain the greater of: (1) 50 percent of the amount collected or (2) the actual,
reasonable, and necessary expenses related to the collection, including the cost of investigation, legal fees and
collection fees. The recoveries may be obtained through litigation (including settlement of a lawsuit), a court-ordered
restitution, or an administrative repayment agreement pursuant to an administrative grievance procedure. The
rule applies to the Section 8 Rental Certificate, Rental Voucher, Moderate Rehabilitation Programs and private
owner/HA new construction and substantial rehabilitation projects subject to an Annual Contributions Contract
(ACC) between HUD and an HA.

Finally, in August of 1986, the Department added a final rule implementing section 326(d)(1) of the 1981 HCD Amendments
as a new part 892. This final rule transfers the requirements of 892 to a new part 792, and removes part 892. The rule also
changes the reference from public housing agency (PHA) to housing agency (HA) to recognize definitional changes
resulting from the Indian Housing Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-358). 



II. Other Matters 



A. Environmental Impact 



In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this rule relate only to HUD administrative procedures
and, therefore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. 



B. Executive Order 12612, Federalism 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the Federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. Specifically, the rule increases the amount a housing agency may recover
in fraud and abuse cases. As such, the rule will not impinge on the relationship between the Federal and state and local
governments, and the rule is not subject to review under the order. 



C. Executive Order 12606, the Family 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and,
thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result
from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. 



D. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) has reviewed and approved this
rule, and in so doing certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities, because the number of recoveries by housing agencies is expected to be small and so the number of small
public housing agencies affected will be small. In any event, the effect on small entities is expected to be positive
rather than negative. 



E. Paperwork 



The changes made by this final rule to the regulatory text in 24 CFR part 892, which now appears as 24 CFR part 792, will
not add any additional information collection burden than that already approved by the Office of Management and Burden
under the Paperwork Reduction Act and assigned OMB approval number 2577-0053. 



F. Regulatory Agenda 



This rule was listed as item no. 1655 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October 25,
1993 (58 FR 56402, 56453) in accordance with Executive Order 12991 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 



G. Justification for Final Rulemaking 



In general, the Department publishes rules for public comment before their issuance for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 provides exceptions from that general rule where
the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied
when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest'' (24 CFR 10.1).
The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this rule for effect without first soliciting public comment,
in that prior public procedure is unnecessary because the changes being made to part 892, which now appears as part
792, merely implement statutory amendments that do not involve the exercise of any discretion by the Department.

Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended by redesignating
part 892 as part 792 and by revising the newly designated part 792 to read as follows: 


PART 792_HOUSING AGENCY SECTION 8 FRAUD RECOVERIES 


Subpart A_General Provisions 


Sec. 


792.101 Purpose. 
792.102 Applicability. 
792.103 Definitions. 


Subpart B_Recovery of Section 8 Funds 


792.201 Conduct of litigation. 
792.202 HA retention of proceeds. 
792.203 Application of amounts recovered. 
792.204 Recordkeeping and reporting.

42 U.S.C. 1437f note; 42 U.S.C. 3535(d). 


Subpart A_General Provisions 


 792.101 

Purpose. 


The purpose of this part is to encourage public housing agencies and Indian housing authorities (HAs) to investigate
and pursue instances of tenant and owner fraud and abuse in the operation of the section 8 housing assistance payments
programs. 


 792.102 

Applicability. 


(a) This part applies to an HA acting as a contract administrator under an annual contributions contract with HUD in
any section 8 housing assistance payments program. To be eligible to retain section 8 tenant or owner fraud recoveries,
the HA must be the principal party initiating or sustaining an action to recover amounts from families. 
(b) This part applies only to those instances when a tenant or owner committed fraud, and the fraud recoveries are obtained
through litigation brought by the HA (including settlement of the lawsuit), a court-ordered restitution pursuant
to a criminal proceeding, or an administrative repayment agreement with the family or owner as a result of an HA administrative
grievance procedure pursuant to, or incorporating the requirements of,  882.216 or 887.405. This part does
not apply to cases of owner fraud in HA-owned or controlled units, or where incorrect payments were made or benefits
received because of calculation errors instead of willful fraudulent activities.

<DOCNO> FR940228-0-00050 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940228-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(c) This part applies to all tenant and owner fraud recoveries resulting from litigation brought by the HA (including
settlement of the lawsuit), or a court-ordered restitution pursuant to a criminal proceeding obtained on or after
October 8, 1986, and to all tenant and owner fraud recoveries obtained through administrative repayment agreements
signed on or after October 28, 1992. 


 792.103 

Definitions. 




Fraud and abuse. 

Fraud and abuse means a single act or pattern of actions: 
(1) That constitutes false statement, omission, or concealment of a substantive fact, made with intent to deceive
or mislead; and 
(2) That results in payment of section 8 program funds in violation of section 8 program requirements. 


HA (Housing Agency). 

HA (Housing Agency) means any State, county, municipality, or other governmental entity or public body, including
any Indian Housing Authority, acting as a section 8 contract administrator under an annual contributions contract
with HUD. 


Judgment. 

Judgment means a provision for recovery of section 8 program funds obtained through fraud and abuse, by order of a court
in litigation or by a settlement of a claim in litigation, whether or not stated in a court order. 


Litigation. 

A lawsuit brought by a HA to recover section 8 program funds obtained as a result of fraud and abuse. 


Principal party in initiating or sustaining an action to recover. 

Principal party in initiating or sustaining an action to recover means the party that incurs more than half the costs
incurred in: 
(1) Recertifying tenants who fraudulently obtained section 8 rental assistance; 
(2) Recomputing the correct amounts owed by tenants; and 
(3) Taking needed actions to recoup the excess benefits received, such as initiating litigation. 
Costs incurred to detect potential excessive benefits in the routine day-to-day operations of the program are excluded
in determining the principal party in initiating or sustaining an action to recover. For example, the cost of income
verification during an annual recertification would not be counted in determining the principal party in initiating
or sustaining an action to recover. 


Repayment agreement. 

Repayment agreement means a formal document signed by a tenant or owner and provided to an HA in which a tenant or owner
acknowledges a debt, in a specific amount, and agrees to repay the amount due at specific time period(s). 


Subpart B_Recovery of Section 8 Funds 


 792.201 

Conduct of litigation. 


The HA must obtain HUD approval before initiating litigation in which the HA is requesting HUD assistance or participation.



 792.202 

HA retention of proceeds. 


(a) Where the HA is the principal party initiating or sustaining an action to recover amounts from tenants that are
due as a result of fraud and abuse, the HA may retain, the greater of: 
(1) Fifty percent of the amount it actually collects from a judgment, litigation (including settlement of lawsuit)
or an administrative repayment agreement pursuant to, or incorporating the requirements of,  882.216 or  887.405;
or 
(2) Reasonable and necessary costs that the HA incurs related to the collection from a judgment, litigation (including
settlement of lawsuit) or an administrative repayment agreement pursuant to, or incorporating the requirements
of,  882.216 or  887.405. Reasonable and necessary costs include the costs of the investigation, legal
fees and collection agency fees. 
(b) If HUD incurs costs on behalf of the HA in obtaining the judgment, these costs must be deducted from the amount to
be retained by the HA. 

 792.203 

Application of amounts recovered. 


(a) The HA may only use the amount of the recovery it is authorized to retain in support of the section 8 program in which
the fraud occurred. 
(b) The remaining balance of the recovery proceeds (i.e., the portion of recovery the HA is not authorized to retain)
must be applied as directed by HUD. 


 792.204 

Recordkeeping and reporting. 


To permit HUD to audit amounts retained under this part, an HA must maintain all records required by HUD, including:

(a) Amounts recovered on any judgment or repayment agreement; 
(b) The nature of the judgment or repayment agreement; and 
(c) The amount of the legal fees and expenses incurred in obtaining the judgment or repayment agreement and recovery.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS</USDEPT>








To Amend the Travel Authority for Beneficiaries Who Are in Receipt of Pension


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Veterans Affairs.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is amending the regulations that govern its program to provide for the transportation
of claimants and beneficiaries to VA health care facilities. The amendments will correct an inadvertent error made
when the Department last promulgated regulations pertaining to this program in 1991. This amendment will delete
an inaccurate reference to beneficiaries who are in receipt of pension as not subject to a travel deductable.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 21, 1991, the Department of Veterans Affairs amended its regulations governing the beneficiary travel
program to implement changes in law made by Public Law 100-322. Generally, that law authorized the Government
to pay for travel for certain categories of veterans but imposed a ``deductible'' on the amount of the benefit. Other
categories of veterans could receive travel benefits without having to pay the deductible. The 1991 amendments to
the implementing regulations correctly provided that a veteran in receipt of pension benefits was required to pay
a deductible. (See: 38 CFR 17.100(b)(3)). However, in another place, the same regulation inadvertently provided
that a veteran in receipt of VA pension benefits could receive transportation expenses without being subject to the
deductible. (See: 38 CFR 17.100(c)(3)). The latter provision is inconsistent with the law, and this amendment will
correct that error.


The Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs hereby certifies that this regulation will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5
U.S.C. 601-612.
This regulation concerned the provision of beneficiary travel to a specified category of eligible veterans. No paperwork,
administrative or other regulatory burdens are imposed upon small entities.



The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Numbers are 64.009, 64.010 and 64.011.

Pesticide Tolerances for Permethrin, Cypermethrin, Fenvalerate/Esfenvalerate, Tralomethrin, Bifenthrin,
Cyfluthrin, and Lambda-Cyhalothrin; Extension of Tolerances




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document extends tolerances for the residues of the seven synthetic pyrethroids_permethrin, cypermethrin,
fenvalerate/esfenvalerate, tralomethrin, bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, and lambda-cyhalothrin (collectively referred
to as the synthetic pyrethroids)_in or on certain raw agricultural commodities. This rule to extend the effective
date for tolerances for maximum permissible levels of residues of these synthetic pyrethroids in or on these commodities
was requested by FMC Corp. (FMC), Zeneca Ag Products, E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., Inc., Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet
Co., and Miles, Inc. (collectively called the industry's Pyrethroid Working Group (PWG)).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of October 20, 1993 (58 FR 54093), EPA issued a proposed rule to amend 40 CFR part 180 by extending to November 15, 1994,
tolerances for the residues of the seven synthetic pyrethroids in or on certain commodities. The Pyrethroid Working
Group had requested the extension.


There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted in conjunction with the extension request and in previous extensions for the synthetic pyrethroids
have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes
that the tolerance extensions will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerance extensions are established
as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Executive Order 12866.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Summary of Report and Order



1. In this Report and Order the Commission allocates 33 MHz of spectrum, the 1610-1626.5 and 2483.5-2500
MHz bands, for the mobile-satellite service (MSS). A total of 16.5 MHz, 1610-1626.5 MHz, is provided for primary
space-to-Earth (uplink) operations and 16.5 MHz, 2483.5-2500 MHz, is provided for primary Earth-to-space
(downlink) operations. Also, 12.7 MHz, 1613.8-1626.5 MHz, is allocated for secondary MSS space-to-Earth
(downlink) operations. In addition, the Commission elevates the radio astronomy service allocation in the 1610.6-1613.8
MHz band from secondary to co-primary status.

2. The 1610-1626.5 and 2483.5-2500 MHz bands currently are allocated to a number of other services. The
radiodetermination satellite service (RDSS), is allocated in these bands on a primary basis but only interim RDSS
systems have been authorized. 

See

 Newcomb Communications, Inc., 8 FCC Rcd 3631 (1993); and letter to Counsel, Mobile Data Communications, Inc. from
Chief, Domestic Facilities Division (August 19, 1993). Currently, the 1610-1626.5 MHz band is allocated to
the aeronautical radionavigation service on a co-primary basis, and the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz segment of this
band also is allocated to the radio astronomy service (RAS) on a secondary basis. Frequencies adjacent to the 1610-1626.5
MHz band are allocated to aeronautical radionavigation satellite and maritime mobile satellite services.

3. The 2483.5-2500 MHz band is authorized for co-primary use by the broadcast auxiliary service, the terrestrial
fixed service, and the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) service. Additionally, the frequencies adjacent
to this band are allocated on a primary basis to the instructional television fixed service (ITFS), the multi-channel
multi-point distribution service (MMDS), fixed services, mobile services and for industrial, scientific, and
medical (ISM) equipment, and to the radiolocation service on a secondary basis.

4. On August 5, 1992, we proposed to allocate these bands to the mobile-satellite service systems, shared on a co-primary
basis with the RDSS. See 57 FR 43434 (September 21, 1992).

5. Based on the record in this proceeding, we find that there is substantial interest in using both LEO and GEO technologies
to provide new voice and data MSS services in the subject bands. As we indicated in the Notice, MSS LEO systems will offer
significant new benefits to both domestic and international communications users. MSS LEO systems potentially
can provide a universally available world-wide cellular-like radiotelephone service offering voice, data, and
facsimile service. In addition, radiolocation and radionavigation applications also can be provided.

6. Some of the new applications envisioned include: (1) personal locator services that could be used to locate accident
victims or persons stranded because of weather or injury; (2) fleet management and tracking services that would permit
more efficient shipping and transportation of goods, including the tracking of hazardous wastes and material; (3)
public safety services that would allow state and local governments to use MSS to extend health and emergency services
to rural and remote areas currently unserved by traditional communications facilities; and (4) International Services
that would permit global MSS and make modern telephone communications available to remote and underserved areas
throughout the world.

7. Further, the Commission determined that although the specific method for sharing among systems remains to be determined,
based on the record, bi-directional operations in the 1613.8-1626.5 MHz band is feasible, and accordingly
the Commission is providing for a secondary allocation for space-to-Earth operations in this band.

8. The Commission also concluded that MSS operations in the 1610-1626.5 and 2483.5-2500 MHz bands should
be subject to the e.i.r.p. and power flux density levels set forth in the international Radio Regulations. In addition,
such MSS operations will be subject to the coordination and notification procedures set forth in Resolution 46.

9. We continue to believe that, at least initially, the existing FSS bands are sufficient to accommodate MSS feeder
links. We note that there may be difficulties in using FSS bands that generally are congested with significant numbers
of geostationary fixed-satellite systems (GEO FSS). Consequently, because of the significant coordination difficulties
arising from the global nature of LEO operations, MSS LEO feeder links would need to operate in FSS frequency bands
that are not heavily used by GEO FSS systems. We are also including the inter-satellite service bands at 24.45-24.65
and 24.65-24.75 GHz and the already allocated inter-satellite service band at 22.55-23 GHz in the United
States Table of Frequency Allocations for non-government use.

10. In view of the important health issues involved, the fact that no general manufacture of consumer equipment for
MSS in these bands has yet begun, and our intent to provide for the expeditious initiation of the services for which
this spectrum is being allocated, we believe the ANSI/IEEE guidelines (IEEE C95.1-1991) should be used when
evaluating the potential for harm to public health from exposure to RF emissions of MSS user devices. If we modify the
ANSI/IEEE guidelines in ET Docket No. 92-62, those guidelines will be applied to MSS equipment. We will require
that all hand-held devices comply with the ANSI/IEEE specifications for ``uncontrolled'' environments because
the new MSS service as envisioned would include consumer use that would be within the ``uncontrolled'' definition.

11. Further, in the Notice and Tentative Decision, 57 FR 43434, September 21, 1992 

supra, 

we dismissed a petition for rule making filed by CELSAT to use the RDSS frequency band for a hybrid satellite and terrestrial
ground personal communications service (PCS). CELSAT had an alternative request for spectrum in the 2120-2129
and 2410-2428 MHz bands, including a pioneer's preference request which remains pending. On October 5, 1992,
CELSAT filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the Commission's Notice and Tentative Decision in which it argues
that the Commission incorrectly dismissed its proposed spectrum allocation because the terrestrial element of
its proposal was incompatible with WARC-92. TRW filed a petition to dismiss the CELSAT Petition for Reconsideration.
The Commission grants TRW's petition but accepts CELSAT's petition as late filed comments. The Commission continues
to believe that for the purpose of international coordination it is important that our domestic allocation be compatible
with the WARC-92 spectrum allocation. Thus we continue to hold that terrestrial operations in these bands is
inappropriate. For this reason, we accept CELSAT's Petition for Reconsideration as a comment in this proceeding.

12. In the Notice and Tentative Decision we noted that the proposal was analyzed with respect to the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 and found to contain no new or modified form, information collection and/or record keeping, labeling,
disclosure, or record retention requirements, and will not increase or decrease burden hours imposed on the public.
No comments were received regarding the Paperwork Reduction Act.

13. Further, in the Notice and Tentative Decision we invited comments on the impact of the proposed allocation in accordance
with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980. No comments were received in response to our analysis of this allocation
as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 96, Accounting for Income Taxes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission has adopted a Report and Order to incorporate the liability method of accounting for income taxes into
the Uniform System of Accounts for Telecommunications Companies. This action brings the method of accounting for
income taxes in line with the generally accepted method of accounting for income taxes prescribed for the American
business community.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a synopsis of the Commission's Report and Order in CC Docket No. 89-360, adopted January 31, 1994 and released
February 8, 1994. The complete text of this Report and Order is available for inspection and copying during normal
business hours in the FCC Dockets Branch (room 230), 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC, and may also be purchased from
the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Inc., at (202) 857-3800, 2100 M Street
NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037.



Synopsis of Report and Order



1. This Report and Order amends part 32 to incorporate the new accounting procedures for income taxes prescribed in
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (SFAS-109) and it also establishes new accounts to properly
implement those procedures.

2. This Report and Order adds three new accounts to the Uniform System of Accounts to incorporate the requirements
of SFAS-109 into part 32. The new accounts are Account 1437, Deferred Tax Regulatory Asset; Account 4341, Net
Deferred Tax Liability Adjustments; and Account 4361, Deferred Tax Regulatory Liability. These new accounts will
reflect the adjustments to existing carrier deferred tax balances that are necessary as a result of adopting SFAS-109.

3. The type of SFAS-109 adjustments that will be shown in the above accounts relate to changes in tax rates, recording
tax liabilities for items that were previously accounted for under the flow through method, and recording taxes on
items that were formerly considered permanent differences by the accounting profession.

4. The Report and Order will be effective six months after it is published in the 

Federal Register

. However, the Report and Order permits carriers to adopt SFAS-109 for federal accounting purposes on January
1, 1993 if the carriers so desire.

5. Finally, the new accounts that are established in the Report and Order will be excluded from interstate rate base
and revenue requirement determinations. This insures that the adoption of SFAS-109 for federal accounting
purposes will not increase or decrease the interstate revenue requirement.



Rule Changes



6. Accordingly, 

it is ordered that,

 Pursuant to sections 1, 4(i), 201-205, 218, 220, and 403 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.
151, 154(i)201-205, 218, 220, 403, part 32 is amended as set forth below.

7. 

It is further ordered that,

 Pursuant to section 220(g) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.  220(g) and  1.427(c)
of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 1.427(c), the amendments to part 32 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 32.1 

et seq.,

 as set forth below, shall be effective August 29, 1994.

8. 

It is further ordered that,

 Pursuant to section 4(i) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i),  32.16 of the Commission's
rules 47 CFR 32.16 is waived to the extent that it requires the filing of a revenue requirement study in regard to SFAS-109.

9. 

It is further ordered that,

 Carriers may implement SFAS-109 for federal regulatory purposes prior to the effective date of the new rules.

10. 

It is further ordered that,

 The Secretary shall provide a copy of this Report and Order to each state utility commission.

2. Section 32.22 (a), (c), (d), and (f) is revised to read as follows:


 32.22

Comprehensive interperiod tax allocation.


(a) Companies shall apply interperiod tax allocation (tax normalization) to all book/tax temporary differences
which would be considered material for published financial report purposes. Furthermore, companies shall also
apply interperiod tax allocation if any item or group of similar items when aggregated would yield debit or credit
entries which exceed or would exceed 5 percent of the gross deferred income tax expense debits or credits during any
calendar year over the life of the temporary difference. The tax effects of book/tax temporary differences shall
be normalized and the deferrals shall be included in the following accounts:



4100, Net Current Deferred Operating Income Taxes;
4110, Net Current Deferred Nonoperating Income Taxes;
4340, Net Noncurrent Deferred Operating Income Taxes;
4350, Net Noncurrent Deferred Nonoperating Income Taxes.



In lieu of the accounting prescribed herein, any company shall treat the increase or reduction in current income taxes
payable resulting from the use of flow through accounting in prior years as an increase or reduction in current tax
expense.


* * * * *


(c) Subsidiary records shall be used to reduce the deferred tax assets contained in the accounts specified in paragraph
(a) of this section when it is likely that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The amount
recorded in the subsidiary record should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is likely
to be realized.
(d) The records supporting the activity in the deferred income tax accounts shall be maintained in sufficient detail
to identify the nature of the specific temporary differences giving rise to both the debits and credits to the individual
accounts.


* * * * *


(f) The tax differentials to be normalized as specified in this section shall also encompass the additional effect
of state and local income tax changes on Federal income taxes produced by the provision for deferred state and local
income taxes for book/tax temporary differences related to such income taxes.

Deferred tax regulatory asset.




(a) This account shall include amounts of probable future revenue for the recovery of future increases in taxes payable.
As reversals occur, amounts recorded in this account shall be reduced with a credit entry and a debit entry to Account
4341, Net Deferred Tax Liability Adjustments.


(b) This account shall also be adjusted for the impact of prospective tax rate changes on the deferred tax liability
for those temporary differences underlying its existing balance. If the cumulative effect of such adjustments reduce
the account to a net credit balance, such balance shall be reclassified to Account 4361.

ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

By this Third Report and Order, the Commission makes final decisions on 50 pioneer's preference requests related
to broadband 2 GHz Personal Communications Services (PCS). The Commission awards pioneer's preferences to three
applicants and denies the remaining 47 requests. This action guarantees a license to each pioneer in 30 megahertz
of spectrum in a Major Trading Area (MTA) if the applicant is otherwise eligible to hold such a license and subject to
any changes upon reconsideration in GEN Docket No. 90-314 that affect service areas or spectrum blocks. The
action is intended to appropriately reward the three parties that pioneered new PCS services and technologies.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a summary of the Commission's Third Report and Order adopted December 23, 1993, and released February 3, 1994.
This action will not change the public reporting burden. The full text of this Commission decision is available for
inspection and copying during regular business hours in the FCC Reference Center (room 239), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20554. The complete text of the decision also may be purchased from the Commission's duplication contractor, International
Transcription Service, (202) 857-3800, 2100 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20037.



Summary of Third Report and Order



1. In the Tentative Decision and Memorandum Opinion and Order (Tentative Decision) (57 FR 57458, December 4, 1992)
in this proceeding, the Commission proposed to award pioneer's preferences to American Personal Communications
(APC), Cox Enterprises, Inc. (Cox), and Omnipoint Communications, Inc. (Omnipoint) and to deny 53 other requests.
Subsequently, in the First Report and Order (58 FR 42681, August 11, 1993) in GEN Docket No. 90-314 and ET Docket
No. 92-100, six of these 53 requests were found to address 900 MHz narrowband services and therefore final action
on these six was taken in that proceeding. The Commission adopted final rules for broadband 2 GHz PCS in the Second Report
and Order (58 FR 59174, November 8, 1993) in this proceeding. Seven blocks of spectrum were allocated for licensed
2 GHz PCS encompassing 120 megahertz at 1850-1890, 1930-1970, 2130-2150, and 2180-2200 MHz.
Regional and local PCS service areas based upon MTAs and Basic Trading Areas (BTAs) also were adopted.

2. The Commission's pioneer's preference rules provide preferential treatment in its licensing process to parties
that demonstrate their responsibility for developing new communications services and technologies. To be granted
a pioneer's preference, an applicant must demonstrate that it has developed the new service or technology; 

e.g.

, that it has developed the capabilities or possibilities of the technology or service or has brought them to a more
advanced or effective state. The applicant also must demonstrate the technical feasibility of the new service or
technology, either by submitting a technical feasibility showing or at least preliminary results of an experiment.
Finally, a preference will be granted only if the rules adopted are a reasonable outgrowth of the proposal and lend
themselves to grant of a preference. An applicant meeting this standard will be placed on a pioneer's preference track,
will not be subject to competing applications, and if otherwise qualified will receive a license. Other applicants
will compete for additional licenses on a separate track. The pioneer's preference rules are intended to foster development
of new services and improve existing services by reducing the delays and risks innovators otherwise would face with
the Commission's licensing process.

3. In the Tentative Decision, the Commission proposed to grant APC, Cox, and Omnipoint a pioneer's preference and
to deny 53 requests that is tentatively concluded did not merit preferences. After opportunity for additional comment
and replies focused on the Tentative Decision, the Commission found that APC, Cox, and Omnipoint meet the pioneer's
preference standard and therefore merit award of preferences; and that the remaining applicants do not meet this
standard and therefore do not merit award of preferences.

4. APC was granted a pioneer's preference for its development and demonstration of technologies that facilitate
spectrum sharing by PCS facilities and microwave systems at 2 GHz. APC's analysis and testing demonstrated that there
exists unused spectrum in the 1850-1990 MHz band sufficient to allow immediate initiation of PCS services without
first having to relocate existing microwave operations. Its study changed the focus of attention from relocating
fixed microwave operations before initiating PCS to initially implementing PCS while sharing the spectrum with
the existing microwave operations. This study, and the transition plan presented in comments submitted by APC, have
elements in common with the transition plan adopted in ET Docket No. 92-9 to facilitate making 2 GHz spectrum
available for emerging technologies, including PCS. Further, APC developed Frequency Agile Sharing Technology
(FAST) and demonstrated that it provides a practical means to transition from fixed services to shared fixed and mobile
services in this spectrum.

5. As explained by APC, FAST is a frequency planning and management tool used to predict (and avoid) interference both
between private operational fixed service (POFS) and PCS systems, and within a PCS system. The FAST system utilizes
theoretical interference analyses verified by signal strength measurements to determine frequency assignments
to PCS base stations. This function is accomplished by a Channel Utilization Controller (CUC), which monitors and
determines the channels each PCS base station may use. The CUC monitors coverage and interference; analyzes and integrates
measured data; integrates supporting data bases; and supports data communications links to each PCS base station.
For each PCS base station the CUC calculates theoretical interference values and areas for every POFS station in its
data base. Both PCS-to-POFS and POFS-to-PCS interference is calculated. The CUC then compiles a list of available
channels for each base station. The theoretical interference analysis is recalculated when PCS and/or POFS systems
are changed.

6. APC states that FAST technology can be used with any relatively narrow band PCS system channel architecture employing
a channel bandwidth of 5 megahertz or less. In particular, APC states that the FAST system can be used in conjunction
with code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access, time division duplexed, and frequency
division duplexed systems that use various transmit-receive frequency separations. APC asserts that testing of
its FAST/CDMA system verified the ability of its technology to complete PCS calls without causing interference to
existing microwave operations.

7. Cox was granted a preference for having developed and demonstrated PCS/cable plant interface technology and equipment
that interfaces existing cable plant with new PCS wireless applications, resulting in spectrum-efficient applications
for PCS. Cox first proposed using cable systems to provide backbone functions for PCS (instead of using the existing
telephone or fixed microwave networks), applied to the Commission for a PCS experimental license, and successfully
developed and tested equipment. Through experiments, Cox demonstrated cost-effective integration of PCS and cable
networks that makes more efficient use of existing cable plant without impairing existing cable services. Cox designed,
developed, and tested multi-backhaul configurations and multi-PCS radio systems with hand-off capability, centralized
modulation, and distributed antenna configurations. These capabilities were realized through its design and development
work, the key to which is its ``cable microcell integrator'' that Cox developed to connect PCS handsets to its embedded
cable plant.

8. Using the existing cable plant in PCS network design permits economical and rapid deployment of PCS systems and
substitution of existing infrastructure for increasingly scarce spectrum. The efforts of Cox advanced PCS system
design by demonstrating the feasibility of integrating cable networks with full-featured PCS systems. Its developments
potentially permit offering efficient PCS service in a timely, cost efficient manner with no impairment to existing
cable services.

9. Omnipoint was granted a preference for its development of 2 GHz equipment that uses advanced techniques that will
facilitate continued development and implementation of PCS services and technologies. Omnipoint was the first
to produce practical, working 2 GHz equipment for PCS. It engaged in radio frequency engineering and related spread
spectrum product design, development, miniaturization, and manufacture of 2 GHz equipment.
10. Omnipoint designed and manufactured equipment that uses direct sequence spread spectrum access techniques
in a 5 or 10 megahertz channel. The original work of Omnipoint contributed significantly to the development and testing
of PCS services and design concepts that will facilitate initial implementation of PCS in the 2 GHz band on a sharing
basis with fixed microwave licensees. Omnipoint has demonstrated that its 2 GHz PCS equipment uses innovative technology,
combining spread spectrum and time division techniques. Further, Omnipoint has demonstrated the capability of
providing PCS service using its equipment. Finally, the use of Omnipoint's handsets by other parties to develop PCS
experimental systems has fostered the development of PCS.
11. By receiving a pioneer's preference, APC, Cox, and Omnipoint, if otherwise qualified, will not be subject to competing
license applications in Channel Block A, a 30 megahertz MTA in the 1850-1865 and 1930-1945 MHz bands. APC,
Cox, and Omnipoint argued that a 30 megahertz MTA grant was necessary to permit implementation of the systems they
proposed.
12. Cablevision Systems Corporation (Cablevision), Southwestern Bell Corporation (SBC), and Fidelity Investments
and Cylink Corporation (Fidelity/Cylink) disagreed that a 30 megahertz MTA license should be awarded pioneers.
Cablevision contended that a 20 megahertz BTA block would permit the grantees to use the band in which they have conducted
experiments, while not conveying a windfall 30 megahertz MTA block that could have a preclusive effect on other licensees.
SBC concurred, stating that a 20 megahertz BTA block would be enough spectrum to provide adequate PCS service. Fidelity/Cylink
argued that a 10 megahertz BTA block at 2130-2200 MHz would be adequate because such a block would enable the provision
of full-featured PCS, as well as many specialized PCS services.
13. The Commission found the arguments of APC, Cox, and Omnipoint persuasive. Each applicant conducted experiments
in the 1850-1990 MHz band, not in the 2130-2200 MHz band. An award in the lower band is appropriate to ensure
that the grantees can implement the services they have proposed. While the Commission continues to believe that the
upper band has the potential to provide a variety of important PCS services, APC, Cox, and Omnipoint have designed
their systems and conducted their experiments in the 1850-1990 MHz band. Further, the Commission is not convinced
that a 20 megahertz BTA grant would be adequate, given the nature of the systems proposed. Accordingly, the Commission
awarded each pioneer a 30 megahertz MTA block in the service area each requested.
14. The Commission instructed the licensing bureau to condition licenses issued as a result of these pioneer's preference
grants upon construction of PCS systems that substantially use the design and technologies upon which the preference
awards are based and upon each licensee holding its license for a minimum of three years or until the construction requirements
applicable to the five-year build-out period specified in Section 99.206 of the Commission's Rules have been satisfied,
whichever, is earlier. APC's service area is the MTA that includes Washington, DC and Baltimore, Maryland; Cox's
service area is the MTA that includes San Diego, California; and Omnipoint's service area is the MTA that includes
northern New Jersey. The Commission noted that both PCS channel blocks and service areas are the subject of petitions
for reconsideration and clarification. Should either PCS channel blocks or service areas be amended on reconsideration,
the pioneer's preferences will be modified accordingly.

15. Finally, the Commission stated that the 47 pioneer's preference requests that were found not to have met the pioneer's
preference standard were denied for a variety of reasons. Some of these requests were incompatible with the rules
adopted in the Second Report and Order in this proceeding, some did not demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
technologies, some did not demonstrate innovation, and some did not demonstrate the capabilities or possibilities
of specific identifiable PCS technologies or services or show how these technologies or services had been brought
to a more advanced or effective state.

16. Accordingly, 

it is ordered

 that the requests for pioneer's preference filed by American Personal Communications; Cox Enterprises, Inc.; and
Omnipoint Communications, Inc. are granted. 

It is further ordered

 That the relevant licensing bureau shall impose the following conditions on the licenses received by American Personal
Communications; Cox Enterprises, Inc.; and Omnipoint Communications, Inc. pursuant to their pioneer's preference
awards: (1) Each licensee must build a system that substantially uses the design and technologies upon which its preference
award is based; and (2) Each licensee must hold its license for a minimum of three years or until the construction requirements
applicable to the five-year build-out period specified in Section 99.206 of the Commission's Rules have been satisfied,
whichever is earlier. 

It is further ordered

 That the requests for pioneer's preference filed by Adelphia Communications Corp.; Advanced MobileComm Technologies,
Inc. and Digital Spread Spectrum Technologies, Inc.; American Portable Telecommunications, Inc.; American Telephone
and Telegraph; American TeleZone; Ameritech; Associated PCN Corporation; Atlantic Cellular Company, L.P.; Bell

AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; technical amendment. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS implements a regulatory amendment that prohibits the retention of groundfish caught with unauthorized gear
in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off Alaska. In addition, this action implements a technical amendment that organizes
all fishing gear definitions as paragraphs under the single definition of ``authorized fishing gear''. This action
is necessary to prevent fishing with unauthorized gear and associated preemption of fishing grounds and gear conflicts,
and undermining prohibited species bycatch measures in the groundfish fishery. It is intended to support the goals
and objectives contained in the Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and the
Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Fishing for groundfish by U.S. vessels in the EEZ of the GOA and the BSAI is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according
to the FMP for Groundfish of the GOA and the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI. The FMPs were prepared by the North
Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C.
1801 

et seq

.) (Magnuson Act), and are implemented by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR parts 672
and 675. General regulations that also pertain to U.S. fisheries are codified at 50 CFR part 620. 
This regulatory action amends 50 CFR 672.7 and 675.7 to prohibit the retention of groundfish caught with other than
authorized fishing gear types. Authorized fishing gear are all fishing gear types currently defined at   672.2
and 675.2. 
A proposed rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 12, 1993 (58 FR 59980). A complete description of, and justification for, changes to regulations that
prohibit the retention of groundfish caught with other than authorized fishing gear types were discussed in the proposed
rule. 
Public comment on the proposed rule was invited through December 13, 1993. One letter opposing and one letter supporting
the proposed action were received within the comment period and are summarized and responded to below in the ``Response
to Comment'' section. 
Upon reviewing the reasons for and the comments on this action, NMFS has determined that this rule is necessary for
fishery conservation and management and has approved it.

Response to Comments 





Comment 1:

 Prohibiting fishing gear types not defined in the regulations will stifle gear innovations and development by the
industry. 



Response:

 This rule will not stifle gear innovations or the development of new fishing gear by the industry. Gear innovations
and development can be accomplished within existing regulations governing experimental fishing at   672.6
and 675.6. 

Under an experimental fishing permit, otherwise unauthorized gear could be assessed relative to fishing efficiency,
bycatch mortality rates, and the effects on the biological and physical environment. Fishing gear types assessed
under this process could be subsequently authorized under future regulatory amendments. 



Comment 2:

 Prohibiting gear types not defined in the regulations is supported because new gear types should be thoroughly tested.
However, the proposed rule did not assess and does not prevent the use of imported gear, in particular the use of pair
trawls, as an authorized gear type. 



Response:

 The purpose of this action is to limit the fishing gear types employed in the groundfish fisheries off Alaska to those
traditionally used, including pair trawls. Any vessels participating in a fishery with pair trawls are subject to
observer requirements by   672.27 and 675.25. The use of imported gear would be inconsistent with regulations
unless it conforms to the authorized fishing gear definition. NMFS will continue to obtain information from observers
about performance of each authorized fishing gear type used in the groundfish fisheries. 



Technical Amendment 



The rule by technical amendment moves existing definitions of fishing gear types from alphabetic locations at 
  672.2 and 675.2 and reorganizes them under a new definition, 

Authorized fishing gear.

 Although the final rule does not change existing definitions from the proposed rule, it redesignates the fishing
gear definitions by removing them from their alphabetical order and placing them as paragraphs under this new definition.
Three definitions, 

Trawl, Non-trawl

, and 

Longline

 are modified to provide consistency in the fishing gear definitions in the GOA and BSAI regulations. 



Classification 



This rule is not subject to review under E.O. 12866.

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is today promulgating a rule to amend the financial responsibility requirements
for underground storage tanks (USTs) containing petroleum that appear in subpart H of 40 CFR part 280. Specifically,
this rule modifies the financial responsibility compliance date under 40 CFR 280.91(e) for one category of UST owners.
Under this modification, Federally-recognized Indian tribes that own USTs on Indian lands are required to comply
with Federal Financial Responsibility requirements of 40 CFR part 280 subpart H_Financial Responsibility_by December
31, 1998 if those USTs are in compliance with applicable technical requirements for USTs in 40 CFR part 280. Today's
rule extends the deadline for certain USTs owned by Indian tribes from the previous date of February 18, 1994. This
change will allow EPA, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian tribes additional time to explore options for solving
the root problem of lack of funding for past contamination on Indian lands and further assist tribes with future technical
requirements, such as tank upgrading. EPA is not changing the financial responsibility deadline for rural petroleum
marketers or local governments. A discussion of the Agency rationale behind this decision can be found in section
III. C. under ``

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

''.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA is today finalizing a rule that would allow certain Federally-recognized Indian tribes that own USTs containing
petroleum on Indian lands additional time to comply with the financial responsibility requirements. Specifically,
this rule modifies the compliance date under 40 CFR 280.91(e). Under this modification, Indian tribes that own USTs
containing petroleum on Indian lands must comply with the financial responsibility requirements by December 31,
1998. To qualify for the 1998 financial responsibility deadline, tribally-owned USTs must be in compliance with
the technical requirements for USTs described in 40 CFR part 280. Technical compliance for USTs includes, for example,
leak detection and reporting. The technical requirements criterion has been included to protect human health and
the environment on Indian lands. EPA is not changing the financial responsibility deadline for rural petroleum marketers
or local governments. A discussion of Agency rationale behind this decision can be found in section III C.

I. Authority 


These regulations are issued under the authority of sections 2002, 9001, 9002, 9003, 9004, 9005, 9006, 9007, and 9009
of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 6912, 6991, 6991a, 6991b, 6991c, 6991d, 6991e, 6991f, and 6991h).



II. Effective Date 


This rule will be effective on February 28, 1994, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d). This rule may be made effective immediately
because it extends an existing compliance date and there is good cause to make that extension immediately effective
within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. 553(d)(1) and (3). 


III. Background 


On October 26, 1988, EPA promulgated financial responsibility requirements applicable to owners and operators
of underground storage tanks (USTs) containing petroleum (53 FR 43322). To meet the requirements, owners and operators
must demonstrate that they can pay for the costs of cleanups and third-party damages resulting from any leaks that
may occur. In the final rule, EPA established a phased compliance schedule for owners and operators of petroleum USTs.
The principal reason for adopting the phased compliance approach was to provide the time necessary for providers
of financial assurance mechanisms (including private insurance companies and states intending to establish state
assurance funds) to develop new policies and programs or conform their policies and programs with EPA requirements.
See 53 FR 43324. 
When devising the phased compliance approach, the Agency wanted to achieve the best balance between the need to demonstrate
financial responsibility for UST releases and the time necessary for owners and operators to obtain assurance mechanisms.
The Agency attempted to establish compliance dates that were as early as possible, considering the type of assurance
different types of facilities were likely to obtain. Petroleum marketers owning or operating 1,000 or more USTs and
non-marketers with more than $20 million in tangible net worth were required to comply by January 24, 1989, based primarily
on their ability to qualify for self-insurance. Petroleum marketers with 100 to 999 USTs were required to comply by
October 26, 1989. These marketers were estimated to be relatively more likely to be able to obtain insurance; some
of them were also expected to qualify as self-insurers. Petroleum marketers owning 13 to 99 USTs at more than one facility
were originally required to comply by April 26, 1990. However, on May 2, 1990, the Agency published a rule (55 FR 18566)
extending this compliance date to April 26, 1991. These marketers were thought to be less likely to be able to obtain
insurance than members of the October 26, 1989, compliance group. 
Petroleum marketers owning fewer than 13 USTs at more than one facility or owning only one facility with fewer than
100 USTs, as well as non-marketers with less than $20 million in net worth and local governments (including Indian
tribes) were originally required to comply by October 26, 1990. This group was expected to rely primarily on state
assurance funds for compliance. (State assurance funds provide money for cleanups to owners and operators in their
states. Owners and operators in states with assurance funds are deemed to be in compliance with financial responsibility
for the amount covered by the fund once the state submits the fund to EPA for approval unless and until EPA disapproves
the fund.) On October 31, 1990, EPA extended the compliance deadline for one year for small marketers (with fewer than
13 USTs or fewer than 100 USTs at a single facility) and small non-marketers (with less than $20 million in net worth),
otherwise known as Category IV. This extension was based on the need for additional time for state assurance funds
to be developed. In addition, EPA extended the compliance deadline for local governments and Indian tribes until
one year after publication of a final rule with additional self-insurance mechanisms for local governments to use
to demonstrate compliance. This rule was published on February 18, 1993 (58 FR 9026).

On December 23, 1991, EPA once again extended the compliance deadline for the Category IV group (small marketers with
fewer than 13 tanks at more than one facility or fewer than 100 tanks at a single facility as well as non-marketers with
net worth less than $20 million) to December 31, 1993 (56 FR 66369). EPA based the extension on its understanding that
more members of this compliance group than the Agency had originally projected must rely on state assurance funds,
rather than on insurance, to demonstrate compliance with the financial responsibility requirements. EPA believed
that, in order for owners and operators to rely on state assurance funds as compliance mechanisms, states must have
more time to submit their state assurance funds to EPA for approval. Currently, 31 state assurance funds have been
approved by EPA and an additional eight state assurance funds have been submitted to EPA for approval. (It is important
to note that upon submission of a state assurance fund to the EPA Regional Administrator, the fund is considered to
be approved unless and until EPA disapproves it.) Additionally, the extension provided states with more time to develop
and implement financial assistance programs (e.g., direct loan programs, loan guarantee programs, grant programs)
which help owners and operators (especially small businesses) pay for technical requirements such as tank upgrading.
These technical improvements, in turn, help USTs meet insurers' underwriting criteria. 
The Agency, however, continued to be concerned about the effects of its regulations on the regulated community. By
analyzing the costs of the requirements, EPA found that the affordability of financial responsibility compliance
is often tied to early compliance with technical requirements such as tank upgrading, since, for example, private
insurance companies may refuse to provide coverage unless they are certain that a site does not pose a high risk of leaking.
EPA believed that the costs associated with the technical requirements are an important factor underlying the inability
of some small owners and operators to meet the financial responsibility requirements. These costs coupled with the
lack of a state assurance fund, grant, or loan program could force some gas stations to close their tanks when the 1993
financial responsibility compliance date fell. EPA believed that tank closure could be particularly problematic
when those tanks provide essential services to rural communities. 

As a result of this concern about the availability of fuel in rural areas, EPA proposed a December 31, 1998 compliance
date for certain petroleum marketers, local governments, and Indian tribes, that meet Federally-determined criteria
(58 FR 43770). The objective of the August 17, 1993 proposed rule was to obtain data on whether an additional extension
of the financial responsibility requirements was needed, and for whom. The Agency intended to limit any additional
extension to, at most, a small sub-group of marketers currently in Category IV, as well as certain local governments
and Indian tribes; EPA did not want to change compliance dates for all Category IV marketers or local governments on
the belief that most of these tank owners were already in compliance with the financial responsibility requirements
due to the existence of state assurance funds and reliance on self-insurance mechanisms. The August 17, 1993 proposed
rule included eligibility criteria limiting the proposed 1998 compliance group to rural petroleum marketers that
met a hardship criterion of annual profit on gasoline sales of $15,000 or less, rural local governments that use tanks
for essential services such as police and fire departments, and Indian tribes. (The definition of rural was obtained
from the Farmers Home Administration within the U.S. Department of Agriculture.) In addition, all owners in the new
1998 compliance group would have to ensure that their tanks were in compliance with applicable technical requirements,
such as leak detection. The techn
