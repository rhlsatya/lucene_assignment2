Fees for Official Pesticide Residue Testing



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Grain Inspection Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) is proposing to establish a new testing service under the United States
Grain Standards Act (USGSA) for pesticide residues in wheat. The new service will be provided, upon request, using
gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The cost of the testing will be recovered by fees charged to the applicant.
Testing will be conducted at the USDA-FGIS Technical Center, Kansas City, Missouri.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Executive Order 12866



The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.



Executive Order 12778



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended
to have a retroactive effect. The United States Grain Standards Act provides in section 87g that no State or subdivision
may require or impose any requirements or restrictions concerning the inspection, weighing, or description of grain
under the USGSA. Otherwise, this proposed rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies
unless they present irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be
exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule.



Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification



David R. Galliart, Acting Administrator, FGIS, has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Most users of the official inspection and weighing services
and those persons who perform those services do not meet the requirements of small entities as defined in the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.).



Information Collection Requirements



In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the information collection requirements
contained in part 800 have been previously approved by OMB under control number 0580-0013.


Background


Since the early 1980s, FGIS has provided official service under the Agricultural Marketing Act (AMA) to test grain
and processed grain products for the residue of three pesticides, carbon tetrachloride, methylbromide, and ethylene
dibromide. This service has been available upon request from FGIS' Commodity Testing Laboratory in Beltsville,
MD.

FGIS is now proposing to expand its pesticide residue testing program to include testing wheat for 29 additional pesticides
under the authority of the United States Grain Standards Act. The service will be performed on a request basis; it will
not be required for either domestic or export shipments. All samples will be tested at the Kansas City Technical Center.
A minimum of 500 grams of wheat will be required for testing. The residues (routine compounds) that will be certified
are as follows: Aldrin, Azinphos-methyl, Alpha-BHC, Beta-BHC, Delta-BHC, Carbofuran, Chlorpyrifos, Chlorothalonil,
Chlorpyrifos Methyl, P.P'-DDD, P.P'-DDE, P.P'-DDT, Diclofop-methyl, Dieldrin, Dimethoate, Endosulfan, Endrin,
Esfenvalerate, Fenitrothion, Fenthion, Folpet, Lindane, Malathion, Methidathion, Methoxychlor, Parathion,
Parathion-methyl, Pirimiphos-methyl, and Triallate. These compounds will be analyzed by gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry.

Laboratory analytical results will be provided to the applicant as soon as practicable. Generally the testing requires
a minimum of 48 hours.

The proposed fees will be set forth in  800.71(a), Schedule A. The proposed fee is $200 for each sample tested
during a regular workday and $300 for each sample tested during a non-regular workday. The proposed fees are intended
to cover, as nearly as practicable, the FGIS operating cost including related supervisory and administrative costs.
Testing for additional residues (special compounds) within FGIS capabilities may be requested at a proposed rate
of $100 per hour during a regular workday and $150 per hour during a nonregular workday. The testing fee does not include
charges for sampling. Sampling service fees, if required, will be assessed in accordance with the sampling rates
in  800.71(a), Schedule A. Testing of other grains will be provided as a service at a later date.

Major importers of U.S. wheat such as Japan, China, Mexico, and Korea have indicated a strong interest in having U.S.
grain tested for the presence of specific pesticide residues. FGIS is proposing to offer certification of these specific
pesticide residue levels for export and domestic wheat. The anticipated volume of requests for this service is 500
samples per year or 10 per week. This represents a generated income of approximately $100,000 per year which will cover
the costs of providing the service.



Proposed Action



FGIS proposes to revise  800.71(a), Schedule A, to establish new fees for testing pesticide residues.

Filberts/Hazelnuts Grown in Oregon and Washington; Hearing on Proposed Further Amendment of Marketing Agreement
and Order No. 982, Both as Amended 






<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of public hearing on proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given of a public hearing to consider amending Marketing Agreement and Order No. 982 
(order). The order regulates the handling of filberts/hazelnuts grown in Oregon and Washington. The purpose of the
hearing is to receive evidence on proposals to amend provisions of the order. The proposed amendments would make changes
in order provisions regarding: Volume control; nomination and membership of the Filbert/Hazelnut Marketing Board
(Board); collecting assessments; and the administration and operation of the program. The proposed amendments
were submitted by the Board, the agency responsible for local administration of the order, to make the order more consistent
with current industry conditions and needs. The Fruit and Vegetable Division, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS),
proposes other conforming and necessary changes. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This administrative action is taken pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended 
(7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' This action also is governed by the provisions of
  556 and 557 of Title 5 of the United States Code and, therefore, is excluded from the requirements of Executive
Order 12866. 


The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et. seq.

) seeks to ensure that within the statutory authority of a program, the regulatory and informational requirements
are tailored to the size and nature of small business. Interested persons are invited to present evidence at the hearing
on the possible regulatory and informational impact of the proposals on small businesses. 

The amendments proposed herein have been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. They are not
intended to have retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendments would not preempt any state or local laws,
regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his principal place of business, has
jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later
than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 

The hearing is called pursuant to the provisions of the Act and the applicable rules of practice and procedure governing
the formulation of marketing agreements and orders (7 CFR Part 900). 


The Board proposes several amendments to the order's volume control provisions. The Board recommends an amendment
that would expand the primary (domestic) market by adding Hawaii to the distribution area that currently is the continental
United States (including Alaska) ( 982.16). In addition, the Board proposes an amendment that would allow
the Board, with the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture, to make future changes in the primary market's distribution
area ( 982.16). The Board proposes another amendment designed to provide the Board with additional flexibility
to release up to 15 percent of the average volume acquired by the trade for the primary market for the preceding three
years' rather than the mandatory 15 percent release specified in the current order ( 982.40). The Board recommends
an amendment that would allow the Board to establish identification standards for inspected and certified lots of
hazelnuts rather than the current order requirement which specifies seals, stamps, tags or other identification
( 982.46). 


The Board recommends several proposed amendments regarding nomination and Board membership. The Board proposes
an amendment to change the length of the term of office to two years from the current one-year period with a corresponding
change limiting the consecutive terms to three two-year terms rather than the current six consecutive 
one-year terms ( 982.33). A corresponding amendment would establish the qualifications for nominating handler
Board members based on the handlers' previous two years' volume handled rather than the previous one year volume handled,
as currently required ( 982.30). Similarly, the Board recommends a conforming change to the qualification
period for weighing handler votes to the previous two marketing years rather than the previous one year marketing
year 
( 982.32). The Board proposes that a change be made in the voting procedures when calculating handler voting
qualifications by changing the minimum weighted volume to one ton rather than the current one percent ( 982.32).
The Board also proposes that a clarification be added to voting procedures to make it clear that eligible handlers
vote for only one member and one alternate member ( 982.32).

The Board recommends several amendments to the administrative procedures and operations of the order's programs.
The Board recommends changing the name of the regulated product from ``filberts'' or ``filberts/hazelnuts'' to
the single name ``hazelnuts'' ( 982.4). Another amendment would allow telephone votes taken by the Board to
remain unconfirmed until the next Board meeting rather than being confirmed in writing by individual members immediately
after the vote ( 982.37). Also, the Board proposes an amendment to remove the requirement that ``verbatim''
reports be made of Board proceedings on marketing policy meetings ( 982.39). One amendment would remove an
incorrect word in the current order language which determines handler credit for ungraded product ( 982.51).
The Board has recommended an amendment which would provide that, when the Board establishes bonding rates for handlers
who temporarily defer meeting their restricted obligations, the Board would use the estimated value of restricted
credits rather than the estimated product value of a handler's deferred restricted obligation ( 982.54).
Further, the Board recommends that defaulted bond payments should be used by the Board to purchase excess restricted
credits from handlers rather than purchasing certified merchantable product which has already met restricted obligations
( 982.54). Also, the Board recommends a corresponding change that such restricted credits should be used by
the handlers to liquidate their restricted obligation rather than be disposed of as restricted product ( 982.54).


The Board proposes two amendments to the assessment provision to allow the Board to accept advance assessment payments
(and provide discounts to those handlers who make advanced payments) and borrow money. Advance payments and borrowed
moneys would be used only for meeting administrative obligations before current year assessment payments are available
( 982.61). The Board also proposes a new provision that would allow the Board to accept voluntary contributions
from willing individuals. Such contributions would be used only for production research, marketing research and
development, and marketing promotion, including paid advertising (new  982.63). 

Finally, the Board proposes that a clarification be added to the exemption provision of the order to make it perfectly
clear that mail order sales to destinations outside the area of production are not exempt from order requirements
( 982.57). 

These proposals were submitted by the Board which works with the Department in administering the order. The Fruit
and Vegetable Division, AMS, proposes conforming changes to further clarify and assure consistency with existing
provisions of the order. The Board's proposed amendments have not received the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture.


The public hearing is held for the purpose of: (1) Receiving evidence about the economic and marketing conditions
which relate to the proposed amendments of the order; (2) determining whether there is a need for the proposed amendments
to the order; and (3) determining whether the proposed amendments, or appropriate modifications thereof, will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 



All persons wishing to submit written material as evidence at the hearing should be prepared to submit four copies
of such material at the hearing and should have prepared testimony available for presentation at the hearing. 

From the time this hearing notice is issued and until the issuance of a final decision in this proceeding, Department
employees involved in the decisional process are prohibited from discussing the merits of the hearing issues on an


ex parte 

basis with any person having an interest in the proceeding. The prohibition applies to employees in the following
organizational units: Office of the Secretary of Agriculture; Office of the Administrator, AMS; Office of the General
Counsel, except designated employees of the Office of General Counsel assigned to represent the Board in this rulemaking
proceeding; and the Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS. 

Procedural matters are not subject to the above prohibition and may be discussed at any time.

by the Board. Any handler desiring to export any part or all of that handler's certified merchantable restricted hazelnuts
shall deliver to the Board the certified merchantable restricted hazelnuts to be exported, but the Board shall be
obligated to sell in export only such quantities for which it may be able to find satisfactory export outlets. Any hazelnuts
so delivered for export which the Board is unable to export shall be returned to the handler delivering them. Sales
for export shall be made by the Board only on execution of an agreement to prevent reimportation into the area designated
in  982.16. A handler may be permitted to act as an agent of the Board, upon such terms and conditions as the board
may specify, in negotiating export sales, and when so acting shall be entitled to receive a selling commission as authorized
by the Board. The proceeds of all export sales, after deducting all expenses actually and necessarily incurred, shall

Bonding requirement.

 Such bond or bonds shall, at all times during their effective period, be in such amounts that the aggregate thereof
shall be no less than the total bonding value of the handler's deferred restricted obligation. The bonding value shall
be the deferred restricted obligation poundage multiplied by the applicable bonding rate. The cost of such bond or
bonds shall be borne by the handler filing same. 
(c) 

Bonding rate.

 Said bonding rate shall be an amount per pound as established by the Board. Such bonding rate shall be based on the estimated
value of restricted credits for the current marketing year. Until bonding rates for a marketing year are fixed, the
rates in effect for the preceding marketing year shall continue in effect. The Board should make any necessary adjustments
once such new rates are fixed. 
(d) 

Restricted credit purchases.

 Any sums collected through default of a handler on the handler's bond shall be used by the Board to purchase restricted
credits from handlers, who have such restricted credits in excess of their needs, and are willing to part with them.
The Board shall at all times purchase the lowest priced restricted credits offered, and the purchases shall be made
from the various handlers as nearly as practicable in proportion to the quantity of their respective offerings of
the restricted credits to be purchased.

administrative and other costs incurred in the collection of such sums, and in the purchase of restricted credits
as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. 
(f) 

Transfer of restricted credit purchases.

 Restricted credits purchased as provided for in this section shall be turned over to those handlers who have defaulted
on their bonds for liquidation of their restricted obligation. The quantity delivered to each handler shall be that
quantity represented by sums collected through default.

In  982.57, revise paragraph (b) to read as follows: 


 982.57 

Exemptions. 


* * * * * 


(b) 

Sales by growers direct to consumers.

 Any hazelnut grower may sell hazelnuts of such grower's own production free of the regulatory and assessment provisions
of this part if such grower sells such hazelnuts in the area of production directly to end users at such grower's ranch
or orchard or at roadside stands and farmers' markets. The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish
such rules, regulations, and safeguards and require such reports, certifications, and other conditions, as are
necessary to ensure that such hazelnuts are disposed of only as authorized. Mail order sales to destinations outside
the area of production are not considered to be exempt sales under this part. 


Proposal No. 12 


In  982.58, revise the last sentence of paragraph (a) to read as follows: 


 982.58 

Research, promotion, and market development. 


(a) * * * The expenses of such projects shall be paid from funds collected pursuant to  982.61,
 982.63, or credited pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. 


* * * * * 


Revise  982.61 by designating the present text as paragraph (a) and adding a new paragraph (b) to read as follows:



 982.61 

Assessments. 


(a) * * *
(b) In order to provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal
period before sufficient operating income is available from assessments on the current year's shipments, the Board
may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may also borrow money for such purpose. Further, payment discounts
may be authorized by the Board upon the approval of the Secretary to handlers making such advance assessment payments.
Add a new  982.63 to read as follows: 


 982.63 

Contributions. 


The Board may accept voluntary contributions but these shall only be used to pay expenses incurred pursuant to  982.58.
Furthermore, such contributions shall be free from any encumbrances by the donor and the Board shall retain complete
control of their use. 


Proposal No. 13 


The Fruit and Vegetable Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, proposes to make such changes to the order as may
be necessary to conform with any amendment thereto that may result from the hearing.

Licenses for Radiography and Radiation Safety Requirements for Radiographic Operations 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations governing industrial radiography.
The proposed rule would include additional safety requirements to enhance the level of protection of radiographers
and the public and would clarify the regulations so that licensees may have a better understanding of what is expected
in radiographic operations. The proposed rule includes a number of updated radiography regulations that have been
adopted by the Agreement States. The major changes in the proposed rule include requirements for: (1) Two qualified
individuals to be present whenever radiography occurs at a temporary jobsite, 
(2) mandatory certification of radiographers, (3) permanent radiographic installations, and (4) a radiation safety
officer. The format of the radiography regulations would be revised to place requirements into descriptive categories.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


Part 34 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations was first published in 1965 (30 FR 8192) as part of the recodification
of parts 30 and 31 for the purpose of simplifying and clarifying the format of the then-current requirements on radiography
so that persons subject to byproduct material licensing regulations could conveniently use and understand them.
Numerous modifications to the original part 34 have been made since 1965, many of which have been directed toward the
safety aspects of field radiography. These modifications include performance requirements on radiography equipment
and requirements for the use of alarming ratemeters published in 1990 (55 FR 843; January 10, 1993). 
There are approximately 200 NRC radiography licensees with an additional 500 Agreement State licensees. Radiography
licensees often conduct business under both NRC and Agreement State jurisdiction. 
The NRC has not initiated an overall revision of part 34 in many years. However, a number of Agreement States have updated
their radiography regulations. The decision to develop an overall revision to 10 CFR part 34 was made with the intent
of establishing new safety requirements for radiography licensees and clarifying the regulation so that licensees
will have a better understanding of what is expected in radiographic operations. The format of the radiography regulations
would be revised to place requirements into descriptive categories that better describe the type of requirements
found in the subpart. 
The NRC solicited recommendations on radiography issues at the 1991 Agreement States' meeting in Sacramento, CA,
as well as from NRC regional offices, radiography equipment manufacturers, and radiography licensees. Public comments
were solicited on the issue of radiographer certification at the May 19, 1991, annual meeting of the Conference of
Radiation Control Program Directors (CRCPD), Inc. in Wichita, Kansas, and a public workshop on radiographer certification
was held May 27-28, 1992, in Mobile, Alabama. A separate workshop was held on November 18, 1992, in Dallas, Texas,
to discuss recommendations received from the Agreement States and licensees on revision of the radiography regulations.
The transcripts of these meetings, which are available for inspection and copying in the NRC Public Document Room,
were reviewed in further developing the proposed revision. The NRC utilized part E of the ``Suggested State Regulations
for Control of Radiation'' developed by the CRCPD, part 31 of the Texas Regulations for Control of Radiation, Chapter
5 of the Louisiana regulations, and the Canadian ``Atomic Energy Control Regulations,'' that apply to radiography
in developing this proposed revision of part 34.

II. Petition for Rulemaking 


A petition was received on October 15, 1992, from the International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE), Local No.
2, requesting an amendment to the radiography regulations to require a minimum of two radiographic personnel when
performing industrial radiography at temporary jobsites. The petition was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 4, 1992 (57 FR 57392). Thirty-eight comment letters were received, 35 were in favor of granting the petition.
Resolution of this petition has been addressed in this proposed revision to part 34. 
The IUOE petition offered three options for the makeup of the two-person crew: (1) Two radiographers; (2) one radiographer
and one radiographer's assistant; and (3) one radiographer and one trainee, with the trainee having completed 40
hours of approved radiation safety training and passed an examination. The petitioners identified a number of problems
associated with the use of licensed material by one radiographer at temporary jobsites. These problems included:
(1) Difficulty keeping the area under constant surveillance while radiographic operations are ongoing; (2) difficulty
in maintaining surveillance when working in trenches; and (3) difficulty in obtaining assistance in the event of
an emergency if there is only one individual. The petitioners believe that the suggested change is necessary to ensure
a safe working environment. 
The comments received raised concerns regarding the combination of a radiographer and a trainee as a two-person team.
Many stated that the trainee is an unskilled individual that may or may not achieve radiographer status and spending
the time and money for 40 hours training may not be financially feasible for some radiography companies. 
This proposed rule, if adopted, would constitute a partial granting of the petition in that it proposes to require,
at a minimum, a two-person crew whenever radiographic operations are being conducted outside of a permanent radiographic
installation. The NRC has decided not to adopt the term ``radiographer trainee,'' and is proposing that the second
person be another qualified radiographer or an individual who has met, at a minimum, the requirements for a radiographer's
assistant. The NRC recognizes that, in Agreement States, the training of those individuals designated as trainees
would meet the NRC's training requirements for a radiographer's assistant. 
The estimated cost of requiring the two-person crew could be significant for licensees who send only one radiographer
to a temporary jobsite. However, the current regulation requires direct surveillance of the operation to prevent
unauthorized entry into a high radiation area. To comply with this regulation most licensees already must use more
than one qualified individual in many situations. For certain circumstances where a licensee could demonstrate
that adequate surveillance can be maintained by one radiographer, the Commission could consider granting an exemption
through the process described in the proposed  34.111. The Commission is concerned that this requirement could
cause a significant impact on a number of small entities which currently do not use two-person crews, and is soliciting
comments on the potential impact. Furthermore, the Commission is interested in receiving proposals for alternatives
to the two-person requirement which would achieve comparable enhancements in safety with less of a burden on licensees.

In summary, the Commission believes that by requiring at least two qualified individuals to always be present when
radiographic operations are being conducted, there will be a significant increase in assurance that operational
safety measures and emergency procedures will be effectively implemented. The expectation is that violations involving
failures to perform adequate radiation surveys of radiographic exposure devices and the surrounding area, failures
to adequately post and monitor the restricted area, and failures to lock and secure the camera when not in use will become
less frequent. Furthermore, if an incapacitating injury to a radiographer should occur at a remote location, the
presence of a second individual could be an important factor in preventing unnecessary radiation exposures. The
Commission is considering amending the Enforcement Policy as a result of this proposed rulemaking to provide, as
an example of a Severity Level III violation, the conduct of radiography operations without the required second radiographer
or individual with, at least, the qualifications of a radiographer's assistant as provided in the proposed  34.41.

III. General Discussion of Proposed Rule Changes 



The proposed amendments contain requirements which are intended to improve radiography safety. The first major
change is a proposal to require, at a minimum, two qualified individuals (two radiographers or a radiographer and
an individual who has met, at least, the requirements to be a radiographer's assistant) to be present any time radiographic
operations occur outside of a permanent radiographic installation. This issue has already been addressed under
Section II. Petition for Rulemaking. 

On March 19, 1991 (56 FR 11504), the NRC published a final rule which provided for a voluntary third-party radiographer
certification program through the American Society for Nondestructive Testing (ASNT), as discussed further in
Section IV. Several Agreement States have adopted mandatory radiographer state administered examination programs.
The promulgation of these programs, as well as other changes in their radiography regulations, have contributed
to an overall improvement in safety and a decrease in serious overexposures in these Agreement States. 

The proposed rule would recognize other certifying organizations who meet the requirements outlined in Appendix
A of the proposed rule. Independent certifying organizations would be required to meet all of the requirements listed
in Appendix A, while Agreement States that wish to become certifying entities would only be required to meet the requirements
listed in part II and III of the Appendix. The NRC plans to publish annually in the 

Federal Register

 an updated list of certifying entities and to provide the list with license application forms. The NRC also plans to
investigate the feasibility of establishing a toll-free telephone number whereby licensees could obtain information
on approved certifying entities. 

Another issue involves the definition of a permanent radiographic installation. The proposed rule changes the definition
of a ``permanent radiographic installation'' to mean an enclosed shielded room, cell, or vault in which radiography
is performed. The terms ``designed or intended for radiography'' and ``regularly performed'' have been removed
from the definition to reduce any ambiguity as to what is intended. Under the existing rule, if a licensee has a room,
cell, or vault that meets the definition of a ``permanent radiographic installation'', then it must meet the special
safety requirements of  34.33. The proposed rule adds two additional requirements: (1) To perform a daily check
of the visible and audible signals, and (2) to list all permanent facilities on the license. Under the proposed rule,
radiography can only be performed in one of two ways: (1) In a permanent radiographic installation with a qualified
radiographer, or (2) at any other location with at least two qualified individuals. The special safety requirements
of  34.33 would not apply to the use of a shielded room at a temporary jobsite, although licensees would be permitted
to submit a license amendment requesting approval to use a shielded room which meets the requirements of  34.33
as a permanent radiographic installation. 

The proposed rule includes requirements specifying the qualifications and duties of the Radiation Safety Officer
(RSO). The RSO is the key licensee individual charged with the responsibility to ensure that the requirements in the
license are followed. These requirements have been based on similar commitments previously included in specific
license conditions on a case-by-case basis. The proposed rule would require additional special training for RSOs.
The Commission is considering permitting existing RSOs to obtain the additional training within 2 years from the
effective date of the rule and is specifically requesting comment on this proposed requirement. 



IV. An Independent Certifying Entity (ASNT) 



The current ASNT program for certifying industrial radiographers was approved by its Board of Directors in March
1990 and offers certification for either isotope or x-ray users. The NRC staff has extensively reviewed this program,
which includes a written examination developed by the State of Texas. 

The application to become a certified radiographer requires documentation of 40 hours of classroom training in radiation
safety topics specified by ASNT including those topics listed in the proposed  34.43(f), documentation of
520 hours of direct hands-on experience with radiography sources and devices under the control of an NRC or Agreement
State licensee, and proof of successful completion of a practical examination on safety procedures administered
by an ASNT-recognized institution. Recognized institutions, generally the candidates' employers, have been licensed
by NRC or an Agreement State for the use of radiography sources. 

After ASNT's approval of an application, a candidate radiographer takes the written examination. The examination
is administered by ASNT or the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors, Inc. (CRCPD) and subsequently
sent to the State of Texas for grading. The results of the examination are forwarded to ASNT. The written examination
covers the fundamental radiation safety principles outlined in 10 CFR part 34, pertinent Federal and State regulations,
basic radiographic equipment operation, general operating and emergency procedures, radiation detection instrumentation,
and radiation safety procedures applicable to industrial radiography. In addition, candidates are required to
sign a pledge that they will abide by the ASNT Rules of Conduct. On successful completion of the required examinations
and other requirements, a certified individual is provided with a wallet card identifying him/her as an ASNT-certified
radiographer. 

ASNT certification is valid for 3 years, unless suspended or revoked for cause. Renewal of certification may be accomplished
either with or without reexamination. A candidate for renewal without reexamination must document continuous active
full-time employment in radiography for at least 6 of the last 12 months. In addition, the candidate must document
at least 8 hours, each year, of classroom refresher training covering basic radiation safety principles, equipment
operations, emergency procedures, new safety regulations, license requirements, and other pertinent information.
If these criteria are not met, the candidate must retake the written examination. 

The ASNT Rules of Conduct require certified individuals to comply with NRC and Agreement State regulations and the
employer's procedures for radiation safety, routine and emergency operations, and to act in a professional manner
in matters pertaining to industrial radiography or to the ASNT certification. 

The certification program also contains complaint and hearing procedures. For example, written allegations of
unauthorized practice by an ASNT-certified individual are reviewed by the ASNT Ethics Subcommittee. In some cases
a formal hearing may be held. If the ASNT Ethics Subcommittee determines that an unauthorized practice has been committed,
the subcommittee may take one of the following actions:

1. Revoke the individual's certification for a minimum of 1 year. 
2. Suspend the individual's certification for 30 to 180 days. 
3. Formally reprimand the individual. 

More detailed information on the ASNT certification program is available from the American Society for Nondestructive
Testing, Inc., 1711 Arlingate Plaza, P.O. Box 28518, Columbus, Ohio 43228-0518. 



V. Discussion of the Proposed Rule 



Table of Contents 



The new Table of Contents contains eight subparts. The organization is as follows: 




Subpart A_General Provisions 
Subpart B_Specific Licensing Provisions 
Subpart C_Equipment 
Subpart D_Radiation Safety Requirements 
Subpart E_Recordkeeping Requirements 
Subpart F_Notifications 
Subpart G_Exemptions 
Subpart H_Violations 
Appendix A 




This organization follows the same general format used in 10 CFR part 39 concerning radiation safety requirements
for well logging. 



Subpart A_General Provisions 



This subpart covers items of a general nature, such as listing definitions and OMB approvals. It also describes the
purpose and scope of the rule. 

Section 34.1, Purpose and scope, is basically unchanged from the existing regulation. Other NRC regulations that
apply to radiography licenses are referenced in this section. 

Section 34.3, Definitions, contains the following new terms: ALARA, Annual safety review, Becquerel, Certifying
entity, Collimator, Control (drive) cable, Field station, Gray, Independent certifying organization, Radiographer
certification, Radiation Safety Officer, Sievert, S-tube, and Temporary jobsite. These definitions were added
to define terms used in requirements not previously addressed in Part 34. The term ALARA, which means as low as reasonably
achievable, has been added to describe a key element of the revised part 20, ``Standards for Protection Against Radiation,''
that licensees must implement by January 1994. The term Annual safety review was added to describe this activity in
the proposed rule. The terms Becquerel, Gray, and Sievert were added to define the metric units used in all new or revised
regulations. The terms Certifying entity, Independent certifying organization, and Radiographer certification
were added to describe terms associated with revised requirements for verification of radiographer training. The
terms Collimator and Control (drive) cable were added to the proposed rule to describe pieces of equipment that is
often used in conducting radiography operations. The term S-tube was added to describe this component of a radiographic
exposure for which there are new requirements in the proposed rule. The terms Field station and Temporary jobsite
were added to clarify the meaning of these terms in the proposed rule. The term Field station is being used to designate
those locations where radiography equipment is stored and from which equipment is dispatched. The term Temporary
jobsite is being used to describe locations not authorized on the license where radiography is conducted. The term
Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) was added to describe the role of this individual in the proposed rule. 

The terms Associated equipment, Control tube, Exposure head, Field examination, Projection sheath, Radiographic
Operations, Shielded position, and Source assembly, while used in the existing regulation, were not previously
defined. Both licensees and Agreement State representatives requested clarification of these terms. Changing
the definition of radiographer's assistant was discussed at the November 1992 workshop in Dallas, Texas. Some Agreement
States use the term ``trainee'' to refer to a radiographer's assistant and require training similar to that required
of a radiographer. The NRC has decided to retain the term radiographer's assistant and has proposed upgrading the
training requirements to provide additional assurance that radiographers' assistants are sufficiently knowledgeable
of NRC regulations. Although the NRC is not adopting the term ``trainee,'' the proposed rule has been written to provide
the flexibility for the second person to have training beyond that of a radiographer's assistant. This position could
then equally be filled by a ``trainee.'' 

The definition of a permanent radiographic installation was modified to remove ambiguities in the previous definition.
The definitions of storage area and storage container were modified to remove references to transportation. Specific
transportation requirements are addressed in  34.35.

Section 34.5, Interpretations, is standard regulatory language to state that only the General Counsel of the NRC
has the authority to provide interpretations of the regulations which will be binding on the Commission. 

Section 34.8, Information collection requirements: OMB approval, is unchanged from the current regulation, except
for changing the section numbers to conform to the new format of the proposed rule and to list any new requirements that
require OMB approval. The Commission has submitted the proposed rule for OMB clearance. Final OMB clearance will
be obtained before publication of a final rule. 


Subpart B_Specific Licensing Provisions 


This proposed subpart provides the basic requirements for submittal of a license application. The sections in this
proposed subpart are basically unchanged from those in the current subpart A of part 34. 
Section 34.11, Application for a specific license, is worded the same as  34.3 in the current part 34. 
Section 34.13, Specific license for radiography, has several changes from  34.11 in the current part 34. A proposed
 34.13(c) would specify requirements for establishing procedures to verify the certification status of radiographers.
The requirement for verifying an individual's certification would only apply to previously certified radiographers
whom a licensee might hire. A licensee would already know an individual's status if the individual is employed by the
licensee at the time of certification. However, the licensee would be required to ensure that all radiographers are
certified. 

Section 34.13(e) proposes a reduction in the frequency of field inspections of radiographers and radiographer's
assistants from quarterly to annually for individuals regularly conducting radiographic operations. For individuals
who have not performed radiographic operations for more than six months, an inspection of job performance would be
required at the time they next participate in a radiographic operation. This reduction is possible due primarily
to the proposed two-person rule, adoption of mandatory certification for radiographers, and upgraded radiographer
assistants training which would reduce the need for inspection of job performance. The basic requirements for conducting
the field inspections have been relocated to  34.43(d) to more accurately reflect its role in the training program.
In addition, a requirement for conducting annual safety reviews has also been added in 
 34.13(b)(1) and  34.43(c) to clarify the intent of the current  34.11(b) which requires periodic
training. Section 34.13(g) is proposed to require the licensee to designate an individual on the license to fulfill
the duties of the RSO. The qualifications and duties of this individual are specified in 
 34.42. 
Section 34.13(i) is a new paragraph which, as proposed, would require a list and description of all permanent radiographic
installations and all field stations to be included in the license application. 
Section 34.13(j) is a new paragraph which, as proposed, would permit licensees to have the option to use certified
radiographers before the proposed rule is adopted in final form and becomes effective. 


Subpart C_Equipment 


This proposed subpart describes the requirements for radiographic equipment performance and use. Some of the requirements
in this proposed subpart are changed from the current part 34 as described below. 

Section 34.20, Performance requirements for radiography equipment, is slightly changed from  34.20 of the
current rule. Section 34.20(b)(3) is revised to prohibit modification of any exposure device. The proposed rule
was modified to remove any ambiguity regarding permission to modify safety components. The term Source assembly
was added to  34.20 (c) and (e) to make clear that it is one of the pieces of equipment that must meet the requirements
of  34.20. Section 34.20(f) is added to require labeling of all associated equipment acquired after January
10, 1996, to identify that the components have met the requirements of this section. 
Section 34.21, Limits on levels of radiation for radiographic exposure devices, storage containers, and source
changers, is basically unchanged from  34.21 of the current rule with the following exceptions. Metric equivalents
to the values previously cited have been included. While it is recognized that radiation exposure instruments currently
use units of roentgens to measure radioactivity, the rule has been modified to use the terms millisieverts and millirems.
Rather than making the transition from roentgens to coulombs per kilogram (in air), the terms millisieverts and millirems
were chosen because a quality factor of 1 is appropriate in dealing with gamma-ray emitting radiography sources.
Under the proposed rule measurements taken in roentgens may continue to be recorded in terms of roentgens, provided
the limits described in the rule, expressed in millisieverts or millirems, are not exceeded.

Section 34.23, Locking and relocation of radiographic exposure devices, storage containers, and source changers,
is slightly changed from  34.22 of the current rule, as described below. Section 34.23(a) describes locking
of radiographic exposure devices. A requirement to remove the key of any 
keyed-lock is proposed. Should the key remain in the radiographic exposure device, there is an increased likelihood
of the accidental or intentional removal of the sealed source when the radiographic device is unattended. The word
``manually'' is added to clarify what is meant by securing the source assembly for radiographic exposure devices
manufactured before January 10, 1992. Section 34.23(b) is added which specifies requirements for ensuring that
the sealed source is in the shielded position before moving the device and associated equipment because a number of
overexposures have occurred while radiographic devices were being moved from one location to another. 
Section 34.25, Radiation survey instruments, replaces  34.24 in the current rule and has been updated to reflect
current calibration standards for different types of survey meters. This is to specify requirements to address the
variety of survey instruments currently available. An additional requirement to perform an operability check before
use is proposed. While this is routinely part of all survey instrument specifications, a failure to determine whether
an instrument was operable before use has been a contributing factor in overexposures during radiographic operations.

In  34.27, Leak testing and replacement of sealed sources, the words ``repair, tagging, opening, and modification''
of sealed sources have been removed because these activities are only approved for individuals specifically licensed
to do so. It was never intended that radiographers would be permitted to perform these activities without special
authorization from the Commission or an Agreement State. Section 34.31 was modified to include a specific prohibition
on the opening, repair, or modification of sealed sources. Most of the language in the proposed rule is the same as 
 34.25 of the existing rule. However, the organization has been modified for purposes of clarification. The
requirement that performance of a source exchange or a leak test must be done by persons approved by the Commission
has been modified to include Agreement States. Recordkeeping requirements have been moved to  34.67. 
Section 34.27(f) is proposed to require surveys for depleted uranium (DU) contamination in the ``S'' tube of radiographic
devices at least once every 12 months. Depleted uranium is used as a shielding material in most radiographic devices
and replaces the lead shielding that was used in older models. The presence of DU contamination in the ``S'' tube may
be an indication that the control cable has worn a groove through the ``S'' tube into the DU shielding. This condition
could cause binding of the control cable in the groove with the resultant inability to retract the source, and could
result in unwarranted exposures. Recordkeeping requirements may be found in  34.67. 
Section 34.29, Quarterly inventory, is basically unchanged from the existing regulation with the exception of moving
all recordkeeping requirements to  34.69. 
Section 34.31, Inspection and maintenance of radiographic exposure devices, storage containers, associated equipment,
and source changers, includes several proposed changes from  34.28 in the current rule. The term associated
equipment has been included in the proposed rule, and includes various items used for specific tasks which may not
be supplied with the radiographic device. Experience has shown that defects in associated equipment can have an effect
on safety. Therefore, associated equipment must be included in an inspection and maintenance program. Section 34.31(a)
has been revised to clarify the intent of the daily visual check and the required actions if defects are found. In  34.31(b),
the term routine maintenance is now used to clarify that licensees are not required to perform all maintenance. Many
equipment repairs may require returning the device to the manufacturer. Language has been added to specify that defective
equipment must be removed from service until repaired and that a record of the defect, as well as corrective actions
taken, must be made. While this appears obvious, there have been numerous instances where the use of defective equipment
continued and overexposures of personnel occurred as a direct result of the defects. Recordkeeping requirements
have been moved to  34.73. The records required to be kept would now be specified in the rule, and include: Date
of check, individual performing check, equipment involved, any defects found, and repairs made. 
Section 34.33, Permanent radiographic installations, is basically unchanged from the existing requirements in
part 34, with the exceptions noted below. Section 34.33(a) has been revised to clarify which entrance controls are
required by incorporating the appropriate language from 10 CFR 20.1601 into part 34. Section 34.33(b) is revised
to require an alarm system check at the beginning of each day of use. This is to be performed by checking the warning light
and audible alarm with the source exposed before using the room each day. A defective alarm would require repair before
radiographic operations could resume. This requirement is included because there have been instances where failures
in alarm systems have resulted in personnel overexposures upon entry into a high radiation area.

Section 34.35, Labels, storage, and transportation precautions, is a proposed new section that would place requirements
that specify labeling and security precautions for radioactive material storage and transportation in part 34.
Section 34.23 of the current rule describes storage precautions for exposure devices and storage containers but
does not address transportation or labeling requirements. In  34.35 of the proposed rule, labeling requirements
for source changers and storage containers are specified. The proposed rule contains specific requirements to lock
and physically secure transport packages. The proposed rule would also require licensees to store licensed material
in a manner which minimizes the danger from explosions or fire. The requirement for a Quality Assurance (QA) program,
as described in  71.105, has been added to the proposed rule. While radiography licensees have always had to
comply with  71.105, there have been numerous cases where radiography licensees were unaware of this requirement
and, therefore, failed to comply. The addition of requirements addressing labeling and transportation is necessary
because in the past personnel and public exposures have occurred from the failure to properly safeguard radioactive
material during storage and transportation. 



Subpart D_Radiation Safety Requirements 




This subpart describes basic radiation safety requirements for radiographic operations and includes training,
safety procedures, personnel monitoring and surveys. New requirements describing the duties of the radiation safety
officer are proposed. 


Section 34.41, Conducting radiographic operations, would be added to address the practice of conducting radiography
at sites where the special safety features of a shielded facility are not available. The proposed requirement specifies
that, as a minimum, either two radiographers or a radiographer and an individual who has met the requirements to be
a radiographer's assistant must be present any time radiographic operations occur outside a permanent installation.
The basis for this proposed requirement is to ensure that, in the absence of the safety features outlined in  34.33,
there will be a significant increase in assurance that operational safety measures will be implemented effectively.
The expectation is that violations involving failures to perform adequate radiation surveys of radiographic exposure
devices and the surrounding area, failures to adequately post and monitor the restricted area, and failures to lock
and secure the camera when not in use will become less frequent. Furthermore, if an incapacitating injury to a radiographer
should occur at a remote location, the presence of a second individual could be an important factor in preventing unnecessary
radiation exposures. Section 34.41(b) is proposed to require that radiographic operations conducted at locations
listed on the license be conducted in a permanent radiographic installation. If licensees would need to perform radiography
outside of a permanent facility due to some unique circumstances Commission authorization would be required, and
the requirements of  34.41(a) would need to be met. 


Section 34.42, Radiation Safety Officer (RSO), lists the qualifications and duties of the RSO. This section would
be added to place in the regulations the requirements for this key individual. Previously, these requirements were
referenced in regulatory guides and included as license conditions on a case-by-case basis, but not specified in
the regulations. The NRC believes that the RSO is the key individual for ensuring safe operations. The qualifications
listed for the RSO in the proposed rule include: (1) Completion of the training required for a radiographer as described
in part 34; and (2) 2000 hours of documented experience in industrial radiography with at least 40 hours of formal classroom
training with respect to the establishment and maintenance of radiation protection programs. It is anticipated
that most existing RSOs already meet these requirements. It is proposed that licensees would have two years from the
effective date of the rule to meet this 40 hour training requirement for existing RSOs. A key duty of the RSO is to ensure
the safe conduct of operations and to stop unsafe operations and institute corrective actions. Other duties of the
RSO in the proposed rule include overseeing procedure implementation and employee training, and monitoring radiation
surveys, leak tests, and personnel monitoring results. 


Section 34.43, Training, contains several new requirements. Section 34.43(a) has been revised to require radiographers
to be certified by a certifying entity meeting the criteria specified in Appendix A of the proposed rule. To be recognized
as a certifying entity, an independent organization meeting the criteria specified in part I of appendix A would have
to apply as specified in  34.43(a)(2). Certifying programs would be periodically reviewed by the NRC to ensure
that the conditions of approval are being met. A list of approved certifying entities would be made available to licensees
on request by contacting the appropriate regional office listed in appendix D to 10 CFR part 20, and would be published
annually in the 

Federal Register

. Under the proposed rule licensees would have 2 years to implement the proposed change. The change in the verification
of training requirements was included in the proposed rule to provide assurance of the quality of radiographers'
training in the safe handling of radioactive material. NRC and Agreement States must reciprocally recognize valid
radiographer certifications issued by either an independent certifying entity approved by the NRC or an Agreement
State certification program meeting the requirements of appendix A, parts II and III, of the proposed rule. Also included
in this section is training in   30.7, 30.9, and 30.10, applicable sections of 10 CFR part 71, and some instructions
in applicable Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations as referenced in 10 CFR part 71 in addition to other
parts of NRC regulations. 


Section 34.43(b), which lists training requirements for radiographers' assistants, has been revised to require
training in   30.7, 30.9, 30.10, and parts 19, 20, 34, 71, and instructions in applicable DOT regulations
as referenced in 10 CFR part 71, in addition to the licensee's operating and emergency procedures. These changes are
to ensure that radiographers and radiographers' assistants are knowledgeable of the safety requirements applicable
to handling radioactive material in the conduct of radiography. In  34.43(b)(3) the option of providing an
oral test has been omitted. The proposed rule would only allow a written test to be given. Section 34.43(c) describes
a proposed requirement to conduct annual safety reviews of radiographers and radiographers' assistants. In the
current rule, periodic training is required but required topics to be addressed are not included. Because a number
of violations involving personnel overexposures have resulted from licensees' failures to provide adequate training,
the proposed amendment for annual safety reviews includes training on revised operating and emergency procedures,
new equipment, and safety issues.

Section 34.43(d) has been relocated from  34.11(d), and describes the requirements for routine inspections
of job performance for radiographers and radiographers' assistants. The proposed rule reduces the frequency of
these inspections from quarterly to annually. The NRC is proposing to reduce the frequency of inspections of job performance
for individuals regularly conducting radiographic operations. For individuals who have not performed radiographic
operations for more than six months, an inspection of their job performance would be required at the time of their next
participation in a radiographic operation. With several of the other requirements proposed in this rulemaking,
such as, certification of radiographers, and having at least two individuals at a temporary jobsite, the Commission
believes that the frequency of inspection of job performance can be reduced from quarterly to annually. 


Proposed  34.43(e) specifies that recordkeeping requirements can be found in  34.79. The requirements
for records are unchanged from the current part 34 except for the addition of records verifying the certification
status of radiographers. Proposed  34.43(f) contains the subjects currently listed in Appendix A of part 34.
Several additional requirements are proposed. These include: Pictures or models of source assemblies; training
in storage, control, and disposal of licensed materials; and pertinent Federal regulations, i.e., Department of
Transportation. A new  34.43(g) would be added which would allow licensees to continue to permit uncertified
individuals to act as radiographers for a 2-year period after the proposed rule becomes final. 


In  34.45, Operating and emergency procedures, minor changes were made to include procedures for source recovery
if the licensee intends to perform emergency source recovery. These were added because many of the steps in a source
recovery would be the same in any circumstance and, in the past, a number of personnel overexposures have occurred
during emergency source recovery operations because basic radiation protection precautions were overlooked.
Additional requirements are proposed for transportation procedures to include placarding of vehicles, and reference
to the DOT regulations. A number of violations have resulted from licensees failing to follow DOT regulations in the
transportation of radioactive material. Section 34.45(b) is proposed which specifies that the recordkeeping requirements
can be found in  34.81. Sections 34.89 and 34.91 specify that copies of current operating and emergency procedures
are to be maintained at field stations, permanent installations, and temporary jobsites, to ensure that adequate
documents are available where radiographic operations occur. 

Section 34.46, Supervision of radiographers' assistants, is unchanged from  34.44 of the current rule. 

In  34.47, Personnel monitoring, several changes are proposed. The existing requirement specifies that pocket
dosimeters have a range from zero to at least 200 milliroentgens. The proposed rule has dropped the term ``at least,''
to limit the range to be only from 0-200. This is to prevent the use of pocket dosimeters with very high ranges where
the users would be unable to properly determine their exposure. Use of pocket dosimeters with a range higher than 200
milliroentgens will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Additional requirements are proposed on the replacement
frequency for film and TLDs. The existing regulation does not specify the replacement frequency for film and TLDs.
The high intensity sources used in radiography necessitate frequent monitoring. Monthly replacement is judged
to be an appropriate frequency to adequately track an individual's exposure. With the new lower limits for occupational
dose, less frequent monitoring could result in a worker receiving an overexposure. 

Section 34.47(b) addresses the use of pocket dosimeters. A requirement to read dosimeters at the beginning and end
of each shift is proposed. This is added to ensure that the dose is correctly estimated. The existing regulation only
specifies a daily reading and does not provide sufficient instruction on how licensees should handle any readings
which remain on the pocket dosimeter after recharging. Because it is nearly impossible to recharge a pocket dosimeter
to zero, licensees must take a reading before and after use and determine the difference to determine the dose accurately.
Section 34.47(d) addresses an off-scale pocket dosimeter. The proposed rule would require that, in the case of a pocket
dosimeter being off-scale, the individual will not be permitted to work with licensed material until the RSO or a designee
of the RSO makes a determination of the worker's radiation exposure. The current rule requires that the worker's film
badge or TLD be sent for processing, but does not specify when the individual can return to work. The proposed revision
provides the criteria that must be met before permitting the individual to return to work. A provision is included
which will permit the individual to return to work when the circumstances are clearly known and justified by the RSO
that there was no possibility of overexposure. 

Section 34.47(e) is proposed to require that a worker cease work whenever a film badge or TLD is lost or damaged until
a replacement is available. This is added to ensure that there is a means to accurately determine the worker's radiation
dose.

Section 34.47(g) has a proposed revision to require alarm ratemeters to be capable of alerting the wearer regardless
of the environmental conditions. In a recent radiography overexposure incident, a licensee reported that a radiographer
who was wearing ear protection due to high workplace noise levels was overexposed because he was unaware that his ratemeter
was alarming. For use in high ambient noise areas, ratemeters could be supplied with either a vibrating alarm that
could be felt by the wearer or a small speaker built into hearing protectors to meet this requirement. NRC expects its
licensees to determine the need for alarm ratemeters that incorporate these additional protective measures.

In  34.49, Radiation surveys, there are several proposed changes. The existing regulation requires a survey
of the circumference of the radiographic exposure device and the guide tube. A number of violations of NRC requirements
have occurred due to a failure to comply with the requirement to survey the full circumference of the camera. In reviewing
the regulation, the NRC has decided to revise the survey requirements to specify that a survey be conducted of the radiographic
exposure device to determine that the sealed source has returned to the shielded position, and specify that the radiographer
conduct a survey as he/she approaches the guide tube to exchange film, reposition the collimator, or dismantle equipment.
The proposed rule places the responsibility with the licensee for ensuring that an adequate survey is conducted.
In the majority of cases, a survey of the radiographic exposure device's ports should be adequate to make this determination.
A proposed requirement to survey storage areas when radioactive material is initially placed in storage, during
each quarterly inventory, and whenever changes occur which could increase radiation levels, is added.

Section 34.51, Surveillance, is basically unchanged from  34.41 of the current rule. References to part 20
have been updated to reflect the proposed revisions in  34.33.

Section 34.53, Posting, is basically unchanged from  34.42 of the current rule except to incorporate current
references to part 20.



Subpart E_Recordkeeping Requirements



This subpart does not appear in the current part 34. This subpart is proposed to place all recordkeeping and notification
requirements in one location. Most of the recordkeeping requirements are unchanged from those contained in the existing
part 34. Proposed changes are discussed below.

Section 34.61, Specific license for radiography, requires the licensee to maintain a copy of the license until it
is terminated by the Commission.

Section 34.63, Records of receipt and transfer of sealed sources, is added to provide a record showing the disposition
of sources.

Section 34.65, Records of radiation survey instruments, is proposed as currently written in Section 34.24. Licensees
would be required to maintain calibration records for radiation survey instruments for 3 years after the record is
made.

Section 34.67, Records of leak testing and replacement of sealed sources is proposed as currently written in  34.25(c)
and requires licensees to maintain records of leak tests for 3 years after the record is made.

Section 34.69, Records of quarterly inventory is proposed as currently written  34.26 and requires licensees
to maintain records of quarterly inventories for 3 years after the record is made.

Section 34.71, Utilization logs, is proposed much as currently written in  34.27. This section would require
licensees to maintain utilization logs for 3 years after the record is made. The proposed rule has added several additional
pieces of information to the logs including the serial number of the device in which the sealed source is located, the
radiographer's signature, and the dates the device is removed and returned to storage. This information is necessary
in order to verify location of sources.

Section 34.73, Records of inspection and maintenance of radiographic exposure devices, storage containers, associated
equipment, and source changers, is proposed much as currently written in  34.28(b). This section requires
licensees to maintain inspection and maintenance records for 3 years after the record is made. The proposed rule would
specify the information that must be included in the inspection records: Date of check, name of inspector, equipment
inspected, any defects found, and repairs made.

Section 34.75, Records of alarm system checks at permanent radiographic installations, is proposed as currently
written in  34.29(c) and requires licensees to maintain records of alarm system checks for 3 years after the
record is made.

Section 34.79, Records of training, is proposed as currently written in  34.31(c) with proposed additional
requirements for maintaining records of radiographer certification and annual safety reviews. This paragraph
would require licensees to maintain records verifying radiographer certification status. For annual safety reviews,
the records would include copies of tests, dates administered, names of instructors and attendees, and the topics
covered. Under the proposed rule, records of the annual inspections would include a list of items checked, and any
non-compliances observed by the RSO.

<TEXT>
 

Section 34.81, Copies of operating and emergency procedures, is proposed as currently written in  34.32 and
requires licensees to maintain copies of emergency and operating procedures until the Commission terminates the
license.

Section 34.83, Records of personnel monitoring, is proposed as currently written in  34.33(b), and requires
licensees to maintain records of alarm ratemeter calibrations, pocket dosimeter readings, and operability checks
for 3 years from the date the record was made, and to maintain records of film badge or TLD reports until the Commission
terminates the license.

Section 34.85, Records of radiation surveys, is proposed as currently written in  34.43(d) and requires records
of the exposure device surveys for 3 years from the date the record was made.

Section 34.87, Form of records, is proposed as currently written in  34.4 and specifies how records must be maintained,
including permitting records to be stored in electronic media.

Section 34.89, Documents and records required at field stations and permanent installations, would be added to list
documents and records required at field stations and permanent installations. This section is necessary to ensure
that licensees have available sufficient records to demonstrate compliance with NRC regulations. Field stations
and permanent installations may be far removed from the home office. Therefore, records necessary to conduct operations
safely should be readily available. These records include a copy of the current license, copies of pertinent regulations,
copies of operating and emergency procedures, instrument calibration records, leak test results, inventory records,
utilization logs, training and survey records. These records are those required for licensees to safely handle radioactive
material, and are a subset of the records required at a licensee's normal place of business.

Section 34.91, Documents and records required at temporary jobsites and use or storage locations exceeding 180 days,
would be added to list documents and records required at temporary jobsites and locations where radioactive material
will be in use or storage for more than 180 days. This section is necessary to ensure that licensees have available sufficient
records to demonstrate compliance with NRC regulations and those records necessary to maintain safe operations.
The records listed are a smaller subset of the records required for a field station or permanent installation. These
records include copies of pertinent regulations, evidence of latest instrument calibrations, latest survey records,
shipping papers, and NRC license or Agreement State license if operating under reciprocity. These records are those
required for licensees to safely handle radioactive material.



Subpart F_Notifications



This subpart is basically unchanged from  34.30 with the exception of an additional requirement. Section 34.101(c)
would require licensees to notify the appropriate NRC regional office in writing before using or storing radioactive
material in one location for more than 180 days. This notification would be required within 30 days of exceeding the
180-day timeframe. This provision would be added to provide the NRC with information in a timely manner to permit inspection
of radioactive material at these locations.



Subpart G_Exemptions

This subpart addresses exemptions and is basically the same as  34.51 in the current part 34 with the exception
of minor wording changes to make it consistent with current language used in other parts of the rule. See 
 39.91. 



Subpart H_Violations 



This subpart addresses violations and is basically the same as  34.61 and  34.63 in the current part 34
with the exception of minor wording changes to make the sections referenced consistent with the proposed rule. 



Appendix A to Part 34 



This appendix is new. The requirements in appendix A to the current part 34 have been relocated to  34.43(f).
Part I of the new appendix A provides the proposed requirements for an independent certifying organization, and does
not apply to Agreement States choosing to become a certifying entity. Parts II and III of the new appendix A provide
the proposed requirements for certification programs and written examinations for a certifying entity, which would
include Agreement States. The proposed appendix A would not impose new requirements on NRC's radiography licensees.


NRC is proposing that an independent certifying organization would have to be a national society or association involved
in setting national standards of practice for industrial radiography or non-destructive testing to be recognized.
Membership in the organization could not be restricted because of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin
or handicap and the organization's certification program would need to be open to nonmembers. The independent certifying
organization would need to: 

(1) Be incorporated; 

(2) Have a permanent full-time staff; 

(3) Be nationally recognized; 

(4) Have a policy and decision-making review board; 

(5) Be governed by written organizational by-laws and policies; and 

(6) Have a viable system of financing its operations. 

An independent certifying organization would also need to have: 

(1) A committee to review and approve certification guidelines and procedures and to advise the organization's staff
in implementing its certification program; 

(2) A committee to review complaints against certified individuals; 

(3) Written procedures describing its certification program; and 

(4) An agreement to exchange information about certified individuals with the Commission and the Agreement States.


For a certification program to be acceptable, NRC is proposing that it include provisions requiring individuals
to receive training in the topics listed in  34.43(f), complete a written examination, complete a practical
examination or equivalent, and require a minimum period of on-the-job experience. The program would also have to
include procedures that ensure due process whenever an individual's certification may need to be revoked, suspended,
or restricted for willful or significant failure to comply with his or her employer's operating or emergency procedures,
or the Commission's or an Agreement State's regulations. 

For the written examination, NRC is proposing that it be: (1) Designed to test knowledge and understanding of the subjects
listed in  34.43(f); (2) written for a ninth-grade reading comprehension level; and (3) scientifically analyzed
to ensure that the questions are not biased or misleading. 



Agreement State Compatibility 



The rule will be a matter of compatibility between the NRC and the Agreement States, thereby providing consistency
between Federal and State safety requirements. With regard to basic radiation equipment specifications, standards,
and definitions identified as matters of Division 1 level of compatibility, the Agreement States will be expected
to adopt, essentially verbatim, the proposed part 34 standards and definitions into their equivalent regulations.
However, the NRC also recognizes that certain terms, such as radiographer's assistant, may not be used in present
Agreement State regulations. Continued use of alternative terms, such as ``trainee'' will be considered acceptable
so long as the underlying requirements of the position are consistent with those proposed by the Commission. The remainder
of the rule will be a Division 2 level of compatibility allowing the Agreement State regulators the flexibility to
adopt similar or more stringent requirements based on their radiation protection experience, professional judgments,
and community values. 

Appendix A of proposed 10 CFR part 34 provides the requirements for certifying entities to be acceptable to NRC. The
Commission reserves the right to make this determination and therefore this is a Division 4 item of compatibility.
Because it concerns a regulatory function that will be reserved for the Commission pursuant to 10 CFR part 150, the
Agreement States will not need to implement this provision of the proposed rulemaking. A new section proposed for
part 150 would make clear the Commission's intent to reserve this function and also to reserve the right to set minimum
radiographer certification standards. 

Agreement States that wish to develop radiographer certification programs would be expected to implement parts
II and III of the proposed appendix A. The definitions and the requirements for certification programs and written
examinations contained in this rulemaking must be the same for all NRC and Agreement State licensees to maintain consistency.
In practice, States that develop certification programs must develop regulatory language and regulations that
implement appendix A, parts II and III criteria. States would be permitted to include additional administrative
requirements (such as State-issued cards). States that do not develop certification programs would not be expected
to implement appendix A. NRC or an Agreement State must reciprocally recognize valid radiographer certifications
issued by either an independent certifying entity approved by the NRC or by an Agreement State certification program
meeting the requirements of appendix A, parts II and III, of the proposed rule. Agreement States would be expected
to submit their proposed program for NRC review and evaluation prior to implementing their certification program.

Implementation 



The Commission intends to have different implementation dates for particular requirements of this proposed rule.
The proposed requirements would become effective 90 days after publication of the final rule in the 

Federal Register

. For the proposed requirements in  34.41 to use, as a minimum, a two-person crew for radiographic operations
not conducted in a permanent facility, licensees would have 1 year from the effective date of the rule to comply. Licensees
would be required to affirm that all radiographers have met the certification requirements of 34.43(a)(1) within
2 years from the effective date of the rule. This would allow radiography licensees operating in NRC jurisdiction
2 years to obtain certification for their employees who act as radiographers. This requirement would include radiographers
employed by Agreement State licensees operating in non-Agreement States under reciprocity pursuant to 10 CFR 150.20.
The Commission notes that the State of Texas currently provides a 90-day grace period for non-Texas licensees operating
in that State under reciprocity (TRC 31.90). However, because this proposed rule will be a matter of compatibility,
the requirement for mandatory certification would apply to radiography licensees nationwide. 

Licensees would have one year from the effective date of the rule to comply with the additional training requirements
specified in  34.43(b). Licensees could consider combining this training with the annual safety review. 

For the proposed revision to  34.47(g) that would require alarm ratemeters be capable of alerting the wearer
regardless of environmental conditions, licensees would have 1 year to obtain or modify a sufficient number of additional
alarm ratemeters to meet anticipated needs. 

For use/storage locations not previously identified on the license (e.g., field stations, permanent radiographic
installations, and temporary jobsites exceeding 180 days) licensees must request amendments or notify the NRC,
as appropriate, by the effective date of the rule. Few amendment requests are anticipated. 

All current RSOs would be granted a two-year extension to meet the proposed additional RSO training requirements
specified in  34.42(a). 

The Commission requests that persons commenting on this proposed rulemaking particularly address any hardships
that would result if the proposed rule were adopted and also address any hardships that would result if the proposed
implementation schedule were adopted. The NRC is particularly interested in suggestions for alternative implementation
schedules. 



Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability 



The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's
regulations in subpart A of 10 CFR part 51, that the rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federal action; therefore,
an impact statement is not required. The revision of 10 CFR part 34 should have no environmentally significant impact
because radiography only involves the use of sealed sources, and no environmental impact will be involved. The environmental
assessment and finding of no significant impact on which this determination is based are available for inspection
at the NRC Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington DC. 



Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 



This proposed rule amends information collection requirements that are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of
1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). This rule has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval
of the information collection requirements. 

The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 108 hours per response, including
the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,
and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any
other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Information
and Records Management Branch (MNBB-7714), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555; and
to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB-3019, (3150-0007 and 3150-0120),
Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. 



Regulatory Analysis 



The Commission has prepared a draft regulatory analysis on this proposed regulation. The analysis examines the costs
and benefits of the alternatives considered by the Commission. The draft analysis is available for inspection in
the NRC Public Document Room at 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. 



Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 



The NRC has prepared an initial regulatory analysis of the impact of this proposed rule on small entities. A summary
of this analysis appears as Appendix A to this document. A copy of the analysis is available for inspection in the NRC
Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the analysis may be obtained
from Donald O. Nellis or Mary L. Thomas, Division of Regulatory Application, Office of Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Telephone (301)-492-3785. The NRC is seeking public comment on the
initial regulatory flexibility analysis. The NRC is particularly seeking comment from small entities (i.e., small
businesses, small organizations, and small jurisdictions under the Regulatory Flexibility Act) as to how the regulations
will affect them and how the regulations may be tiered or otherwise modified to impose less stringent requirements
on small entities while still adequately protecting the public health and safety. Those small entities which offer
comments on how the regulations could be modified to take into account the differing needs of small entities should
specifically discuss the following items: 

(a) The size of their business and how the proposed regulations would result in a significant economic burden upon
them as compared to larger organizations in the same business community.

(b) How the proposed regulations could be modified to take into account their differing needs or capabilities. 

(c) The benefits that would accrue, or the detriments that would be avoided, if the proposed regulations were modified
as suggested by the commenter. 

(d) How the proposed regulations, as modified, would more closely equalize the impact of NRC regulations or create
more equal access to the benefits of Federal programs as opposed to providing special advantages to any individuals
or groups. 

(e) How the proposed regulations, as modified, would still adequately protect the public health and safety. 
The comments should be sent to the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington,
DC 20555, Attn: Docketing and Service Branch. 



Backfit Analysis 



The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this proposed rule and, therefore, that
a backfit analysis is not required for this proposed rule. The proposed rule does not involve any provisions that would
impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).

apply to applications and licenses subject to this part. This rule does not apply to medical uses of byproduct material.




 34.3 

[Removed] 



5. Section 34.3 is removed. 

6. Section 34.2 is redesignated as  34.3, and the new  34.3 is revised to read as follows: 



 34.3 

Definitions. 





ALARA

 (acronym for as low as reasonably achievable) means making every reasonable effort to maintain exposures to radiation
as far below the dose limits specified in part 20 as is practical consistent with the purpose for which the licensed
activity is undertaken, taking into account the state of technology, the economics of improvements in relation to
state of technology, the economics of improvements in relation to benefits to the public health and safety, and other
societal and socioeconomic considerations, and in relation to utilization of nuclear energy and licensed materials
in the public interest. 



Annual safety review

 means a review conducted or provided by the licensee for its employees on radiation safety aspects of radiography.
The review may include, as appropriate, the results of internal inspections, new procedures or equipment, accidents
or errors that have been observed, and opportunities for employees to ask safety questions. 



Associated equipment

 means equipment that is used in conjunction with a radiographic exposure device to make radiographic exposures that
drives, guides, or comes in contact with the source, (e.g., guide tube, control tube, control (drive) cable, removable
source stop, ``J'' tube). 



Becquerel (Bq)

 means one disintegration per second. 



Certifying entity

 means an independent certifying organization meeting the requirements in Appendix A of this part or an Agreement
State meeting the requirements in Appendix A, parts II and III of this part. 



Collimator

 means a device used to limit the size, shape, and direction of the primary radiation beam. 



Control (drive) cable

 means the cable that is connected to the source assembly and used to drive the source to and from the exposure location.




Control tube

 means a protective sheath for guiding the control cable. The control tube connects the control drive mechanism to
the radiographic exposure device.



Exposure head

 means a device that locates the gamma radiography sealed source in the selected working position. (An exposure head
is also known as a source stop.) 



Field examination

 means a demonstration through practical application of the safety rules and principles in radiography including
use of all appropriate equipment and procedures. 



Field station

Appendix A_Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
for Revision of 10 CFR Part 34 


The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations governing industrial radiography.
The proposed rule would include additional safety requirements to enhance the level of protection of radiographers
and the public and would clarify the regulations so that licensees may have a better understanding of what is expected
in radiographic operations. The proposed rule includes a number of updated radiography regulations that have been
adopted by many Agreement States. The format of the radiography regulations would be adjusted to place requirements
into descriptive categories. 
The radiography industry in the United States consists of approximately 700 firms, employing about 20,000 individuals,
that perform radioisotope radiography either at fixed locations or at multiple temporary job sites. Of these firms,
approximately 200 are NRC licensees employing about 3,400 radiographers with an additional 2,000 radiography supervisors
and radiographers' assistants. This estimate is based on 1990 data for the number of individuals monitored for radiation
exposure to comply with 10 CFR Part 20. The industry uses an estimated 3,500 radiographic exposure devices that employ
either cobalt-60 or iridium-192 radioisotope sources. Roughly one-quarter of the firms conduct radiography at
a single location and the other three-quarters work at multiple locations generally referred to as temporary jobsites.


Approximately 90 percent are considered to be ``small entities'' under the criterion established in Section 605(b)
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980. Most of the radiography licensees are in the business of non-destructive
testing in which radiography represents only a part of their total income. A few small firms work only in radiography.
Much of the work in the field involves the inspection of welds in bridges, oil, gas, and other pipelines and in the steel
framework of commercial buildings under construction so that the success and viability of the industry is closely
tied to the economic health of the country. NRC surveys indicated that 76 percent of NRC radiography licensees had
annual receipts of over $500,000, and most of the remainder had annual receipts exceeding $250,000. 
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605 (b)), the Commission believes that this rule
may, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
The proposed revisions to part 34 are intended to provide additional safety requirements to enhance the level of protection
of radiographers and the public and to clarify the regulations so that licensees may have a better understanding of
what is expected in radiographic operations. The proposed rule includes a number of radiography regulations which
have been adopted by the Agreement States. 
The proposed revisions to part 34 can be grouped into major and minor impacts. Of the five major impacts, the proposed
requirement to have a second qualified individual at temporary jobsites may have a significant effect on small entities,
who would be more likely to use single-person crews. It should be recognized that under the current rule many licensees
already need to have, at least, two qualified individuals present at a temporary jobsite to maintain direct surveillance
of radiographic operations so as to protect against any unauthorized entry into the restricted area. Therefore,
this proposed requirement will only impact those operations where two individuals are not currently required. It
was assumed in the draft Regulatory Analysis that approximately 25 percent of NRC licensees who perform radiography
at temporary jobsites will need to hire and train additional staff to meet the proposed requirement. Other assumptions
used in the draft Regulatory Analysis were that each of these 50 licensees would need to hire 3-4 additional workers,
and that the cost of each assistant is $24,000 per year including benefits. 
The other major impacts include mandatory certification requirements for radiographers, additional training
for radiographers' assistants, a specific requirement for a Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) who meets certain training
requirements, requirements for permanent installation alarms, and additional requirements for alarm ratemeters.
The estimated costs for all of these changes are significantly less than the costs associated with adopting the two-person
rule. The initial costs to certify radiographers is approximately $4080. The initial costs for each licensee to provide
an additional eight hours of training for radiographers' assistants is approximately $1,200. The initial costs
to provide the additional training required to meet the proposed RSO requirements is $3,700 per RSO. The initial costs
to install alarms in permanent installations is estimated to be $3,000. The initial costs to purchase additional
upgraded alarm ratemeters is estimated to be $1800. The other proposed revisions which are of a minor nature, would
result in initial costs of $700-$800 per licensee. 


In addition, the proposed rule includes a reduction in the number of field inspections to be conducted, from quarterly
to annual. This reduction would lead to an estimated annual savings to each NRC licensee of approximately $16,000.
The proposed rule also includes a reduction in the frequency for radiation survey instrument calibrations from 3
months to 6 months. This reduction would lead to an estimated annual savings to each NRC licensee of approximately
$1400. 
Of these changes, the costs to adopt the two-person rule may have the most impact on a substantial number of ``small
entities''; however, the Commission believes that by requiring at least two qualified individuals to always be present
when radiographic operations are being conducted, there will be a significant increase in assurance that operational
safety measures and emergency procedures will be implemented effectively. The potential for a lowering of the risk
of unintended public exposure can be viewed as a potential cost savings to the industry. This proposed rule does not
duplicate or conflict with other Federal rules. No other alternative regulatory provisions that would minimize
the economic impact on small entities were considered.

Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; withdrawal. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable
to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. That action would have required modification of the automatic speed
brake control circuit. Since the issuance of the NPRM, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has reconsidered
its position on this safety issue and has concluded that the proposed modification is unnecessary to provide an acceptable
level of safety. Accordingly, the proposed rule is withdrawn. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to add a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable
to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, was published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 17, 1993 (58 FR 48616). The proposed rule would have required modification of the automatic speed brake
control circuit. That action was prompted by a report of failure of a hydraulic pressure line to a landing gear truck
tilt cylinder, which resulted in inadvertent deployment of the automatic speed brake. The proposed actions 
were intended to prevent inadvertent in-flight operation of the automatic speed brake system. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
Boeing requests that the proposal be withdrawn. Boeing notes that an AD was not 
issued when the Boeing service bulletin (referenced in the notice) was released in 1971 
because, at that time, neither Boeing nor the FAA considered that there was an unsafe 
condition addressed. Boeing has carefully examined the scenario of the incident of 
inadvertent deployment of the automatic speed brake that prompted issuance of the 
proposal, and finds that the incident did not occur during airline operations, but during a 
Boeing test flight. Specifically, the incident occurred while the airplane was conducting 
``touch and go's'' (which are not allowed in airline operations), which allowed the landing 
gear trucks to move out of the fully tilted position and initiated extension of the automatic 
speed brake. The pilot immediately recognized this and retracted the spoilers manually. 
(On Boeing Model 747 series airplanes equipped with triple slotted flaps, once the spoilers 
are retracted, the hydraulic flow redirects to the flaps immediately, and the lift is regained 
with minimal altitude loss.) Boeing points out that, during this incident, the reported 
6-foot loss in altitude occurred when the airplane was at around 100 feet. 
Finally, Boeing asserts that the reason for issuance of its service bulletin, containing procedures for installing
the modification of the automatic speed brake control circuit, was not only to add better protection for the circuit,
but to minimize the ``pitch up'' on the ground during landing. If the number four hydraulic system (which powers the
inboard spoilers) is inoperative, a ``pitch up'' would occur with outboard spoilers only. Boeing asserts that the
pilot can easily compensate for this condition by using his/her hand and the speed brake levers. 
Based upon the information discussed above, Boeing requests that the proposal be withdrawn. 

In response to these comments, the FAA acknowledges that issuance of the notice was based on a recommendation of the
Systems Review Task Force (SRTF). The SRTF has completed an extensive review process to ``* * * determine
possible design concepts that will provide alternative means of control of flight critical functions in the event
of total loss of all (normal) redundant systems which provide that control * * *'' The SRTF's charter
was specifically oriented toward identifying alternative means to ensure controllability of airplanes that have
lost all normal flight control functions, while maintaining basic airplane structural integrity. The SRTF recommended
incorporation of the modification described in Boeing Service Bulletin 27-2066, Revision 1, dated August
20, 1971, which was referenced in the notice. 
However, after further study of the Boeing service bulletin and its intent, the FAA has determined that failure to
incorporate the modification described in that service bulletin does not degrade the flight safety of the airplane.
While the modification adds logic to prevent uncommanded deployment on touchdown for airplanes equipped with auto
speed brakes, the effects of such deployment can be readily rectified by manually retracting the spoilers. Although
the installation of the proposed modification would add additional protection against inadvertent deployment
of the speed brakes and thereby minimize the pitch up on the ground as a result of such deployment, this condition does
not cause loss of hydraulics, does not affect airplane symmetry, and does not significantly degrade airplane flight
controllability. 
Upon further consideration, the FAA has determined that this condition does not present an unsafe condition that
would warrant the proposed mandatory corrective action. Accordingly, the proposed rule is hereby withdrawn. 
Withdrawal of this notice of proposed rulemaking constitutes only such action, and does not preclude the agency from
issuing another notice in the future, nor does it commit the agency to any course of action in the future. 
Since this action only withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking, it is neither a proposed nor a final rule and therefore,
is not covered under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979).

Discussion 



The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the Netherlands, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. The RLD advises that
several operators of Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes have reported finding cracks and broken spokes on certain
main wheel assemblies, part number 5008131-4. Investigation revealed that the manufacturer of these wheels
had discontinued a shot-peening procedure that was part of the manufacturing process prior to April 1991. Subsequently,
an improved shot-peening procedure on the mating surfaces of the inboard wheel subassemblies was introduced in October
1992. However, this procedure was not introduced on the outboard wheel subassemblies until February 1993. Consequently,
a number of units were produced that are prone to fretting and cracking due to a lack of shot-peening of the assembly
mating surfaces and bolt bosses. This condition, if not corrected, could result in loss of a main wheel assembly during
takeoff or landing.

Fokker has issued Service Bulletins SBF100-32-070, dated January 18, 1993, and SBF100-32-073,
dated September 10, 1993, which reference Aircraft Braking Systems Corporation (ABSC) Service Bulletins Fo100-32-46,
dated December 24, 1992, and Fo100-32-48, dated March 10, 1993, as the appropriate sources of service
information. The RLD classified these Fokker service bulletins as mandatory and issued Netherlands Airworthiness
Directive (BLA) 93-009/3 (A), dated June 1, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes
in the Netherlands. 

ABSC Service Bulletin Fo100-32-46 describes procedures for eddy current inspections to detect cracks
of certain demountable flange (inboard) wheel subassemblies; and, if no cracks are found, modification and subsequent
inspections of the subassemblies; and, if cracks are found, replacement of the subassemblies with serviceable parts.


ABSC Service Bulletin Fo100-32-48 describes procedures for eddy current inspections to detect cracks
of the bolt bosses of certain demountable flange (outboard) wheel subassemblies; and, if no cracks are found, modification
of the subassemblies; and, if cracks are found, replacement of the subassemblies with serviceable parts. 

This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.


Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require repetitive eddy current inspections to detect
cracks of certain demountable flange (inboard) wheel subassemblies and of the bolt bosses of certain demountable
flange (outboard) wheel subassemblies, and modification or replacement, if necessary. Replacement of a cracked
wheel subassembly terminates certain repetitive inspections required by this AD. The actions would be required
to be accomplished in accordance with the ABSC service bulletins described previously. 

The FAA estimates that 87 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
14 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection and modification, and that the average labor rate
is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $66,990, or $770 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed
requirements of this AD action. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposed rule would revise and update the procedures governing the imposition and adjudication of program sanctions
predicated on recommendations of State Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organizations (PROs). These
changes are necessitated by statutory revisions addressing health care fraud and abuse issues and the OIG sanctions
process. In addition, this proposed rule also sets forth new appeal and reinstatement procedures for practitioners
and other persons excluded by the OIG based on a PRO recommendation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 






I. Background





The Medicare Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization (PRO) program was established to ensure that
Medicare beneficiaries receive medical care that meets professionally recognized standards. Section 1156 of the
Social Security Act (the Act) sets forth specific statutory obligations imposed on practitioners and other persons
to furnish necessary services meeting professionally recognized standards. The statute also authorizes the Secretary,
based on a PRO's recommendation, to impose sanctions (exclusion from Medicare and any State health care program participation
as defined under section 1128 of the Act or a monetary penalty) on those who fail to comply with the statutory obligations.

Under the PRO sanction process, no practitioner or other person is recommended for exclusion or the imposition of
a monetary penalty until the PRO provides the opportunity for extensive discussion with the practitioner or other
person, and the opportunity to provide additional information. After receipt of a recommendation from a PRO, the
Office of Inspector General (OIG) excludes, or imposes a monetary penalty, only after a careful review of all the documentation
submitted and a separate determination that the practitioner or other person has violated the statutory obligations
to render only medically necessary and appropriate care that meets professionally recognized standards or has failed
to provide evidence of medical necessity and quality, and is unwilling or unable to comply with those obligations.
A practitioner or other person who is excluded from Medicare and any State health care programs as defined in section
1128(h) of the Act, or assessed a monetary penalty, on the basis of a PRO finding is entitled to administrative and judicial
review after the exclusion is imposed or the monetary penalty is assessed.




Recent Statutory Changes




A. Public Law 100-93




Prior to the enactment of Public Law 100-93 (the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of
1987), section 1156 of the Act set forth obligations of practitioners and other persons providing care to Medicare
patients to provide care that was medically necessary and appropriate that meets professionally recognized standards
of quality, and appropriately documented. It also provided for the exclusion from Medicare of practitioners and
other persons who, upon the review and recommendation of a PRO, were found to have violated those obligations. Section
6 of Public Law 100-93 extended those obligations to encompass all health care services for which payment may
be made under the Act, and not just Medicare. Further, the exclusion authority was extended to encompass violations
occurring in, and exclusions from, Medicaid, the title V Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, and the title XX Social
Services Block Grant programs.


B. Public Law 100-203


Section 4095 of Public Law 100-203, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1987, amended section 1156
of the Act to provide that an exclusion of a health care practitioner or other person who practices in a country of less
than 70,000 people or in a rural health professional shortage area (HPSA) cannot be effectuated until an opportunity
is provided for a preliminary administrative hearing. The purpose of this preliminary hearing is to determine whether
the practitioner's or other person's continued program participation, through the conclusion of the administrative
proceedings on the merits of the exclusion, would place beneficiaries at serious risk. In accordance with section
1156(b)(5) of the Act, unless the administrative law judge (ALJ) at the preliminary hearing determines that the practitioner
or other person will pose a serious risk to Medicare beneficiaries if permitted to continue furnishing such services,
the exclusion of a rural practitioner or other person may not be effectuated until they are given an opportunity for
an administrative hearing on the merits of the exclusion itself.


C. Public Law 101-508


Section 4205 of Public Law 101-508, OBRA 1990, set forth new statutory requirements with respect to PRO sanction
activities. Specifically, the statutory amendments require PROs, if appropriate, to offer a corrective action
plan to practitioners and other persons prior to making a finding under section 1156 of the Act; and require the Secretary
to consider, in determining whether a practitioner or other person is willing and able to comply with his, her or its
obligations, whether the practitioner or other person entered into and successfully completed a corrective action
plan prior to the PRO's submission of its recommendation and report to the Secretary.


II. Provisions of the Proposed Rule


A. Inclusion of the OBRA 1990 Provisions Relating to PROs


On January 29, 1992, the OIG published a final rule (57 FR 3298) setting forth amendments to the OIG's exclusion and
civil money penalty (CMP) authorities resulting from Public Law 100-93. Specifically, that final rule revised
 1004.130 of the regulations and deleted  1004.100(g) in its entirety to be consistent with the establishment
of a new part 1005_Appeals of exclusions, civil money penalties and assessments_which now governs ALJ hearings and
subsequent appeals to the Secretary for all CMP and other OIG sanction cases.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940228-1-00047 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940228-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The revisions to 42 CFR part 1004 of that final rule were meant only to conform the regulations to new statutory changes
resulting from OBRA 1990, and were not meant to be a comprehensive rewrite of part 1004. This regulation sets forth
a more complete and comprehensive rewrite of this part. Among other revisions:

 These proposed regulations would eliminate the current procedural distinction between ``substantial''
violations and ``gross and flagrant'' violations. This is an artificially created procedure that has no basis in
law or legislative history to provide a distinction between the two types of violations. Experience in processing
these cases has shown that the second meeting is just a repeat of the first meeting since the present regulations preclude
any new violations identified in the second meeting as serving as the basis for a sanction recommendation. Under these
proposed regulations, which are consistent with a recommendation from the Administrative Conference of the United
States, an opportunity would be provided for a meeting with the PRO and to provide additional information. The regulations
would also provide that any violations of the obligations that are identified during a corrective action plan period
would be used to support the PRO's recommendation regarding unwillingness or inability to comply with the statutory
obligations.

 These proposed regulations also codify the agreement reached among the American Medical Association, the
American Association of Retired Persons, the Health Care Financing Administration, and the Office of Inspector
General with regard to PRO physicians involved in the sanctions process. Under this agreement, no physician member
of the PRO panel may be in direct competition with, or have a substantial personal bias against, the practitioner or
other person being considered for sanction.

 Section 1004.30(e) of these proposed regulations would provide instructions to the PROs on the actions to
be taken when a physician relocates after receiving a sanction notice.

 Among the factors considered by the OIG in imposing an exclusion, in addition to the practitioner's or other
person's previous sanction record, are any prior problems that such person has had with the Medicare carrier or intermediary.
We are now proposing to include as an additional factor any prior problems that any State health care program has had
with such practitioner or other person.

 The current language of  1004.90(b)(1) concerning the OIG's review responsibilities (that would now
be designated as  1004.100(b)(1)) would be modified to state that the OIG will review the PRO report to determine
whether the PRO followed the ``regulatory requirements of part 1004.''

 The existing definition of the term ``physician'' appearing in  1004.1 would be deleted in order to conform
with the HCFA definition of this term.



B. Preliminary Hearings



These proposed regulations would amend part 1004 by allowing a practitioner or other person in specified rural areas
or counties of a specified population to request a preliminary hearing when notified of an exclusion from participation
in the Medicare program by the OIG as a result of a PRO recommendation under section 1156(b) of the Act. The preliminary
hearing would be solely on the issue of whether such practitioner's or other person's continued participation in
the program during the appeal to an ALJ would place program beneficiaries at serious risk.



Criteria for entitlement.

 Entitlement to such a preliminary hearing would apply to providers or practitioners for whom an exclusion is proposed
who practice in a rural Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) for their specialty or in a county with a population
of less than 70,000. For purposes of this entitlement, a practitioner's or other person's practice is where over 50
percent of his, her or its services are rendered.

Health professional shortage areas are designated by the Secretary and are defined in regulations at 42 CFR 5.2. Since
HPSAs are not specifically designated by rural or urban classifications, we are proposing that any HPSA not located
in a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) would be considered a rural HPSA for purposes of these regulations. Both
section 1886(d)(2) of the Act and regulations at 42 CFR 412.62(f) use these MSAs as the basis for determining an urban
area or rural area for computing Medicare prospective payment rates. Although Public Law 100-203 divided the
definition of urban into large urban and other urban areas, it did not change the differentiation between urban and
rural. Therefore, we are proposing to classify any HPSA not located in a MSA as rural.

There are seven different HPSA specialty categories. These HPSA specialty categories are described in current regulations
at 42 CFR part 5, Appendices A through G, and include primary medical care, dental, psychiatric, vision care, podiatric,
pharmacy and veterinary manpower. In determining eligibility for a preliminary hearing, we are proposing to use
these categories for all practitioners and other persons to whom they apply. For all practitioners not covered by
the specialty categories, we are proposing to use the ``primary medical care'' specialty category for determining
eligibility for a preliminary hearing. This means that any practitioner who practices a specialty other than those
identified in 42 CFR part 5 will be regarded as practicing in a rural HPSA only if that area is designated as an HPSA for
``primary medical care.''

The ``primary medical care'' category will also be used for all other persons and facilities, e.g., hospitals, with
the exception of those ``other persons'' qualified under the ``psychiatric'' manpower category.

Information on a county's population size would be obtained by the OIG from the responsible officials of that county.

<TEXT>
 



Timeframes for hearing

. The proposed regulations provide that a practitioner's or other person's request for a preliminary hearing must
be received within 15 days of receipt of an OIG exclusion notice. Once such a request is received, the preliminary hearing
is to be held and a decision rendered on the ``serious risk'' issue within 45 days. In those cases where the ALJ grants
a stay of the exclusion, a full hearing must be held and a decision rendered within six months. These timeframes developed
for the ALJs are intended to balance the right of a ``rural'' practitioner or other person to receive timely due process
against the OIG responsibility to ensure that substandard or unnecessary health care services are not provided to
program beneficiaries.


C. Sanctions Notification Process


Section 1156(b)(2) of the Act requires reasonable notice to the public of a sanction action being taken against a practitioner
or other person based on the PRO's recommendation. Under the current implementing regulations, when a sanction action
is taken by the OIG against a practitioner or other person, the OIG is required to notify the general public of such action.
This notice to the public specifically identifies: (1) The sanctioned practitioner or other person; (2) the obligation
that has been violated by this person; (3) the specific sanction action imposed; and (4) if the sanction is an exclusion,
the effective date and duration of this action.
While this public notification process has worked well in most instances, we believe the present publication procedure
may not always yield the most effective results of informing affected parties and program beneficiaries of a specific
sanction action taken under the program. As a result, we are considering permitting practitioners and other persons
to select an alternative method of notification.
These proposed regulations would amend 42 CFR part 1004 to offer sanctioned health care practitioners and other persons
the option of informing all their patients directly of a sanction action taken against them. If they select this option
and comply with its requirements in a timely fashion, this compliance would constitute public notice and would replace
the public notice currently published by the OIG. Among other things, a practitioner or other person opting for this
method of notification would be required to certify to the Department that they have undertaken to inform all their
patients of the action taken and, in the case of exclusion, that they will notify new patients before furnishing services.


Method of direct notification of patients by practitioner or other person

. We considered a variety of methods for practitioners and other persons to notify and inform patients of a sanction
action. For example, we considered having the sanctioned party (1) post a sign in his, her or its office; (2) verbally
communicate the information to patients when they called for an appointment or came to an office visit; or (3) send
written notification to each of his, her or its patients. After evaluating the options, we believe that the first two
methods indicated above would not effectively meet the proposed requirement that all existing patients be informed
within 30 calendar days since it is unlikely that all of these patients would make an appointment or come for an office
visit in the specified period. In addition, the Department would be unable to verify that the proper information had
been adequately conveyed to the patients if either of the first two notification methods were selected.
We, therefore, propose that each sanctioned practitioner or other person opting for this alternative notification
procedure alert both his, her or its existing patients and all new patients through written notification based on
a suggested (non-mandatory) model that will be provided to the sanctioned individual by the OIG. If the sanctioned
party is a hospital, the hospital would be required to notify all physicians having privileges at the hospital, as
well as post a sign in its emergency room, business office and in all affiliated entities regarding its sanction. (Practitioners
and other persons must also notify all new patients orally at the time an appointment is set to provide services, as
well as provide written notification to such patients at the time they arrive to see the provider for treatment or services.)
We believe that only through this method can the OIG assure that all patients are properly informed of a sanction action.

<TEXT>
 



Certification of notice to patients.

 If the sanctioned practitioner or other person chooses to use the alternative notification approach, he, she or it
would be given 30 calendar days from receipt of the notification from the OIG to return an OIG-prepared certification
form stating that: (1) He, she or it has informed each of their existing patients that a sanction has been imposed; (2)
if excluded from Federal programs, the program will not pay for items and services ordered, furnished or prescribed
by the practitioner or other person and that this ban will remain in effect until the practitioner or other person is
reinstated; (3) if excluded, he, she or it will provide this information, prior to providing services, to any new patient
seen until he, she or it is reinstated; and (4) he, she or it certifies to the truthfulness and accuracy of the notification
and the statements in the certification.



Non-election of the alternative method of notification.

 If the sanctioned practitioner or other person does not elect this alternative method of notification of informing
his, her or its patients and returning the certification form within the proposed 30-day period, the OIG would follow
its standard procedure for public notification, which consists of notifying the public directly of the identity
of the sanctioned practitioner or other person, the obligation that has been violated, and the effective date and
duration of any exclusion.



Failure to comply with alternative method of notification after electing such method.

 If the sanctioned practitioner or other person elects the alternative method of notification by returning the certification
form within the proposed 30-day period, but the OIG receives reliable evidence that such practitioner or other person
has not adequately informed his, her or its new and existing patients of the sanction, the OIG would follow its standard
procedure for public notification as described above. Once a practitioner or other person has elected the alternative
notification option by returning the certification form to the OIG, his, her or its failure to follow through and fully
comply with the notification requirements will be considered adversely at the time of his, her or its application
for reinstatement.

In order to ensure that patient notification is enforced and provided in a timely manner so that patients are not at
risk of receiving poor quality of care, we are soliciting comments on how best to enforce this provision. Under this
proposed approach, when the OIG learns through patient complaints or other forms that the practitioner or other person
has not fully complied, the IG at that point may additionally consider specific action to remedy the situation, such
as pursuing penalties for the filing of a false statement. Comments on this alternative notice process and on whether
this enforcement approach is reasonable and effective are specifically invited.

Notification of other entities

. Under this proposed revision, as under the current regulations, the OIG would continue its practice of notifying
hospitals at which a sanctioned practitioner has privileges, as well as State licensing boards and other entities,
of any sanction action taken.



III. Additional Information



A. Regulatory Impact Statement



The Office of Management and Budget has reviewed this proposed rule in accordance with the provisions of Executive
Order 12866. As indicated above, the revisions contained in this proposed rule are intended to revise and update administrative
procedures governing the imposition and adjudication of program sanctions, based on PRO recommendations, against
practitioners and other persons who violate the statute. We believe that the great majority of practitioners and
other persons do not engage in such prohibited activities and practices, and that the aggregate economic impact of
these provisions should, in effect, be minimal, affecting only those who have engaged in prohibited behavior in violation
of statutory intent. As such, these regulations should have no direct effect on the economy or on Federal or State expenditures.

In addition, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed regulation would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. While some sanctions and penalties may have an impact on
small entities, we do not anticipate that a substantial number of these small entities would be significantly affected
by this rulemaking. Therefore, since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would
not have a significant economic impact on a number of small business entities, we have not prepared a regulatory flexibility
analysis.



B. Response to Comments



Because of the number of comments we normally receive on proposed regulations, we cannot acknowledge or respond to
each letter individually. Rather, in preparing the final rule, we will consider all comments received timely and
respond to the major issues in the preamble of that rule.

returns the certification within the 30-day period but the OIG obtains reliable evidence that such person nevertheless
has not adequately informed new and existing patients of the sanction, the OIG will see that the public is notified
directly of the identity of the sanctioned practitioner or other person, the obligation that has been violated, and
the effective date and duration of any exclusion. 

(3) If the sanctioned practitioner or other person is entitled to a preliminary hearing in accordance with  1004.140(a)

The effect of an exclusion is set forth in  1001.1901 of this chapter.





 1004.130

Reinstatement after exclusion.





A practitioner or other person who has been excluded in accordance with this part may apply for reinstatement at the
end of the period of exclusion. The OIG will consider any request for reinstatement in accordance with provisions

Subpart F_Appeals




 1004.140

Appeal rights.





(a) 

Right to preliminary hearing. 

(1)(i) A practitioner or other person excluded from participation in Medicare and any State health care programs
under section 1156 of the Act may request a preliminary hearing if the location where services are rendered to over
50 percent of the practitioners's or other person's patients at the time of the exclusion notice is in a rural HPSA or
in a county with a population of less than 70,000.



(ii) Unless the practitioner's or other person's practice meets the definition for psychiatric professional, vision
care professional, dental professional, podiatric professional or pharmacy professional, the HPSA used by the
OIG for determination of entitlement to a preliminary hearing will be the HPSA list for primary medical care professional.



(iii) Information on the population size of a county in order to determine entitlement to a preliminary hearing will
be obtained by the OIG from the responsible officials of that county.


(2)(i) A request for a preliminary hearing must be made in writing and received by the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB)
no later than the 15th day after the notice of exclusion is received by a practitioner or other person. The date of receipt
of the notice of exclusion by the practitioner or other person is presumed to be 5 days after the date appearing on the
notice, unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary.


(ii) A request for a preliminary hearing will stay the effective date of the exclusion pending a decision of the ALJ
at the preliminary hearing, and all the parties informed by the OIG of the exclusion will be notified of the stay.




(iii) A request for a preliminary hearing received after the 15-day period has expired will be treated as a request
for a hearing before an ALJ in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.


(iv) If the practitioner or other person exercises his, her or its right to a preliminary hearing, such a hearing must
be held by the ALJ in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section unless the OIG waives it in accordance with
paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section.


(v) The ALJ cannot consolidate the preliminary hearing with a full hearing without the approval of all parties to the
hearing. 


(3)(i) The preliminary hearing will be conducted by an ALJ of the DAB in a city that the ALJ deems equitable to all parties.
The ALJ will conduct the preliminary hearing and render a decision no later than 45 days after receipt of the request
for such a hearing by the DAB. Date of receipt by the DAB is presumed to be 5 days after the date on the request for a preliminary
hearing, unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary. A reasonable extension to the 45-day period of up to
15 days may be requested by any party to the preliminary hearing and such a request may be granted upon concurrence by
all parties to the preliminary hearing. Such request must be received no later than 15 days prior to the scheduled date
of the preliminary hearing.



(ii) The only issue to be heard and decided on at the preliminary hearing is whether the practitioners's or other person's
continued participation in the Medicare and State health care programs during the appeal of the exclusion before
an ALJ would place program beneficiaries at serious risk.

<DOCNO> FR940228-1-00059 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940228-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(iii) In the interest of time, the ALJ may issue an oral decision to be followed by a written decision. 

(iv) In those cases where the ALJ has stayed an exclusion after a preliminary hearing, a full hearing must be held and
a decision rendered by the ALJ within 6 months. If, for any reason, the request for a full hearing before the ALJ is withdrawn
or dismissed, the exclusion for the period that has not been served will be effective 5 days after the notice of the withdrawal
or dismissal is received in the OIG headquarters. 

(4) The preliminary hearing decision is not appealable or subject to further administrative or judicial review.


(5) A practitioner or other person found at the preliminary hearing not to place program beneficiaries at serious
risk, but later determined to have been properly excluded from program participation after a full hearing before
an ALJ, is not entitled to have the exclusion stayed further during an appeal to the DAB. Exclusions in such instances
will be effective 5 days after receipt of the ALJ decision in the OIG headquarters. 

(6)(i) After notice of a timely request for a preliminary hearing, the OIG may determine that the practitioner's or
other person's continued program participation during the appeal before the ALJ will not program beneficiaries
at serious risk and waive the preliminary hearing. Under these circumstances, the exclusion will be stayed pending
the decision of the ALJ after a full hearing. The hearing must be held, and a decision reached, within 6 months. 

(ii) If the OIG decides to waive the preliminary hearing, the request for the preliminary hearing will be considered
a request for a hearing before the ALJ in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. 

(b) 

Right to administrative review. 

(1) A practitioner of other person dissatisfied with an OIG determination, or an exclusion that results from a determination
not being made within 120 days, is entitled to appeal such sanction in accordance with part 1005 of this chapter. 

(2) Due to the 120-day statutory requirement specified in  1004.100(e), the following limitations apply_


(i) The period of time for submitting additional information will not be extended. 

(ii) Any material received by the HHS after the 30-day period allowed will not be considered by the ALJ or the DAB. 

(3) The OIG's determination continues in effect unless reversed by a hearing. 

(c) 

Rights to judicial review. 

Any practitioner or other person dissatisfied with a final decision of the Secretary may file a civil action in accordance
with the provisions of section 205(g) of the Act.

 Proposed rule; notice of hearing; extension of the 
comment period.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On December 9, 1993, the Federal Transit 
Administration (FTA) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
(NPRM) for its Rail Fixed Guideway Systems State Safety 
Oversight program. FTA has decided to hold a public hearing in 
conjunction with an American Public Transit Association meeting 
which occurs after the close of the comment period announced in 
the NPRM. This document accordingly reopens the comment period 
and announces the public hearing.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Introduction 



FTA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in the 


Federal Register

 on December 9, 1993, at 58 FR 64856, concerning 
the creation of a State oversight agency that would develop 
certain procedures for overseeing the safety of rail fixed 
guideway systems. FTA has determined that a public hearing 
would help in the development of the final rule. FTA 
accordingly will hold the hearing in conjunction with a 
conference sponsored by the American Public Transit Association 
(APTA), which will be attended by State and local transit 
representatives. The hearing will be held on March 8, 1994. 
Because of this action, FTA is extending the comment period. 



Information on the Public Hearing 



The hearing will be held on March 8, 1994, in the Grand 
Ballroom_Salon D at the J.W. Marriott Hotel, 1331 Pennsylvania 
Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20004. It will begin at 8 a.m. 
(EST). 

Those interested in providing comments on the NPRM may respond 
in writing to the docket or participate in the public hearings 
and are encouraged to do both. 

FTA has established the following procedures to facilitate the 
hearings. Those wishing to participate in the public hearings 
should contact either Mr. Franz Gimmler or Mr. Roy Field by 
telephone at (202) 366-2896, by fax at (202) 366-3765, or in 
writing at the address in the 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT 

section at least three business days before the hearing is to be 
held or register with the FTA on the day of the hearing. Those 
contacting FTA at least three business days before the hearing 
is scheduled may request a particular time to testify. FTA 
will try to accommodate those requests. 


For those who have not contacted FTA at least three business 
days in advance, a registration desk will be available at the 
hearing site on the day of the hearing. Individuals may 
register beginning one hour before the hearing is scheduled to 
start. The registration desk will remain open until the hearing 
begins, after which FTA staff will try to accommodate late 
registrants. Time permitting, individuals will testify in the 
order in which they have registered. 

Those who request to testify may be given ten minutes to make a 
statement or present other relevant documents which will be 
included in the docket. FTA encourages those individuals to 
submit a written statement which will also be included in the 
docket. 

Those individuals in need of an oral interpreter should inform 
Mr. Gimmler or Mr. Field of that need also at least three 
business days before the hearing is to be held. Unless 
requested three business days before the hearing, an oral 
interpreter will not be provided. 

A hearing officer will preside over the hearing. The hearing 
officer may make a statement to clarify issues or facilitate 
discussion during the hearing . Any statements the hearing 
officer makes during a hearing are not intended to be and should 
not be construed as a position of the FTA with respect to the 
NPRM or any future rulemaking. 

The hearing will be recorded by a court reporter. A transcript 
of the hearing will be included in the official rulemaking 
Docket 92-D and be available for inspection. Any individual 
interested in a copy of the transcript of a hearing may contact 
the court reporter directly. 

The hearing is designed to solicit public views and information 
on the NPRM. Therefore, the hearing will be conducted in an 
informal and nonadversarial manner. However, the hearing 
officer may ask questions in order to clarify statements made at 
the hearing. To facilitate comment and get a broad 
cross-section of views, the FTA may ask some of those who 
register in advance to participate on a panel during the hearing.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary proposes to amend Subparts A and B of the 
Student Assistance General Provisions regulations and the Federal 
Pell Grant Program regulations to reflect changes made by the 
Higher Education Amendments of 1992 and the Higher Education 
Technical Amendments of 1993 to the Higher Education Act of 1965, 
as amended (HEA). These proposed regulations would seek to 
improve the efficiency of Federal student aid programs and, by so 
doing, to improve their capacity to enhance opportunities for 
postsecondary education. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In order to approve a postsecondary 
education institution to participate in the student financial 
assistance programs authorized by Title IV of the HEA (Title IV, 
HEA programs) and many other Federal programs, the Secretary must 
determine, in part, that the institution satisfies the statutory 
definition of an ``institution of higher education.'' Under the 
HEA and other Federal statutes, one element of that definition 
requires an eligible institution of higher education to be 
accredited or preaccredited by an accrediting agency recognized 
by the Secretary as a reliable authority as to the quality of the 
education or training provided by the institution. Another 
element requires an eligible institution to be legally authorized 
to provide an educational program beyond the secondary level in 
the State in which it is located. Thus, the statutory definition 
of an institution of higher education provides the framework for 
a shared responsibility among accrediting agencies, States, and 
the Federal government to ensure that the ``gate'' to the Title IV, 
HEA programs is opened to only those institutions that provide 
students with quality education or training worth the time, 
energy, and money they invest in it. The three ``gatekeepers'' 
sharing this responsibility have traditionally been referred to 
as ``the triad.'' While the concept of a triad of entities 
responsible for gatekeeping has had a long history, the triad has 
not always worked as effectively as it should to ensure 
educational quality, nor has it served as an effective deterrent 
to abuse by institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA 
programs. For several years, certain institutions participating 
in the Title IV, HEA programs have failed to provide students 
with education or training of an acceptable level of quality; 
they have also failed to treat students fairly. In addition, 
they have failed to meet acceptable standards of financial 
responsibility and administrative capability and to adequately 
protect Title IV, HEA program funds entrusted to them. The 
institutions that have engaged in these abusive practices are not 
restricted to a particular sector of higher education. Rather, 
the abuses have been found in all types of institutions 
participating in the Title IV, HEA programs, including those in 
the private non-profit and public sectors of higher education as 
well as those in the proprietary sector. 


At the same time, gatekeeping functions have not been 
carried out effectively. For example, some accrediting agencies 
have not taken sufficient care to ensure the quality of the 
education or training provided by the institutions or programs 
they accredit or to protect student interests when they accredit 
particular institutions or programs. Moreover, some States have 
also not taken sufficient care to ensure the quality of the 
education or training provided by the institutions they authorize 
or license to operate in the State or to protect student 
interests. Finally, the Federal government's management of its 
responsibilities to determine eligibility and to certify 
institutions to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs has not 
always been adequate to prevent abusive practices at institutions 
that participate in those programs.

Consequently, in the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, 
Public Law 102-325, (the Amendments of 1992), Congress provided for 
a new part H of Title IV entitled ``Program Integrity Triad.'' 
Under that part, States and accrediting agencies are required to 
assume major new oversight responsibilities, and States, 
accrediting associations, and the Secretary are linked to create 
a stronger and more coordinated evaluation of institutions that 
participate or wish to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
The Secretary believes that the most appropriate approach to this 
coordinated evaluation of institutions by the three components of 
the triad is a complementary one with each component focusing its 
evaluation on its obligations within the context of the HEA. 
Thus, the focus for accrediting agencies is the quality of 
education or training provided by the institutions or programs 
they accredit. For States, which already had responsibility for 
determining that institutions have the legal authority to operate 
within the State, the HEA added a new focus: reviewing 
institutions that trigger certain statutory review criteria. 
The focus of the Secretary's evaluation of institutions is the 
administrative and financial capacity of those institutions to 
participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. 

The statute allocates legal responsibility among the 
entities that compose the program integrity triad. While the 
specific statutory responsibilities for the three triad entities 
may overlap, when viewed as a whole the triad brings together in 
a coordinated fashion three different but very important aspects 
of institutional review. Within this statutory scheme, the 
Secretary has sought to assure that the gatekeeping system 
operates as efficiently as possible, with maximum integration 
among the three triad entities and without unnecessary burden on 
postsecondary institutions. In order to assist the Secretary in 
designing a final regulation that achieves these goals, the 
Secretary specifically requests comment on the following 
questions: 
(1) In several areas, the statute specifically requires 
each triad entity to evaluate an institution under the same or 
similar standards. For example, a SPRE and an accrediting agency 
may establish different standards for evaluating the financial 
responsibility of an institution or for evaluating the success of 
an institution's educational program. Thus, a reviewed 
institution would need to satisfy the SPRE's and the accrediting 
agency's standards even though those standards address the same 
areas. How should final regulations be structured to both reduce 
the burden on institutions and enable the triad entities to carry 
out effectively their statutory functions? 
(2) Should final regulations be more explicit in 
identifying levels, characteristics, or definitions for any of 
the assessment or review criteria that a triad entity is expected 
to consider in its evaluation of an institution? 
Subpart 1 of part H creates a new program, the State 
Postsecondary Review Program, or SPRP, under which State 
oversight of institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA 
programs is strengthened. Subpart 2 of part H establishes 
procedures and criteria under which the Secretary recognizes an 
accrediting agency as a reliable authority as to the quality of 
the education or training offered by institutions that the agency 
accredits. Lastly, subpart 3 specifies the procedures the 
Secretary uses to determine whether an institution meets the 
eligibility requirements and has the administrative capacity and 
financial responsibility to administer the Title IV, HEA 
programs. 
On January 24, 1994, the Secretary published in the 

Federal 
Register

 the NPRMs to implement the SPRP provisions in subpart 1 
of part H of the HEA (59 FR 3604) and the accrediting agency 
provisions in subpart 2 of part H of the HEA (59 FR 3578). The 
Secretary's publication of this NPRM prior to the publication of 
final regulations implementing the SPRP and accreditation 
provisions provides the Department of Education an opportunity to 
coordinate all comments received on the triad. 
The provisions of subpart 3 that pertain to the 
institutional eligibility requirements found in 34 CFR part 600 
have been addressed in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) 
published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 10, 1994, that 
proposes changes to 34 CFR part 600. This NPRM addresses those 
provisions of subpart 3 that pertain to subparts A and B of 34 
CFR part 668. Subpart A contains definitions applicable to the 
Title IV, HEA programs. Subpart B contains requirements for 
initial and continued participation in the programs. In 
particular, the following provisions in this NPRM address 
provisions of subpart 3: Proposed   668.15 and 668.16 delineate 
the standards for the evaluation of an institution's financial 
responsibility and administrative capability, respectively, as 
required by section 498(a), (c), and (d) of the HEA. Proposed 
 668.15 also codifies the definition of persons who exercise 
substantial control of an institution found in section 498(e) of 
the HEA. Proposed  668.12 addresses the requirements of section 
498(b) of the HEA that requires the Secretary to develop a single 
application form to be used by institutions that wish to apply to 
participate or to continue to participate in a Title IV, HEA 
program. Proposed  668.13 includes the provisions governing the 
requirement of financial guarantees from owners found in section 
498(e) of the HEA, addresses the provision that requires the 
Secretary to establish a schedule for the expiration of the 
approval of institutions to participate in the Title IV, HEA 
programs found in section 498(g) of the HEA, and codifies the 
provisions governing provisional certification of institutions 
found in section 498(h) of the HEA. Pursuant to sections 498(g) 
and (h) of the HEA, proposed  668.26 delineates the date that an 
institution's period of participation would end, when the 
institution's period of participation expires, or the 
institution's provisional certification is revoked.

The Amendments of 1992 amended the HEA in several areas 
relating to the participation of institutions in the Title IV, 
HEA programs. The Student Assistance General Provisions 
regulations contain requirements that are common to educational 
institutions that participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. The 
following list summarizes the major issues in this 
NPRM. 
 Each participating institution is subject to a new statutory 
definition of an academic year in which a full-time student 
(with respect to an undergraduate course of study), during a 
minimum 30-week period, must complete: At institutions that 
measure program length in credit hours, at least 24 semester 
or trimester hours or 36 quarter hours; or at institutions 
that measure program length in clock hours, at least 900 
clock hours. Section 668.2 proposes to clarify the terms 
used in the statutory definition of academic year. 
 The statute now mandates the definition of an eligible 
program for proprietary institutions of higher education and 
postsecondary vocational institutions, including 
``short-term'' programs (at least 300 but less than 600 clock 
hours) that would be eligible for the FFEL programs only. 
The statute requires that these programs must have 
completion and placement rates of at least 70 percent, 
measured in accordance with regulations. Section 668.8 
proposes methodologies for those measurements. The 
Secretary eventually may propose a single methodology (based 
on comments on this NPRM, regulations to implement the 
Student Right-to-Know Act, and other NPRMs) to be used 
wherever appropriate in regulations for the Title IV, HEA 
programs. In accordance with the statute, this NPRM 
contains further provisions to evaluate the quality of these 
programs, specifically a requirement proposed by the 
Secretary that a program may not exceed by more than 50 
percent the minimum number of clock hours required by the 
State for training in the recognized occupation for which 
the program prepares students, and a requirement that a 
program be in existence for at least one year before 
applying for eligibility under these criteria. 
 This NPRM proposes to add two new sections to codify 
procedures with regard to applications to participate 
initially or to continue to participate in a Title IV, HEA 
program (proposed  668.12) and procedures by which the 
Secretary certifies that an institution meets the standards 
in subpart B of these regulations and accordingly may 
participate in a Title IV, HEA program (proposed  668.13). 
Proposed  668.13 also includes proposed procedures whereby 
the Secretary codifies new statutory provisions governing 
provisional certification procedures for participation in a 
Title IV, HEA program. Provisional certification permits 
the Secretary to allow an institution that otherwise would 
not qualify to participate in a Title IV, HEA program to 
participate on a limited basis. The institution is subject 
to shorter periods of participation than a fully certified 
institution and does not have the right to the extensive 
appeal proceedings under subpart G of the Student Assistance 
General Provisions if the Secretary revokes the 
institution's provisional certification. Instead, as 
proposed by the Secretary in this NPRM, the institution 
would be offered a modified appeal. Further, an institution 
that is provisionally certified may be monitored more 
closely to the extent that the Secretary believes the 
institution warrants a greater degree of oversight. 
 Section 668.14 proposes to amend the regulations governing 
program participation agreements to include numerous new 
provisions added by the Amendments of 1992 and provisions 
previously prescribed by the HEA but not specifically 
spelled out in the regulations. This section also includes 
provisions proposed by the Secretary. This NPRM proposes to 
implement statutory requirements regarding disclosure of 
revenues and expenses for institutions that offer 
athletically related student aid. This NPRM would also 
address statutory requirements concerning incentive payments 
based directly or indirectly on success in securing 
enrollments or financial aid. 
 This NPRM proposes significant changes to  668.15 (currently 
 668.13) the section governing the evaluation of an 
institution's financial responsibility. The NPRM proposes 
to strengthen the factors used to evaluate an institution's 
financial responsibility and to reflect statutory changes, 
including the provision that requires that any standards 
developed for the determination of an institution's 
financial responsibility take into account any differences 
in accounting principles between for-profit and nonprofit 
institutions. For example, this NPRM proposes to require a 
for-profit institution to have a ratio of current assets to 
current liabilities of 1.25:1 and a nonprofit institution to 
have a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 
1:1. As the statute requires the establishment of cash 
reserves sufficient to ensure repayment of any required 
refunds, the NPRM also proposes to require each institution 
to maintain a minimum cash reserve of at least 10 percent of 
the institution's total deferred tuition income at the end 
of the institution's most recent fiscal year.

 This NPRM proposes, in  668.16 (currently   668.14 and 
668.15) to strengthen and expand the standards of 
administrative capability for participating institutions, 
addressing areas previously not regulated or for which there 
were only guidelines, such as: The maximum time frame 
allowed in the standards for satisfactory academic progress 
for completion of a student's educational program and the 
expansion of standards to include those general areas that 
will be reviewed by State postsecondary review entities 
(SPREs). The SPRE review areas are included because these 
areas may have a significant bearing on an institution's 
administrative capability and thus should be considered as 
the Secretary reviews the administrative capability of an 
institution. 
However, the NPRM does solicit comments on whether these 
additional proposed standards should be implemented across 
the board or be made applicable only to institutions that 
meet specific criteria or thresholds, e.g., institutions 
with short-term programs and institutions with a history of 
administrative problems. For example, this section of the 
NPRM includes the proposed requirement that an institution 
that offers a vocational program of less than two years in 
length that prepares students to enter recognized 
occupations must demonstrate that the borrower's increased 
annual expected earnings, based on completion of the 
training, will exceed the annual amount of Title IV, HEA 
program assistance received for the programs. 
 The provisions in proposed  668.17 (currently  668.15) 
governing default reduction measures reflect statutory 
changes made by the Amendments of 1992 and current 
departmental practices. The provisions in the Technical 
Amendments of 1993 that address institutional appeals of 
cohort default rates are not included in this NPRM and will 
be addressed separately. 
 As mandated by statute, all participating institutions are 
required to implement a fair and equitable refund policy. 
This statutory provision is similar to the requirement for 
fair and equitable refunds prescribed by the FFEL program 
regulations for institutions that participate in the FFEL 
programs. Section 668.22 proposes to clarify the terms used 
in the statutory definition of a fair and equitable refund 
policy. The NPRM also proposes to mandate a refund policy 
(Appendix A) that an institution must use to calculate a 
student's refund if the student is not entitled to a 

pro 
rata 

refund and an institution's State and accrediting 
agency do not have specific refund standards. In addition, 
because of a new statutory provision that specifies the 
order of return of refunds to the Title IV, HEA programs and 
other sources of aid without regard to the amount of aid 
received from State or private sources, this NPRM proposes 
to remove the fraction that is currently used to determine 
the portion of the refund attributable to the Title IV, HEA 
programs and that attributable to other sources of aid. 
 In accordance with the statute, institutions will now be 
required to have compliance audits every year rather than 
every two years, as required by current regulations. 
Section 668.23 proposes to allow institutions that do not 
pose a great financial risk to the Title IV, HEA programs 
(i.e., institutions that received less than $100,000 in 
total annual funding under the Title IV, HEA programs or 
have not had deficiencies identified in their most recently 
submitted audit reports) to submit audits biennially. 
Further, under this proposal, an institution would not be 
required to submit a compliance audit for any year in which 
the total Title IV, HEA program funds it received were less 
than $25,000. This section also proposes to extend audit 
requirements to foreign institutions. 
This NPRM also contains a proposed change to the Federal 
Pell Grant Program regulations. This NPRM proposes to implement 
section 487(c)(7) of the HEA that provides that an institution 
may offset the amount of Title IV, HEA program disbursements 
against liabilities or may receive reimbursement from the 
Department for those amounts if, in the course of any audit 
conducted after December 31, 1988, the Department discovers or is 
informed of any Title IV, HEA program assistance (specifically, 
Federal Pell Grant Program funds) that an institution has 
provided to its students in accordance with program requirements, 
but the institution has not previously received credit or 
reimbursement for these disbursements. Although this provision 
relates directly to the Federal Pell Grant Program and is 
proposed to be included in the Federal Pell Grant Program 
regulations, it is contained in Part G of the HEA and is subject 
to the negotiated rulemaking process explained below. Therefore, 
it has been included in this NPRM instead of the Federal Pell 
Grant Program NPRM, which was not subject to the negotiated 
rulemaking process.

Under new section 492 of the HEA, these proposed changes are 
subject to the negotiated rulemaking process, which includes a 
requirement for the Secretary to convene regional meetings to 
obtain public involvement in the development of proposed 
regulations. Accordingly, issues related to these proposed 
changes were discussed in meetings held in September 1992 in New 
York City; San Francisco; Atlanta; and Kansas City, Missouri. At 
these meetings, the Secretary provided the attendees with a list 
of issues to be addressed in these proposed regulations. A 
summary of the responses of the attendees is contained in the 
Appendix to this preamble. 
Groups that attended the regional meetings nominated 
individuals to participate in the regulation negotiations. The 
Secretary selected regulation negotiators from the names 
nominated and chose negotiators to reflect all the groups that 
participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, such as students, 
student financial aid administrators, and various types of 
eligible institutions. 
These proposed regulations also address statutory changes 
required by the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993, 
Public Law 103-208 (the Technical Amendments of 1993). Those areas 
affected by the Technical Amendments of 1993 are identified in 
the discussion of regulatory changes. The Secretary notes that 
the statutory changes required by the Technical Amendments of 
1993 are not subject to the negotiated rulemaking process of 
section 492 of the HEA. 


Regulatory Changes 


In accordance with section 492(b) of the HEA, the Secretary 
prepared draft proposed regulations and negotiated the provisions 
of that draft with negotiators. The great majority of the 
proposed changes do not reflect consensus reached at the 
negotiations (as consensus was rarely obtained). The Secretary 
has identified in the discussion of changes the areas where 
consensus was reached. 
The following discussion reflects proposed significant 
changes to the existing Student Assistance General Provisions 
regulations and the Federal Pell Grant Program regulations. 
Proposed changes are discussed in the order in which they appear 
in the proposed regulatory text. If a provision applied to more 
than one section or is included in more than one section, it is 
discussed the first time it appears with an appropriate reference 
to its other appearances. 


Subpart A_General
Section 668.1 Scope



The Secretary proposes to revise this section to remove 
vocational school from the list of what the term institution 
includes, because vocational schools are no longer eligible 
institutions under the HEA. The Secretary proposes to revise 
this section to reflect a listing of currently existing Title IV, 
HEA programs that would be subject to part 668. Programs added 
to the list would include the National Early Intervention 
Scholarship and Partnership, Presidential Access Scholarship, and 
Federal Direct Student Loan programs. The Income Contingent Loan 
Program, which no longer exists, would be removed from the list. 
These revisions reflect statutory changes made to the HEA by the 
Amendments of 1992. 


Section 668.2 General Definitions 



This section includes definitions proposed in NPRMs 
published on October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51716), and on February 17, 
1994 (in part II) (59 FR 8044). Those definitions are: 

designated department 
official, initiating official, output document, show-cause 
official, 

and 

third-party servicer. 

The Secretary will not 
repeat the discussion of those definitions here. 

The Secretary proposes to remove the definitions of 

Award 
year, Regular student,

 and 

State,

 because they would be included 
in 34 CFR part 600, governing institutional eligibility under the 
HEA. The Secretary proposed to move these definitions to 34 CFR 
Part 600 in the NPRM published on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6446). 

The Secretary is proposing technical changes to clarify the 
definitions of the current Title IV, HEA programs and to add 
definitions of the newly authorized Title IV, HEA programs to 
conform with statutory changes and for consistency with 
terminology used in the individual program regulations. The 
Secretary also proposes to make technical changes in the 
definitions of 

Independent student,

 to reflect statutory changes, 
and 

Enrolled, Valid student aid report, 

and 

Valid institutional 
student information report

 for consistency with other program 
regulations. The Secretary would move the definition of 


Participating institution

 from  668.81 to this section.

The Secretary is proposing to add or amend the following 
definitions: 


Academic Year 


Section 481(d)(2) of the HEA provides a definition of 


academic year

 to be used for all the Title IV, HEA programs. 
The statute specifies that in an academic year, a full-time 
student is expected to complete at least twenty-four semester or 
trimester hours or thirty-six quarter hours at an institution 
that measures program length in credit hours, or at least nine 
hundred clock hours at an institution that measures program 
length in clock hours. The definition delineates not only the 
minimum amount of work that a full-time student enrolled in an 
undergraduate educational program is expected to complete during 
an academic year, but also the minimum period of time over which 
the work in any educational program must be completed. 
The Technical Amendments of 1993 specify that this provision 
is only applicable with respect to an undergraduate course of 
study. The Secretary expects that institutions would continue to 
use their own academic standards, within the framework of current 
program regulations, to determine the amount of work full-time 
graduate and professional students are expected to complete over 
a minimum of thirty weeks of instruction. 
The minimum time period specified is thirty weeks of 
instructional time. The Technical Amendments of 1993 further 
amended section 481 of the HEA definition of 

academic year 

to 
provide that the Secretary may reduce, for good cause on a 
case-by-case basis, the 30-week minimum to not less than 26 weeks 
of instructional time in the case of an institution of higher 
education that provides a 2-year or 4-year program of instruction 
for which it awards an associate or baccalaureate degree. The 
Secretary has been unable to determine a definition of ``good 
cause'' that would justify using this authority. In addition, the 
Secretary is concerned that regulatory standards for those 
reductions would encourage many institutions to seek that 
treatment routinely and this implementation would result in the 
inequitable treatment of Federal student aid recipients from 
institution to institution. Further, the Secretary is concerned 
that widespread implementation would result in increased costs to 
the Title IV, HEA programs. Therefore, the Secretary has not 
proposed specific criteria to implement this technical amendment 
at this time. The Secretary requests comments on a definition of 
``good cause'' and ways of implementing this provision through 
regulations that address the Secretary's concerns. 
The Secretary has determined that the terms used in the 
definition of 

academic year

 must be clarified if the definition 
is to be well-understood and applied consistently. In 
determining what constitutes the 30-week period, the Secretary 
would count the period that begins on the first day of classes 
and ends on the last day of classes or examinations. For 
example, if an institution's first day of classes begins on a 
Tuesday, the first week of the academic year would begin on that 
Tuesday and end the following Monday. The institution would not 
begin counting with the Sunday preceding the first day of 
classes. 
The Secretary proposes that, for purposes of this 
definition, a 

week

 would be a consecutive seven-day period, as 
opposed to a five-day or six-day 

school week

 or seven individual 
days that are spread out over more than one calendar week. This 
approach would facilitate counting and readily accommodate 
institutions that start and end on different days of the week. 
For purposes of this definition, a 

week of instructional 
time

 would be any week in which at least one day of regularly 
scheduled instruction, examinations, or preparation for 
examination occurs. The Secretary recognizes that there may be 
certain weeks during an academic year during which fewer than 
five days of instruction occur. An institution should not be 
prohibited from counting those weeks in its 30-week period, 
provided at least one day of regularly scheduled classes occurs 
in each of those weeks. Further, this proposal would accommodate 
innovative educational programs such as those offered only on 
weekends or condensed schedules. At the same time, the proposal 
does not open the door to abuse, because regardless of the number 
of days of study that occur in any week, an institution must 
still provide enough instruction for a full-time student to be 
able to earn the minimum number of credit or clock hours needed 
to meet the definition. Finally, the Secretary would make clear 
that an institution cannot count, as instructional time, periods 
consisting purely of noninstructional activities, such as 
orientation, counseling, or vacations.

It should be noted that because the statute specifies both 
the amount of work expected to be completed and the minimum 
timeframe for an academic year for use in the Title IV, HEA 
programs, an institution might need to prorate or adjust 
Title IV, HEA program assistance for its students. For example, 
if the span of time from the first scheduled class at the 
beginning of the school year until the last examination at the 
end of the school year (excluding any weeks that consist 
exclusively of vacation time and all other activities not 
directly related to instruction, preparation for examinations or 
examinations) is twenty-five weeks, the institution would need to 
make adjustments in accordance with individual program 
regulations. Because summer sessions generally would not be long 
enough to constitute the equivalent of a complete semester or 
quarter, as they are under various current program regulations, 
Title IV, HEA program funds awarded for summer sessions would 
need to be adjusted to reflect the lengths of the sessions. A 
comprehensive discussion of the potential effect of this new 
definition of academic year on Federal Pell Grant calculations 
may be found in the NPRM on the Federal Pell Grant Program to be 
published shortly. 


Full-Time Student 


The Secretary believes it is necessary to have a definition 
of 

full-time student

 that is applicable to all Title IV, HEA 
programs. A definition of 

full-time student

 is needed because 
the definition of 

academic year

 is based, in part, on the 
workload of a full-time student, and because the term is used 
elsewhere for other purposes in part 668. The Secretary has 
proposed a definition of 

full-time student

 that would be based on 
a slightly modified definition found in the Federal Pell Grant 
and the campus-based program regulations. This definition also 
would incorporate parts of the definition of full-time student 
found in the FFEL program regulations. 
Generally, the Secretary proposes to define a 

full-time 
student

 as an enrolled student who is carrying a full-time 
academic workload (other than by correspondence) as determined by 
the institution under a standard applicable to all students 
enrolled in a particular educational program. In determining a 
student's workload, an institution would be permitted to include 
combinations of courses, work, research, or special studies that 
the institution considers sufficient to classify the student as a 
full-time student. Under this proposal, for an undergraduate 
student, an institution's minimum standard must equal or exceed: 
(1) 12 semester hours or 12 quarter hours per academic term in 
an educational program using a semester, trimester, or quarter 
system; (2) 24 semester hours or 36 quarter hours per academic 
year for an educational program using credit hours but not using 
a semester, trimester, or quarter system (or the prorated 
equivalent for a program of less than one academic year); or 
(3) 24 clock hours per week for an educational program using 
clock hours. 
This definition also provides for a method for determining 
full-time status for students enrolled in an educational program 
using both credit and clock hours. In order to evaluate the 
combined workload of the student, an institution could determine 
full-time status based on the sum of the proportionate workload 
carried in terms of credit hours and the proportionate workload 
carried in terms of clock hours. 
Further, an undergraduate student could be considered a 
full-time student if he or she undertakes a series of courses or 
seminars that equals at least 12 semester hours or 12 quarter 
hours in a maximum of 18 weeks. For cooperative education 
programs, an undergraduate student could be considered a 
full-time student if the work portion of a cooperative education 
program in which the amount of work performed is equivalent to 
the academic workload of a full-time student. 
The Secretary is particularly interested in establishing a 
minimum standard for a full-time academic workload for students 
who receive funds under the FFEL programs. Currently, for the 
purpose of those programs, an institution determines what a 
full-time academic workload is for these students. The Secretary 
recognizes that, because no minimum requirement for an academic 
workload of a full-time student exists under the FFEL programs, 
there is the potential for abuse of FFEL program funds through 
the use of the definition of an academic year. For example, an 
institution might have educational programs that are measured in 
credit hours and do not use academic terms. The institution 
could claim that it offers a full academic year's worth of work 
over a thirty-week period by giving a full-time student a small 
amount of instruction, which the institution claims to be 
equivalent to 24 semester or 36 quarter hours. This situation 
would result in the receipt of an inordinately large amount of 
FFEL program funds for the amount of work actually accomplished. 
The Secretary requests comments on whether, to further address 
this potential abuse, he should also establish a weekly minimum 
full-time workload for educational programs that are measured in 
credit hours but do not use academic terms.

Undergraduate Student 


The Secretary proposes to add a definition of 

undergraduate 
student 

to this section. Because the proposed definition of a 


full-time student 

makes reference to an 

undergraduate student 

and 
because the term 

undergraduate student 

is used in other places in 
part 668, the Secretary believes it is now necessary to define 


undergraduate student 

in this part. The proposed definition is 
the definition currently found in the Federal Pell Grant and 
campus-based program regulations. The Secretary proposes to 
define an 

undergraduate student 

as a student enrolled in an 
undergraduate educational program at an institution who has not 
earned a baccalaureate or first professional degree. The student 
would have to be enrolled in an undergraduate educational program 
that usually does not exceed 4 academic years, or a 4- to 
5-academic-year program designed to lead to a first degree. A 
student enrolled in a program of any other length would be 
considered an undergraduate student for only the first four 
academic years of that program. 




Section 668.8 Eligible Program




Admission Requirements 




These proposed regulations would remove the current 
provisions in  668.8(a)(1) (i) through (iv), which govern the 
educational qualifications of persons admitted into an eligible 
program. These qualifications are appropriately addressed in 
34 CFR 600.4 through 600.6, which govern the types of 
institutions that may be eligible to apply to participate in HEA 
programs. The educational qualifications of eligible students 
under the Title IV, HEA programs are also addressed in 
 668.7(a) (3) and (b). Therefore, these provisions are no longer 
needed for purposes of defining an eligible program. Note that 
other provisions governing the admission requirements needed for 
certain educational programs to qualify as an eligible program 
are discussed further below. 




Definitions 





These regulations would clarify a number of the terms used 
to determine an eligible program. Proposed  668.8(b)(1) would 
define the 

equivalent of an associate degree 

as either an 
associate degree, or the successful completion of at least a 
two-year program that is acceptable for full credit toward a 
bachelor's degree and qualifies a student for admission into the 
third year of a bachelor's degree program. This definition is 
needed because educational programs offered by a proprietary 
institution of higher education or a postsecondary vocational 
institution may qualify as eligible programs depending, in part, 
on whether the programs admit students with the equivalent of an 
associate degree (see the discussion on minimum program lengths). 
The definition is based on the provision in section 1201(a)(3) of 
the HEA that qualifies institutions offering 2-year transfer 
programs for institutional eligibility. 


For the same reason (that the terms are needed to establish 
the eligibility of programs offered by proprietary institutions 
of higher education and postsecondary vocational institutions_ 
see the discussion on minimum program lengths) the Secretary 
proposes to define 

week 

and 

week of instruction. 

For 
consistency, these terms would be the same as those proposed to 
be used in  668.2 for the definition of 

academic year. 

The terms 
are discussed in detail there. 

It is important to note that short-term programs (those 
offering less than 600 clock hours) that are eligible under 
current regulations because they met the definition of 

vocational 
school 

that used to be in section 435 of the HEA, will cease to 
be eligible when the final regulations governing programs become 
effective, unless those short-term programs are able to satisfy 
these regulations. Short-term programs that were not offered or 
were not eligible before July 23, 1992 can only become eligible 
when final regulations become effective.

Minimum Program Length 




The proposed regulations would also add requirements 
regarding the minimum length of an eligible program. Under 
section 481(b) of the HEA, a proprietary institution of higher 
education or a postsecondary vocational institution must, to be 
eligible, provide an eligible program, as defined in section 
481(e) of the HEA. Proposed  668.8(d) would implement that 
definition. The proposed definition would supplant the current 
regulatory definition of a 

six-month training program 

in 34 CFR 
600.2. 


Section 481(e) of the HEA provides for three types of 
eligible programs. The first type of eligible program is one 
that must provide at least 600 clock hours, 16 semester or 
trimester hours or 24 quarter hours of instruction offered during 
a minimum of 15 weeks. The program must provide undergraduate 
training that prepares a student for gainful employment in a 
recognized occupation. The program may admit as regular students 
persons who have not completed the equivalent of an associate 
degree. 


The second type of eligible program is one that must provide 
at least 300 clock hours, 8 semester hours, or 12 quarter hours 
of instruction offered during a minimum of 10 weeks. The program 
must provide training that prepares a student for gainful 
employment in a recognized occupation and be a graduate or 
professional program or admit as regular students only persons 
who have completed the equivalent of an associate degree. For 
the first time, this type of program may qualify for purposes of 
all Title IV, HEA programs, not just the FFEL programs, as under 
current regulations. 


The third type of eligible program would qualify for the 
FFEL programs only. It must provide at least 300 but less than 
600 clock hours of instruction offered during a minimum of 10 
weeks. The program must provide undergraduate training that 
prepares a student for gainful employment in a recognized 
occupation, and admit as regular students some persons who have 
not completed the equivalent of an associate degree. This type 
of program must also satisfy regulations of the Secretary 
governing placement rates, completion rates, and other criteria. 
These rates and criteria are discussed below. 




Qualitative Factors




Section 481(e)(2) of the HEA requires the third type of 
eligible program to have a verified completion rate of at least 
70 percent and a verified placement rate of at least 70 percent 
in accordance with the Secretary's regulations and to meet other 
criteria specified by the Secretary in regulations. Proposed 
 668.8(e) would implement these provisions. Proposed 
 668.8(e)(2) would require an institution to substantiate the 
calculation of its completion and placement rates by having its 
independent auditor who prepares its compliance audit report 
under  668.23 verify the accuracy of the calculations. The 
Secretary believes that the auditor's assurance of these 
calculations would be a reliable independent substantiation. The 
Secretary also believes it is practical for an auditor to check 
this information, inasmuch as he or she is already on site to 
perform the institution's required compliance audit. 


Section 668.8 would include formulas in paragraphs (f) and 
(g) for calculating the appropriate completion and placement 
rates. The Secretary believes a single methodology is desired, 
and invites comments in this area. The Secretary notes that an 
NPRM implementing the Student Right-to-Know provisions in section 
485(a) of the HEA, which addressed the calculation of completion 
or graduation rates, was published in the 

Federal Register

 on 
July 10, 1992 (57 FR 30826). The Secretary will be publishing a 
second NPRM for implementation of the Student Right-to-Know 
provisions shortly after publication of this NPRM to further 
address this calculation. The Secretary would also like to know 
if any proposals relative to the Student Right-to-Know Act 
regarding graduation and completion rate calculations should be 
used instead of the methods proposed here. The proposed formulas 
would be based on the following: 




Award Year




All calculations would be based on enrollments, completions, 
and placements during an award year. Thus, an applicable 
completion or placement rate would be the rate as it existed at 
the end of a particular award year. 




Calculation of Completion Rate




(1) An institution would base its calculation on the number 
of regular students who were enrolled in the program during the 
award year. The rate calculation is based on regular students 
because those students by definition intend to complete a 
program. The Secretary believes that inclusion of other students 
would not provide an accurate picture of the institution's 
completion rate. 


(2) The institution would subtract from the number of 
regular students the number of those students who, during that 
award year, withdrew from, dropped out of, or were expelled from 
the program and were entitled to and actually received in a 
timely manner in accordance with  668.22(i)(3) a refund of 100 
percent of their tuition and fees (less any permitted 
administrative fee) under the institution's refund policy. The 
Secretary believes that the inclusion of students who have 
received a 100 percent refund at an institution would unduly 
penalize the institution because these students would not have 
participated in the academic component of an institution's 
program. These students are excluded from the calculation 
because there would not be a loss of Title IV, HEA program funds 
to the Department of Education if the institution has refunded 
all tuition and fees. 


(3) The institution would subtract the number of students 
who were enrolled in the program at the end of that award year. 


(4) The institution would determine the number of regular 
students who, during that award year, received the degree, 
certificate or other recognized education credential awarded for 
successfully completing the program.

<TEXT>
 

(5) The institution would divide the number determined in 
item (4) by the total obtained under item (3) of this section. 
This proposed methodology instructs institutions to subtract 
from the denominator all students who were enrolled in the 
program at the end of the award year without regard to any time 
frame established for the completion of the program. In view of 
the fact that the Secretary is addressing the effect of the 
expectation that a student complete a program in a reasonable 
period of time on the calculation of completion rates in the 
forthcoming NPRM concerning the Student Right-to-Know provisions 
in section 485(a) of the HEA, the Secretary particularly invites 
comment on whether that expectation should also be considered in 
the calculation under this section. 


Calculation of Placement Rate 


(1) An institution would determine the number of students 
who, during the award year, received the degree, certificate, or 
other recognized educational credential awarded for successfully 
completing the program. The Secretary believes it would not be 
fair or accurate to include in the placement rate calculation 
those students who have not yet completed the program. 

(2) The institution would subtract from the number of 
students described in item (1) the number of those students who 
were employed by the institution either before or after their 
receipt of the degree, certificate, or other recognized 
educational credential. The Secretary believes that excluding 
employees of the institution will help curb abuse by those 
schools who may hire their own students in order to increase 
placement rates. The Secretary specifically requests comment on 
whether there are methods of distinguishing legitimate hiring by 
an institution of its graduates or students from hiring simply to 
improve the results of a placement rate calculation. 

(3) Of the total obtained under item (2), the institution 
would determine the number of students who, within 180 days of 
the day they received their degree, certificate, or other 
recognized education credential, obtained gainful employment in 
the recognized occupation for which they were trained or in a 
related comparable recognized occupation and, on the date of this 
calculation, are employed or have been employed for at least 13 
weeks following receipt of the credential from the institution. 

The Secretary believes that only students who have been 
placed within 180 days should be counted in the calculation. The 
Secretary proposes 180 days because it is consistent with the 
maximum period of time that a payment on a student's loan under 
the FFEL loan program may be deferred. These FFEL deferments 
include provisions for deferments for periods of unemployment. 
The Secretary considers this time frame to be adequate and 
reasonable, and provides ample time for an institution to place a 
student. 

The proposed regulation allows an institution to include in 
its placement rate a student who is placed in a recognized 
occupation which is comparable and related to the occupation for 
which the student has been trained. For instance, if a student 
were trained as an auto mechanic, he could be included in the 
placement rate calculation if he were placed as a boat mechanic. 
However, if a student completed a retail sales management 
program, he could not be included in the calculation if he were 
placed as a counterman at a fast food establishment. 

To be included in the placement rate, a student must have 
been employed for at least 13 weeks following graduation from the 
institution. The Secretary believes that this requirement will 
help stem abuse by institutions that may arrange to have students 
hired for short term jobs in order to boost placement rates. The 
proposed 13-week period is consistent with the period of time a 
student must be employed to be counted in the calculation of an 
institution's placement rate under the procedures delineated in 
current  668.15(g) for the appeal of an institution's loss of 
participation due to an unacceptable cohort default rate. 

As stated above, for purposes of this calculation, a student 
has up to 180 days after he or she receives his or her degree, 
certificate, or other recognized education credential to obtain 
gainful employment and then must be employed for at least 13 
weeks following receipt of the credential from the institution. 
The Secretary understands that, because of the total length of 
time allowed for obtaining and maintaining employment, an 
institution's calculations may not accurately reflect placement 
results for programs that are offered in the latter half of the 
award year. The Secretary specifically requests comments on ways 
to address this issue.

(4) The institution would divide the number of students 
determined in item (3) of this section by the total obtained 
under item (2). 
The institution must maintain documentation that each 
student described in item (3) above, obtained gainful employment 
in an occupation for which he or she was trained or in a related 
occupation. Examples of satisfactory documentation of a 
student's gainful employment include, but are not limited to_

 A written statement from the student's employer; 
 Signed copies of State or Federal income tax forms; and 
 Written evidence of payments of Social Security taxes. 
The Secretary believes that requiring institutions to 
collect this data will help curb abuse by institutions that may 
overstate their placement rates in order to achieve and maintain 
eligibility for short-term programs. Furthermore, to further 
avoid potential abuse, the Secretary proposes that in certifying 
the accuracy of an institution's placement rate, as required 
under  668.8(e)(2), the institution's auditor should review the 
above types of documentation collected by the institution to 
verify each student's inclusion in the placement rate 
calculation. 
The statute provides that the Secretary may prescribe other 
regulations to determine the quality of these programs. Under 
proposed  668.8(e)(1)(iii), to be eligible, programs less than 
600 clock hours in length may not exceed by more than 50 percent 
the minimum number of clock hours required for training in the 
recognized occupation for which the program prepares students, as 
established by the State in which the program is offered, if the 
State has established such a requirement. For example, if a 
State requires security guard students to complete only 300 clock 
hours of training, a security guard program in that state will 
not be eligible if it exceeds 450 clock hours. The Secretary 
believes this regulation will help curb abuse of the programs by 
preventing institutions from providing unnecessary training to 
students in order to receive additional Title IV, HEA program 
funds. 
Proposed  668.8(e)(1)(iv) requires that to be eligible, 
programs less than 600 clock hours must have been in existence 
for at least one full year. The Secretary believes that this 
time frame is necessary so programs may demonstrate the 
appropriate completion and placement rates. Institutions will be 
required under 34 CFR 600 to apply for eligibility of these 
programs after the one-year requirement is satisfied. 


English as a Second Language 


In addition to the elements already in place in the current 
regulations regarding English as a Second Language (ESL) 
programs,  668.8(j)(2) proposes that in order for an ESL program 
to be eligible, the institution must test each student at the end 
of the program to substantiate that the student has attained 
adequate proficiency in written and spoken English to use already 
existing knowledge, training or skills. The institution will 
also be required to identify the test it gives to the students 
and the basis for the judgment that the student has attained the 
adequate proficiency. This proposal, based on California law, 
was suggested during the negotiation process as a method to stem 
abuse by institutions which offer ESL programs. As established 
by the current regulations, ESL programs which qualify as 
eligible programs are eligible for purposes of the Federal Pell 
Grant program only. This provision remains unchanged. 


Subpart B_Standards for Participation in the Title IV, HEA 
Programs 
Section 668.12 Application Procedures 


The Secretary proposes to add a new  668.12 to codify the 
Secretary's current practices with regard to applications to 
participate or to continue to participate in a Title IV, HEA 
program. This section also would include proposed procedures 
whereby the Secretary codifies new statutory provisions governing 
applications to participate or to continue to participate in a 
Title IV, HEA program. 
Section 498(b) of the HEA requires the Secretary to develop 
a single application form to be used by an institution that 
wishes to apply to participate or to continue to participate in a 
Title IV, HEA program. The statute requires that this form 
provide for the collection of various information and 
documentation. First, the form must require an institution to 
provide sufficient information and documentation to determine 
that the requirements of institutional eligibility, 
accreditation, and the capability of the institution are met. 
Second, the form must require an institution to describe the 
relationship between a main campus of an institution and all of 
its branches. In particular, the form must require an 
institution to include a description of the student aid 
processing that is performed by the main campus and that which is 
performed at its branches. Third, the form must require an 
institution to describe all third-party servicers of the 
institution and supply a copy of any contract with a third-party 
servicer. Finally, the form must require an institution to 
provide any other information that the Secretary determines will 
ensure compliance with Title IV, HEA program requirements with 
respect to eligibility, accreditation, administrative capability 
and financial responsibility.

Currently, the Department of Education uses a single 
application form that addresses both institutional eligibility 
requirements (as found in 34 CFR part 600) and the standards for 
certification of administrative capability and financial 
responsibility. In recent years, although institutions filed a 
single application form, they received separate notifications of 
action from the Department: an institutional eligibility notice 
and a certification letter. This created confusion because some 
institutions misinterpreted the institutional eligibility notice 
also to be the notice informing the institution that it met the 
requirements for ``certification'' and that the institution was now 
able to participate in a Title IV, HEA program. 
In order to reduce confusion, the Secretary is now combining 
these notices of ``institutional eligibility'' and ``certification'', 
issuing one ``Institutional Approval Notice'' to an institution 
that meets the institutional eligibility and certification 
requirements. The Institutional Approval Notice advises the 
institution that it is an eligible institution, and is approved 
to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs listed in the Notice 
and indicated in the institution's program participation 
agreement. The effective date of approval, which is specified in 
the Institutional Approval Notice, is the date that the Secretary 
signs the institution's program participation agreement. 
Under current practice, an institution that wishes to 
participate in a Title IV, HEA program for the first time must 
first apply to the Secretary for a certification that the 
institution meets the standards for participation found in 
Subpart B of these regulations. A currently participating 
institution must apply to the Secretary for a certification that 
the institution continues to meet these standards under a number 
of conditions. 
First, the institution must apply for certification if the 
Secretary requests the institution to apply. The Secretary 
reserves the right to require a participating institution to 
apply at any time if the Secretary is concerned about the 
institution's continued participation in a Title IV, HEA program. 
Currently, the Secretary exercises this authority only rarely, 
and generally when the Secretary receives reliable information 
that could affect the institution's eligibility under 34 CFR part 
600 or the institution's financial responsibility or 
administrative capability under subpart B of these regulations. 
For example, if the Secretary receives information that an 
institution that does not grant degrees has received 
authorization from its State and accrediting agency to award 
degrees, the Secretary would require the institution to apply 
under 34 CFR part 600 to determine whether the institution 
satisfies the definition for a different type of institution and 
therefore might be eligible to apply to participate in HEA 
programs for which the institution earlier was not qualified. At 
the same time, the Secretary requires the institution to apply 
for recertification under this subpart. Similarly, if the 
Secretary receives reliable information that could affect whether 
an institution meets the factors of financial responsibility in 
this subpart, the Secretary requires the institution to apply for 
recertification. The Secretary does not intend to exercise this 
authority more frequently than under current practice. 
Second, a participating institution must apply for 
certification if the institution wishes to include in its 
participation a branch campus (as that term would be defined in 
34 CFR part 600) or another location that offers 100 percent of 
an educational program. Adding a branch campus or additional 
location that offers 100 percent of an educational program can 
have a great effect on the ability of an institution to continue 
to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary 
considers it is appropriate to scrutinize the effect of such an 
addition. In particular, the Secretary believes it is necessary 
to examine whether the institution has the financial resources 
and the administrative capability necessary to support such an 
addition.

A number of circumstances that could affect an institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program do not, under
the Secretary's current practice, require the institution automatically to apply for recertification under subpart
B of these regulations. Instead, these circumstances require the institution to notify the Secretary, and, if necessary,
provide specified information about the circumstances. These circumstances parallel many of those described in
34 CFR part 600 requiring the institution to notify the Secretary of changes that could affect the institution's eligibility.
Based on that notification and information, the Secretary determines whether the institution must apply for recertification.
If the institution need not apply, the Secretary notifies the institution under the provisions of 34 CFR 600.30 that
the institution continues to be eligible and participating. If the Secretary needs further information to make that
determination, the Secretary requests additional information from the institution or requires the institution
to apply for recertification. These procedures apply to the following circumstances: (1) A change in name, address,
or location of the institution or one of the institution's locations; and (2) the inclusion in an institution's participation
of a location that offers less than 100 percent but at least 50 percent of an educational program. In making the determination
that the institution must apply for approval, the Secretary takes into account the institution's ability to provide
adequately education or training at the location, including such factors as the percentage of an educational program
offered at the location and the financial and administrative capability of the institution. 

Under current practice and under these proposed regulations, a participating institution that wishes to include
in its participation a location that offers less than 50 percent of an educational program need not provide any notification
or application to the Secretary, unless the Secretary so requests. 

Third, a participating institution must apply for certification if the institution wishes to continue to participate
in a Title IV, HEA program following a change in ownership that results in a change in control. The regulations governing
institutional eligibility (34 CFR part 600) contain the requirements governing institutions that change ownership
resulting in a change of control. 

New section 498(g) of the HEA requires the Secretary to establish a schedule for the expiration of the approval of institutions
to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. Once this schedule is in place, each program participation agreement
will have a specific expiration date. To continue participating in the Title IV, HEA programs beyond the expiration
date of its program participation agreement, an institution will need to apply for and be granted approval for continued
participation. The Secretary will notify an institution well in advance of the expiration date of the institution's
program participation agreement that the institution must apply for and be granted continued participation. If
an institution does not apply for or is not granted approval for continued participation by the expiration date of
the institution's program participation agreement, the institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs
would expire on that expiration date. In this case, the Secretary may choose to provisionally certify the institution.
Provisional certification will be addressed in more detail later in this discussion. 

The proposed regulations would specify that an institution that applies for participation in any Title IV, HEA program
must apply on the form prescribed by the Secretary and provide all information and documentation requested by the
Secretary. The Secretary would like to clarify that an institution may be asked to supply additional information
in support of its application after its initial submission. This does not represent a change from current procedures.




Section 668.13 Certification Procedures 



Currently, the Secretary informally refers to the procedures by which the Secretary certifies that an institution
meets the standards in subpart B of these regulations and accordingly may participate in a Title IV, HEA program as
the ``certification procedures.'' The Secretary proposes to add a new  668.13 to codify these procedures.
This section also would include proposed procedures whereby the Secretary codifies new statutory provisions governing
certification and provisional certification procedures for participation in a Title IV, HEA program.

Clearly, an institution may not be certified unless the institution is eligible under the provisions of 34 CFR part
600. Further, this section would make clear that an institution could be certified only if the institution meets all
the applicable standards for participation in subpart B of these regulations. 

Finally, because the requirement that each time an institution seeks to begin to participate in a Title IV, HEA program
the specified individuals must complete ``precertification training'' provided by or approved by the Secretary
is a certification requirement, the Secretary proposes to move this requirement from the current  668.12 (Institutional
participation agreement) to this section. The Secretary proposes to amend this requirement to clarify that an institution
subject to this training requirement may not begin participation until the individuals have completed the training.
Under current regulations, the Secretary specifies that an institution may request an on-site review (instead of
electing to use the precertification training procedures) before beginning its participation. 

In accordance with section 498(g) of the HEA, the Secretary proposes to delineate the period for which an institution
may participate in a Title IV, HEA program. Generally, this period is the maximum of four years permitted by the HEA;
however, the Secretary may specify a shorter period as the Secretary deems necessary. 

Section 498(h) of the HEA permits the Secretary to provisionally certify an institution to participate in a Title
IV, HEA program in a number of circumstances. Provisional certification permits the Secretary to allow an institution
that otherwise would not qualify to participate in a Title IV, HEA program to participate. However, because such an
institution cannot meet all the requirements for ``full'' certification, the institution's participation would
be limited. For example, an institution that is provisionally certified could be monitored more closely to the extent
that the Secretary believes the institution warrants a greater degree of oversight. Further, in accordance with
the statute, an institution that is provisionally certified is subject to shorter periods of participation than
a fully certified institution. The Secretary notes that these limitations may vary, within the limits of the statute,
to address the specific circumstances of the institution. Finally, under the terms of provisional certification,
an institution will not have the right to a formal appeal under subpart G of this part if the Secretary revokes the institution's
provisional certification; instead, the Secretary proposes to offer the institution a modified appeal. These limitations
are addressed in more detail later in this discussion. 

Under section 498(h) of the HEA, the Secretary may provisionally certify an institution that: (1) Applies for initial
participation in any Title IV, HEA program; (2) has its administrative capability or financial responsibility determined
by the Secretary for the first time; (3) undergoes a change of ownership; (4) seeks to renew its certification and jeopardizes
its ability to perform its financial responsibilities by not meeting the factors of financial responsibility or
standards of administrative capability in proposed   668.15 and 668.16 (and whose participation has
been limited or suspended under subpart G of this part, or voluntarily enters into provisional certification); or
(5) is a participating institution that was accredited or preaccredited by a nationally recognized accrediting
agency on the day before the Secretary withdrew recognition of that agency. In addition, the Secretary is proposing
to add, to the list of institutions that may be provisionally certified, an institution that allowed its specified
period of participation to expire without reapplying and qualifying for participation in time.

The Secretary intends to use provisional certification as a 
mechanism for monitoring an institution that has not previously 
participated or one that has changed ownership, until it has time 
to establish a track record. In keeping with current practice, 
the Secretary does not intend to certify any initial applicant 
until it has successfully completed a period of provisional 
certification. Because many of the requirements for 
certification cannot be met until an institution has participated 
in the Title IV, HEA programs for a period of time, an initially 
participating institution would still have the opportunity to 
participate while establishing a record that demonstrates 
compliance with all of the proposed current standards for 
participation. The Secretary notes that certain factors of 
financial responsibility and administrative capability, such as 
requirements governing the appropriate handling of Title IV, HEA 
program funds and timely submission of required audits and other 
reports, cannot be judged until an institution has Title IV, HEA 
program funds to administer. In these cases, instead of 
certifying that an institution meets all the standards of 
subpart B, the Secretary certifies that an institution has 
demonstrated that it meets all the standards it can currently and 
that it will be able to meet all the standards in subpart B to 
qualify it for full certification within a period of time 
specified by the Secretary. Such an institution will receive a 
modified program participation agreement. For the same reasons, 
the Secretary also intends to use provisional certification for 
all institutions that undergo a change of ownership. Provisional 
certification would permit them to participate in Title IV, HEA 
programs while demonstrating over time that they can meet the 
standards for participation under the new ownership. 
In addition, the HEA provides that the Secretary may use 
provisional certification for institutions that are currently 
participating who will have their financial responsibility and 
administrative capability determined for the first time. Some 
institutions have been participating in the Title IV, HEA 
programs since before the establishment of the financial 
responsibility and administrative capability standards, and have 
never undergone a certification review. These institutions may 
be allowed the time necessary to establish that they can remedy 
any deficiencies found and meet the standards for participation. 
Finally, under the provisions of the Technical Amendments of 
1993, the Secretary may provisionally certify a participating 
institution that is undergoing a certification review if the 
Secretary believes that the institution is in a financial or 
administrative position that could jeopardize the institution's 
ability to perform its financial responsibilities under its 
program participation agreement. The Secretary may provisionally 
certify an institution under this provision if the institution's 
participation has been limited or suspended under subpart G of 
this part, or voluntarily enters into provisional certification. 
Thus, the Secretary proposes to use provisional certification as 
a probationary period for some participating institutions, if the 
Secretary determines that the institutions are capable of meeting 
the standards for full certification by the end of that period. 
For example, the Secretary might find that an institution 
applying for recertification on its own fails to meet one of the 
standards in proposed  668.15. If the Secretary determines that 
the failure could jeopardize the institution's ability to meet 
its financial responsibilities, such as the payment of refunds, 
the Secretary would provisionally certify the institution.

Finally, the Secretary proposes to use provisional 
certification for institutions that seek a renewal of 
participation in a Title IV, HEA program after the expiration of 
a prior period of participation in that program. The Secretary 
will examine the reasons for the lapse in participation to 
determine if additional safeguards are necessary for the 
institution to demonstrate that it is capable of resuming its 
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
The Secretary does not intend to certify an institution 
provisionally if the institution does not meet the financial 
responsibility standards, unless the institution provides the 
Secretary with certain additional financial guarantees of its 
ability to continue operating. The Secretary believes that 
additional financial guarantees are necessary in that situation 
to ensure that funds may be available to repay liabilities or to 
pay required refunds that could arise under the Title IV, HEA 
programs. The Secretary generally does not intend to certify an 
institution provisionally if the institution does not meet the 
general standards of financial responsibility or the exceptions 
to the general standards of financial responsibility under 
proposed  668.15(d) unless the institution meets three additional 
conditions. First, the institution would have to demonstrate to 
the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has sufficient 
financial and administrative resources to participate in the 
Title IV, HEA programs under a funding arrangement other than the 
Department of Educations's standard advance funding arrangement. 
For example, the institution could be funded through an escrow 
arrangement where an approved third party controls the 
institution's access to Title IV, HEA program funds. The 
Secretary believes that it is necessary for the Department of 
Education to have the added control over Title IV, HEA program 
funds provided by an escrow arrangement. Second, the institution 
would have to submit to the Secretary a letter of credit payable 
to the Secretary equal to not less than 10 percent of the Title 
IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during the last 
complete award year for which figures are available; the 
Secretary believes that 10 percent of an institution's Title IV, 
HEA program funds is the minimum necessary to ensure repayment of 
liabilities that may be identified during the institution's 
period of provisional certification. Further, the Secretary 
believes that the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds received 
by an institution during the last complete award year for which 
figures are available provides the most accurate indication of 
the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds the institution will 
use in the next award year. Third, the institution would have to 
demonstrate that it has met all of its financial obligations 
during the preceding two award years, including (but not limited 
to) the payment of required refunds and repayments to the 
Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs 
administered by the Secretary. The Secretary believes that an 
institution that could meet this proposed standard has 
established a track record for meeting its financial obligations. 
The Secretary notes that an institution that is applying for 
initial participation in the Title IV, HEA programs could not 
satisfy the proposed requirement that the institution submit to 
the Secretary a letter of credit payable to the Secretary equal 
to not less than 10 percent of the Title IV, HEA program funds 
received by the institution during the last complete award year 
for which figures are available because the institution would not 
have received any Title IV, HEA program funds during the last 
award year. The Secretary requests comments on a comparable way 
to determine the amount of a letter of credit for an institution 
that is applying for initial participation in the Title IV, HEA 
programs. 
The Secretary also would impose additional conditions on any 
institution that has not been considered financially responsible 
under proposed  668.15 at any time within the past five years, or 
if the institution is not considered financially responsible for 
one of the following reasons (as delineated in  668.15(c)(2)): 
(1) The institution has been limited, suspended, terminated or 
entered into a settlement agreement to resolve such an action by 
the Secretary or a guaranty agency within the preceding five 
years; (2) the institution had an audit finding during its two 
most recent audits, or a program review finding during its two 
most recent program reviews, that resulted in the institution's 
being required to repay an amount greater than five percent of 
the Title IV, HEA funds that the institution received for any 
award year covered by the audit or the program review; or (3) the 
institution failed to address satisfactorily any compliance 
problems identified in program review or audit reports based upon 
a final decision of the Secretary.

An institution in these categories could only be 
provisionally certified if, in addition to meeting whatever 
conditions the Secretary might reasonably require of a 
provisionally certified institution, the institution satisfied 
one of the following conditions. First, the institution, or one 
or more persons or entities that the Secretary determines to 
exercise substantial control over the institution, or both, would 
have to submit to the Secretary financial guarantees in an amount 
determined by the Secretary to be sufficient to satisfy the 
institution's potential liabilities arising from the 
institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
Second, one or more persons or entities that the Secretary 
determines to exercise substantial control over the institution 
would have to agree to be jointly or severally liable for any 
liabilities arising from the institution's participation in the 
Title IV, HEA programs and any civil and criminal monetary 
penalties authorized under Title IV of the HEA. The law permits 
the Secretary to impose these conditions on these institutions; 
the Secretary is announcing that he would always impose them, 
because these circumstances are indicative that extra protection 
is needed for the institution and their students to be permitted 
to benefit from the use of Title IV, HEA program funds. 

Generally, provisional certification may be granted for a 
period of no longer than three award years. In accordance with 
section 498(h) of the HEA, an institution that is applying for 
initial participation may be provisionally certified for a period 
of no longer than one award year. A participating institution 
that was accredited or preaccredited by a nationally recognized 
accrediting agency on the day before the Secretary withdrew the 
Secretary's recognition of that agency may be provisionally 
certified for no longer than 18 months after the date that the 
Secretary withdrew that recognition. The Secretary has the 
authority to specify a shorter period of provisional 
certification, as necessary. 

In accordance with section 498(h) of the HEA, the Secretary 
may revoke an institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA 
programs, at any time before the end of a period of provisional 
certification, if the Secretary determines that the institution 
is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program 
participation agreement. If the Secretary makes that 
determination, the Secretary would notify the institution of the 
determination by mail, unless the Secretary chooses more 
expeditious means, and revocation would take effect on date that 
notice is mailed. The institution would have to adhere to the 
requirements of proposed  668.26 which describes the consequences 
of revocation. 

Under the terms of the provisional certification, the 
institution does not have the right to a formal appeal under subpart G of this part before the revocation takes effect.
However, the Secretary proposes to allow the institution to submit a written request to reconsider the revocation
within 20 days of the institution's receipt of the Secretary's notice, 
after the revocation takes effect. The institution's request for 
reconsideration would have to include written evidence that the 
revocation is unwarranted. 

If the Secretary decides that the revocation is unwarranted, 
the institution's provisional certification would be reinstated 
in accordance with the time, terms, and conditions set out in the 
institution's original provisional certification. If, after 
consideration of the institution's submission, the Secretary 
denies the institution's request, the institution would not be 
permitted to reapply for participation in the Title IV, HEA 
programs before at least 18 months after the revocation or the 
expiration of any debarment or suspension of the institution, 
whichever is later. Generally, an institution whose 
participation has been terminated because the institution's 
provisional certification was revoked would be able to apply for 
reinstatement after 18 months. However, a debarment or 
suspension under E.O. 12549 or the FAR can last 3 or more years. 
This change would eliminate any doubt that a debarred or 
suspended institution may apply for reinstatement of the 
institution's participation during the period of a debarment or 
suspension. The Secretary will not accept any application by a 
debarred or suspended institution until the debarment or 
suspension has expired or been removed. 



Section 668.14 Program Participation Agreement. 



The Secretary proposes to redesignate  668.12 as  668.14. 
This section includes provisions dealing with third-party 
servicers that were proposed in the NPRM published on 
February 17, 1994 (in part II). The Secretary will not repeat 
the discussion of those provisions here.

Current regulations governing program participation 
agreements state only the basic terms of participation in the 
Title IV, HEA programs and the purpose and scope of the agreement 
between the Secretary and individual institutions. All of the 
specific provisions of the program participation agreement that 
are listed in section 487(a) of the HEA are not restated in the 
regulations. Instead, all the specific statutory provisions are 
included in the actual agreement signed between the Secretary and 
individual institutions. The Secretary proposes to revise this 
section of the regulations to include not only the new provisions 
of program participation agreements added by the Amendments of 
1992, but also those provisions previously prescribed by the HEA 
but not specifically spelled out in this section. The Secretary 
will specify which proposed changes have been made to this 
section as a result of the Amendments of 1992 to distinguish them 
from the provisions that the Secretary proposes to add that 
already existed under the HEA, but have not been codified in 
regulations. 

The additional provisions of program participation 
agreements enumerated in the HEA, as well as other changes the 
Secretary is proposing in order to clarify what the agreements 
cover and to reflect new procedures and statutory language, are 
described below. 

By providing a comprehensive list of the provisions of the 
basic program participation agreement in one section, thus making 
reference to all the provisions more convenient, the Secretary 
hopes to facilitate institutions' understanding of their 
responsibilities with respect to initial and continued 
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. 

The Secretary proposes to clarify the scope of the program 
participation agreement. By signing a program participation 
agreement, an institution indicates it understands that its 
initial or continued participation in the Title IV, HEA programs 
is contingent on compliance with the Student Assistance General 
Provisions regulations, the regulations of the specific Title IV, 
HEA programs in which the institution participates, and any 
additional requirements specific to that institution that the 
Secretary requires the institution to meet. Further, the 
Secretary proposes to make clear the long-standing practice that 
the program participation agreement applies to each branch or 
other additional location of the institution that meets the 
applicable requirements of the Student Assistance General 
Provisions, unless the Secretary specifies otherwise. 

The Secretary proposes to specify that by entering into a 
program participation agreement the institution agrees to comply 
not only with statutory and regulatory requirements, but also 
with any special arrangement, agreement, or limitation. The 
proposed expansion of this provision is necessary to make it 
clear that if it is to participate in a Title IV, HEA program, an 
institution must adhere not only to those requirements listed in 
the statute and regulations, but to any conditions of provisional 
certification, any limitation imposed on the institution to which 
the institution has agreed, or any other special arrangement that 
the institution makes pursuant to statutory or regulatory 
authority under Title IV of the HEA. The Secretary also believes 
it is necessary to clarify the Secretary's longstanding 
interpretation that to begin or continue to participate in a 
Title IV, HEA program, an institution must comply with each 
requirement applicable to that program, not just selected 
provisions. 

The Secretary proposes to add a clause specifically 
requiring that institutions that receive Title IV, HEA program 
funds under an advance payment method must time their requests 
for funds to meet immediate programs needs. The Secretary finds 
that this addition is necessary because, in the absence of this 
specifically stated requirement, too many institutions have drawn 
down funds in excess of immediate need, thereby adding 
unnecessarily to the Federal debt by causing the Treasury to 
incur interest costs on funds given to institutions that were not 
required to meet immediate needs. 

The Amendments of 1992, as clarified by the Technical 
Amendments of 1993, has removed the requirement that an 
institution may not request from or charge any student a fee for 
processing or handling the Federal Student Assistance Report, to 
conform with other statutory provisions of the Amendments of 1992 
that eliminated previous references to that report. The 
Secretary would remove the corresponding regulatory language from 
this section. No change has been made to the general requirement 
that an institution may not request from or charge any student a 
fee for processing or handling any application, form, or data 
required to determine a student's eligibility for, and amount of, 
Title IV, HEA program assistance. 

In accordance with the HEA, an institution must establish 
and maintain necessary administrative and fiscal procedures and 
records to ensure proper and efficient administration of Title 
IV, HEA program funds that the institution receives from the 
Secretary or from students. Further, the Amendments of 1992 
require that the institution provide, upon request and in a 
timely manner, information relating to its administrative 
capability and financial responsibility of the institution to the 
Secretary, the appropriate State postsecondary review entity 
designated under Part H of Title IV of the HEA, any applicable 
guaranty agency under the FFEL programs, and the institution's 
accrediting agency or agencies. The Secretary proposes to add to 
this list of agencies the institution's State agency with legal 
jurisdiction over the institution and, where appropriate, the 
State agency recognized by the Secretary for the approval of 
public postsecondary education as an alternative to accreditation 
or preaccreditation. The Secretary believes that it is important 
that these agencies also have access to information regarding an 
institution's financial responsibility and administrative 
capability.

The HEA requires that an institution must agree to comply with the Secretary's regulations governing financial responsibility
and administrative capability. Thus, the Secretary would specify that the institution must agree to comply 
with proposed-to-be-redesignated   668.15 and 668.16. 
The HEA requires that an institution must submit reports, as 
directed by the Secretary, to the Secretary, or, as appropriate, 
holders of student loans under the Title IV, HEA programs, 
containing information required to administer the Title IV, HEA 
programs. The Secretary considers this provision to be 
self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory requirement 
to the regulations without substantive modifications. 
The HEA requires that an institution may not provide any 
statement to a student or certification to a lender under the 
FFEL programs that qualifies a student for loans in excess of the 
annual and aggregate limits for which the student is eligible for 
in accordance with statutory requirements. The Secretary 
proposes to extend this requirement to include unsubsidized 
Federal Stafford loans. 
The HEA requires that an institution must comply with the 
consumer information requirements in subpart D of these 
regulations. The Secretary considers this provision to be 
self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory requirement 
to the regulations without substantive modifications. 
The HEA requires that an institution that advertises job 
placement rates as a means of procuring enrollment must make 
available to prospective students data necessary to substantiate 
the truthfulness of the advertisement. In addition, the 
Amendments of 1992 require that an institution make available to 
prospective students the relevant State licensing requirements 
for any job for which an institution's educational program is 
designed to prepare prospective students. The HEA also requires 
that an institution must inform all eligible borrowers under the 
FFEL programs of their eligibility for and the availability of 
State grant assistance. The Secretary considers this provision 
to be self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory 
requirement to the regulations without substantive modifications. 
In order to streamline these regulations, the Secretary 
proposes to list in one place in this section all the 
certifications that an institution must make to participate in a 
Title IV, HEA program. The institution would have to agree in 
its program participation agreement to provide these 
certifications. These certifications include the following: (1) 
That the institution has in operation a drug abuse prevention 
program accessible to any of the institution's officers, 
employees, and students; and (2) establishment of a campus 
security policy and disclosure requirements as required by 
section 485(f) of the HEA. The Secretary considers this 
provision to be self-explanatory and proposes to add this 
statutory requirement to the regulations without substantive 
modifications. 
The HEA requires that an institution make available to 
students who receive Title IV, HEA program aid based on their 
ability to benefit from the training offered a program proven 
successful in assisting those students to obtain the recognized 
equivalent of a high school diploma. The Secretary considers 
this provision to be self-explanatory and proposes to add this 
statutory requirement to the regulations without substantive 
modifications. 
The Amendments of 1992 require an institution to agree that 
it will not deny any form of Federal financial aid to any 
eligible student solely on the grounds that the student is 
participating in a program of study abroad approved for credit by 
the institution. The Secretary considers this provision to be 
self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory requirement 
to the regulations without substantive modifications. 
The Amendments of 1992 require that as a condition for 
participation any institution seeking to participate for the 
first time in the Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, and 
Federal SLS programs and any institution participating in those 
loan programs that changes ownership resulting in a change of 
control or changes its status as a main campus, branch campus, or 
an additional location, develop and implement for two years a 
default management plan. The Secretary proposes to allow 
institutions to develop and implement, or submit if required by 
the Secretary, a default management plan developed in accordance 
with the default reduction measures described in appendix D of 
current regulations to meet this requirement.

The Amendments of 1992 require that an institution must acknowledge the authority of the Secretary, guaranty agencies
and lenders as defined in 34 CFR part 682, nationally recognized accrediting agencies, the Secretary of Veterans
Affairs, and State postsecondary review entities designated under subpart 1 of part H of Title IV of the HEA, to share
with each other any information pertaining to the institution's eligibility for or participation in the Title IV,
HEA programs, or any information on fraud and abuse. The Secretary proposes to add to this list of agencies the institution's
State agency with legal jurisdiction over the institution and, where appropriate, the State agency recognized by
the Secretary for the approval of public postsecondary education as an alternative to accreditation or preaccreditation.

The statutory provision that governs the effect of fraud and criminal conduct by individuals, agencies, or organizations
affiliated with an institution was discussed in the NPRM published on February 17, 1994 (in part II) that deals with
third-party servicers. The Amendments of 1992 require that an institution must timely and satisfactorily complete
any survey conducted as a part of the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), or other Federal data
collection effort on postsecondary institutions. The Secretary considers this provision to be self-explanatory
and proposes to add this statutory requirement to the regulations without substantive modifications. The Amendments
of 1992 spell out the requirements imposed on participating institutions that offer athletically related student
aid. In order to participate in a Title IV, HEA program, an institution that offers athletically related student aid
must compile annually and have audited independently at least every 3 years, data on the revenues derived by the institution
from and expenses made by the institution for the institution's intercollegiate athletics activities. This compilation
must include data on total revenues and total expenses, revenues and expenses attributable to football, revenues
and expenses attributable to men's basketball, revenues and expenses attributable to women's basketball, revenues
and expenses attributable to all other men's sports combined, and revenues and expenses attributable to all other
women's sports combined. The compilation must also include data on the total revenues and operating expenses of the
institution. The institution is required to prepare the compilation within 6 months after the end of the institution's
fiscal year. The institution must make the compilation and, where allowable by State law, the required audits, available
for inspection by the Secretary and the public. For purposes of this compilation, the Amendments of 1992 define revenues
from intercollegiate athletics activities allocable to a sport to include without limitation gate receipts, broadcast
revenues, appearance guarantees and options, concessions, and advertising. Revenues such as student activities
fees or alumni contributions not allocable to a sport must be included in the calculation of total revenues only. The
Amendments of 1992 define expenses for intercollegiate athletics activities allocable to a sport to include without
limitation grants-in-aid, salaries, travel, equipment, and supplies. Expenses such as general and administrative
overhead that are not allocable to a sport must be included in the calculation of total expenses only. Generally, the
Secretary is proposing to restate the language of the statute in the regulations. However, the Secretary proposes
changes to conform with the NCAA's 1989 Financial Audit Guidelines. In addition to the statutory definition of what
is included in revenues from intercollegiate athletics activities allocable to a sport, the Secretary proposes
to specify that other conference distributions in addition to broadcast revenues would also be included. The Secretary
also proposes to specify that revenues such as investment interest income that are not allocable to a sport would be
included in the calculation of total revenues only.

The Amendments of 1992 provide that an institution may not 
impose any penalty on any student because of the student's 
inability to meet his or her financial obligations to the 
institution as a result of the delayed disbursement of a 
title IV, HEA program loan due to compliance with statutory and 
regulatory requirements for the Title IV, HEA programs, or delays 
attributable to the institution. The statute specifies that 
those prohibited penalties include the assessment of late fees, 
the denial of access to classes, libraries, or other 
institutional facilities, or the requirement that the student 
borrow additional funds. The Secretary proposes to clarify that 
the restriction that institutions may not require a student to 
borrow additional funds would apply only to funds for which 
interest or other charges are assessed. Therefore, this 
provision would not apply to any interest-free loans that the 
institution might require the student to borrow until other 
sources of aid are available. 
The Amendments of 1992 provide that an institution may not 
provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based 
directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or 
financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in any student 
recruiting or admission activities. An institution also may not 
provide such an incentive payment to any persons or entities 
engaged in making decisions regarding the awarding of student 
financial assistance. The statute specifies that this 
requirement does not apply to the recruitment of foreign students 
residing in foreign countries who are not eligible to receive 
Federal student assistance. The Secretary proposes to extend 
this provision to require that institutions also may not contract 
with entities that improperly provide, any commission, bonus, or 
other incentive payment as delineated in the statute. The 
Secretary believes that this provision is necessary to implement 
more rigid restrictions than were seen in the past on the 
practices of ``commissioned salespersons.'' The Secretary proposes 
to repeat the language of the statute with the addition of this 
change. The Secretary believes it is clear that this statutory 
requirement places rigid restrictions on the practice of 
recruitment, admission activities, and the awarding of student 
financial assistance. 
The Secretary is aware that some institutions pay incentives 
to recruiters or admissions office employees based on the success 
of those persons in enrolling students, provided that the 
enrolled students maintain satisfactory progress for and remain 
enrolled in the institution for a specified period of time. The 
Secretary considers this practice, which commonly is referred to 
as an incentive based on ``retention,'' to be an example of an 
activity that is prohibited by the statute. 
During the negotiated rulemaking sessions, the Secretary's 
negotiator requested further examples of prohibited activities. 
A non-Federal negotiator offered the following examples that the 
Secretary believes are not permitted by the statute. (1) An 
institution might offer payments or gifts to students for 
referring other prospective students for admission to the 
institution. (2) An institution might offer payments or gifts to 
students on the condition that persons whom the students referred 
to the institution were actually admitted and remained enrolled 
in the institution for a specified period of time. (3) An 
institution might present gifts to alumni, such as coffee mugs, 
sporting events tickets, or contributions in their name for 
referring students to the institution for admission. (4) An 
institution might pay bonuses to Directors of Admissions (or 
other management personnel) based on the number of enrollments 
received during a particular academic year or the number of 
students who, after enrolling, remained at the institution until 
all financial aid had been received. The Secretary specifically 
requests comments on these examples and others that might serve 
as useful guidelines in these regulations. 
The Amendments of 1992 require that an institution comply 
with applicable requirements established by all members of the 
``triad''; i.e., the Secretary, State postsecondary review 
entities, and nationally recognized accrediting agencies pursuant 
to part H of title IV of the HEA. The Secretary considers this 
provision to be self-explanatory and proposes to add this 
statutory requirement to the regulations without substantive 
modifications.

The Amendments of 1992 require that an institution comply 
with the institutional refund policy established in accordance 
with  668.22. The Secretary considers this provision to be 
self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory requirement 
to the regulations without substantive modifications. 
Finally, in addition to the statutory requirements for 
program participation agreements, an institution would have to 
agree to be liable for all improperly spent or unspent funds 
received under the title IV, HEA programs, including funds 
administered by a third-party servicer, and refunds that the 
institution or its servicer may be required to make. This 
provision was proposed and discussed in the NPRM published on 
February 17, 1994 (in part II) that deals with third-party 
servicers. 
The Amendments of 1992 and the Technical Amendments of 1993 
amended the HEA to require that an institution that has a change 
in ownership resulting in a change in control reestablish 
institutional eligibility and undergo a certification review 
before it may participate in any title IV, HEA programs. 
Therefore, the Secretary is proposing to remove the provision in 
current regulations that permitted the new participation 
agreement of an institution that changed ownership to be 
effective on the date of the change of ownership. Instead, under 
the proposed regulations, the program participation agreement of 
an institution that changes ownership would be effective on the 
date that the Secretary signs the agreement, just as any other 
new program participation agreement would. 
The Secretary proposes to specify that a program 
participation agreement expires if the institution's 
participation ends because: (1) The institution closes or stops 
providing educational programs for a reason other than a normal 
vacation period or a natural disaster that directly affects the 
institution or the institution's students; (2) the institution 
loses its institutional eligibility under 34 CFR part 600; (3) 
the institution's period of participation, as specified under 
 668.13, expires (that is, the four-year limit on participation, 
the limits on participation established pursuant to provisional 
certification, or shorter periods established by the Secretary), 
or the institution's provisional certification is revoked under 
 668.13; (4) the Secretary determines under  668.13(c) that the 
institution that is applying for certification has jeopardized 
its ability to perform its financial responsibilities by not 
meeting the factors of financial responsibility under  668.15 or 
the standards of administrative capability under  668.16 (in the 
case of an institution whose participation has been limited or 
suspended under subpart G of this part, or voluntarily enters 
into provisional certification); or (5) the Secretary receives a 
notice from the appropriate SPRE that the institution's 
participation should be withdrawn. 
These provisions would conform to the provisions in proposed 
 668.26 governing the end of an institution's participation in a 
title IV, HEA program. The first of these circumstances listed 
above is purely a clarification of existing practice. The last 
three describe circumstances mandated by the change made to the 
HEA by the Amendments of 1992. 


Section 668.15 Factors of Financial Responsibility 


The Secretary proposes to redesignate  668.13 as  668.15. 
This section includes provisions dealing with third-party 
servicers that were proposed in the NPRM published on 
February 17, 1994 (in part II). The Secretary will not repeat 
the discussion of those provisions here. However, this third-party servicer NPRM proposed to apply the general standards
of 
financial responsibility that are proposed in this NPRM to third-party servicers that contract with lenders or guaranty
agencies 
to administer any aspect of the title IV, HEA programs. 


General 


Section 487 of the HEA requires the Secretary to develop 
regulations to determine the financial responsibility of an 
institution as a part of the Secretary's determination that an 
institution is able to participate in a title IV, HEA program. 
Section 498 of the HEA mandates some of the standards that the 
Secretary must use in making a determination of financial 
responsibility. In general, section 498 of the HEA adopted, with 
modifications, the standards used by the Secretary in current 
 668.13 of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations. 
The Secretary proposes to require an institution to demonstrate 
that it is financially responsible under the proposed 
requirements in this section.

General Standards of Financial Responsibility 


In paragraph (b) of proposed  668.15, the Secretary would 
list general standards of financial responsibility. The first 
six standards are applicable to all institutions. Section 
498(c)(1) of the HEA specifies that an institution's financial 
responsibility must be determined based on whether the 
institution is able to provide the services that the institution 
claims to provide, to provide administrative resources necessary 
to comply with Title IV, HEA program requirements, and to meet 
all of the institution's financial obligations, including refunds 
and liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by 
the Secretary. These standards were adopted from current 
regulations and the Secretary proposes to continue to use them 
unchanged. 
The Secretary proposes to add to the list of proposed 
financial responsibility requirements for all institutions the 
requirement that an institution be current on any debt service 
payments. An institution normally has variable costs that 
fluctuate to meet the demand created by increasing or decreasing 
volume in those costs such as those for educational supplies and 
expenses and instructor salaries associated with educating an 
increasing or decreasing number of students. Debt service 
represents a fixed cost, such as mortgage or lease payments, to 
the institution that generally does not fluctuate with that 
volume. Thus, in a situation in which an institution is 
experiencing a decline in revenue due to a decrease in new 
enrollments, debt service would remain unchanged. The 
institution's flexibility to deal financially with the decline is 
reduced because management typically is unable to adjust the 
amount of payment for debt service without the consent of the 
creditor to whom the debt is owed. This situation places some 
degree of control outside the institution and beyond the scope of 
management's ability to deal with a deteriorating situation by 
reducing costs. Furthermore, a failure to meet debt service 
payments might precipitate collective action on the part of 
creditors to place the institution in an involuntary liquidation 
situation under Federal bankruptcy laws. 
Alternatively, a growing institution usually must take on 
more debt to fund its operations. Should the growth fail to 
continue, the institution might be unable to service the 
increasing debt service associated with its expansion. Thus, the 
Secretary believes an institution's failure to remain current on 
its debt service payments would be a strong indicator of the 
institution's inability to meet its financial obligations. 
Section 498(c)(5) of the HEA provides that the Secretary 
must establish requirements for an institution to maintain 
sufficient cash reserves to ensure repayment of any required 
refunds. Section 498(c)(5) of the HEA also provides for an 
exemption to this requirement which is discussed below under 
exceptions to the general standards of financial responsibility. 
The Secretary proposes to require an institution to maintain, at 
all times, a minimum cash reserve of at least 10 percent of the 
institution's total deferred tuition income at the end of the 
institution's most recent fiscal year for repayment of refunds. 
The cash reserve would have to be maintained in a cash reserve 
account and would have to consist of cash or cash equivalents, as 
those terms are defined in accordance with generally acceptable 
accounting principles. 
The Secretary believes that it would be unreasonable and 
unduly burdensome to require an institution to calculate the 
percentage of its cash reserve on a continual basis. 
Accordingly, the Secretary would require an institution to 
determine its total deferred income at the end of the 
institution's fiscal year and calculate the percentage based on 
that total. Once that percentage is determined, the institution 
would have to maintain that amount of cash reserve at all times 
until a new calculation is performed at the end of the 
institution's subsequent fiscal year. The calculation would be 
based on the institution's total deferred tuition income because 
deferred tuition income is an indicator of the value of services 
that the institution will provide for the coming year. The 
Secretary requests comment on a comparable way to determine the 
appropriate level for the cash reserve. 
Ten percent of this amount represents roughly the equivalent 
of a month's worth of an institution's revenue. The Secretary 
considers this amount a reasonable amount for an institution to 
have available to pay refunds in the event of the institution's 
precipitous closure. Generally, under this proposal, an 
institution would demonstrate its compliance with this provision 
once a year with the submission of the institution's audited 
financial statements. However, because an institution would be 
expected to maintain this cash reserve at all times, the 
Secretary would reserve the right to evaluate an institution's 
compliance with the requirement at any time. Finally, the 
proposal to allow cash equivalents to be included in the cash 
reserve is consistent with generally accepted accounting 
principles.

Finally, the Secretary proposes that, in order to be financially responsible, an institution must not have as part
of its audit report for its most recently completed fiscal year any of the following. First, the institution's audit
would not contain a statement by the accountant acknowledging substantial doubt about the institution's ability
to continue operating as a going concern. A ``going concern'' statement is a professional opinion rendered by an independent
certified public accountant, commenting on the institution's unstable financial condition and informing the reader
of the possibility that the institution may not survive the coming fiscal year. Although such a ``going concern''
statement is rarely issued, its presence attests to a concern held by the auditor that the institution's ability to
continue operating is uncertain. The Secretary believes that if an auditor, after close examination of the institution's
operations, concludes that such a statement is warranted, this is cause for the Department to protect its interest
in the Title IV, HEA program funds administered by the institution by requiring the institution to be subject to the
appropriate remedies for establishing financial responsibility, or to be subject to provisional certification
or the proceedings in subpart G of these regulations. 

Second, the institution's audit could not contain a finding of unauthorized use of donor restricted net assets to
meet current operating expenses. Unauthorized use of donor restricted net assets is a violation of the restrictions
placed on donations by the donor. Any donor-restricted funds are placed in an endowment fund to be used for specific
purposes, such as providing scholarships. Donor restricted net assets are most commonly found at nonprofit institutions.
The Secretary believes that if this money is transferred to current funds or total net assets for current operating
expenses, this is not only an indication of extremely impaired cash flow, but also a violation of an institution's
responsibility as a fiduciary of Title IV, HEA program funds. 

Third, the institution's audit could not contain a disclaimed or adverse opinion by the accountant. A disclaimed
or adverse opinion is an indicator that the auditor is unable to perform a complete audit of the institution with the
assurance that the audit presents a reliable presentation of the institution's financial condition. An audit submitted
with such a disclaimer or limitation would cause the institution's financial report to be rejected by the Secretary.
Such a statement in the auditor's report is an indication that the financial statement was not prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles as required in current regulations. 

The statute authorizes the Secretary to prescribe criteria for evaluating operating losses, net worth, asset to
liabilities ratios and operating fund deficits. The Secretary's goal in developing these proposed regulations
is to ensure that institutions are capable to operate as a fiduciary of Federal 
funds based on a sufficient financial base to properly provide education and meet the institution's financial obligations.
The Secretary, therefore, proposes to amend the current factors of financial responsibility section to establish
new financial responsibility standards as a means of further refining the above requirements. 
The Secretary proposes that, as in the past, failure to meet 
any one of the factors may result in initiation of an 
administrative proceeding to limit, suspend, fine or terminate an 
institution. Because some of these proposed factors are more 
stringent than those currently found in the regulations, the 
Secretary recognizes that an institution may need a sufficient 
period of time to adjust its operations in order to come into 
compliance with these proposed factors, if they are adopted. 
Under this proposal, the Secretary may provisionally certify 
institutions that did not meet these proposed standards to 
provide them with this additional period of time to comply, 
provided that the institution shows that it would have met the 
current standards. 
The Technical Amendments of 1993 require the Secretary to 
take into account an institution's total financial circumstances 
in making a determination of an institution's financial 
responsibility. The Secretary believes that these proposed 
factors evaluate, both directly and indirectly, the overall 
soundness of an institution's financial condition for the period 
covered by its audited financial statements and, therefore, take 
into account an institution's total financial condition as 
required by the Technical Amendments of 1993. 
The Technical Amendments of 1993 require that criteria 
developed for the determination of an institution's financial 
responsibility take into account any differences in generally 
accepted accounting principles, including required financial 
statements, that are applicable to for-profit and nonprofit 
institutions. Therefore, in addition to general standards that 
all institutions would be required to meet, the Secretary has 
proposed standards applicable specifically to for-profit, 
nonprofit, and public institutions that the Secretary believes 
indicate an equal level of financial responsibility. At the 
suggestion of some of the negotiators, the proposed specific 
standards of financial responsibility have been organized by type 
of institution; i.e., for-profit, nonprofit, and public.

Due to differences in legal and reporting entity, mission, 
and accounting format for nonprofit entities and for 
profit-seeking entities, there are differing tests of financial 
responsibility to be applied. Evaluating a nonprofit entity's 
overall financial condition is more complicated because there is 
no commonly accepted standard of acceptable financial condition. 
Generally, a measure of an institution's financial condition is a 
measure of an institution's solvency, or the ability of an 
institution to adequately cover its expenditures with revenues. 
In determining an institution's financial condition, the 
Secretary believes it is necessary to look at the institution's 
short-term solvency and long-term solvency, which is the ability 
of an institution to support an adequate level of services over 
the long run, withstanding economic disruption and meeting 
changing demands for services. 

With accounting for for-profit entities, analysis of 
financial statements provides an understanding of an institution's 
financial condition through comparisons of key financial ratios 
that measure the institution's ability to remain solvent while 
continuing to provide educational services at acceptable levels. 
Examination of financial information from nonprofit entities 
requires a review of other organizational factors that measure 
the ability of the institution to provide educational services 
using a larger and more complex source of funds. It is therefore 
necessary to differentiate the standards that are applicable to 
profit-seeking entities from the standards that are applicable to 
nonprofit entities. 

The Secretary will first address the specific standards for 
for-profit institutions. 

The Secretary proposes to require that a for-profit 
institution have, at the end of its latest fiscal year, a ratio 
of current assets to current liabilities of at least 1.25:1. One 
commonly used means of determining whether or not the institution 
has sufficient short-term solvency is use of the ratio of current 
assets to current liabilities. For the past fourteen years the 
Department has used a current assets to current liabilities ratio 
of at least 1:1 as an indicator of financial responsibility. 
This means that the institution has current assets at least equal 
to their current liabilities. In theory, this would indicate 
that an institution has sufficient resources to handle not only 
debt service, but also other liabilities for at least the coming 
fiscal year. The higher the amount of assets, the better the 
liquidity position of the institution and, therefore, the better 
the institution will be able to handle unforeseen economic 
conditions. The Secretary believes that the current 1:1 
benchmark offers little or no indication of adequate short-term 
solvency. A 1.25:1 benchmark has, therefore, been proposed for 
for-profit institutions. Cash is now required to be a component. 
The Secretary believes that the proposed increase in current 
assets will help to ensure that institutions have sufficient 
resources to provide worthwhile education and training. 

The Secretary is proposing a higher ratio of current assets 
to current liabilities ratio for for-profit institutions than for 
nonprofit institutions. The Secretary believes that a higher 
current ratio is necessary for for-profit institutions because 
they will be less likely, in the event of hampered liquidity, to 
draw on fund-raising as a source of cash. This rationale is 
discussed later as part of the discussion of the proposed ratio 
of current assets to current liabilities for nonprofit 
institutions. 

The Secretary proposes to exclude from the calculation of 
this ratio for for-profit institutions, uncollateralized loans 
receivable from owners and related parties. Uncollateralized 
related party loans are loans that have been made to affiliates, 
officers, or employees and have not been secured by tangible 
assets. In accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin 43 
(ARB43), chapter 3A, paragraph 6, the concept of current assets 
contemplates the exclusion from that classification of such 
resources as ``* * * (c) receivables arising from unusual 
transactions (such as the sale of capital assets, or loans or 
advances to affiliates, officers, or employees) that are not 
expected to be received within twelve (12) months''. In the event 
that certain financial statements present these types of loans on 
the balance sheet, they will be disregarded by the Secretary in 
computation of the current ratio. 

Further, because the proposed cash reserve requirement may 
cause a portion of the institution's cash reserves to be 
classified as a restricted asset, which would, under generally 
accepted accounting principles, be excluded from classification 
as current assets, the Secretary's proposal specifies that, for 
for-profit institutions, the cash reserves may be included in the 
institution's current assets in calculating the institution's 
current assets to current liabilities ratio. The Secretary 
believes that it is appropriate to permit for-profit institutions 
to treat the cash reserves as current assets because the funds 
are held for the benefit of the students, and inclusion of those 
amounts toward demonstrating a 1.25:1 current ratio still leaves 
the institution with sufficient unrestricted assets to pay all 
current expenses.

The Secretary proposes that a for-profit institution is 
financially responsible if it has not had operating losses over 
both of its two latest fiscal years that cause an operating loss 
exceeding 10 percent of the institution's previous year's 
tangible net worth for its latest fiscal year. While it may not 
be unusual for an institution to record a loss in any fiscal 
year, this loss is not harmful so long as the loss is not 
excessive, is not indicative of a deteriorating trend in the 
institution's financial condition, and the institution otherwise 
meets the factors substantiating its financial strength. The 
Secretary proposes to define an operating loss, for purposes of 
these provisions, as total net income minus extraordinary gains 
or losses, income or losses from discontinued operations, prior 
period adjustments, and the cumulative effect of changes in 
accounting principle, estimate, or reporting entity. The 
Secretary proposes that the calculation of tangible net worth 
shall exclude all assets defined as intangible in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. The Secretary believes 
this standard will measure whether a profit-seeking entity is 
operating from current cash flow to the extent possible. The 
aggregate residual effect of these activities on the 
organization's individual net assets is represented, along with 
any interfund transfers that may have taken place during the 
period. 

The Secretary proposes that a for-profit institution is 
financially responsible if it had, for its latest fiscal year, a 
positive tangible net worth. The Secretary proposes that, for 
purposes of this section, a positive tangible net worth occurs 
when the institution's tangible assets exceed its liabilities. 
Further, the Secretary proposes that the calculation of tangible 
net worth shall exclude all assets defined as intangible in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In 
applying this proposed standard, the Secretary could consider the 
effect of extraordinary gains or losses resulting from unusual 
and infrequent events, and could take into consideration the 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, estimate or 
reporting entity to the extent that such a change results in a 
more accurate representation of the institution's financial 
position in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. For the past fourteen years, the Department has had 
a standard for net worth that states that an institution is not 
financially responsible if it has a deficit net worth (i.e., the 
institution's liabilities exceed its assets.), a measure of 
long-term solvency. Therefore, an institution with a net worth 
of zero meets this current requirement. The proposed change from 
penalizing a deficit net worth to requiring a positive net worth 
is only a technical change in form that should affect few, if any 
institutions. 

By excluding all assets classified as intangible, all assets 
such as goodwill, organization costs, and 
covenants-not-to-compete, which have little market value in the 
determination of an institution's overall solvency will be 
eliminated in the calculation of net worth. In purchasing a 
business, the new owner pays an amount and allocates the market 
value to individual tangible assets in order to prepare financial 
statements. After applying the proper market value to the 
various assets, any residual amount that appears on the 
institution's balance sheet as goodwill, organization costs, or 
covenant-not-to-compete, is classified as an intangible asset. 

It is the Secretary's intent to identify those institutions 
that do not have sufficient capital assets. For example, 
businesses that operate on month-to-month leases with minimum 
capital actually invested in the business are a potential risk to 
students, and ultimately to the taxpayers in terms of possible 
collapse and bailout. In these cases loans to students are often 
automatically discharged in accordance with provisions in the 
HEA. Preventing institutions that have no real assets from 
participating in the programs should enhance the gatekeeping 
process.

In the case of nonprofit institutions, the Secretary has 
developed standards in accordance with Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 117 (FAS 117) that was issued in June 
1993 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). FAS 117 
altered the reporting format for not-for-profit organizations 
after the negotiated rulemaking process was already well 
underway. FAS 117 is effective for annual financial statements 
issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994, except 
for organizations with less than $5 million in total assets and 
less than $1 million in annual expenses. For those 
organizations, the Statement is effective for fiscal years 
beginning after December 15, 1995 with earlier application 
encouraged. 

The Secretary proposes to require a nonprofit institution to 
prepare a classified statement of financial position in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to 
provide the Secretary with the financial information necessary to 
determine the institution's financial responsibility under these 
proposed regulations. The Secretary proposes that, 
alternatively, a nonprofit institution could provide this 
information as footnotes to the audit. Although FAS 117 does not 
require a nonprofit institution to submit a classified statement 
of financial position prior to published implementation dates, it 
does not prohibit the institution from doing so. The Secretary 
notes that a financial statement that is not classified is not 
structured to provide the financial information necessary for the 
Secretary to determine an institution's compliance with these 
proposed regulations; however, the information could be included 
as footnotes to the audit. 

The Secretary proposes that a nonprofit institution is not 
financially responsible if it cannot demonstrate, at the end of 
its latest fiscal year, a ratio of current assets to current 
liabilities of at least 1:1. The Secretary proposes to not 
permit a nonprofit institution to include the cash reserves in 
the institution's current assets. The Secretary believes that, 
because the proposed current assets to current liabilities ratio 
for a nonprofit institution is 1:1, if the institution used 
designated reserve funds to meet this ratio, there would be no 
assurance of solvency. 

The importance of a higher current ratio for for-profit 
institutions lies in the fact that they are not as likely to be 
able to draw on fund raising as a source of cash in the event of 
hampered liquidity because donors are less likely to contribute 
funds to a for-profit institution where those contributions would 
not be tax deductible. Many nonprofit institutions have 
sufficient support in the community and from friends and alumni 
who are willing to donate to the institution. The cash intake of 
for-profit institutions is therefore limited to cash generated 
through profitability, whereas nonprofit institutions have an 
additional source of cash. Endowments, even when restricted to 
functions such as providing scholarships, are awarded and may be 
taken into cash from operations. Consistent profitable 
operations result in a better liquidity position for for-profit 
institutions, whereas consistent profitable operations are not 
necessary for a nonprofit to remain viable. In addition, it is 
inherent in a nonprofit institution that its final cash position 
not reflect a profit. In the nonprofit industry, the financial 
manager has limited authority. The financial manager may make 
recommendations, but the ultimate authority lies with the 
governing board. There is, therefore, less control in the hands 
of financial managers and a corresponding decrease in their 
ability to control a liquidity situation. 

Lack of liquidity means that the institution is unable to 
service its current debt. This can lead to the forced sale of 
long-term investments and assets. To the owners of an 
institution, a lack of liquidity will mean reduced profitability 
or it may mean loss of control or loss of the entire capital 
investment. To creditors of the enterprise, it means slow 
collection of principal and interest due or even loss of the 
amounts due them. Students of these institutions can also be 
affected by a short-term poor financial condition. These effects 
may take the form of inability of the institution to perform 
their contract, inability to make refunds due to students or 
lenders, or the loss of supplier relationships. Suppliers are 
interested in an institution's liquidity position, and if it is 
found to be inadequate, it may cease to do business with the 
institution.

The Secretary proposes that a nonprofit institution is not 
financially responsible if it has had a decrease in total net 
assets at the end of its latest fiscal year of such significance 
that, if continued, would result in a ratio current assets to 
current liabilities of less than 1:1. Under this proposal, the 
Secretary could consider the effect of extraordinary gains or 
losses resulting from unusual and infrequent events, and could 
take into consideration the cumulative effect of a change in 
accounting principle, estimate or reporting entity to the extent 
that such a change results in a more accurate representation of 
the institution's financial position in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. For purposes of this proposed 
analysis, the Secretary could exclude unrealized gains and losses 
on investments that have been reported as changes in unrestricted 
net assets. The standard was revised to reflect the changes 
brought about with the issuance of FASB 117 and in order to 
provide parity with the for-profit institutions. The concept of 
net worth, as it applies to profit-seeking entities, does not 
exist for a not-for-profit entity. Upon implementation of FASB 
117, fund accounting will no longer be used for colleges and 
universities, but these entities will adopt a format that is more 
similar to the format for-profit entities have been using. The 
term ``fund balance'' will no longer apply, but will be replaced by 
total net assets, divided into unrestricted, temporarily 
restricted and permanently restricted assets. For institutions 
not required to implement FAS 117 prior to the effective date of 
these regulations, the regulations applying to nonprofits 
currently found in 34 CFR 668.13(c), ``the institution shall not 
have a deficit current unrestricted fund balance'', will remain in 
effect until the institution adopts FAS 117. 

The Secretary requests comments on whether the Secretary 
should determine a nonprofit institution to be financially 
responsible even if it does not meet these requirements if the 
institution has an acceptable ``bond rating''. The Secretary 
suggests that a type of acceptable bond rating may be a current 
general obligation or general obligation equivalent debt rating 
(because such a rating is backed by the full resources of the 
institution) by a nationally recognized debt rating organization, 
approved by the Secretary, that is at least investment grade. 

The Secretary proposes that a public institution is 
financially responsible only if the institution has its 
liabilities backed by the full faith and credit of the State, or 
by an equivalent government. The Secretary is aware that 
accounting principles for public institutions differ from those 
for for-profit and nonprofit institutions. The Secretary 
solicits comments on other acceptable measures of a public 
institution's financial responsibility that take the applicable 
accounting principles into account.

Past Performance of an Institution or Persons Affiliated With An Institution 


The Secretary proposes to remove from the factors of 
financial responsibility the provisions in current  668.13 (c)(4) 
and (d)(2) governing the effect on an institution's financial 
responsibility of criminal conduct and fraud involving Federal 
funds. Those provisions have been superseded by a similar 
statutory provision that is addressed in the discussion on 
proposed  668.14 governing program participation agreements. 
Under proposed  668.15(c)(2), an institution would not be 
considered financially responsible, despite meeting all other 
requirements of this proposed section, if: (1) The institution 
has been limited, suspended, terminated, or entered into a 
settlement agreement, to resolve such an action by the Secretary 
or a guaranty agency within the preceding five years; (2) the 
institution had an audit finding during its two most recent 
audits, or a program review finding during its two most recent 
program reviews, that resulted in the institution's being 
required to repay an amount greater than five percent of the 
Title IV, HEA funds that the institution received for any award 
year covered by the audit or the program review; or (3) the 
institution failed to address satisfactorily any compliance 
problems identified in program review or audit reports based upon 
a final decision of the Secretary. 
The consequences of this proposed provision are described 
more fully earlier in this preamble in the discussion on 
provisional certification. Essentially, institutions that fall 
into one of these categories not only would not be considered 
financially responsible, but could not be provisionally certified 
without the submission of certain financial guarantees or 
personal assumptions of liability arising from participation in 
the Title IV, HEA programs. 


Exceptions to the General Standards of Financial Responsibility 


The Amendments of 1992, as amended by the Technical 
Amendments of 1993, provide that the Secretary shall determine an 
institution to be financially responsible even though it does not 
meet certain general standards of financial responsibility, under 
various conditions. 
Section 498(c)(5)(B) of the HEA provides that the Secretary 
shall establish a process whereby an institution is exempt from 
the cash reserve requirement if the institution is located in, 
and is legally authorized to operate within, a State that has a 
tuition recovery fund that ensures that the institution is able 
to pay all required refunds and the institution contributes to 
that tuition recovery fund. The Secretary proposes that an 
institution is exempt from the proposed cash reserve requirement 
if it meets these conditions; however, the Secretary proposes to 
stipulate that a State's tuition recovery fund must be acceptable 
to the Secretary. The Secretary would like to ensure that a 
State's tuition recovery fund truly has the resources to ensure 
payment of all required refunds if necessary. To this end, the 
Secretary would expect States to provide as much information as 
possible to demonstrate that their tuition recovery fund can pay 
all required refunds on behalf of an institution that closed 
precipitously. The Secretary invites comment on what specific 
standards should be used to measure the acceptability of a 
State's tuition recovery fund. 
Section 498(c)(3) of the HEA provides that an institution is 
financially responsible even though it does not meet the other 
general standards of financial responsibility, under the 
following circumstances. First, an institution that is not 
financially responsible under the general standards of financial 
responsibility (except the cash reserve requirement) is 
financially responsible if the institution submits to the 
Secretary third-party financial guarantees, such as performance 
bonds or letters of credit payable to the Secretary, that equal 
not less than one-half of the annual potential Title IV, HEA 
program liabilities of the institution. The Secretary proposes 
that a letter of credit that is payable to the Secretary and 
effective for a period of time as determined by the Secretary 
would be the only acceptable type of third-party guarantee for 
this requirement. The determination by the Secretary that 
payment from a third-party guarantee requires that funds become 
immediately available to make refunds or to reimburse the 
Secretary for debts incurred in the programs. It has been the 
Secretary's experience that letters of credit are the only method 
by which funds do become immediately available; however, the 
Secretary requests comments on other standard forms of publicly 
guaranteed security that would provide the same level of security 
to the Secretary. The Secretary notes that an institution is 
liable for all mishandled Title IV, HEA program funds that it 
receives. Further, the Secretary believes that the total Title 
IV, HEA program funds received by an institution during the last 
complete award year is the best indicator of the amount of Title 
IV, HEA program assistance that the institution will receive for 
the next award year. Therefore, the Secretary proposes to 
require an institution to submit a letter of credit equal to not 
less than one-half of the Title IV, HEA program funds received by 
the institution during the last complete award year for which 
figures are available in order to meet this requirement.

Second, the Technical Amendments of 1993 provide that an 
institution that is not financially responsible under the general 
standards of financial responsibility (except the cash reserve 
requirement) is financially responsible if it establishes to the 
satisfaction of the Secretary, with the support of a financial 
statement audited by an independent certified accountant with 
generally accepted accounting standards, that the institution has 
sufficient resources to ensure against the precipitous closure of 
the institution, including the ability to meet all of its 
financial obligations, including refunds of institutional charges 
and repayments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts 
incurred in programs administered by the Secretary. The 
Secretary proposes to restate the statute, modifying it only to 
propose to require that the financial statement be submitted in 
accordance with the proposed requirements for documentation of 
financial responsibility that will be discussed later. 
The Technical Amendments of 1993 further provide that an 
institution is not required to meet the general standards of 
financial responsibility (except for the cash reserve 
requirement) if the institution is an institution that provides a 
2-year or 4-year educational program for which the institution 
awards an associate or baccalaureate degree that demonstrates to 
the satisfaction of the Secretary that there is not reasonable 
doubt as to its continued solvency and ability to deliver quality 
educational services, it is current in its payment of all current 
liabilities, including student refunds, repayments to the 
Secretary, payroll, and payment of trade creditors and 
withholding taxes, and it has substantial equity in 
school-occupied facilities, the acquisition of which was the 
direct cause of its failure to meet the current operating ratio 
requirement. The Secretary proposes to restate the statute 
without modification. 


Documentation of Financial Responsibility
 


Section 498(c)(4) of the HEA provides that the determination 
of an institution's financial responsibility be based on an 
audited and certified financial statement of the institution or, 
where appropriate, its parent corporation, conducted by a 
qualified independent organization or person in accordance with 
standards established by the American Institute of Certified 
Public Accountants. The statement must be submitted to the 
Secretary when the institution is applying to begin or continue 
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. The statute further 
provides that the Secretary may require the submission of 
additional audits if the first submission does not establish 
compliance with the general standards of financial 
responsibility. Although audited financial statements should be 
rendered in a uniform manner, there is some leeway with regards 
to contents of the statements. The Secretary proposes to require 
institutions to submit financial statements on an annual basis 
within four months after the end of the institution's fiscal 
year. The Secretary believes that four months from the end of an 
institution's fiscal year is a sufficient period of time for an 
institution to submit a financial statement. The Secretary also 
clarifies that, upon request, the institution must provide or 
otherwise make available the accountant's work papers in order to 
ensure that all information relevant to preparing an audited 
financial statement is readily available. Institutions are 
already required to provide access to such information pursuant 
to current  668.23, and the Secretary proposes to reference that 
access to records in this proposed section. The Secretary 
proposes that an institution may be granted a filing extension to 
an institution upon a showing of good cause. The Secretary 
intends that this extension would be granted on an infrequent 
basis, as the Secretary believes it is imperative to have the 
financial information from the institution that most accurately 
reflects the current financial situation of the institution.

Section 668.16 Standards of Administrative Capability


The Secretary proposes to redesignate  668.14 as  668.16. 
In matters not governed by specific provisions, section 
487(c)(1)(B) of the HEA provides for the establishment of 
standards of administrative capability for participating 
institutions that include any matter the Secretary deems 
necessary for the sound administration of the Title IV, HEA 
programs. Section 498(d) of the HEA, which was added by the 
Amendments of 1992, authorizes the Secretary to establish 
procedures and requirements relating to administrative 
capability, including the consideration of past performance of 
institutions or individuals in control of those institutions and 
maintenance of records. In addition, section 498(d) authorizes 
the Secretary to establish other reasonable procedures that will 
contribute to ensuring that institutions will be administratively 
capable. 
Given this framework, the Secretary proposes to strengthen 
and modify the administrative capability standards in the current 
regulations by making significant, substantive changes to the 
administrative standards as well as some technical changes; the 
significant proposed changes to the current regulations are 
described below. 
The Secretary proposes to clarify the Secretary's current 
principle that an institution must demonstrate that it is capable 
of meeting each of the administrative standards in this section 
to be considered administratively capable. During negotiated 
rulemaking, alternatives to requiring that institutions meet each 
administrative standard were discussed. Among the options 
considered were that the various factors be ``weighted,'' i.e., the 
Secretary would identify which factors he considered to be the 
most critical and would incur the greatest penalty if they were 
not met. Some of the negotiators suggested that the various 
factors be used only as indicators of capability; that is, the 
Secretary would be required to review each institution that did 
not comply with one or more standard to determine the seriousness 
of noncompliance. However, the negotiators did not reach 
consensus on an approach. Therefore, the Secretary is proposing 
that to be fully certified as meeting the standards in this 
section (as well as the other standards in Subpart B of these 
regulations) an institution must demonstrate that it is 
administratively capable by meeting all the administrative 
standards. An institution that fails to demonstrate compliance 
with one or two administrative standards could be certified 
provisionally (see the earlier discussion on provisional 
certification) if the Secretary were to determine the institution 
capable of meeting all the standards within a specific time 
period and that the noncompliance did not necessitate taking a 
stronger sanction such as a fine, limitation, suspension, or 
termination proceeding against the institution. 
For example, an initial applicant would not be able to 
demonstrate compliance with all standards prior to participation. 
However, the Secretary expects such an institution to demonstrate 
that it is capable of complying with all the standards. 
Therefore, the Secretary currently provisionally certifies an 
initial applicant if the Secretary determines that the applicant 
is capable of meeting the current standards within a specified 
period of time. The Secretary will continue this practice, using 
any additional standards proposed in this section if they are 
adopted in final. 
The Secretary proposes to make explicit the requirement 
that, to be considered administratively capable, an institution 
must administer all the Title IV, HEA programs in which it 
participates in accordance with all applicable statutory and 
regulatory provisions and special arrangements, agreements, and 
limitations. This expectation has been implicit. However, the 
Secretary believes it is important to lay out this standard 
together with all the other administrative standards.

The Secretary proposes to clarify what is meant by a capable individual who is responsible for administering the Title
IV, HEA programs. It is important for each institution that is currently participating or seeking to participate
in the Title IV, HEA programs to demonstrate that it has staff who are capable of administering the programs properly.
While obviously a number of factors should be considered in determining what constitutes ``capable,'' the Secretary
believes that one factor that should be addressed in regulations is whether a financial aid administrator has been
certified by his or her State to have that capability. This factor would apply in a State that requires financial aid
administrators to be certified. The Secretary also proposes to consider whether an individual has successfully
completed Title IV, HEA program training that the Secretary has provided or approved. The Secretary is aware that
some professional organizations provide high caliber training in various aspects of the administration of the Title
IV, HEA programs and wishes to allow for acceptance of that outside training to meet this requirement in the future.
The Secretary welcomes comments on what elements and safeguards should be present in an acceptable training program
for financial aid administrators. While adequate experience and training are major considerations in evaluating
compliance with this standard, the Secretary welcomes suggestions regarding any other appropriate factors that
the Department of Education should take into account in determining an individual's capability.

The Secretary proposes to clarify the factors that are considered in determining whether a financial aid office is
adequately staffed. The Secretary proposes to specify that in looking at the amount of funds administered by the institution,
the Secretary would also consider the number of students who receive any student financial assistance at the institution
as it has a direct bearing on whether an office is adequately staffed. The Secretary also proposes to add consideration
of the degree of office automation in the financial aid office. While the Secretary has always considered the extent
to which financial aid processing is automated in assessing the adequacy of financial aid offices, the Secretary
believes it is helpful to acknowledge specifically in the regulations the bearing the degree of office automation
has on the staffing levels of financial aid offices.

During the negotiated rulemaking sessions, discussions were held regarding the possible development of specific
staffing levels, such as ratios of financial aid staff to the number of financial aid recipients at an institution,
for determining the adequacy of the financial aid office of an institution participating in the Title IV, HEA programs
for the first time, an institution that undergoes a change of ownership resulting in a change of control, and an institution
that has exhibited administrative difficulty with other standards in this section. The Secretary believes that
it is not necessary to prescribe specific staffing levels for participating institutions that have not experienced
administrative problems. However, the Secretary agreed to solicit comments on the need for an additional method
to assess staffing levels of other institutions.

An institution participating in the Title IV, HEA programs for the first time has neither the experience in dealing
with large numbers of financial aid recipients nor a record of administering those programs that can be evaluated.
During discussions at the negotiated rulemaking session, it was suggested that it might be necessary to prescribe
a specific number of staff for the institution's financial aid office that could serve as a guide for determining whether
the institution can handle the volume of financial aid applications and funds it expects to receive. This standard
would be required until the Secretary is able to judge the institution's actual administration of the programs. Similarly,
there is no assurance that an institution that changes ownership will operate with the same staff and procedures and
at the same level of funding as was the case under the previous ownership. Thus, that institution's former track record
could not be relied upon to predict its continued administrative capability and there might be a need to be able to evaluate
the adequacy of current or anticipated staffing levels using specific numbers or ratios, just as the Department would
evaluate those of a new participating institution. Finally, if an institution has documented problems or indicators
of trouble in administering the Title IV, HEA programs, these problems could well be caused by inadequate staffing
levels in the institution's financial aid office. Requirements for financial aid staff to be maintained at specific
levels might need to be imposed upon the institution. To address the problems and administer the Title IV, HEA programs
correctly, it is logical to expect an institution to meet minimum staffing levels that might be adopted.

The Secretary solicits comments on other ways of measuring staff adequacy at newly participating institutions,
institutions that change ownership resulting in a change of control and participating institutions with documented
administrative problems as well as any other categories of institutions that should be subject to requirements for
specific staffing levels. The Secretary further invites comment on how such considerations as the size of the institution,
and the volume of Title IV, HEA program funds administered by the institution should determine the number or ratio
of financial aid staff that the Secretary should prescribe. For example, the Secretary wishes to know whether a reasonable
ratio of staff to applicants or recipients can be established, and, if so, what that ratio might be. The Secretary understands
the difficulty inherent in strict application of a quantitative formula; nevertheless, concern was expressed at
the negotiated rulemaking sessions about having an adequate basis on which to make fair, worthwhile, and consistent
judgments of administrative capability. The Secretary recognizes that appropriate staffing levels must include
staff not only in the financial aid office but also in the business office or other offices within an institution, and
that the use of third-party servicers and office automation have a bearing on those levels. The Secretary asks commenters
to address these factors in their recommendations.

The Secretary proposes to require that to be considered administratively capable, an institution have written procedures,
or other written information covering, at a minimum, the nature and frequency of communication of information among
all the offices that have an impact on the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs and the responsibilities of
various offices with respect to the awarding and delivery of Title IV, HEA program funds and reports to the Secretary.
The Secretary encourages institutions to have specific written procedures where possible, preferably in procedural
manuals, for this purpose. However, the Secretary recognizes that some of the information might be found in catalogs,
student or administrative handbooks, or other sources. The Secretary is proposing to add these provisions because
audits and program reviews of Title IV, HEA programs administered by institutions have shown that lack of written
procedures in these key areas is frequently a contributing factor to a lack of proper controls, resulting in overawards
and inadequate accounting of expenditures. To ensure that only eligible students receive funds and in the correct
amount, and that borrowers are tracked accurately and timely, it is essential that each institution be clear about
how and when pertinent information is transmitted from one office to another. The proposed addition to the regulations
includes examples of the types of information to be transmitted. Similarly, it is critical that each office that is
responsible for the approval and disbursement or delivery of Title IV, HEA funds have in writing that office's responsibilities
and reporting requirements.

The Secretary proposes to clarify what constitutes division of the authorizing and disbursing or delivering functions
by adding an example. In the past, there has been virtually no real separation of these duties in some institutions;
this situation has presented an opportunity for significant abuse. It is important that two different individuals
authorize and disburse or deliver payment, and that an individual performing one of these functions not have control
over the work activities of the person or persons performing the other. To guard against collusion, it is also critical
that the individuals not be members of the same family or exercise substantial control over the institution through
a combined ownership interest in the institution. The terms 

substantial control

 and 

ownership interest

 are currently defined in  668.13. The Secretary considers two individuals to exercise substantial control
through a ``combined'' ownership interest if the individuals hold 

together

 at least a 25 percent ownership interest in the institution. Thus, an institution would be precluded from having one
individual with a 10 percent ownership interest who awards Title IV, HEA program assistance and another individual
with a 15 percent ownership interest who disburses the funds. This concept is designed to allow for those employees
who participate to a moderate degree in a profit-sharing plan to be employed in one of the capacities described in this
provision without having a detrimental impact on the institution's administrative capability. Finally, the Secretary
wishes to clarify that, under both current regulations and the proposed regulations, it is acceptable for a check
that is to be disbursed or delivered to a student by another office to pass through the office that authorizes payment,
as long as the office that authorizes payment does no more than deliver the check to the office responsible for disbursement
or delivery to the student.

The Secretary proposes to make explicit that record-keeping 
is a basic standard of administrative capability. Those new 
institutions that do not have adequate record-keeping capability 
would not be approved to participate in the Title IV, HEA 
programs. The record-keeping capability of participating 
institutions would be evaluated when the institutions seek 
renewal of their program participation. 
The Secretary proposes to revise the satisfactory progress 
standards to require that the maximum time frame for completion 
of an undergraduate program be no longer than 150 percent of the 
published length of the educational program and that increments 
of the maximum time frame not exceed the lesser of one academic 
year or one-half the published length of the educational program. 
The establishment of the maximum time frame must, as usual, take 
into account a student's enrollment status. Thus, an institution 
that offers a four-year degree program (as listed in the 
institution's catalog) would have to establish a maximum time 
frame of no more than six years for completion of the program by 
a full-time student. The time frame could be proportionally 
longer for a half-time student. The Secretary emphasizes that 
this requirement would set an upper limit on the period of time 
for which a student may receive Title IV, HEA program aid. An 
institution would not be required to expel or otherwise remove a 
student from the educational program after the expiration of this 
maximum time frame (unless, of course, the institution has a 
similar requirement for students who do not receive Title IV, HEA 
program assistance). The Secretary has a longstanding policy 
under which 150 percent of the length of an educational program 
is considered to be a reasonable period in which a serious 
student should be able to complete the program. The Secretary 
notes that this proposed time frame is also consistent with 
proposals made by the NPRM implementing the Student Right-to-Know 
provisions in section 485(a) of the HEA (57 FR 30826). The 
Secretary does not believe that Title IV, HEA program aid should 
be provided beyond the point at which a student can reasonably be 
expected to complete his or her educational objective. 
The Secretary proposes to expand and clarify the 
requirements for reporting information about possible fraud or 
illegal misconduct related to the Title IV, HEA programs. The 
proposed regulations would eliminate the current provision for an 
institution to refer suspected instances of fraud or other 
criminal misconduct involving Title IV, HEA program assistance to 
a State or local law enforcement agency rather than the Office of 
Inspector General (OIG), if more appropriate. Instead, the 
proposed regulations would require the institution to notify only 
the OIG. The proposed regulations would also remove a related 
requirement_that the institution report to the OIG, for each 
calendar year, all relevant referrals to State or local law 
enforcement agencies, as this would no longer be necessary if all 
referrals were made directly to the OIG. Upon receipt of the 
information, the OIG will notify and work with the appropriate 
officials to resolve the issue. The Secretary is proposing to 
amend this section to streamline the referral process and reduce 
the burden of reporting information. 
Currently, under this provision governing the reporting of 
instances of suspected fraud and criminal misconduct, 
institutions are required to report only information regarding 
applicants for Title IV, HEA program assistance. Another 
proposed change would expand the reporting requirement with 
respect to both the types of misconduct to be reported and the 
individuals and entities involved in the misconduct. In addition 
to the information currently required, an institution would be 
required to report information regarding illegal conduct 
involving the eligibility and funding of the institution and its 
students through Title IV, HEA programs believed by the 
institution to have been committed by any employee, third-party 
servicer, or other agent of the institution that acts in a 
capacity that involves the administration of the Title IV, HEA 
programs. This provision would specify that illegal conduct 
would include possible fraud, misrepresentation, conversion or 
breach of fiduciary responsibility, or any other illegal conduct. 
The Secretary believes it is important to investigate any 
possible illegal misconduct (i.e., misconduct where formal 
criminal charges have not been brought) in addition to possible 
criminal misconduct. The intent of this expansion is to specify 
that institutions should report not only acts that constitute 
fraud or criminal conduct, but any and all other illegal conduct 
involving Title IV, HEA programs in which an employee or 
third-party servicer might have engaged.

In addition to modifying and expanding some of the existing 
administrative capability standards, and making others explicit, 
the Secretary proposes to expand the administrative capability 
standards to include the general areas that SPREs will review 
when they become operational. The Secretary realizes that the 
SPRE review standards must be developed in consultation with 
institutions located in the State and will apply only to those 
institutions that trigger reviews; therefore, those standards may 
differ greatly from those proposed here for purposes of 
evaluating an institution's administrative capability. However, 
the Secretary believes that these areas of review have a 
significant bearing on an institution's administrative capability 
and therefore should be incorporated in the Federal 
administrative capability standards. 
The Secretary's overriding concern is that the Secretary 
have sufficient information on which to make a determination that 
a new or currently participating institution is administering or 
is capable of administering the Title IV, HEA programs 
efficiently, effectively, and correctly. With this in mind, the 
Secretary solicits comments on specific ways to quantify these 
provisions (for example, what a ``significant number of students 
with special needs'' is) and whether each of these added 
requirements should be made applicable to all institutions or 
whether these provisions should be made applicable only to 
institutions that meet specific criteria or thresholds, e.g., 
institutions with short-term programs, a history of high 
withdrawal rates, high default rates, student complaints, etc. 
Specifically, the Secretary is proposing to require 
institutions that enroll significant numbers of students with 
special needs to have and implement a plan that provides access 
to adequate support services for those students. The Secretary 
believes that an institution that cannot provide adequate 
peripheral support should not enroll those special-needs students 
in significant numbers. In evaluating administrative capability, 
the Secretary has looked historically at withdrawal rates. High 
withdrawal rates often result in refund and default problems in 
the FFEL programs. Some institutions have high withdrawal rates 
because they have recruited students who were not able to 
complete the program. Student withdrawal for academic reasons 
has been addressed by changes to the ability-to-benefit 
provisions: students who do not have a high school diploma or the 
recognized equivalent now need to pass an independently 
administered, approved examination. However, other students who 
have been admitted have had the academic capability to succeed, 
but have been unable to complete the program because of other 
factors, such as lack of child care, or changes in child care 
arrangements, or lack of adequate transportation. Some of the 
negotiators provided the Secretary with examples of students who 
could not complete a course of study because of a lack of 
information about how to access adequate support services, who 
otherwise may not have enrolled in those programs if accurate 
information about the restricted availability of those services 
had been disclosed. For example, if a school enrolls a 
significant number of students who have small children and, 
therefore, need someone to look after their children while they 
are in classes and studying, or students who have no 
transportation of their own, it is incumbent upon the institution 
to work with these students to ensure they have access to the 
ancillary services required in order for them to complete their 
education or training. The institution may, but need not, 
actually provide the specific services, such as child care, but 
must, at a minimum, provide adequate guidance and access to 
enable their students to overcome barriers to attendance. 
The Secretary is proposing that affected institutions have a 
plan, which they may be asked to submit, to demonstrate that they 
meet this provision. However, the Secretary is interested in 
receiving suggestions about other ways to address the problem of 
institutions that recruit and enroll significant numbers of 
students who need support services without informing those 
students about access to the support services. The Secretary 
solicits comments regarding how to determine what constitutes a 
``significant number'' of students with special needs and what 
special needs should be included. Further, the Secretary would 
like to receive proposals for alternate means of addressing this 
issue.

The Secretary proposes to require each institution to have 
procedures for receiving, investigating, and resolving student 
complaints. 

The Secretary proposes to require that if the stated 
objectives of an educational program are to prepare students for 
gainful employment, the institution must be able to show that 
there is a reasonable relationship between the length of the 
program and entry level requirements for employment. In addition 
to supporting the length of a program, the institution should be 
able to substantiate the need for the number of hours of 
training. The Secretary proposes to consider the relationship 
between the quantity of training provided in the program and 
entry-level requirements to be reasonable if the number of clock 
hours in the program does not exceed by more than 50 percent any 
State requirement for the minimum number of clock hours necessary 
to train the student in the occupation for which the program 
prepares the student. For example, the Secretary is aware of an 
institution that sought approval of a 600-hour program when the 
state in which the institution is located requires only 40 hours 
of training for entry level positions for which the program 
provided training. The Secretary believes that in situations 
such as this, the onus is on the institution to demonstrate the 
value of the longer program. The Secretary believes that the 
excessive length of programs requires a student to incur 
additional unnecessary debt. 

A corollary requirement is that the need for the training 
provided is established. Over the past several years, the 
Secretary has been made aware of many schools that have provided 
three to six months of training for entry-level jobs, some of 
which required no external training before employment, as the 
employers have internal training programs or provide on-the-job 
training. As a basic tenet of student financial assistance is to 
enable students who would not otherwise be able to afford needed 
training or education to enroll in an appropriate program, the 
Secretary believes that if an institution is administering the 
Title IV, HEA programs adequately, it can demonstrate that the 
training it provides is needed. The Secretary solicits 
suggestions on the most appropriate documentation to show the 
need for the training. 

The Secretary proposes to add to the administrative 
capability standards the requirement that the institution make 
information on job availability and state licensing requirements 
available to students in occupational, professional and 
vocational educational programs. The Secretary believes that, in 
order for a prospective occupational, professional or vocational 
education student and financial aid applicant to make an informed 
decision about enrollment and use of student financial assistance 
in a particular program, the applicant must have access to 
accurate, up-to-date information on the job market for that 
field, and the availability of specific jobs for which he or she 
would be adequately prepared after completion of the program. 
Similarly, the applicant should have access to information on the 
extent to which the educational or training program addresses 
state licensing standards, so the informed student can determine, 
with reasonable assurance, that necessary topics are covered in 
the program and the extent to which additional information, not 
necessary for state licensure, is covered. The Secretary notes 
that this information may be obtained by the institution from 
other Federal and State sources, such as Employment Service or 
State occupational coordinating committees. An institution would 
not be required to produce this information on its own. 

The Secretary proposes to include within the administrative 
capability standards a requirement that the institution have 
advertising, promotion, and student recruitment practices that 
accurately reflect the content and objectives of the educational 
programs offered by the institution. The Secretary believes that 
to administer the Title IV, HEA programs in a responsible manner, 
the institution must advertise its programs and the financial 
assistance available in an accurate manner. 

The Secretary proposes to specify that an institution 
provide all required program and fiscal reports and financial 
statements in a timely manner. The Secretary believes strongly 
that adequate, timely submission of accurate reports is an 
essential element in the proper administration of the Title IV, 
HEA programs. The failure to meet requirements for submission of 
reports is an indication that an institution's administrative 
capability is impaired.

The Secretary proposes to include as a specific 
administrative standard the requirement that an institution have 
no outstanding liabilities owed to the Secretary unless the 
institution has made satisfactory arrangements to repay those 
liabilities and is honoring those arrangements. The Secretary 
believes that unless a participating institution demonstrates it 
has met all its programmatic, contractual, and fiscal obligations 
in the past, and has taken positive steps to rectify problems and 
liabilities in the past, there is no reason to presume that the 
institution has the capability and willingness to administer the 
Title IV, HEA programs responsibly in the future. 

The Secretary proposes to take into account whether 
significant problems have been identified in final reports and 
determinations issued by the Secretary, the OIG, accrediting 
agencies, SPREs, guaranty agencies, and State authorizing 
agencies and findings in criminal, civil, or administrative 
proceedings, in addition to financial and compliance audit 
reports and program review reports, in assessing an institution's 
administrative capability. The Secretary believes that pertinent 
information from any of the agencies or proceedings identified is 
relevant to determining whether an institution is 
administratively capable. An institution should be considered 
administratively capable only if there is no evidence of 
significant problems in those reviews or proceedings. 

The Secretary proposes to add to the administrative 
capability standards, the prohibition against debarments, 
suspensions, and causes of debarment or suspension under E.O. 
12549 and the FAR, 48 CFR subpart 9.4. The Secretary proposes to 
amend this section to provide that an institution would not be 
considered administratively capable if (1) cause exists for 
debarring the institution under 34 CFR 85.305, or for suspending 
the institution under 34 CFR 85.405, (2) any principal (as that 
term is used in 34 CFR part 85) of the institution is debarred or 
suspended, or (3) the institution is an affiliate (as that term 
is used in 34 CFR part 85) of any person so debarred or 
suspended. Under these changes, the Secretary would not certify 
the administrative capability of an institution that fits into 
any of these categories. The Secretary would not permit such an 
institution to begin participation in a Title IV, HEA program, 
and the Secretary would require a participating institution to 
rectify the problem that adversely affects the institution's 
administrative capability. A participating institution's 
inability or unwillingness to rectify the problem would warrant 
initiation of an emergency action, limitation, suspension, or 
termination proceeding against the institution under subpart G. 
The Secretary expects that such a proceeding would be combined 
with a debarment or suspension proceeding under 34 CFR part 85. 

These changes are needed to establish appropriate safeguards 
to protect the Title IV, HEA programs when serious questions are 
raised about the honesty and lawfulness of the conduct of an 
institution's owners, officers, directors, management, employees, 
or affiliates whose duties involve the administration of or 
influence over those programs. 

The Secretary proposes to require that an institution comply 
with any standards regarding completion and placement rates and 
pass rates on State licensing examinations established by the 
State in which an institution is located as a standard of 
administrative capability. The Secretary supports the 
development of appropriate standards by each State, as individual 
States will be able to address local concerns and conditions in 
the development of standards. In the absence of such a State 
standard, the Secretary believes an institution must comply with 
appropriate standards regarding completion rates, placement rates 
and pass rates on required State examinations, as established by 
the Secretary, in consultation with institutions located in the 
State. 

The Secretary proposes to require as a standard for full 
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs that institutions 
have default rates that do not exceed 20 percent for the Federal 
Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs, and default rates that do 
not exceed 15 percent for the Federal Perkins Loan program. For 
the Federal Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs, a 20 percent 
trigger is currently used as an indicator of impaired 
administrative capability. For the Federal Perkins Loan program, 
the Secretary has used a 20 percent trigger as an indicator of 
impaired administrative capability. The Secretary is proposing 
to change this figure to 15 percent for consistency with the 
statutory requirement of section 461(g) of the HEA that requires 
an institution with a cohort default rate of 15 percent in the 
Federal Perkins Loan program to establish a default management 
plan pursuant to regulations. Under this proposal, institutions 
applying for participation under a change of ownership or for a 
renewal of their participation with default rates exceeding these 
proposed amounts would be provisionally certified for a lack of 
administrative capability if no other serious administrative 
capability problems were identified that warranted denying the 
application. The Secretary notes that, under this proposal, an 
institution applying for a renewal of participation that has a 
default rate under the Federal Stafford Loan programs that 
exceeds 20 percent could submit information demonstrating 
mitigating circumstances as provided in  668.15 of current 
regulations to demonstrate that the institution's default rate is 
not a basis for denial of full participation. If no other 
serious administrative capability problems were identified that 
warrant denying the application for full participation, an 
institution with default rates over these triggers could receive 
full participation if it successfully showed that those 
mitigating circumstances existed.

In addition, the Secretary is proposing that an institution would not be considered administratively capable if
it has a withdrawal rate of more than 33 percent. This change from the current regulations, under which the Secretary
considers withdrawal rates of more than 33 percent as an indicator of problems in administrative capability, would
become, like the other standards in this section, absolute requirements rather than mere indicators. The calculation
of this withdrawal rate is currently made using the formula on the application for participation in the Title IV, HEA
programs.

The Secretary is proposing these changes to the current default rate and withdrawal rate requirements because the
Secretary believes that these rates are appropriate measures of an institution's past administrative performance;
an institution that administers the Title IV, HEA programs correctly will, absent mitigating circumstances for
its Federal Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs default rate, have default rates and withdrawal rates below these
percentages.

The Secretary understands that some currently participating institutions have rates in excess of these levels.
Therefore, the Secretary anticipates that when these institutions next undergo a reevaluation of their institutional
eligibility, administrative capability, and financial responsibility, some of them would be determined not to
be administratively capable purely for failure to meet these standards, even if they meet all the other financial
responsibility and administrative capability standards in these proposed regulations. In those cases, if there
are no other significant problems, these institutions could be granted provisional certification so they could
continue to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs for a limited time on a limited basis to allow them to bring their
default or withdrawal rates or both down to an acceptable level. However, an institution with a high withdrawal rate
applying for participation in the Title IV, HEA programs for the first time would not be approved to participate in
the Title IV, HEA programs. In addition to these default rates the Secretary plans to establish an appropriate default
rate applicable to the FDSL Program and solicits comments on what that should be. For example, comments are requested
on whether FDSL Program default rate thresholds should be developed to take into consideration students who are using
income contingent repayment.



Section 668.17 Default Reduction Measures



Default Rates



Because of the changes described above in proposed  668.16 concerning the effect of default and withdrawal
rates on an institution's administrative capability, the remaining provisions in current  668.15 would address
default reduction measures for institutions with high Federal Stafford loan and Federal SLS default rates. Therefore,
the Secretary proposes to redesignate current  668.15 as  668.17 and rename it ``Default reduction measures.''

The Secretary proposes to clarify that the Secretary notifies an institution of its Federal Stafford loan and Federal
SLS cohort default rate if that rate exceeds 20 percent for any fiscal year before the Secretary takes an action against
the institution. This change merely reflects the Secretary's current practice.

The Secretary proposes to remove the option to require an institution with a Federal Stafford loan and Federal SLS
cohort default rate that exceeds 20 percent for any fiscal year to submit to the Secretary and guaranty agencies the
specific information described in current  668.15(b)(2)(ii) concerning pass rates, job placement rates,
and completion rates. These changes are consistent with earlier statutory and regulatory revisions to current  668.15
and because the Secretary rarely asks institutions to submit this information. The Secretary would reserve the right
to request any information the Secretary deems necessary to make a preliminary determination as to the appropriate
action to be taken by the Secretary regarding the institution.



Default Management Plan



The Secretary proposes to clarify requirements for implementation of default management plans for institutions
with Federal Stafford loan and Federal SLS cohort default rates greater than 20 percent for any fiscal year. The Secretary
has required implementation of a default management plan for institutions with cohort default rates greater than
20 percent since the implementation of the default reduction initiative in final regulations published June 5, 1989
(54 FR 24114). In the preamble to the June 5, 1989, final regulations, the Secretary stated that, in accordance with
current  668.15(e), an institution with a default rate over 20 percent could be required to implement a default
management plan. The proposed provision specifies that, for an institution with a Federal Stafford loan and Federal
SLS cohort default rates greater than 20 percent or less than or equal to 40 percent for any fiscal year, the institution
would have to submit a default management plan that implements the measures described in appendix D to this part. An
institution could only implement a default management plan that deviates from the measures in appendix D if the institution
submits a justification for the deviation that is approved by the Secretary. An institution with a Federal Stafford
loan and Federal SLS cohort default rate that exceeds 40 percent for any fiscal year, and, therefore, is subject to
a limitation, suspension, or termination action under subpart G, would have to implement all of the default reduction
measures described in appendix D to this part no later than 60 days after the institution receives the Secretary's
notification of the institutions cohort default rate. The institution would not be required to submit any written
plans to the Secretary or a guaranty agency unless specifically requested to do so by the Secretary or guaranty agency.



End of Participation



Section 435(a)(2) of the HEA provides that an institution's participation in the FFEL programs ends if the Secretary
determines that the institution's cohort default rate for each of the three most recent fiscal years for which the
Secretary has determined the institution's rate is equal to or greater than the applicable threshold rates. Section
435(a)(2)(B) of the HEA sets the threshold rate for fiscal year 1994 and all subsequent fiscal years at 25 percent.
Consistent with current regulations, institutions may appeal such loss of participation by demonstrating that
mitigating circumstances as found in current  668.15 are present.

Currently, an institution may not participate in the FFEL programs beginning eight calendar days after the date the
Secretary notifies the institution that its cohort default rate exceeds the specified thresholds. The Secretary
proposes to change this provision to require that an institution may not participate in the FFEL program beginning
with the date that the institution receives notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate exceeds
the specified thresholds. The Secretary does not believe it is appropriate to continue to allow an institution that
has lost its participation due to a high default rate to have the benefit of further Title IV, HEA program funds unless
it successfully appeals. The Secretary proposes to make corresponding changes throughout this section.

Appeal Procedures 


The Technical Amendments of 1993 amended section 435(a) and 
(m) of the HEA as those sections relate to institutional appeals 
of cohort default rates. These amendments are not reflected in 
this NPRM but will be addressed separately. However, the 
Secretary proposes to remove the provision that provides that an 
institution may appeal its loss of participation in the FFEL 
programs under the provisions of this section on the grounds that 
the institution has reduced its cohort default rate for each of 
the two most recent fiscal years for which the Secretary has 
calculated a cohort default rate for that institution by 50 
percent of the amount by which its cohort default rate for the 
previous year exceeds the applicable threshold percentage 
specified in this section. This provision is no longer 
applicable because it was limited to notices of loss of 
eligibility that were received by an institution in the fiscal 
year that ended September 30, 1991. 
Current regulations allow an institution to appeal its loss 
of participation in the FFEL programs under the provisions of 
this section on the grounds that, for any twenty-four month 
period ending not more than six months prior to the date the 
institution submits its appeal, two-thirds or more of the 
institution's students who are enrolled on at least a half-time 
basis are individuals from disadvantaged economic backgrounds as 
established by documentary evidence submitted by the institution 
such as a Pell Grant Index of zero, or an AGI of less than the 
poverty level, as determined by criteria developed by the 
Department of Health and Human Services. The Secretary proposes 
that the term ``such as'' be eliminated to reflect the current 
practice; i.e., the institution must establish the grounds for 
its appeal based only on the information specified in the 
regulations. The Department would only accept the specific 
evidence listed in the regulations although the current 
regulations suggest that other evidence is acceptable. This 
change reflects the current practice of the Secretary. The 
Secretary solicits comment on other acceptable forms of 
acceptable documentation. 


Definitions 


The Student Loan Reform Act (Pub. L. 103-66) amended the 
definition of 

cohort default rate 

to include Federal 
Consolidation Loans which are used to repay Federal Stafford and 
Federal SLS loans. The Secretary proposes to amend this section 
to reflect this change. 
Definitions applicable to this section would be revised to 
reflect changes to the definition of 

cohort default rate 

in 
section 435(m) of the HEA. In accordance with the statute, as in 
the past, for any fiscal year in which 30 or more current and 
former students at the institution enter repayment on Federal 
Stafford or Federal SLS program loans received for attendance at 
the institution, the cohort default rate is the percentage of 
those current and former students who enter repayment in that 
fiscal year on Federal Stafford or Federal SLS program loans 
received for attendance at that institution who default before 
the end of the following fiscal year. Formerly, for any fiscal 
year in which fewer than 30 of the institution's current and 
former students entered repayment on a Federal Stafford or 
Federal SLS loans received for attendance at the institution, the 
cohort default rate was the average over the three most recent 
fiscal years of the rates calculated in the manner described for 
any fiscal year in which 30 or more current and former students 
enter repayment on a Federal Stafford or Federal SLS program 
loan. The HEA now requires that, for any fiscal year in which 
fewer than 30 of the institution's current and former students 
enter repayment, the cohort default rate is the percentage of 
those current and former students who entered repayment on 
Federal Stafford loans or Federal SLS loans in any of the three 
most recent fiscal years who default before the end of the fiscal 
year in which they entered repayment. 
The Technical Amendments of 1993 changed section 
435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA to make clear that the issue of improper 
loan servicing is only part of the appeal process and does not 
relate to the Secretary's initial release of cohort default 
rates. Thus, in issuing the rates initially, the Secretary is 
not obligated to consider allegations of improper loan servicing. 
The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations to reflect this 
change by removing the requirement that the Secretary must 
exclude any loans that, due to improper servicing or collection, 
would result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the 
cohort default rate. 
Section 435(m) of the HEA requires the addition of the 
requirement that a Federal SLS loan not be considered to enter 
repayment until after the borrower has ceased to be enrolled in 
an educational program leading to a degree or certificate at the 
eligible institution on at least a half-time basis (as determined 
by the institution) and ceased to be in a period of forbearance 
based on that enrollment. Section 435(m) further requires that 
each eligible lender of a Federal SLS loan to provide the 
guaranty agency with the information necessary to determine when 
the loan entered repayment for purposes of this definition and 
requires the guaranty agency to provide that information to the 
Secretary.

Section 668.22 Institutional Refunds and Repayments 


General 


The Amendments of 1992 added section 484B to the HEA to 
require an institution to have in place, as of July 23, 1992, a 
fair and equitable institutional refund policy as promulgated in 
that section. The fair and equitable refund requirements 
prescribed by law are similar to the fair and equitable refund 
requirements prescribed by  682.606 of the FFEL program 
regulations for institutions that participate in the FFEL 
programs. The HEA extends this requirement to institutions 
participating in any Title IV, HEA program and makes various 
modifications. 
Under this fair and equitable refund policy, an institution 
must make a refund of unearned tuition, fees, room and board, and 
other charges to a student who received Title IV, HEA program 
assistance (including PLUS loans received on behalf of the 
student) if the student does not register for the period of 
enrollment for which the student was charged or if the student 
withdraws, drops out, or is expelled from the institution before 
completing the period of enrollment for which he or she was 
charged. 
The interpretation of the applicability of a fair and 
equitable refund policy was the subject of extensive discussions 
among the negotiators. The HEA specifically mandates a refund to 
any student who received Title IV HEA program assistance. 
However, at issue during the negotiations was the fairness and 
equity in having a refund policy for students who receive Title 
IV, HEA program assistance that is different from the refund 
policy for those students enrolled in the same educational 
program who do not receive Title IV, HEA program assistance. 
Several negotiators felt that requiring institutions to apply the 
refund requirements found in this proposed section to all 
students who attend an institution would be an unauthorized 
intrusion by the Secretary into the administrative decisions of 
an institution. Many negotiators felt that compliance with a 
refund requirement that is applicable to all students would be 
too costly for an institution. 
Therefore, the Secretary proposes to define a fair and 
equitable refund policy only with respect to students who receive 
Title IV, HEA program assistance. Although the Secretary 
proposes to limit the scope of this provision to those 
recipients, under this proposed provision an institution would 
not be prohibited from adopting these refund requirements for all 
students. 
The Secretary proposes to require that an institution 
provide a written statement containing its refund policy to 
prospective students and make its policy known to currently 
enrolled students. This proposal is based upon requirements 
currently prescribed by  682.606 of the FFEL program regulations. 
The Secretary proposes to expand this FFEL provision to require 
that the written statement must be clear and conspicuous and must 
include information on the allocation of refunds and repayments 
to sources of aid. In keeping with current FFEL program 
regulations, the Secretary proposes that the written statement 
include examples of the application of the refund policy. This 
requirement would be met if the institution informs students in 
the written statement that examples are available and the 
institution makes the examples readily available to the student 
upon request. 
As in the current FFEL program regulations, the Secretary 
proposes to require an institution to provide the written 
statement to prospective students. Section 668.41(b) of current 
regulations defines a ``prospective student'' as an individual who 
has contacted an institution participating in any Title IV, HEA 
program for the purpose of requesting information concerning 
admission to the institution. The Secretary believes that a 
student is a ``prospective student'' if he or she is not enrolled 
in an institution and has not entered into any contractual 
agreement or incurred a financial obligation to attend an 
institution. Therefore, the Secretary proposes to require an 
institution to provide this written statement to a student prior 
to the earlier of the student's enrollment or the execution of 
the student's enrollment agreement. If the institution's refund 
policy changes, the institution would have to ensure that all 
students are made aware of the new policy and advise the 
currently enrolled students of any changes that the institution 
intended to apply to those students for their current enrollment 
period.

The Secretary believes that some institutions have assessed excessive equipment charges that have increased the
total aid received. For example, some students have been charged as much as ten or fifteen times an institution's documented
equipment costs for kits students were required to purchase. If the calculation of a refund includes equipment charges
with such an extreme price mark-up, the amount of money an institution would be permitted to keep is greatly inflated.
To help curb this abuse, the Secretary is proposing to require an institution to publish in its school catalog or other
information provided to its students, the cost to the student of required supplies and equipment. Further, the Secretary
proposes to require an 
institution to substantiate to Department officials, upon the request of the Secretary, that the costs are reasonably
related to the costs of providing the supplies and equipment to students. This provision would not require the institution
to provide this cost substantiation to students, but would permit the Secretary to obtain information regarding
the cost of required supplies and equipment to determine whether an abuse in this area is occurring or has occurred.
For example, this information may be routinely reviewed during a program review. If the charges for equipment and
supplies appear to be unreasonable, the institution would be required to show that its charges were reasonably related
to the cost of providing those items. Under this proposal, an institution would not be expected to provide this information
to the Secretary as a regularly scheduled submission, but only upon request from the Department of Education. 



Fair and Equitable Refund Policy 



Section 484B of the HEA defines a fair and equitable refund policy to be one that provides for at least the largest of
the amounts provided under: 

(1) The requirements of applicable State law; 

(2) The specific refund requirements established by the institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency
and approved by the Secretary; or 

(3) The 

pro rata

 refund calculation described in the statute for students attending the institution for the first time, except that
this 

pro rata

 refund calculation does not apply for any student whose withdrawal date is after the 60 percent point in time in the
period of enrollment for which the student has been charged. 

The Secretary intends to clarify that an accrediting agency's refund policy must contain specific standards. Refund
``guidelines'' developed by an accrediting agency (for example, an accrediting agency refund policy that only requires
an institution to develop its own fair and equitable refund policy) 
would not be considered to have standards. Obviously, an institution would not be considered to be in compliance with
a State's or an approved accrediting agency's refund policy if the institution adopts a refund policy that is merely
similar to the State's or accrediting agency's but does not incorporate all the required standards. This policy is
consistent with the current provisions of the FFEL program regulations. 

The Secretary recognizes that there may be situations where an institution's State and accrediting agency do not
have specific refund policies. If a student is not entitled to a 

pro rata

 refund, no specific standard would then exist under the law to ensure that the student received a fair and equitable
refund. Because the Secretary believes that all recipients of Title IV, HEA program assistance should be treated
fairly, the Secretary is 
proposing to require an institution to provide a refund to a student that is the larger of the institution's refund
policy or the specific refund standards contained in appendix A to this part if an institution's State and accrediting
agency do not have refund standards and the student is not entitled to a 

pro rata

 refund. The NPRM published on January 24, 1994 to implement the 
accrediting agency provisions in subpart 2 of part H of the HEA proposes that the Secretary will not recognize an accrediting
agency unless the agency has a refund policy that provides for a fair and equitable refund to a student. The Secretary
notes that if this provision of the accreditation agency NPRM is adopted in final regulations, there would not be a
need for the proposed 
appendix A requirement once all accrediting agencies have been reviewed and recognized by the Secretary.

The refund policy proposed to be adopted as appendix A is derived from the guidelines developed by the National Association
of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO). Currently, under the FFEL program regulations, an institution
must follow the guidelines developed by NACUBO and restated in appendix A to the FFEL program regulations (or refund
policy standards set by 
another association of institutions of postsecondary education and approved by the Secretary) if neither an institution's
State nor its accrediting agency have refund standards. While the NACUBO standards identify policy standards that
institutions should have for the refund of student charges, the Secretary's proposed appendix A establishes policy
standards that institutions must have for the refund of student charges. The Secretary has always considered these
standards as mandatory for purposes of the FFEL program regulations and is, therefore, making that interpretation
clear in these proposed regulations. Further, the Secretary's proposed appendix A to this part would mandate the
percentage of tuition charges that must be returned 
to a student who withdraws from an institution at various intervals during the refund period. In the development of
the actual refund calculation for this policy, the Secretary adapted a proportionate calculation that is similar
to refund policies used by proprietary institutions. The Secretary believes that 
this refund schedule provides a fairer allocation of resources between the institution and the Title IV, HEA programs
than exists under the shorter refund periods often found at traditional colleges and universities. This proposed
refund policy is not normally as generous to the student as the 

pro rata

 refund policy prescribed by the statute, because the affected students would not be first time students and, therefore,
would not be entitled to the full protection of the 

pro rata

 refund policy. Under the standards in appendix A, a student who submits written notice of withdrawal up to one week
before the first day of class would receive a refund of 100 percent of tuition charges. The refund would be reduced to
at least 90 percent if the student submits written notice of withdrawal between the end 
of the 100 percent period and the first 10 percent of the period for which the student was charged. A student would receive
at least a 50 percent refund if he or she withdraws between the first 10 percent and the first 25 percent of the period
for which the student was charged. Finally, a student would receive at least a 25 percent refund if he or she withdraws
between the first 25 percent and the first 50 percent of the period for which the student was charged. 

As a part of the refund policy in proposed appendix A, the Secretary would allow an institution to subtract from the
refund to a student any charges for equipment (including books and supplies) if there is a separate charge for the equipment
and the student actually obtains the equipment but the student fails to return the equipment within 20 days after his
or her withdrawal. This provision is discussed further in the explanation on 

pro rata

 refunds. 

An institution must determine whether a student withdrew prior to the 60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment
for which the student has been charged when determining whether the 

pro rata

 refund calculation is applicable to a student. The Secretary proposes to define ``the 60 percent point in time in the
period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' based upon whether the educational program in which
the student 
is enrolled is measured in credit hours or clock hours. In the case of an educational program that is measured in credit
hours, this point would be the point in calendar time when 60 percent of the period of enrollment for which the student
has been charged has elapsed. In the case of an educational program that is measured in clock hours, this point would
be the point in time 
when the student completes 60 percent of the clock hours scheduled for the period of enrollment for which the student
is charged. 

For instance, if the student's period of enrollment in an educational program that is measured in credit hours is scheduled
to last 5 months (20 weeks), the 60 percent point of the period is at 12 weeks. However, in the case of a program measured
in clock hours, the Secretary believes that it is more accurate to use the number of completed clock hours to determine
the 
percentage of enrollment. For instance, if the student is scheduled to complete 900 clock hours, the 60 percent point
of the period of enrollment occurs when the student has completed 540 clock hours. The Secretary wishes to emphasize
that the definition of the determination of the 60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for which the student
has been charged is different from the determination of ``the portion of the period of period of enrollment for which
the student has been charged that remains'' that is used to calculate the refund after the institution has determined
that the 

pro rata

 refund calculation is to be used. The proposed definition of the latter term will be discussed later. 

In determining the largest refund to a student, the Secretary proposes to require an institution to determine the
largest refund for each student. An institution would not be permitted to determine which refund is generally the
most generous and use that refund calculation for all students. The 
Secretary believes that current computer technology enables an institution to automate this determination through
the use of computer software.

Pro Rata Refund 


The Secretary notes that although the statutory requirements for 

pro rata

 refunds supersede the 

pro rata

 regulations found in the FFEL program regulations, institutions have been advised to follow guidance given for implementation
of the FFEL program regulations as ``safe-harbor'' guidance for implementation of the statutory requirements for


pro rata

 refunds. The Secretary intends that final regulations for 

pro rata

 refunds developed as a result of this NPRM and any guidance given for implementation of these regulations will replace
the required 

pro rata

 refund policy for an institution that is required to use a 

pro rata

 refund policy because the institution has a cohort default rate that exceeds 30 percent under the FFEL programs. 

A ``

pro rata

 refund,'' as defined in statute, is required for a student attending an institution for the first time, unless another
applicable refund is greater. The 

pro rata

 refund may not be less than that portion of the tuition, fees, room, board, and other charges assessed the student by
the institution equal to the portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged that remains
on the withdrawal date. The 

pro rata

 refund is then rounded downward to the nearest 10 percent of that period. The 

pro rata

 refund is then reduced for any unpaid charges and a reasonable administrative fee. The administrative fee may not
exceed the lesser of one hundred dollars or five percent of the tuition, fees, room and board, and other charges assessed
the student. 

The Secretary proposes to permit institutions to subtract certain amounts of institutional charges from the refund
to the student. The Secretary wishes to clarify that these proposed regulations would permit an institution to subtract
charges or portion of charges from a 

pro rata

 refund only if the charges are included in the calculation of the 

pro rata

 refund. 

Under the statute, an institution may subtract any unpaid charges owed to the institution by the student. The Secretary
is proposing to define unpaid charges by using the definition for an ``unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment''
published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 8, 1993 (58 FR 32188). Although those final regulations discussed the unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment
as being excluded from the amount the institution may retain for institutional charges, rather than for the purpose
of excluding any unpaid balance from the refund to the student, the Secretary believes it is appropriate to adopt the
same definition to define these unpaid charges. In accordance with the current regulations, a student's scheduled
cash payment would be defined as the amount of institutional charges that is not paid for by financial aid. An institution
could count any late disbursements of Title IV aid as financial aid for this purpose (i.e., the amount of the late disbursement
would not be included as part of the student's scheduled cash payment.) Any amount of the scheduled cash payment that
has not been paid would be the amount of unpaid charges owed by the student. The treatment of unpaid charges for refunds
other than 

pro rata

 refunds is addressed later in this discussion. 

The statute also permits an institution to subtract a reasonable administrative fee from the refund owed to a student.
This administrative fee must be a real charge and documented as such. An institution may not automatically subtract
the lesser of five percent of the tuition, fees, room and board, and other charges assessed the student or one hundred
dollars if no such administrative fee actually exists.

The Secretary proposes to add to the list of permitted subtractions from the refund to a student any application fee
charged by the institution. The Secretary believes that an application fee is a fee incurred separately from a student's
charges for an enrollment period, and therefore, should not be included in the refund to the student. 
In addition, for institutions whose students are issued meal credits that can be spent irregularly throughout the
enrollment period (e.g., coupons or meal tokens) the Secretary proposes to allow an institution to deduct from the
refund owed under this paragraph the portion of ``board'' charges (i.e., meal tickets) that has been expended by the
student that exceeds the portion attributable to the period for which the student attended at the time of withdrawal.
For example, if a student withdrew at the 50 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for which the student has
been charged but had used 60 percent of the meal tickets, the institution could subtract from the refund to the student
the value of the meal tickets attributable to that 10 percent of the period of enrollment that the student did not attend.
If a student used less than the attributable value of the meal tickets at the time of his or her withdrawal, an institution
would not be permitted to subtract any amount from the refund to the student. An institution would not be permitted
to subtract any amount from the refund to the student in cases where students have unlimited use of meal tickets.

The Secretary intends to continue the current policy 
regarding the inclusion of books, supplies, and other equipment 
in the 

pro rata 

refund calculation consistent with guidance given 
to institutions that were required to use a 

pro rata 

refund 
policy because the institution had a default rate that exceeds 30 
percent and was required to calculate a 

pro rata 

refund for a 
student who received a loan under the FFEL programs. As is 
currently the case, an institution is required to include the 
full amount of charges for equipment in the calculation of 

pro 
rata 

refund if a separate charge exists for the equipment by the 
institution or if the institution requires the student to 
purchase the equipment from a certain vendor. The Secretary 
believes that by charging students a separate equipment charge or 
by requiring students to purchase the equipment from a single 
vendor (for example, a school book store) the equipment charges 
are being mandated by the institution and should be treated as 
institutional costs. In effect, the institution is the sole 
source of the equipment. If an institution does not have a 
separate charge for equipment and the student has the option of 
purchasing the equipment from more than one source, the 
institution would not have to include the equipment charge in the 


pro rata 

refund calculation. An institution would have to be 
able to demonstrate that its students have the option of 
purchasing the equipment from other sources that are easily 
accessible to the student and that the students are advised that 
an option is available. 

The Secretary proposes to allow an institution to subtract 
from the refund to a student any charges for equipment (including 
books and supplies) that a student could have returned for credit 
but did not do so. Under this provision, there would have to be 
a separate charge for the equipment, and the student must 
actually have obtained the equipment but failed to return the 
equipment within 20 days after his or her withdrawal. This 
provision was suggested by one of the negotiators and is based 
upon California law. By consensus of the negotiators, this 
provision would be extended to situations where the equipment and 
supplies are sold by an affiliate or related entity of the 
institution. If the student does not return the equipment, the 
institution could subtract from the 

pro rata 

refund owed to the 
student the documented cost to the institution of equipment 
issued to the student. The student would be liable for the 
amount, if any, by which the documented cost for equipment 
exceeds the amount of the student's 

pro rata 

refund. 

Under this proposal, if some or all of the equipment is not 
actually received by the student, the institution would have to 
include in the 

pro rata 

refund calculation 100 percent of the 
amount paid for that portion of the equipment. Further, if an 
institution gives a student the option to return the equipment, 
the institution would not be permitted to subtract the cost of 
the equipment from the refund to the student if the student 
chooses to return the equipment and does so within 20 days of his 
or her withdrawal. The Secretary believes that 20 days provides 
the student with a sufficient period of time to return equipment 
without delaying the refund to the student. 

The Secretary proposes that any equipment returned by a 
student must be in good condition allowing for reasonable wear 
and tear. The Secretary notes that there may be restrictions 
under State laws that prevent an institution from accepting 
returned equipment due to health and sanitary reasons. Other 
conditions might also limit the return of equipment. For 
example, a workbook that has been written in or a damaged text 
book might not be reusable. The Secretary solicits comments on 
whether this provision should be expanded to identify other 
conditions that could affect the institution's ability to reissue 
equipment. 

The Secretary notes that, because an institution must 
include the charges listed above in the calculation of a 

pro rata 


refund and is then permitted to subtract the charges or a portion 
of the charges from this refund, in many cases it appears that an 
institution could retain more than the actual charge to the 
student. For example, if an institution that charges a $100 
administrative fee calculates a 

pro rata 

refund to a student, a 
portion of the $100 charge would be refunded to the student in 
accordance with the 

pro rata 

refund formula, and a portion of the 
charge would be retained by the institution. Yet, in addition, 
the institution could then be permitted to subtract the full $100 
from the refund to the student. The Secretary requests comments 
on whether it may be more appropriate to require institutions to 
exclude these charges from the refund calculation entirely rather 
than subtracting the charge after performing the calculation. 
The Secretary also requests comment on whether some other means 
should be adopted to eliminate this potential ``double counting'' 
of charges. 

For purposes of determining a 

pro rata 

refund, the Secretary 
proposes to exclude from the ``room charges'' that are to be 
included in the refund calculation, any room charges for 
off-campus housing that are passed through the institution in 
their entirety to an entity that is not under the control of, 
related to, or affiliated with the institution. The Secretary 
recognizes that an institution may enter into an agreement with 
an outside agency to provide lodging for students. Under such an 
arrangement, the institution is merely a conduit that passes the 
room charges along to the other entity, yet those charges appear 
as institutional charges on student accounts. In these cases, 
the independence of the entities and the students' continuing 
right to occupy the housing after the students withdraw warrant 
the exclusion of the room charges from the refund calculation. 

The Secretary also proposes to exclude from the 

pro rata 


refund calculation charges for group health insurance that are 
mandatory for all students in the calculation of a 

pro rata 


refund so long as the coverage remains in effect for the students 
throughout the period for which the student was charged. The 
Secretary notes that the inclusion of these group health 
insurance charges in the refund calculation could cancel 
insurance coverage that might otherwise be extended to the 
student beyond the student's withdrawal date.

The Secretary proposes to define a student attending an 
institution for the first time as a student who has not 
previously attended at least one class at the institution. A 
student who received a refund of 100 percent of his or her 
tuition and fees (less any permitted administrative fee) under 
the institution's refund policy for previous attendance at the 
institution would also be considered a first-time student. 


The Secretary believes that a first-time student at an 
institution is a student who is attending that institution, as 
opposed to any institution, for the first time. Therefore, if 
the student has not previously attended at least one class at a 
specific institution, the Secretary would consider the student to 
be attending that institution for the first time. If a student 
transfers to another institution, he or she would count as a 
first-time student at the new institution, if he or she has not 
previously attended at least one class at the new institution. 
If a student attends an institution, withdraws from the 
institution (and receives less than a 100 percent refund), and 
then returns to the same institution, the student would not be 
treated as a first-time student for his or her second period of 
attendance. The Secretary believes that if a student has 
previously received a 100 percent refund at an institution, for 
purposes of this definition, the student should be treated as if 
he or she had not previously attended the institution. 

The Secretary proposes that a student should remain a 
first-time student until the student withdraws from the 
institution after attending at least one class, or completes the 
period of enrollment for which he or she has been charged, 
whichever occurs first. Therefore, the shortest amount of time a 
student could remain a first-time student is the period until he 
or she withdraws after attending one class. The longest amount 
of time a student could remain a first-time student is the period 
until his or her completion of the period of enrollment for which 
he or she has been charged. 

The Secretary proposes to adopt for all the Title IV, HEA 
programs the requirement currently found in the FFEL program 
regulations that an institution's payment to a lender of the 
portion of a refund allocable to a Title IV, HEA program cannot 
be delayed because of a delay in the return of equipment. The 
provision would apply to the portion of the refund due to any 
Title IV, HEA program. 

In the actual calculation of a refund under the 

pro rata

 
refund provisions of section 484B of the HEA, the amount of the 
refund is based on ``the portion of the period of enrollment for 
which the student has been charged that remains [after the 
student stopped attending].'' Under the law, ``the portion of the 
period of enrollment for which the student has been charged that 
remains'' in an educational program measured in credit hours is 
determined by dividing the number of weeks that the student did 
not complete by the total number of weeks in the program. For a 
clock-hour program, the determination is made by dividing the 
number of clock hours not completed by the total number of clock 
hours. For a correspondence program, the determination is made 
by dividing the number of lessons not completed by the total 
number of lessons. The Secretary has merely repeated that 
language here. The Secretary would like to note that ``the 
portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has 
been charged that remains'' is used to calculate the 

pro rata

 
refund to a student and is distinct from the determination of the 
60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for which 
the student has been charged that is used to determine whether 
the 

pro rata

 refund calculation is applicable. The definition of 
``the 60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for 
which the student has been charged'' was discussed earlier in the 
summary. 




Period of Enrollment for Which the Student Has Been Charged



Generally, the Secretary proposes to define ``the period of 
enrollment for which the student has been charged,'' as the actual 
period for which an institution charges a student. However, the 
Secretary proposes to establish a minimum period of enrollment 
for which the student has been charged to prevent institutions 
from establishing very short periods to minimize the program 
charges that would be subject to 

pro rata

 refunds for first-time 
students. In the case of an educational program that is measured 
in credit hours and uses semesters, trimesters, quarters, or 
other academic terms, the minimum period would be the semester, 
trimester, quarter, or other academic term. In the case of an 
educational program that is measured in credit hours and does not 
use semesters, trimesters, quarters, or other academic terms, or 
an educational program that is measured in clock hours, the 
minimum period would be the lesser of the length of the 
educational program or an academic year. This proposed 
definition is based on the current policy for the FFEL programs 
that sets minimum certification periods for loans. This policy 
was designed partly to prevent institutions from circumventing 
the refund provisions currently found in  668.22. The Secretary 
invites comments on whether other safeguards are needed to 
prevent institutions from circumventing the 

pro rata

 refund 
requirements.

The Secretary notes that there may be institutions that use different periods for categories of charges. For example,
an institution may charge by the academic year for tuition, but by the academic term for books and supplies. The Secretary,
therefore, proposes that, for purposes of determining refunds under this section, ``the period of enrollment for
which the student has been charged'' is the longest period for which the student is charged. The institution must include
any charges assessed the student for that period of enrollment or any portion of that period of enrollment in calculating
the refund. In the example above, since the institution charged for the entire academic year for tuition, the institution
would have to determine the actual total charge for books and supplies for the academic year in order to determine the
refund to the student. If, in the example above, the institution did not charge for books and supplies after the first
academic term, the institution would only include the charges for the first academic term when calculating the refund
for the academic year. 

The Secretary also proposes to use the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged, instead of the payment
period concept currently used, to determine the return of refunds and repayments to the Title IV, HEA programs. In
doing away with the concept of a payment period for purposes of the calculation of refunds, the Secretary also proposes
to do away with the practice of attributing Title IV, HEA program assistance when determining the return of refunds
and repayments to the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes that the premise for the calculation of a 

pro rata

 refund, (i.e., the refund is to be determined for the percentage of a period of enrollment for which the student has
been charged that remains) dictates that the institution should look at the amount of Title IV, HEA program assistance
received for that same percentage of the period. The Secretary believes that adopting the use of the period of enrollment
for which the student has been charged to determine the return of all refunds and repayments to the Title IV, HEA programs
greatly simplifies these determinations. 


Overpayments




The Secretary proposes to restructure and revise the current provisions relating to overpayments and the repayments
to Title IV, HEA programs of institutional refunds and overpayments. This preamble addresses those areas of these
current provisions that have been significantly revised. 

No changes are proposed to the procedures by which an institution determines if a student has received an overpayment
for noninstitutional costs. 



Repayments to Title IV, HEA Programs of Institutional Refunds and Overpayments



The Secretary proposes to remove the fraction that is currently used to determine the portion of the refund that an
institution must return to the Title IV, HEA programs. Section 485 of the HEA now specifies the order of return of refunds
to the Title IV, HEA programs. Further, the Technical Amendments of 1993 changed section 485 of the HEA to specify that
an institution is to return a refund to other sources of student assistance only after the refund has been returned
to the Title IV, HEA programs (see the discussion below concerning allocations.) The Secretary proposes to make a
conforming change by removing the fraction currently used to determine the portion of an overpayment that an institution
must return to the Title IV, HEA programs.

The June 8, 1993, final regulations modified the definition of institutional refund to require an institution to
exclude any unpaid charges owed to the institution by a student in determining the amount the institution may retain
for institutional charges. These proposed regulations would retain this provision. However, because the HEA now
specifies that an institution is permitted to subtract any unpaid charges owed by a student from the calculated refund
to the student in calculating a 

pro rata 

refund, the requirements of the June 8, 1993, final regulations regarding the treatment of unpaid charges have been
superseded and are inapplicable only in this case. That is, the institution is not required to exclude any unpaid balance
owed to the institution by the student when the institution determines the amount the institution may retain for institutional
charges when calculating a 

pro rata 

refund under section 484B of the HEA. The Secretary notes that the requirements of  668.22 of the June 8, 1993,
final regulations continue to be in effect for all other refunds calculated in accordance with section 484B of the
HEA. 

The Secretary proposes that if the amount of a refund owed to a student is $25 or less, the institution would not be required
to pay the refund. The Secretary believes that the administrative cost to institutions to make refunds of such a small
amount may be greater than the refunds themselves. This consideration is of particular concern at institutions that
have low tuition charges resulting in small refunds that are administratively burdensome and costly to the institution.




Allocation of Refunds and Overpayments 



Section 485 of the HEA specifies the order of return of refunds to the various sources of aid and to the student. A refund
owed to a student who received funds under any Title IV, HEA program is to be returned to the Title IV, HEA programs from
which the student received aid in the following order until the amounts received by the student from those programs
are eliminated. (1) The FFEL programs; (2) The FDSL Program; (3) The Federal Perkins Loan Program; (4) The Federal
Pell Grant Program; (5) The FSEOG Program; (6) All other sources of aid; (7) The student. The Secretary proposes to
make clear the longstanding policy that, after balances resulting from the FSEOG Program are eliminated, balances
on aid received from all other Title IV, HEA programs must be eliminated before the State and private sources of aid
are refunded. For consistency and to reduce administrative burden, the Secretary proposes to apply this order of
return to repayment of overpayments also except that, in accordance with current regulations, no amount of a repayment
may be allocated to the Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, and Federal SLS programs. 

The Secretary also would make clear that refunds would be returned to eliminate outstanding balances of Title IV,
HEA program aid received for the period of enrollment for which the refunds are made. The Secretary does not believe
that refunds should be used to eliminate, for example, outstanding balances on loans made for prior years. 

Section 485 of the HEA does not specify an order of return for refunds under the FFEL programs. The Secretary proposes
a specified order of return for FFEL program funds. Refunds would be returned to eliminate outstanding balances on:
(1) Federal SLS loans; (2) unsubsidized Federal Stafford loans; (3) subsidized Federal Stafford loans; and (4) Federal
PLUS loans, in that order. The Secretary believes that this order is beneficial to the student and that by mandating
the order of return of FFEL program funds, the interest of the student would be protected. The Secretary wishes to clarify
that when returning any FFEL program funds, an institution may return the gross amount of a loan (including the guaranty
and origination fee) if the institution so chooses, to serve as a deterrent to default on the small remaining amount.
This ``extra'' amount would be used to reduce the next source of aid on the list. 

The Secretary wishes to clarify that this order must be used if Title IV, HEA program funds are received, whether they
are applied toward institutional charges or disbursed to the student for living expenses. Even if all Title IV, HEA
program funds are disbursed to the student for living expenses, if a refund is owed when the student withdraws from
the institution, the refund must first be returned to the Title IV, HEA programs from which the student received aid
in the order specified.

Financial Aid 



No proposed changes are being made to the definition of financial aid. 



Refund Dates 



The Secretary proposes to apply to all the Title IV, HEA programs the definition (with some revisions) of ``withdrawal
date'' that currently applies to the FFEL programs. Only significant revisions are discussed. The definition of
``drop out date'' found in the current  668.22 would be incorporated into this definition. Currently, the FFEL
program regulations define the withdrawal date for a student who has not returned to an institution after the expiration
of an approved leave of absence as the first day of the leave of absence. The Secretary proposes to use, instead, the
last recorded date of class attendance by a student, as documented by the institution. The negotiators reached consensus
that it is fair to define the withdrawal date for a student who failed to return from an approved leave of absence in the
same way as the withdrawal date is defined for a student who drops out, because the student's period of attendance was
only extended on the understanding that he or she would be returning by a specified date. Further, the Secretary proposes
to clarify that a student who returns to an institution after the expiration of a leave of absence during an award year
or, for the FFEL programs, during a period of enrollment in which the student was granted the leave of absence, the student
may not receive additional Title IV, HEA program assistance for coursework that he or she has not completed. 

Currently, the FFEL program regulations define the withdrawal date for a student who is enrolled in an educational
program that consists predominantly of correspondence courses as 60 days after the due date of a required lesson that
the student failed to submit in accordance with the established schedule for lessons. The Secretary believes it is
more reasonable to define the withdrawal date in this case as the date of the last submission of a lesson by the student
if the student failed to submit the subsequent lesson in accordance with the established schedule for lessons. 

The Secretary proposes to add the requirement that a leave of absence may not exceed the length of time between the beginning
of the leave of absence and the institution's next period of enrollment, if the institution's next period of enrollment
after the start of the leave of absence begins more than thirty days after the beginning of the leave of absence due to
a period of nonenrollment (i.e., summer break) that prevents a student from enrolling in any coursework. The Secretary
proposes to add this provision to address graduate programs that do not have summer school sessions, thereby preventing
students from re-enrolling during this time. As the determination of a student's withdrawal date is necessary to
determine when a refund must be paid to a student, the Secretary believes it would be unfair to penalize an institution
for failure to pay timely refunds to a student who is deemed to have ``withdrawn'' only because he or she cannot return
to the institution from a leave of absence because classes are not in session. This provision would not additionally
limit the length of a student's leave of absence which could be up to sixty days or six months under the specified conditions.


The Secretary notes that this proposed definition of a leave of absence is a departure from current Federal Pell Grant
Program policy. Currently, for purposes of the Federal Pell Grant Program, a student who is granted a leave of absence
is considered to be no longer enrolled in the institution. The Secretary specifically request comments on the effects
of this proposed change on institutional procedures in relation to the Federal Pell Grant Program. 

The Secretary proposes to require an institution to pay a refund to a student within a specified period of time. The
Secretary believes that 30 days is a sufficient period of time for an institution to complete the administrative procedures
necessary for payment of a refund to a student. This requirement would be in addition to other requirements, which
would not change, for timely payment of refunds to a lender under the FFEL programs.

Section 668.23 Audits, Records, and Examinations 



This section includes provisions dealing with third-party servicers that were proposed in the NPRM published on
February 17, 1994 (in part II). The Secretary will not repeat the discussion of those provisions here. 

The Secretary proposes to extend the requirements of this section to foreign institutions as that term would be defined
in 34 CFR 600.52 of the regulations governing institutional eligibility under the HEA, published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6446). Participating institutions, like institutions in the United States, would accordingly
be required to have compliance audits performed, be subject to program reviews and other investigations, and maintain
records under the provisions of this section. The Secretary believes these steps provide the best means for evaluating
a foreign institution's compliance with the requirements for participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. 

Section 487(c) of the HEA requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations as may be necessary to provide for a compliance
audit of an institution with regard to any funds received under the Title IV, HEA programs on at least an annual basis.


The Secretary notes that, currently, the Department of Education could not properly and effectively review the volume
of audits that the Department would receive if every institution submitted an audit report on at least an annual basis.
The Secretary is concerned that an effort that extensive could diminish the resources needed to concentrate on timely
review of those institutions that pose the greatest financial risk to the government and the taxpayer. The Secretary
proposes to exempt from some or all of the audit requirements of this section certain categories of institutions that
pose no serious threat to the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary proposes that an institution,
other than an institution that is participating in the Title IV, HEA programs for the first time, have the audit performed
at least once every two years if it meets the following conditions: (1) The institution received less than $100,000
in total annual funding under the Title IV, HEA programs for the period covered by the audit; or (2) the institution
had no deficiencies identified in the audit report most recently submitted to the Department if that audit report
was submitted in a timely fashion. The Secretary bases this amount on the amount that would exempt entities from the
audit requirements of the Single Audit Act. The Secretary also believes that an institution that had no deficiencies
identified in its most recently submitted audit report will continue to perform at a level that does not warrant as
great a degree of oversight. In addition, an institution would not be required to have a compliance audit for any year
in which the institution receives less than $25,000 in total annual funding under the Title IV, HEA programs. This
proposal would establish in regulations the Secretary's current practice. Institutions that do not handle large
amounts of Title IV, HEA program funds do not put a large amount of Title IV, HEA program funds at risk. 

The Secretary notes that in spite of these exemptions the Secretary would reserve the right to require an institution
to have a compliance audit performed annually from any institution as the Secretary deems necessary. Further, the
Secretary proposes to require an institution participating in the Title IV, HEA programs for the first time to have
an audit performed at least once a year for the first five years of its participation. The Secretary believes it is important
to monitor an institution more closely if the institution has not previously participated in the programs and has
not had an opportunity to establish a record of consistent compliance with Title IV, HEA program requirements. 

Section 487(c) of the HEA requires that an audit performed in accordance with this section must cover the period since
the most recent audit. The Secretary proposes to specify, for clarification, that an institution's first audit for
a Title IV, HEA program must cover the institution's activities from the beginning of the institution's participation
in that program. 

Rather than continuing to specify deadlines in regulations for the submission of audit reports, the Secretary proposes
to require an institution to submit its audit to the Department's Inspector General by the deadlines established
in the audit guides developed by the Department's Office of Inspector General. Beyond establishing deadlines for
the submission of audit reports, these guides will provide for certain extensions beyond establishing deadlines
for valid reasons. These guides are developed in consultation with the academic community. 

Section 487(c) of the HEA requires the Secretary to make the results of compliance audits available to cognizant guaranty
agencies and eligible lenders under the FFEL programs, State agencies, and designated SPREs. The Secretary proposes
to add nationally recognized accrediting agencies to this list, because of the role of accrediting agencies in assisting
the Secretary with regard to institutional participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary proposes to
require institutions to provide copies of their audit reports to these entities upon request.

The Secretary proposes to add a requirement that specifies 
that an institution must establish and maintain, on a current 
basis, financial and other institutional records necessary to 
determine the institutional eligibility, financial 
responsibility, and administrative capability of the institution. 
The Secretary believes it is essential for the Department to have 
access to this information when evaluating an institution's 
compliance with the requirements of the provisions governing the 
institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and 
administrative capability of the institution. Further, an 
institution needs to maintain this information because, under its 
program participation agreement, the institution must agree to 
make the information available to appropriate authorities 
specified there (see the discussion on proposed  668.14). 

The Secretary proposes to require that all records required 
under the applicable Title IV, HEA program regulations be 
retained by the institution for at least five years from the time 
the record is established unless specific program regulations 
require that a record be kept for a period of time longer than 
five years. Five years is the standard period of time that 
institutions are required to keep most records under the Title 
IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes that this is a 
reasonable period of time to require institutions to maintain 
most records so that the Department is able to evaluate the past 
performance of an institution. 



Section 668.26 End of an Institution's Participation in the 
Title IV, HEA Programs 



The Secretary proposes to clarify the purpose of the section 
currently titled ``Loss of institutional eligibility to 
participate in the Title IV, HEA programs'' by changing the title 
to ``End of an institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA 
programs.'' The Secretary proposes to specify the date on which 
an institution's participation ends under a variety of 
circumstances to reflect statutory changes and to make clear 
existing practice. The Secretary has clarified in these proposed 
regulations the end of participation date currently used by the 
Department to be the date that: The institution closes or stops 
providing educational programs (the Secretary proposes, 
consistent with provisions proposed to be included in the 
regulations governing institutional eligibility under the HEA, to 
specify that this closure must be for a reason other than a 
normal vacation period or a natural disaster that directly 
affects the institution or the institution's students); the 
institution loses its institutional eligibility under 
34 CFR part 600; the institution's participation is terminated 
under the proceedings in subpart G of this part; or the

The Secretary proposes to specify that an institution's 
participation ends on the date that an institution's period of 
participation, as specified under proposed  668.13 governing 
certification procedures, expires, or the institution's 
provisional certification is revoked in accordance with the 
procedures outlined in that proposed section. This change would 
be made pursuant to provisions of section 498(g) and (h) of the 
HEA. 

The Secretary proposes to specify that an institution's 
participation in the FFEL programs ends on the date that the 
Secretary has determined that the institution's cohort default 
rate, for each of the three most recent fiscal years for which 
the Secretary has determined the institution's rate, is equal to 
or greater than the threshold rates listed under proposed 
 668.17(c)(2). This change simply makes the provisions of 
proposed  668.26 consistent with those of proposed  668.17. 

Finally, the Secretary proposes to specify that an 
institution's participation ends on the date that the Secretary 
receives a notice from the appropriate SPRE that the 
institution's participation should be withdrawn. This change is 
mandated by section 494C(h) of the HEA. 

The Secretary proposes to add to the requirements for an 
institution when the institution's participation in a Title IV, 
HEA program ends, that the institution shall, if the 
institution's participation in the NEISP or SSIG Program ended, 
inform immediately the State in which the institution is located 
of that fact. Further, notwithstanding the requirements for the 
treatment of Title IV, HEA program funds found in this section, 
the institution must follow the instructions of that State 
concerning the end of that participation. The Secretary also 
proposes to add that if the institution's participation in all 
the Title IV, HEA programs end has ended, the institution must 
inform the Secretary of how the institution will arrange for the 
collection of any outstanding loans made under the National 
Defense/Direct Student Loan and ICL programs. These changes are 
necessary to make the Student Assistance General Provisions 
regulations consistent with specific program regulations. 



Subpart G_Fine, Limitation, Suspension and Termination 
Proceedings

Section 668.81 Scope and Special Definitions 



The Secretary proposes to make technical changes to this 
section consistent with changes proposed throughout these 
proposed regulations. The Secretary proposes to clarify in this 
section that the procedures under this section do not apply in 
the case of an institution that fails to qualify for provisional 
certification because the institution does not meet the factors 
of financial responsibility. In addition, the procedures under 
this section would not apply in the case of an institution where 
the institution's period of provisional certification has 
expired, nor would they apply in the case of an institution that 
has its provisional certification revoked. These changes are 
necessary to make the scope of Subpart G of these regulations 
consistent with provisions in section 498(g) and (h) of the HEA. 



Section 690.83 Submission of Reports



Section 487(c)(7) of the HEA provides that, if, in the 
course of any audit conducted after December 31, 1988 pursuant to 
the audit requirements of section 487(c) of the HEA and 
Department regulations implementing those requirements, the 
Department discovers or is informed of any Title IV, HEA program 
assistance (specifically, Federal Pell Grant Program funds) that 
an institution has provided to its students in accordance with 
program requirements, but the institution has not previously 
received credit or reimbursement for these disbursements, the 
institution may offset the amount of those disbursements against 
liabilities owed under the audit, or if no liabilities arise from 
the audit, may receive reimbursement from the Department for 
those amounts. 

The HEA requires that the development of NPRMs for 
implementation of changes made by the Amendments to Parts B 
(Federal Family Education Loan programs), G (general provisions 
relating to the student assistance programs) or H (Program 
Integrity Triad) of Title IV of the HEA, is subject to the 
negotiated rulemaking process. Although this provision relates 
directly to the Federal Pell Grant Program, it is contained in 
Part G of the HEA. Therefore, it has been included in this NPRM 
instead of the Federal Pell Grant Program NPRM, which was not 
subject to the negotiated rulemaking process.

The Secretary proposes that, notwithstanding the regulatory 
requirements for submission of reports, if an institution 
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the 
institution has provided Federal Pell Grants in accordance with 
the Federal Pell Grant Program regulations, but has not received 
credit or payment for those grants, the institution may receive 
payment or a reduction in accountability for those grants. The 
institution would have to demonstrate that it qualifies for a 
credit or payment by means of a finding contained in an audit 
report as initially submitted to the Department that was 
conducted after December 31, 1988. The audit would have to have 
been timely submitted in accordance with 34 CFR 668.23(c), with 
respect to grants made during the period of that audit. The 
Secretary specifies that, in determining whether the institution 
qualifies for a payment or reduction in accountability, the 
Secretary would take into account any liabilities of the 
institution arising from that audit or any other source. The 
Secretary collects those liabilities by offset in accordance with 
34 CFR part 30. 


Executive Order 12866 


These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance 
with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the 
Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this 
regulatory action. 
The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations 
are those resulting from statutory requirements and those 
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering 
this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens specifically 
associated with information collection requirements, if any, are 
identified and explained elsewhere in this preamble under the 
heading 

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both 
quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations, the 
Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed 
regulations justify the costs. 
The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory 
action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal 
governments in the exercise of their governmental function. 
To assist the Department in complying with the specific 
requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites 
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce 
any potential costs or increase potential benefits resulting from 
these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and 
efficient administration of the program. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 


The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations 
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. The small entities affected by these 
proposed regulations are small institutions of postsecondary 
education. These regulations make modifications that reduce 
potential abuse in the Title IV, HEA programs. These changes 
will not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require 
unnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations would impose 
minimal requirements to ensure the proper expenditure of program 
funds. 


Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 


Sections 668.8, 668.12, 668.13, 668.14, 668.15, 668.16, 
668.17, 668.22, 668.23, 668.26, 690.83 and Appendix A contain 
information collection requirements. As required by the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will 
submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). 
This NPRM contains provisions that would affect 
postsecondary institutions who wish to participate in the Title 
IV student financial assistance programs. Annual public 
reporting and recordkeeping burden contained in the collection of 
information proposed in these regulations is estimated to be 
10,488 hours, including the time for searching existing data 
sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, completing 
and reviewing the collection of information, and submitting 
materials. 
Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on 
the information collection requirements should direct them to the 
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 3002, New 
Executive Office Building, Washington D.C. 20503; Attention 
Daniel J. Chenok.


Invitation to Comment 


Interested persons are invited to submit comments and 
recommendations regarding these proposed regulations. 
All comments submitted in response to these proposed 
regulations will be available for public inspection, during and 
after the comment period, in room 4318, Regional Office Building 
3, 7th and D Streets, SW., Washington, DC, between the hours 
of 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week 
except Federal holidays. 


Assessment of Educational Impact 


The Secretary particularly requests comments on whether the 
proposed regulations in this document would require transmission 
of information that is being gathered by or is available from any 
other agency or authority of the United States.

attained the adequate proficiency.

(4) An ESL program that qualifies as an eligible program 
under this paragraph is eligible for purposes of the Federal Pell

1099c, and 1141) 






9. Newly redesignated  668.15, is revised to read as follows: 


 668.15 

Factors of financial responsibility. 



(a) 

General.

 To begin and to continue to participate in 
any Title IV, HEA program, an institution must demonstrate to the 
Secretary that the institution is financially responsible under 
the requirements established in this section. 

(b) 

General standards of financial responsibility. 

In 
general, the Secretary considers an institution to be financially 
responsible only if it_

(1) Is able to provide the services described in its 
official publications and statements; 

(2) Is able to provide the administrative resources 
necessary to comply with the requirements of this subpart; 

(3) Is able to meet all of its financial obligations, 
including but not limited to_

(i) Refunds that it is required to make; and 

(ii) Repayments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts 
incurred in programs administered by the Secretary; 

(4) Is current on any debt service payments; 

(5) Maintains, at all times, a minimum cash reserve equal 
to at least 10 percent of the institution's total deferred 
tuition income at the end of the institution's most recent fiscal 
year for repayment of refunds. The cash reserve must be 
maintained in a cash reserve account, consisting of cash or cash 
equivalents as defined in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles; 

(6) Has not had, as part of the audit report for the 
institution's most recently completed fiscal year_

(i) A statement by the accountant acknowledging substantial 
doubt about the institution's ability to continue operation as a 
going concern; 

(ii) A finding of unauthorized use of donor restricted net 
assets to meet current operating expenses; and 

(iii) A disclaimed or adverse opinion by the accountant; 

(7) For a for-profit institution_(i) Demonstrates at the end of its latest fiscal year, a ratio of current assets to
current liabilities of at least 
1.25:1. For purposes of this section, the calculation of this 
ratio must exclude uncollateralized loans receivable from owners 
and related parties. Should application of paragraph (b)(5) of 
this section cause a portion of the institution's cash reserves 
to be classified as a restricted asset, those cash reserves may 
be included in current assets in calculating the institution's 
current ratio; 

(ii) Has not had operating losses over both of its two 
latest fiscal years that causes an operating loss exceeding 10 
percent of the institution's previous year's tangible net worth 
for its latest fiscal year. For purposes of this subsection, an 
operating loss will be calculated by subtracting from total net 
income: extraordinary gains or losses; income or losses from 
discontinued operations; prior period adjustments; and, the 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, estimate or 
reporting entity. The calculation of tangible net worth must 
exclude all assets defined as intangible in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles; and 

(iii) Had, for its latest fiscal year, a positive tangible 
net worth. For purposes of this section, a positive tangible net 
worth occurs if the institution's tangible assets exceed its 
liabilities. The calculation of tangible net worth must exclude 
all assets defined as intangible in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. In applying this standard, the 
Secretary may consider the effect of extraordinary gains or 
losses resulting from unusual and infrequent events, and may take 
into consideration the cumulative effect of changes in accounting 
principle, estimate or reporting entity to the extent that such a 
change results in a more accurate representation of the 
institution's financial position in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles; 

(8) For a nonprofit institution_(i) Prepares a classified statement of financial position in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles or provides the required information as footnotes to the audit; 

(ii) Demonstrates at the end of its latest fiscal year, a 
ratio of current assets to current liabilities of at least 1:1; 

(iii) Has not had, at the end of its latest fiscal year, a 
decrease in total net assets of such significance that, if 
continued, would result in a ratio of current assets to current 
liabilities of less than 1:1. The Secretary may consider the 
effect of extraordinary gains or losses resulting from unusual 
and infrequent events, and may take into consideration the 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, estimate 
or reporting entity to the extent that such a change results in a 
more accurate representation of the institution's financial 
position in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. For purposes of this analysis, the Secretary may 
exclude unrealized gains and losses on investments that have been 
reported as changes in unrestricted net assets; and 

(9) For a public institution, has its liabilities backed by 
the full faith and credit of a State, or by an equivalent 
governmental entity.

(c)

affiliated with an institution.

institution or any member or members of the person's family alone 
or together_

(i)(A) Exercises or exercised substantial control over 
another institution or a third-party servicer that owes a 
liability for a violation of a Title IV, HEA program requirement; 
or 

(B) Owes a liability for a violation of a Title IV, HEA 
program requirement; and 

(ii) That person, family member, institution, or servicer 
is not making payments in accordance with an agreement to repay 
that liability; or 

(2) The institution has_

(i) Been limited, suspended, terminated, or entered into a 
settlement agreement to resolve a limitation, suspension, or 
termination action initiated by the Secretary or a guaranty 
agency (as defined in 34 CFR part 682) within the preceding five 
years; 

(ii) Had_

(A) An audit finding, during its two most recent audits of 
its conduct of the Title IV, HEA programs, that resulted in the 
institution's being required to repay an amount greater than five 
percent of the funds that the institution received under the 
Title IV, HEA programs for any award year covered by the audit; 
or 

(B) A program review finding, during its two most recent 
program reviews, of its conduct of the Title IV, HEA programs 
that resulted in the institution's being required to repay an 
amount greater than five percent of the funds that the 
institution received under the Title IV, HEA programs for any 
award year covered by the program review; 

(iii) Been cited during the preceding five years for 
failure to submit acceptable audit reports required under this 
part or individual Title IV, HEA program regulations in a timely 
fashion; or 

(iv) Failed to address satisfactorily any compliance 
problems identified in program review or audit reports based upon 
a final decision of the Secretary issued pursuant to subpart G or 
subpart H of this part. 

(d)

responsibility.

standard in paragraph (b)(5) of this section if the Secretary 
determines that the institution_

acceptable to the Secretary and ensures that the institution is 
able to pay all required refunds; and 

(ii) Contributes to that tuition recovery fund. 

(2) The Secretary considers an institution to be

credit that is acceptable and payable to the Secretary equal to 
not less than one-half of the Title IV, HEA program funds 
received by the institution during the last complete award year 
for which figures are available; or 

(ii) Establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary, with 
the support of a financial statement submitted in accordance with 
paragraph (e) of this section, that the institution has 
sufficient resources to ensure against the precipitous closure of 
the institution, including the ability to meet all of its 
financial obligations, including refunds of institutional charges 
and repayments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts 
incurred in programs administered by the Secretary. 

(3) An institution is not required to meet the standard in 
paragraphs (b)(7)(i) and (b)(8)(ii) of this section if the 
institution is an institution that provides a 2-year or 4-year 
educational program for which the institution awards an associate 
or baccalaureate degree that demonstrates to the satisfaction of 
the Secretary that_

(i) There is not reasonable doubt as to its continued 
solvency and ability to deliver quality educational services; 

(ii) It is current in its payment of all current 
liabilities, including student refunds, repayments to the

failure to meet the current operating ratio requirement.

if_

Documentation of financial responsibility.

 (1) The 
Secretary determines whether an institution is financially 
responsible under this section by evaluating documents submitted 
by the institution and information obtained from other sources, 
including outside sources of credit information. To enable the 
Secretary to make this determination, the institution shall 
submit to the Secretary for its two latest complete fiscal years, 
a set of financial statements of the institution, prepared in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
appropriate to that institution as established by the American 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants, audited by an 
independent certified public accountant in accordance with 
generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly including 
such tests of the institution's accounting records and such other 
auditing procedures that the independent auditor considered 
necessary in the circumstances. The Secretary may also require 
the institution to submit or otherwise make available the 
accountant's work papers. If an institution submits audited 
consolidated financial statements of its parent corporation for 
the Secretary to use in determining the institution's level of 
financial responsibility, the consolidated financial statements 
must be supplemented with consolidating schedules showing the 
consolidation of each of the parent corporation's subsidiaries 
(each separate institution participating in the Title IV, HEA 
programs must be shown separately), intercompany eliminating 
entries, and derived consolidated totals. The Secretary may also 
require the institution to submit additional substantive 
information. 

(2) An institution shall submit the documents required in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section annually within four months

10. Newly designated  668.16 is revised to read as follows: 


 668.16 

Standards of administrative capability. 


To begin and to continue to participate in any Title IV, HEA 
program, an institution shall demonstrate to the Secretary that 
the institution is capable of adequately administering that 
program under each of the standards established in this section. 
The Secretary considers an institution to have that 
administrative capability if the institution_
(a) Administers the Title IV, HEA programs in accordance 
with any statutory provisions of or applicable to Title IV of the 
HEA, any regulatory provisions prescribed under that statutory 
authority, or any applicable special arrangement, agreement or 
limitation; 
(b)(1) Designates a capable individual to be responsible 
for administering all the Title IV, HEA programs in which it 
participates and for coordinating those programs with the 
institution's other Federal and non-Federal programs of student 
financial assistance. The Secretary considers an individual to 
be ``capable'' under this paragraph if the individual is certified 
by the State in which the institution is located, if the State 
requires certification of financial aid administrators. The 
Secretary may consider other factors in determining whether an 
individual is capable, including, but not limited to, the 
individual's successful completion of Title IV, HEA program 
training provided or approved by the Secretary; 
(2) Uses an adequate number of qualified persons to 
administer the Title IV, HEA programs in which the institution 
participates. The Secretary considers the following factors to 
determine whether an institution uses an adequate number of 
qualified persons_
(i) The number and types of programs in which the 
institution participates; 
(ii) The number of applications evaluated; 
(iii) The number of students who receive any student 
financial assistance at the institution and the amount of funds 
administered; 
(iv) The financial aid delivery system used by the 
institution; and 
(v) The degree of office automation used by the institution 
in the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs; 
(3) Communicates to the individual designated to be 
responsible for administering Title IV, HEA programs, all the 
information received by any institutional office that bears on a 
student's eligibility for Title IV, HEA program assistance; and 
(4) Has written procedures for or written information 
indicating_
(i) The nature and frequency of communication of pertinent 
information among all the offices that have an impact on the 
administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. Examples of this 
information may include information on a student's admissions 
status, enrollment status, attendance (if applicable), prior or 
concurrent attendance at another postsecondary institution, 
satisfactory academic progress, and payment or disbursement 
status; and

(ii) The responsibilities of the various offices with 
respect to the approval, disbursement, and delivery of Title IV, 
HEA program assistance and the preparation and submission of 
reports to the Secretary; 
(c)(1) Administers Title IV, HEA programs with adequate 
checks and balances in its system of internal controls; and 
(2) Divides the functions of authorizing payments and 
disbursing or delivering funds so that no office has 
responsibility for both functions with respect to any particular 
student aided under the programs. For example, the functions of 
authorizing payments and disbursing or delivering funds must be 
divided so that for any particular student aided under the 
programs, the two functions are carried out by at least two 
organizationally independent individuals who are not members of 
the same family, as defined in  668.15, or who do not together 
exercise substantial control, as defined in  668.15, over the 
institution; 
(d) Establishes and maintains records required under this 
part and the individual Title IV, HEA program regulations; 
(e) Establishes, publishes, and applies reasonable 
standards for measuring whether an otherwise eligible student is 
maintaining satisfactory progress in his or her educational 
program. The Secretary considers an institution's standards to 
be reasonable if the standards_
(1) Conform with the standards of satisfactory progress of 
the nationally recognized accrediting agency that accredits or 
preaccredits the institution, if the institution is accredited 
or preaccredited, and if the agency has those standards; 
(2) For a student enrolled in an eligible program who is to 
receive assistance under a Title IV, HEA program, are the same as 
or stricter than the institution's standards for a student 
enrolled in the same educational program who is not receiving 
assistance under a Title IV, HEA program; 
(3) Include the following elements: 
(i) Grades, work projects completed, or comparable factors 
that are measurable against a norm. 
(ii) A maximum time frame in which a student must complete 
his or her educational program. The time frame must be_
(A) Based on the student's enrollment status; 
(B) For an undergraduate program, no longer than 150 
percent of the published length of the educational program; and 
(C) Divided into increments, not to exceed the lesser of 
one academic year or one-half the published length of the 
educational program. 
(iii) A schedule established by the institution designating 
the minimum percentage or amount of work that a student must 
successfully complete at the end of each increment to complete 
his or her educational program within the maximum time frame. 
(iv) A determination at the end of each increment by the 
institution whether the student has successfully completed the 
appropriate percentage or amount of work according to the 
established schedule. 
(v) Consistent application of standards to all students 
within categories of students, e.g., full-time, part-time, 
undergraduate, and graduate students, and educational programs 
established by the institution. 
(vi) Specific policies defining the effect of course 
incompletes, withdrawals, repetitions, and noncredit remedial 
courses on satisfactory progress. 
(vii) Specific procedures under which a student may appeal 
a determination that the student is not making satisfactory 
progress. 
(viii) Specific procedures for reinstatement of aid; and 
(4) Meet or exceed the requirements of  668.7(c); 
(f) Develops and applies an adequate system to identify and 
resolve discrepancies in the information that the institution 
receives from different sources with respect to a student's 
application for financial aid under Title IV, HEA programs. In 
determining whether the institution's system is adequate, the 
Secretary considers whether the institution obtains and 
reviews_ 
(1) All student aid applications, need analysis documents, 
Statements of Educational Purpose, Statements of Registration 
Status, and eligibility notification documents presented by or on 
behalf of each applicant; 
(2) Any documents, including any copies of State and 
Federal income tax returns, that are normally collected by the 
institution to verify information received from the student or 
other sources; and 
(3) Any other information normally available to the 
institution regarding a student's citizenship, previous 
educational experience, or other factors relating to the 
student's eligibility for funds under the Title IV, HEA programs; 
(g) Refers to the Office of Inspector General of the 
Department of Education for investigation_
(1) After conducting the review of an application provided 
for under paragraph (f) of this section, any information 
indicating that an applicant for Title IV, HEA program assistance 
may have engaged in fraud or other criminal misconduct in 
connection with his or her application. The type of information 
that an institution must refer is that which is relevant to the 
eligibility of the applicant for Title IV, HEA program 
assistance, or the amount of the assistance. Examples of this 
type of information are_
(i) False claims of independent student status; 
(ii) False claims of citizenship; 
(iii) Use of false identities; 
(iv) Forgery of signatures or certifications; and 
(v) False statements of income; and

(2) Any information indicating that any employee, 
third-party servicer, or other agent of the institution that acts 
in a capacity that involves the administration of the Title IV, 
HEA programs, or the receipt of funds under those programs, may 
have engaged in fraud, misrepresentation, conversion or breach of 
fiduciary responsibility, or other illegal conduct involving the 
Title IV, HEA programs. The type of information that an 
institution must refer is that which is relevant to the 
eligibility and funding of the institution and its students 
through the Title IV, HEA programs; 

(h) Provides adequate financial aid counseling to eligible 
students who apply for Title IV, HEA program assistance. In 
determining whether an institution provides adequate counseling, 
the Secretary considers whether its counseling includes 
information regarding_

(1) The source and amount of each type of aid offered; 

(2) The method by which aid is determined and disbursed, 
delivered, or applied to a student's account; and 

(3) The rights and responsibilities of the student with 
respect to enrollment at the institution and receipt of financial 
aid. This information includes the institution's refund policy, 
its standards of satisfactory progress, and other conditions that 
may alter the student's aid package;

(i) Has and implements a plan, designed by the institution 
for the student population served by the institution, that 
demonstrates that for an institution that enrolls a significant 
number of students with special support service needs (including, 
but not limited to, child care and transportation), the 
institution has provided these students with information about 
how to access to appropriate support services that will foster 
the students' opportunity to complete the educational program; 

(j) Has procedures for receiving, investigating, and 
resolving student complaints; 

(k) If the stated objectives of an educational program of 
the institution are to prepare a student for gainful employment 
in a recognized occupation_

(1) Demonstrates a reasonable relationship between the 
length of the program and entry level requirements for the 
recognized occupation for which the program prepares the student. 
The Secretary considers the relationship to be reasonable if the 
number of clock hours provided in the program does not exceed by 
more than 50 percent the minimum number of clock hours required 
for training in the recognized occupation for which the program 
prepares the student, as established by the State in which the 
program is offered, if the State has established such a 
requirement; and 

(2) Establishes the need for the training for the student 
to obtain employment in the recognized occupation for which the 
program prepares the student; 

(l) Makes readily available to students information on_

(1) Market and job availability for occupational, 
professional, and vocational educational programs offered by the 
institution; and 

(2) The relationship of mandatory and elective course 
components of occupational, professional, and vocational 
educational programs to specific licensure standards of the State 
in which the institution is located in specific occupations; 

(m) Has advertising, promotion, and student recruitment 
practices that accurately reflect the content and objectives of 
the educational programs offered by the institution; 

(n) Has provided all program and fiscal reports and 
financial statements required for compliance with the provisions 
of this part and the individual program regulations in a timely 
manner; 

(o) Has no outstanding liabilities owed to the Secretary, 
unless the institution has made satisfactory arrangements to 
repay those liabilities and is honoring those arrangements; 

(p) Shows no evidence of significant problems identified in_

(1) Reviews of the institution conducted by the Secretary, 
the Department of Education's Office of Inspector General, 
nationally recognized accrediting agencies, guaranty agencies as 
defined in 34 CFR part 682, State postsecondary review entities 
designated under subpart 1 of part H of Title IV of the HEA, the 
State agency or official by whose authority the institution is 
legally authorized to provide postsecondary education, or any 
other law enforcement agency; or 

(2) Any findings made in any criminal, civil, or 
administrative proceeding; 

(q) Is not, and does not have any principal or affiliate of 
the institution (as those terms are defined in 34 CFR part 85) 
that is_

(1) Debarred or suspended under Executive Order 
(E.O.) 12549 (3 CFR, 1986 Comp., p. 189) or the Federal 
Acquisition Regulations (FAR), 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; or 

(2) Engaging in any activity that is a cause under 
34 CFR 85.305 or 85.405 for debarment or suspension under

State in which the institution is located, by the Secretary 
regarding completion rates, placement rates, and pass rates on 
required State examinations;

(t)(1) For an institution that has a common academic year 
for a majority of its students, does not have more than 33 
percent of the regular students who are enrolled on the first day 
of classes of an academic year withdraw from enrollment at that 
institution during that academic year; or 

(2) For an institution that does not have a common academic

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1082, 1085, 1094, 1099c; Section 4 of 
Pub. L. 95-452, 92 Stat. 1101-1109; E.O. 12549 (3 CFR, 1986

11. Newly designated  668.17 is revised to read as follows: 



 668.17 

Default reduction measures. 



(a) 

Default rates.

 If the Federal Stafford loan and 
Federal SLS cohort default rate for an institution exceeds 20 
percent for any fiscal year, the Secretary notifies the 
institution of that rate and may, after consultation as the 
Secretary deems appropriate with cognizant guaranty agencies take 
one or more of the following actions: 

(1) Initiate a proceeding under Subpart G of this part to 
limit, suspend, or terminate the participation of the institution 
in the Title IV, HEA programs, if_

(i) The institution's Federal Stafford loan and Federal SLS 
cohort default rate exceeds 40 percent for any fiscal year after 
1989 and has not been reduced by an increment of at least 5 
percent from its rate for the previous fiscal year (e.g., a 
50-percent rate was not reduced to 45 percent or below); or 

(ii) The institution's Federal Stafford loan and Federal 
SLS cohort default rate exceeds_

(A) 60 percent for fiscal year 1989; 

(B) 55 percent for fiscal year 1990; 

(C) 50 percent for fiscal year 1991; 

(D) 45 percent for fiscal year 1992; or 

(E) 40 percent for any fiscal year after fiscal year 1992. 

(2) To help the Secretary make a preliminary determination 
as to the appropriate action to be taken by the Secretary 
regarding the institution, require the institution to submit to 
the Secretary and one or more guaranty agencies, as defined in 34 
CFR 682, any information relating to that determination, as 
reasonably required by the Secretary, within a time frame 
specified by the Secretary. 

(b) 

Default management plan.

 If the Federal Stafford loan 
and Federal SLS cohort default rate for an institution_

(1) Is greater than 20 percent but less than or equal to 40 
percent, the institution must submit a default management plan 
that implements the measures described in appendix D of this 
part. An institution that wishes to submit a default management 
plan that deviates from the measures described in appendix D of this part must 
submit a justification for the deviation that includes a 
rationale explaining why the measures from which the plan 
deviates are not appropriate for the institution's specific 
situation. The institution must implement the default management 
plan upon notification from the Secretary that the plan has been 
approved; or 

(2) Exceeds 40 percent for any fiscal year, the institution 
must implement all of the default management reduction measures 
described in appendix D of this part no later than 60 days after 
the institution receives the Secretary's notification of the 
institution's cohort default rate. An institution is not 
required to submit any written plans to the Secretary or a 
guaranty agency unless the Secretary or guaranty agency 
specifically requests the institution to do so. 

(c) 

End of participation.

 (1) Except as provided in 
paragraph (c)(6) of this section, an institution's participation 
in the FFEL programs ends if the Secretary determines that the 
institution's cohort default rate, for each of the three most 
recent fiscal years for which the Secretary has determined the 
institution's rate, is equal to or greater than the applicable 
threshold rates. 

(2) For purposes of the determinations made under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the threshold rates are_

(i) 35 percent for each of fiscal years 1991 and 1992; 

(ii) 30 percent for fiscal year 1993; and

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940228-1-00136 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940228-1-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(iii) 25 percent for fiscal year 1994 and all subsequent fiscal years. 

(3) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, 
an institution whose participation ends under paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section may not participate in the FFEL programs beginning 
with the date that the institution receives notification from the 
Secretary that its cohort default rate exceeds the thresholds 
specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and continuing_

(i) For the remainder of the fiscal year in which the 
Secretary determines that the institution's participation has 
ended under paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and 

(ii) For the two subsequent fiscal years. 

(4) An institution whose participation in the FFEL programs 
ends under paragraph (c)(1) of this section may not participate 
in the FFEL programs until the institution_

(i) Receives notification from the Secretary that the 
notice ending the institution's participation is withdrawn 
pursuant to paragraph (d)(6) of this section; or 

(ii) Following the period described in paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section, satisfies the Secretary that the institution meets 
all requirements for participation in the FFEL programs and 
executes a new agreement with the Secretary for participation in 
the FFEL programs. 

(5) If the Secretary withdraws the notification of an 
institution's loss of participation pursuant to paragraph (d)(6) 
of this section, the participation of the institution is restored 
effective as of the date that the institution received 
notification from the Secretary of the loss of participation. 

(6) Until July 1, 1994, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section do not apply to a historically black college or 
university within the meaning of section 322(2) of the HEA, a 
tribally controlled community college within the meaning of 
section 2(a)(4) of the Tribally Controlled Community College 
Assistance Act of 1978 (25 U.S.C. 1801(a)(4)), or a Navajo community college under the 
Navajo Community College Act (25 U.S.C. 640a-640c). 

(7)(i) If the Secretary's designated department official 
receives written notice from an institution whose participation 
ends under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, within seven 
calendar days from the date on which the institution receives 
notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate 
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, that the institution intends to appeal the end of 
participation under paragraph (d) of this section, the 
institution may, notwithstanding  668.26(d) continue to 
participate in the FFEL programs until no later than the 30th 
calendar day following the date on which the institution receives 
notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate 
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, except as provided in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this 
section. 

(ii) If an institution satisfies the conditions in 
paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section for participating in the 
FFEL programs until the 30th calendar day following the date on 
which the institution receives notification from the Secretary 
that its cohort default rate exceeds the thresholds specified in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the institution may, 
notwithstanding  668.26(d), continue to participate in the FFEL 
programs after that date, until the Secretary issues a decision 
on the institution's appeal, if the institution, by the 30th 
calendar day following the date on which the institution receives 
notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate 
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, files an appeal that is complete in all respects in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. However, the 
appeal of an institution relying on paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
section is not considered incomplete by virtue of a guaranty 
agency's not having yet complied with_or having failed to comply 
with_34 CFR 682.401(b)(14), which requires the agency to respond 
to an institution's request for verification of data within 15 
working days, if the institution submitted that request within 10 
working days from the date on which the institution received 
notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate 
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, and the institution simultaneously submitted a copy of 
that request to the Secretary's designated Department official. 
When the institution receives the guaranty agency's response, to 
complete its appeal, the institution must submit the verified 
data to the Secretary's designated Department official within 
five working days in order to continue participating in the FFEL 
programs until the Secretary issues a decision on the 
institution's appeal. 

(d) 

Appeal procedures. 

(1) An institution may appeal the 
loss of participation in the FFEL programs under paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section by submitting an appeal in writing to the 
Secretary's designated Department official that is postmarked no 
later than 30 days after it receives notification of its loss of 
participation. The institution may appeal on the grounds that_

(i)(A) The calculation of the institution's cohort default 
rate for any of the three fiscal years relevant to the end of 
participation is not accurate; and 

(B) A recalculation with corrected data verified by the 
cognizant guaranty agency or agencies would produce a cohort 
default rate for any of those fiscal years that is below the 
threshold percentage specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section;

(ii) The institution meets the following criteria: 

(A)(

1

) Fifteen percent or fewer of the institution's 
students who are enrolled on at least a half-time basis receive 
Federal Stafford or Federal SLS loans for any twenty-four month 
period ending not more than six months prior to the date the 
institution submits its appeal; or 

(

2

) For any twenty-four month period ending not more than 
six months prior to the date the institution submits its appeal, 
two-thirds or more of the institution's students who are enrolled 
on at least a half-time basis are individuals from disadvantaged 
economic backgrounds, as established by documentary evidence 
submitted by the institution. Such evidence must relate to 
qualification by those students for an Expected Family 
Contribution (EFC) (formerly institutions were required to use 
the Pell Grant index), as defined in 34 CFR 690.2, of zero for 
the applicable award year or attribution to those students of an 
adjusted gross income of the student and his or her parents or 
spouse, if applicable, reported for the applicable award year of 
less than the poverty level, as determined under criteria 
established by the Department of Health and Human Services; and 

(B)(

1

) Two-thirds or more of the institution's students who 
were enrolled on a full-time basis in any twenty-four month 
period ending not more than six months prior to the date the 
institution submits its appeal completed the educational programs 
in which they were enrolled. This rate is calculated by 
comparing the number of students who were classified as full-time 
at their initial enrollment in the institution, and were 
originally scheduled, at the time of enrollment, to complete 
their programs within the relevant twenty-four month period, with 
the number of these students who received a degree, certificate, 
or other recognized educational credential from the institution; 
transferred from the institution to a higher level educational 
program at another institution for which the prior program 
provided substantial preparation; or, at the end of the twenty-
four month period, remained enrolled and were making satisfactory 
academic progress toward completion of their educational 
programs. The calculation does not include students who did not 
complete their programs because they left the institution to 
serve in the armed forces; and 

(

2

) The institution had a placement rate of two-thirds or 
more with respect to its former students who received a degree, 
certificate, or other recognized educational credential from the 
institution in any twenty-four month period ending not more than 
six months prior to the date the institution submits its appeal. 
This rate is calculated by determining the percentage of all 
those students who, based on evidence submitted by the 
institution, are on that date employed, or had been employed for 
at least 13 weeks following receipt of the credential from the 
institution, in the occupation for which the institution provided 
training, or are enrolled or had been enrolled for at least 13 
weeks following receipt of the credential from the institution, 
in a higher level educational program at another institution for 
which the prior educational program provided substantial 
preparation. 

(2) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) of this 
section, a student is originally scheduled, at the time of 
enrollment, to complete the educational program on the date when 
the student will have been enrolled in the program for the amount 
of time normally required to complete the program. The ``amount 
of time normally required to complete the program'' is the period 
of time specified in the institution's enrollment contract, 
catalog, or other materials, for completion of the program by a 
full-time student, or the period of time between the date of 
enrollment and the anticipated graduation date appearing on the 
student's loan application, if any, whichever is less. 

(3) An appeal submitted under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
section is considered to be filed in a timely manner if the 
institution submits a letter of appeal by the 30-day deadline 
notifying the Secretary's designated department official that it 
is appealing on this basis, including with that letter a copy of 
the institution's request to each cognizant guaranty agency for 
verification of the cohort default rate data, and submits the 
verified data to the Secretary's designated Department official 
within five working days of its receipt from the guaranty agency. 
For purposes of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the 
institution's appeal is not considered complete until the 
institution submits the verified data to the Secretary's 
designated Department official. 

(4) The Secretary issues a decision on the institution's 
appeal within 45 days after the institution submits a complete 
appeal that addresses the applicable criteria in 
paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section to the 
Secretary's designated Department official. 

(5) The Secretary's decision is based on the consideration 
of written material submitted by the institution. No oral 
hearing is provided.

(6) The Secretary withdraws the notification of loss of 
participation in the FFEL programs sent to an institution under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if the Secretary determines 
that the institution's appeal satisfies one of the grounds 
specified in paragraphs (d)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section.

former students at the institution enter repayment on Federal 
Stafford loans or Federal SLS loans (or on the portion of a 
Federal Consolidation Loan that is used to repay such loans)

(B) In determining the number of students who default 
before the end of that following fiscal year, the Secretary 
includes only loans for which the Secretary or a guaranty agency 
has paid claims for insurance. 
(ii) (A) In the case of a student who has attended and 
borrowed at more than one institution, the student (and his or 
her subsequent repayment or default) is attributed to each 
institution for attendance at which the student received a loan 
that entered repayment in the fiscal year. 
(B) A loan on which a payment is made by the institution, 
its owner, agent, contractor, employee, or any other affiliated 
entity or individual, in order to avoid default by the borrower, 
is considered as in default for purposes of this definition. 
(C) Any loan that has been rehabilitated under section 428F 
of the HEA before the end of that following fiscal year is not 
considered as in default for purposes of this definition. 
(D) For the purposes of this definition, a loan made in 
accordance with section 428A of the HEA (or a Federal 
Consolidation Loan a portion of which is used to repay a Federal 
SLS loan) shall not be considered to enter repayment until after 
the borrower has ceased to be enrolled in an educational program 
leading to a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational 
credential at the participating institution on at least a half-
time basis (as determined by the institution) and ceased to be in 
a period of forbearance based on such enrollment. Each eligible 
lender of a loan made under section 428A (or a Federal 
Consolidation Loan a portion of which is used to repay a Federal

notified of that rate until the institution is notified by the 
Secretary that the rate no longer applies. 
(iv) (A) For an institution that changes its status from 
that of a location of one institution to that of a free-standing 
institution, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate 
based on the institution's status as of October 1 of the fiscal 
year for which a cohort default rate is being calculated. 
(B) For an institution that changes its status from that of 
a free-standing institution to that of a location of another 
institution, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate 
based on the combined number of students who enter repayment 
during the applicable fiscal year and the combined number of 
students who default during the applicable fiscal years from both 
the former free-standing institution and the other institution. 
This cohort default rate applies to the new, consolidated 
institution and all of its current locations.

(C) For free-standing institutions that merge to form a 
new, consolidated institution, the Secretary determines the 
cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who 
enter repayment during the applicable fiscal year and the 
combined number of students who default during the applicable 
fiscal years from all of the institutions that are merging. This 
cohort default rate applies to the new consolidated institution. 
(D) For a location of one institution that becomes a 
location of another institution, the Secretary determines the 
cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who 
enter repayment during the applicable fiscal year and the number 
of students who default during the applicable fiscal years from 
both of the institutions in their entirety, not limited solely to 
the respective locations. 
(2) 

Fiscal year 

means the period from and including 
October 1 of a calendar year through and including September 30 
of the following calendar year. 
(i) 

Federal SLS Program participation. 

An institution 
loses its participation in the Federal SLS Program if the 
Secretary determines that the institution's cohort default rate 
for the most recent fiscal year for which that rate is available 
is equal to or greater than 30 percent. However, the 
institution's loss of participation does not apply to a student 
who is not an undergraduate student or who has received a Federal 
SLS loan previously for enrollment in the same educational 
program at the institution (except that previous receipt of a 
Federal SLS loan shall not qualify a student for a Federal SLS 
loan with respect to an extension of the duration of that 
educational program that was effected on or after 
November 8, 1989).

 668.22 


Institutional refunds and repayments. 


(a) 

General. 

(1) An institution shall have a fair and 
equitable refund policy under which the institution makes a 
refund of unearned tuition, fees, room and board, and other 
charges to a student who received Title IV, HEA program 
assistance, or whose parent received a Federal PLUS loan on 
behalf of the student if the student_
(i) Does not register for the period of enrollment for 
which the student was charged; or 
(ii) Withdraws, drops out, is expelled from the institution 
or otherwise fails to complete the program on or after his or her 
first day of class of the period of enrollment for which he or 
she was charged. 
(2) The institution shall provide a clear and conspicuous 
written statement containing its refund policy, including the 
allocation of refunds and repayments to sources of aid, together 
with examples of the application of this policy, to a prospective 
student prior to the earlier of the student's enrollment or the 
execution of the student's enrollment agreement. The institution 
shall make its policy known to currently enrolled students. The 
institution shall include in its statement the procedures that a 
student must follow to obtain a refund, but the institution shall 
return the portion of a refund allocable to the Title IV, HEA 
programs in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section whether 
the student follows those procedures or not. If the institution 
changes its refund policy, the institution shall ensure that all 
students are made aware of the new policy. 
(3) The institution shall publish the costs of required 
supplies and equipment and shall substantiate to the Secretary 
upon request that the costs are reasonably related to the cost of 
providing the supplies and equipment to students. 
(b) 

Fair and equitable refund policy. 

(1) For purposes of 
paragraph (a) of this section, an institution's refund policy is 
fair and equitable if the policy provides for a refund of at 
least the larger of the amount provided under_
(i) The requirements of applicable State law; 
(ii) The specific refund standards established by the 
institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency if those 
standards are approved by the Secretary; 
(iii) The 

pro rata 

refund calculation described in 
paragraph (c) of this section, for any student attending the 
institution for the first time whose withdrawal date is on or 
before the 60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment 
for which the student has been charged; or 
(iv) For purposes of determining a refund when the 

pro rata 


refund calculation under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section 
does not apply, and no standards for refund calculations exist 
under paragraph (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, the larger 
of_ 
(A) The specific refund standards contained in Appendix A 
to this part; or 
(B) The institution's refund policy. 
(2) For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, 
``the 60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for 
which the student has been charged'' is_
(i) In the case of an educational program that is measured 
in credit hours, the point in calendar time when 60 percent of 
the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged, 
as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, has elapsed; and 
(ii) In the case of an educational program that is measured 
in clock hours, the point in time when the student completes 60 
percent of the clock hours scheduled for the period of enrollment 
for which the student is charged as defined in paragraph (d) of 
this section.

(3) The institution must determine which policy under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section provides for the largest refund 
to that student. 
(c) 

Pro rata refund. 

(1) 

Pro rata refund, 

as used in 
this section, means a refund by an institution to a student 
attending that institution for the first time of not less than 
that portion of the tuition, fees, room, board, and other charges 
assessed the student by the institution equal to the portion of 
the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged 
that remains on the withdrawal date, rounded downward to the 
nearest 10 percent of that period, less_
(i) (A) Any unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment for 
the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged. 
A scheduled cash payment is the amount of institutional charges 
that is not paid for by financial aid for the period of 
enrollment for which the student has been charged exclusive of_
(

1

) Any amount scheduled to be paid by Title IV, HEA 
program assistance that the student has been awarded that is 
payable to the student even though the student has withdrawn; and 
(

2

) Late disbursements of loans made under the Federal 
Stafford Loan, Federal SLS, and Federal PLUS programs in 
accordance with 34 CFR 682.207(d). 
(B) The unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment is 
computed by subtracting the amount paid by the student for the 
period of enrollment for which the student has been charged from 
the scheduled cash payment for the period of enrollment for which 
the student has been charged; 
(ii) A reasonable administrative fee not to exceed the 
lesser of_
(A) Five percent of the tuition, fees, room and board, and 
other charges assessed the student; or 
(B) One hundred dollars; 
(iii) Any application fee charged by the institution; and 
(iv) The portion of ``board'' charges (i.e., meal tickets) 
that have been expended by the student that exceed the portion 
attributable to the period for which the student attended at the 
time of withdrawal. The institution must include in the refund 
any unexpended ``board'' credits. 
(2) (i) For purposes of this section, ``other charges 
assessed the student by the institution'' include, but are not 
limited to, charges for any equipment (including books and 
supplies) issued by an institution to the student. The 
institution may deduct from the refund owed under this paragraph 
the documented cost to the institution of equipment issued to the 
student if the institution specifies in the enrollment agreement 
a separate charge for equipment which the student actually 
obtains or if the institution refers the student to a vendor 
operated by an affiliated or related entity and the student does 
not return the equipment in good condition, allowing for 
reasonable wear and tear, within 20 days following the date of 
the student's withdrawal. The student shall be liable for the 
amount, if any, by which the documented cost for equipment not 
returned in good condition exceeds the refund under this 
paragraph. Equipment is not considered to be returned in good 
condition if the equipment cannot be reused because of clearly 
recognized health and sanitary reasons, and this fact is clearly 
and conspicuously disclosed in the enrollment agreement. 
(ii) An institution may not delay its payment of the 
portion of a refund allocable under this section to a Title IV, 
HEA program or a lender under 34 CFR 682.607 by reason of the 
process for return of equipment prescribed in paragraph (c)(4)(i) 
of this section. 
(3) For purposes of this section_
(i) ``Room'' charges do not include charges that are passed 
through the institution from an entity that is not under the 
control of, related to, or affiliated with the institution; and 
(ii) ``Other charges assessed the student by the 
institution'' do not include fees for group health insurance, if 
this insurance is required for all students and the purchased 
coverage remains in effect for the student throughout the period 
for which the student was charged. 
(4) (i) For purposes of this section, a student attending an 
institution for the first time is a student who_

(A) Has not previously attended at least one class at the 
institution; or 
(B) Received a refund of 100 percent of his or her tuition 
and fees (less any permitted administrative fee) under the 
institution's refund policy for previous attendance at the 
institution. 
(ii) A student remains a first-time student until the 
student either_
(A) Withdraws, drops out, or is expelled from the 
institution after attending at least one class; or 
(B) Completes the period of enrollment for which he or she 
has been charged.

(5) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, ``the 
portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has 
been charged that remains'' is determined_
(i) In the case of an educational program that is measured 
in credit hours, by dividing the total number of weeks comprising 
the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged 
into the number of weeks remaining in that period as of the 
student's withdrawal date; 
(ii) In the case of an educational program that is measured 
in clock hours, by dividing the total number of clock hours 
comprising the period of enrollment for which the student has 
been charged into the number of scheduled clock hours remaining 
to be completed by the student in that period as of the student's 
withdrawal date; and 
(iii) In the case of an educational program that consists 
predominantly of correspondence courses, by dividing the total 
number of lessons comprising the period of enrollment for which 
the student has been charged into the number of lessons not 
submitted by the student. 
(d) 

Period of enrollment for which the student has been 
charged. 

(1) For purposes of this section, ``the period of 
enrollment for which the student has been charged,'' means the 
actual period for which an institution charges a student, except 
that the minimum period must be_
(i) In the case of an educational program that is measured 
in credit hours and uses semesters, trimesters, quarters, or 
other academic terms, the semester, trimester, quarter or other 
academic term; or 
(ii) In the case of an educational program that is measured 
in credit hours and does not use semesters, trimesters, quarters, 
or other academic terms, or an educational program that is 
measured in clock hours, the lesser of the length of the 
educational program or an academic year. 
(2) If an institution charges by different periods for 
different charges, the ``period of enrollment for which the 
student has been charged'' for purposes of this section is the 
longest period for which the student is charged. The institution 
must include any charges assessed the student for the period of 
enrollment or any portion of that period of enrollment when 
calculating the refund. 
(e) 

Overpayments. 

(1) An institution shall determine 
whether a student has received an overpayment for 
noninstitutional costs for the period of enrollment for which the 
student has been charged if_
(i) The student officially withdraws, drops out, or is 
expelled on or after his or her first day of class of that 
period; and 
(ii) The student received Title IV, HEA program assistance 
other than from the FWS, Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, or 
Federal SLS Program for that period. 
(2) (i) To determine if the student owes an overpayment, the 
institution shall subtract the noninstitutional costs that the 
student incurred for that portion of the period of enrollment for 
which the student has been charged from the amount of all 
assistance (other than from the FWS, Federal Stafford Loan, 
Federal PLUS, or Federal SLS Program) that the institution 
disbursed to the student. 
(ii) Noninstitutional costs may include, but are not 
limited to, room and board for which the student does not 
contract with the institution, books, supplies, transportation, 
and miscellaneous expenses. 
(f) 

Repayments to Title IV, HEA programs of institutional 
refunds and overpayments. 

(1)(i) An institution shall return a 
portion of the refund calculated in accordance with paragraph (b) 
of this section to the Title IV, HEA programs if the student to 
whom the refund is owed received assistance under any Title IV, 
HEA program other than the FWS Program. 
(ii) The portion of the refund that an institution shall 
return to the Title IV, HEA programs may not exceed the amount of 
assistance that the student received under the Title IV, HEA 
programs other than under the FWS Program for the period of 
enrollment for which the student has been charged. 
(2) For purposes of this section, except for the 
calculation of a 

pro rata 

refund required under paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section_
(i) An institutional refund means the amount paid for 
institutional charges for the period of enrollment for which the 
student has been charged minus the amount that the institution 
may retain under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section for the 
portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has 
been charged that the student was actually enrolled at the 
institution; 
(ii) An institution may not include any unpaid amount of a 
scheduled cash payment in determining the amount that the 
institution may retain for institutional charges. A scheduled 
cash payment is the amount of institutional charges that has not 
been paid by financial aid for the period of enrollment for which 
the student has been charged, exclusive of_
(A) Any amount scheduled to be paid by Title IV, HEA 
program assistance that the student has been awarded that is 
payable to the student even though the student has withdrawn; and 
(B) Late disbursements of loans made under the Federal 
Stafford, Federal SLS, and Federal PLUS programs in accordance 
with 34 CFR 682.207(d); 
(iii) In determining the amount that the institution may 
retain for the portion of the period of enrollment for which the 
student has been charged during which the student was actually 
enrolled, an institution shall_
(A) Compute the unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment 
by subtracting the amount paid by the student for that period of 
enrollment for which the student has been charged from the 
scheduled cash payment for the period of enrollment for which the 
student has been charged; and

(B) Subtract the unpaid amount of the scheduled cash 
payment from the amount that may be retained by the institution 
according to the institution's refund policy; and

(iv) An institution shall return the total amount of Title 
IV, HEA program assistance (other than amounts received from the 
FWS Program) paid for institutional charges for the period of 
enrollment for which the student has been charged if the unpaid 
amount of the student's scheduled cash payment is greater than or 
equal to the amount that may be retained by the institution under 
the institution's refund policy. 

(3)(i) A student must repay to the institution or to the 
Title IV, HEA programs a portion of the overpayment as determined 
according to paragraph (e) of this section. The institution 
shall make every reasonable effort to contact the student and 
recover the overpayment in accordance with program regulations 
(34 CFR parts 673, 674, 675, 676, 690, and 691). 

(ii) The portion of the overpayment that the student or the 
institution (if the institution recovers the overpayment) shall 
return to the Title IV, HEA programs may not exceed the amount of 
assistance received under the Title IV, HEA programs other than 
the FWS, Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, or Federal SLS 
Program for the period of enrollment for which the student has 
been charged. 

(iii) Unless otherwise provided for in applicable program 
regulations_

student is considered not to owe an overpayment, and the 
institution is not required to contact the student or recover the 
overpayment; and 

(B) If the amount of the refund is $25 or less, the 
institution is not required to pay the refund. 

(g) 

Allocation of refunds and overpayments.

provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, if a student who 
received Title IV, HEA program assistance (other than assistance 
under the FWS Program) is owed a refund calculated in accordance 
with paragraph (b) of this section, or if a student who received 
Title IV, HEA program assistance (other than assistance under the 
FWS, Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, or Federal SLS Program) 
must repay an overpayment calculated in accordance with paragraph 
(e) of this section, an institution shall allocate that refund

(i) 

Refund dates_

(1) 

Withdrawal date. 

(i) Except as 
provided in paragraphs (i)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section, a 
student's withdrawal date is the earlier of_

(A) The date that the student notifies an institution of 
the student's withdrawal, or the date of withdrawal specified by 
the student, whichever is later; or 

(B) If the student drops out of the institution without 
notifying the institution (does not withdraw officially), the 
last recorded date of class attendance by the student, as 
documented by the institution. 

(ii) If the student has not returned to the institution at 
the expiration of a leave of absence approved under paragraph 
(i)(2) of this section, the student's withdrawal date is the last 
recorded date of class attendance by the student, as documented 
by the institution. If the student returns to the institution 
after the expiration of the leave of absence but during the award 
year or (for the Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, and Federal 
SLS programs) during the period of enrollment in which the 
student was granted the leave of absence, the student may not 
receive additional Title IV, HEA program assistance for 
coursework that he or she has not completed. 

(iii) If the student is enrolled in an educational program 
that consists predominantly of correspondence courses, the 
student's withdrawal date is normally the date of the last lesson 
submitted by the student, if the student failed to submit the 
subsequent lesson in accordance with the schedule for lessons 
established by the institution. However, if the student 
establishes in writing, within 60 days of the date of the last 
lesson that he or she submitted, a desire to continue in the 
program and an understanding that the required lessons must be 
submitted on time, the institution may restore that student to 
``in school'' status for purposes of funds received under the Title 
IV, HEA programs. The institution may not grant the student more 
than one restoration to ``in school'' status on this basis. 

(2) 

Leaves of absence. 

A student who has been absent from 
an institution and has been granted a leave of absence by the 
institution, in accordance with this paragraph, is not considered 
to have withdrawn from the institution for purposes of this 
section. In any twelve-month period, an institution may grant a 
single leave of absence to a student provided that_

(i) The student has made a written request to be granted a 
leave of absence; 

(ii) The leave of absence involves no additional charges by 
the institution to the student; and 

(iii) The leave of absence does not exceed_

(A) Sixty days;

(B) Six months, under either of the following 
circumstances: 

(

1

) The student's educational program does not consist 
predominantly of correspondence courses, and the institution's 
next period of enrollment after the start of the leave of absence 
would begin more than 60 days after the first day of the leave of 
absence. 

(

2

) The leave of absence is requested because of the 
student's medically determinable condition, in which case the 
student must provide the institution with a written 
recommendation from a physician for a leave of absence longer 
than 60 days; or 

(C) The length of time between the beginning of the leave 
of absence and the institution's next period of enrollment, under 
the following circumstance: The institution's next period of 
enrollment after the start of the leave of absence begins more 
than thirty days after the beginning of the leave of absence, and 
a corresponding period of nonenrollment (i.e., summer break) 
prevents a student from enrolling in any coursework. 
(3) 

Timely payment. 

An institution shall pay a refund that 
is due_
(i) If a student officially withdraws or is expelled, 
within 30 days after the student's withdrawal date; 
(ii) If a student drops out, within 30 days of the earliest 
of the_
(A) Date on which the institution determines that the 
student dropped out; 
(B) Expiration of the academic term in which the student 
withdrew; or 
(C) Expiration of the period of enrollment for which the 
student has been charged; or 
(iii) If a student does not return to the institution 
before the expiration of an approved leave of absence under 
paragraph (i)(2) of this section, within 30 days after the last 
day of the leave of absence.

* * * * * 


16. A new Appendix A to Part 668 is added to read as 
follows: 


Appendix A to Part 668_Standards for Acceptable Refund Policies by
 Participating Institutions 


For purposes of  668.22(b)(1)(iv)(A), the Secretary 
considers an institution to have a fair and equitable refund 
policy if the institution uses a policy that meets the minimum 
requirements of this appendix. These requirements are a modified 
version of guidelines developed by the National Association of 
College and University Business Officers. These requirements do 
not affect an institution's obligation to comply with other 
Department of Education regulations. 
(I) 

The governing board of the institution must review and 
approve the schedule of all institutional charges and refund 
policies applicable to students. 

The pricing of services and 
refund policies have important consequences to students, parents, 
the institution, and society; as such, pricing and refund 
policies must receive board attention and approval. 
(II) 

The institution must seek consumer views in the 
process of establishing and amending charge and refund 
structures. 

Decisions regarding institutional funds are 
ultimately the sole responsibility of the institution's legally 
designated fund custodians. However, consumer concerns do affect 
decision making, and involving consumers in decision making 
related to charges and refunds is an essential approach for 
assessing student needs and creating public awareness of 
institutional requirements. 
(III) 

The institution must publish a current schedule of 
all student charges (including the costs of required supplies and 
equipment), publish a statement of the purpose for such charges 
and related refund policies, have those statements readily 
available free of charge to current and prospective students, and 
substantiate that the costs of required supplies and equipment 
are reasonably related to the cost of providing the supplies and 
equipment to the students. 

Students and parents have a right to 
know what charges they will be expected to pay and what will or 
will not be refunded. They also have a right to know what 
services accompany payment of the charges. Informational 
materials published free for students and prospective students 
are ideal for this purpose.

<TEXT>
 

(IV) 

The institution must clearly designate all optional 
charges as ``optional'' in all published schedules and related 
materials. 

Charges that are mandatory and charges that are 
optional must be plainly differentiated in all printed materials. 
Statements accompanying the schedule may include institutional 
endorsements of the optional program or service. The institution 
must state clearly in its schedule if a charge is optional for 
some students but required for others. 
(V) 

The institution must clearly identify charges and 
deposits that are nonrefundable as ``nonrefundable'' on all 
published schedules. 

Institutions determine on an individual 
basis which of their charges are refundable or nonrefundable. In 
general, admission fees, application fees, laboratory fees, 
facility and student activity fees, and other similar charges are 
not refundable. These fees are generally charged to cover the 
cost of activities such as processing applications and other 
student information, reserving academic positions and 
establishing the limits of institutional programs and services, 
reserving housing space, and otherwise setting the fixed costs of 
the institution for the coming academic periods. 
Institutions determine on an individual basis which of their 
deposits are refundable or nonrefundable. Some deposits will be 
nonrefundable or will be credited to a student's account (e.g., 
tuition deposits). Others are refundable according to the terms 
of the deposit agreement (e.g., deposits for breakage). 
(VI) 

The institution must refund housing rental charges, 
less a deposit, as long as written notification of cancellation 
is made prior to a well-publicized date that provides reasonable 
opportunity to make the space available to other students.

 
Written notification on or before the beginning of the term of 
the contract is necessary to ensure utilization of housing units. 
During the term of the contract, room charges are generally not 
refundable. However, based on the program offered, space 
availability, debt service requirements, State and local laws, 
and other individual circumstances, institutions may provide for 
some more flexible refund guideline for housing. 
(VII) 

The institution must refund board charges in full, 
less a deposit, if written notification of cancellation is made 
prior to a well-publicized date that falls on or before the 
beginning of the term of the contract. 

Subsequent board charges 
should be refunded on a 

pro rata 

basis. It is reasonable to make 
a refund for those goods and services not consumed. The deposit 
should reflect that portion of an institution's costs that are 
fixed for the term of the contract. 
(VIII) 

The institutional refund policy must include the 
following requirements: 


A. The institution must refund 100 percent of the tuition 
charges, less an administrative fee that does not exceed the 
lesser of $100 or 5 percent of the tuition, if the student 
submits written notice of cancellation on or before one week 
preceding the first day of classes for the period of enrollment 
for which the student was charged. 
B. The institution must refund at least 90 percent of the 
tuition charges if the student submits written notice of 
cancellation between the end of the period of time specified in 
(VIII) A. and the end of the first 10 percent (in time) of the 
period of enrollment for which the student was charged. 
C. The institution must refund at least 50 percent of the 
tuition charges if the student submits written notice of 
cancellation between the end of the first 10 percent (in time) of 
the period of enrollment for which the student was charged and 
the end of the first 25 percent (in time) of that period of 
enrollment. 
D. The institution must refund at least 25 percent of the 
tuition charges if the student submits written notice of 
cancellation between the end of the first 25 percent (in time) of 
the period of enrollment for which the student was charged and 
the end of the first 50 percent (in time) of the period of 
enrollment. 
E. The institution may deduct from the refund owed under 
this paragraph the documented cost to the institution of 
equipment issued to the student if the institution specifies in 
the enrollment agreement a separate charge for equipment that the 
student actually obtains or if the institution refers the student 
to a vendor operated by an affiliated or related entity and the 
student does not return the equipment in good condition, allowing 
for reasonable wear and tear, within 20 days following the date 
of the student's withdrawal. The student shall be liable for the 
amount, if any, by which the documented cost for equipment 
exceeds the refund under this paragraph. Equipment is not 
considered to be returned in good condition if the equipment 
cannot be reused because of clearly recognized health and 
sanitary reasons, and this fact is clearly and conspicuously 
disclosed in the enrollment agreement. 
(IX) 

The institution must assess no penalty charges where 
the institution, as opposed to the student, is in error. 

Penalty 
charges, such as those involving late registration fees, 
change-of-schedule fees, and late payment fees, must not be 
assessed if it is determined that the student is not responsible 
for the action causing the charges to be levied.

(X) 

The institution must advise students that any 
notifications of withdrawal or cancellation and requests for 
refund must be in writing and addressed to the designated 
institution officer. 

A student's written notification of 
withdrawal or cancellation and request for a refund provides an 
accurate record of transactions and also ensures that the request 
will be processed on a timely basis. Acceptance of oral requests 
is an undesirable practice. 

(XI) 

The institution must pay or credit refunds due in 
accordance with  668.22(h)(4). 

(XII) The institution must publicize, as a part of its 
dissemination of information on charges and refunds, that an 
appeals process exists for students or parents who believe that 
individual circumstances warrant exceptions from published 
policy. The informational materials must include the name, 
title, and address of the official responsible for handling 
appeals. 

Although charges and refund policies should reflect 
extensive consideration of student and institutional needs, it 
will not be possible to encompass in these structures the variety 
of personal circumstances that may exist or develop. 
Institutions are required to provide a system of due process to 
their students, and charges and refund policies are legitimately 
a part of that process. Students and parents should be informed 
regularly of procedures for requesting information concerning 
exceptions to published policies.

Appendix to Preamble



Subparts A and B of the Student Assistance General Provisions 
Regulations 



I. Academic Year 



A. Section 481(d)(2) of the HEA provides that an ``academic year'' 
must require a minimum of 30 weeks of instruction time in which a 
student is expected to complete at least 24 semester or trimester 
hours or 36 quarter hours at an institution that measures program 
length in credit hours or at least 900 clock hours at an 
institution that measures program length in clock hours. 



Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
community's views: 

1. How should prorations be calculated? For example, if 
22 weeks are offered, how does an institution determine the 
portion of an academic year that applies? 

 Prorations of an academic year in educational programs 
shorter than an academic year should be based solely on 
the number of credit or clock hours provided, without 
regard to the number of weeks required. Proration 
should not be used for educational programs of one 
academic year or longer. Attempts to prorate the 
length of an academic year using both weeks and credit 
or clock hours would be inconsistent and confusing, 
because credit or clock hours are not always evenly 
distributed over the calendar length of an educational 
program. [Kansas City] 

 Prorations should be based on the minimum number of 
clock or credit hours that a full-time student in an 
eligible program is scheduled to take in an academic 
year. Prorations should not be based on the number of 
weeks in the academic year. A minority opposed 
inclusion of a reference to ``eligible program'' in this 
recommendation. [Atlanta] 

2. What is a week? How should portions of a week be treated? 

 A week should include any week during a portion of 
which the educational process takes place. 
[Kansas City] 

 A majority of participants recommended that an 
instructional week be defined in terms of a fixed 
standard of clock hours of instruction. Thus, for 
example, if regulations define an instructional week as 
the completion of 30 clock hours, a student who 
completes 90 clock hours of instruction in two calendar 
weeks should be considered to have completed the 
equivalent of three instructional weeks. [New York] 

 A week should be defined as a seven-day period that can 
begin on any day of the week. The seven-day periods 
continue for 30 periods of time. [San Francisco] 

 A ``week'' should be defined as either each seven-day 
period within an enrollment period; or each seven-day 
period (within an enrollment period) during which any 
instruction occurred. [Atlanta] 

3. What is instructional time? Should periods provided for 
orientation, testing, and vacation count? 

 Instructional time should be measured on the basis of 
calendar weeks that begin on Monday and end on Sunday. 
Instructional time should consist of a period of 
continuous enrollment beginning with the first week of 
classes and ending with the conclusion of the period of 
enrollment, including any normally scheduled breaks in 
the academic calendar. [Kansas City] 

 Instructional time should include time spent reading 
and taking examinations. [New York] 

 The interests of students, institutions, and other 
constituents need to be considered in determining 
instructional time. Some participants recommended that 
the determination be left to accrediting agencies. 
Other participants recommended that the determination 
be left to the Secretary. [San Francisco] 

4. What consideration should be given to programs with 
condensed class schedules, or to weekend programs? 

 Because instructional time should be measured on the 
basis of periods of continuous enrollment, special 
consideration for condensed schedules or weekend 
programs is unnecessary. [Kansas City] 

 The interests of students, institutions, and other 
constituents need to be considered in determining how 
to treat condensed schedules and weekend programs. 
Some participants recommended that the determination be 
left to accrediting agencies. Other participants 
recommended that the determination be left to the 
Secretary. [San Francisco] 

 Condensed programs that include the equivalent of the 
workload of a regular academic-year program should be 
considered to meet the definition of academic year. 
[Atlanta]

5. How does the new definition affect less-than-full-time students? 
 The definition does not affect part-time students. 
[Kansas City] 
 A student who completes fewer than the required minimum 
number of clock or credit hours during the 30-week 
period should be considered less-than-full-time. 
[San Francisco] 
 The length of the academic year is irrelevant to 
determining the enrollment status of students. 
Enrollment status is determined by the length of time 
(in terms of credit or clock hours) that a student 
takes to complete a ``program.'' [Atlanta] 


II. Eligible Program 


A. Effective July 1, 1993, section 481(b) and (c) of the HEA 
require a proprietary institution of higher education or a 
postsecondary vocational institution to provide an eligible 
program of training that prepares students for gainful employment 
in a recognized occupation. Section 481(e) of the HEA requires 
an eligible program to consist of at least 600 clock hours, 
16 semester hours, or 24 quarter hours offered during a minimum 
of 15 weeks, if the program admits students who have not 
completed the equivalent of an associate degree. An eligible 
program must consist of at least 300 clock hours, eight semester 
hours, or 12 quarter hours offered during a minimum of ten weeks, 
if the program is an undergraduate program requiring the 
equivalent of an associate degree for admission or if the program 
is a graduate or professional program. 
The Secretary is required to develop regulations to 
determine the quality of educational programs of less than 600 
clock hours. Those regulations must, at a minimum, require those 
educational programs to have verified completion and placement 
rates of at least 70 percent. An educational program of more 
than 300 clock hours and less than 600 clock hours that meets the 
Secretary's regulations qualifies for eligibility under the 
Federal Family Education Loan programs even if the educational 
program is not an undergraduate program requiring the equivalent 
of an associate degree for admission, and even if the educational 
program is not a graduate or professional program.
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
community's views: 
1. What is the equivalent of an associates degree? 
 An associates degree should be a degree which meets the 
degree requirements of any State for an associate 
degree. [Kansas City] 
 An associates degree should represent the completion of 
any educational program that meets State licensure 
requirements and that equals at least the length of a 
typical associate degree program. [Kansas City] 
 An associates degree should represent the completion of 
any educational program leading to a vocational 
objective if the program is at least 1,800 clock hours, 
(60 or 48) semester hours, or (90 or 64) quarter hours. 
(The variation in credit hours depends on whether the 
negotiators decide to use the number of credits 
required to earn an associate degree or the number of 
credits required for completion of at least two 
academic years.) [Kansas City] 
 An associates degree should represent the completion of 
an educational program that is at least two academic 
years in length. [Kansas City] 
 An associates degree should represent the completion of 
an educational program leading to licensure in an 
occupation, if a community college offers an associate 
degree program for that occupation. [Kansas City]

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940228-1-00154 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940228-1-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 An associates degree should be determined by the 
professional judgment of the Secretary. [Kansas City] 
 An associates degree should be determined by an 
institution's State licensing agency. [Kansas City] 
 An associates degree should consist of previous 
training in the same field of study as that for which 
the eligible program prepares training. [Kansas City] 
 An associates degree should, for occupations with 
apprenticeship programs, require the completion of 
five-year apprenticeship programs. [Kansas City] 
 An associates degree should represent the completion of 
the equivalent of two years of successful academic work 
in a postsecondary environment or a professional 
license that required a specific period of training and 
perhaps work experience. [New York] 
 An associates degree should represent the completion of 
the equivalent of at least two academic years of study, 
subject to compliance with applicable State laws and 
regulations. [San Francisco] 
 An associates degree should represent the completion of 
60 semester hours or the equivalent. [Atlanta] 
2. What are other measures of ``quality'' for programs of less 
than 600 hours? 
 An educational program should be considered to satisfy 
the Secretary's quality measures if a program that 
prepares students for State licensure in an occupation; 
a program that prepares students for certification by a 
nationally recognized professional or industry 
association; or a program that is approved by a 
nationally recognized accrediting agency or 
association. [Kansas City] 
 No additional measures should be included. 
[New York, Atlanta] 
3. How should the required job placement and graduation rates 
be calculated? How often should the rates be calculated? 
 The methodology and timing for the calculations should 
be identical to those required under the 
Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology 
Education Act and the Student Right-to-Know and Campus 
Security Act. [Kansas City] 
 Calculation of completion rates should be based on the 
formula used under the Student Right-to-Know and Campus 
Security Act, except that the calculation should not 
include time-specific constraints. [New York] 
 Calculation of placement rates should be based on the 
formula used under the Student Right-to-Know and Campus 
Security Act, except that only completers should be 
counted in the denominator. No time frame should be 
used in the calculation. [New York] 
 Regulations should define completion rate, graduation 
rate, and full-time employment (which should specify a 
period of time in a job). [San Francisco] 
 Calculations should be based over a two-three year 
period to reflect long-term trends and avert the 
adverse impact of short-term problems such as those 
caused by economic conditions. Institutions that fall 
below the minimum rates ought to be provided appeal 
procedures. [San Francisco] 
 Because there are many State regulations and 
accrediting agency standards governing this area, 
institutions should be allowed to follow the most 
restrictive ones. Institutions following the most 
restrictive regulations and standards should not be 
required to maintain multiple sets of documentation 
demonstrating compliance with a variety of regulations 
and standards. [San Francisco] 
 The cohort for calculation of placement rates should 
include placement in jobs related to the occupation for 
which students are trained. [San Francisco] 
 In calculating placement rates, students should be 
counted as employed if they obtain jobs within 180 days 
of graduation. Students should be counted as employed 
if they obtain jobs in the field for which they were 
trained or a related field. Students (such as those in 
continuing education or in the military) who are not 
looking for a job should be excluded from the 
calculation. The calculation should be based on a 
percentage of graduates. Incarcerated or physically 
incapacitated students should be excluded from the 
calculation. [Atlanta] 
4. What documentation is required to support the institution's 
completion and job placement rates? 
 Documentation should be identical to that required 
under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied 
Technology Education Act and the Student Right-to-Know 
and Campus Security Act. [Kansas City] 
 Documentation should be any documentation required by 
the institution's State or accrediting agency. The 
rates can be verified through required compliance 
audits. [New York] 
Calculations should be included in the Fiscal 
Operations Report and Application to Participate 
(FISAP) for the campus-based programs. The time-frame 
for reporting this data should be relatively short, to 
ensure that the data is relevant. [San Francisco] 
 A student's placement information should be maintained 
in each student's file. Placement information should 
be available for the purposes of audits. 
[San Francisco] 
 Institutions should maintain employment records on file 
to confirm placements. Employment records should not 
be submitted to the Department of Education. [Atlanta]

III. Program Participation Agreement 



A. Section 487(a)(5) requires an institution to provide 
assurances that the institution will provide, upon request and in 
a timely fashion, information relating to its administrative 
capability and financial responsibility to the Secretary, the 
designated State postsecondary review entity designated under 
subpart 1 of part H of Title IV of the HEA, the appropriate 
guaranty agency, and accrediting agency or association. 

Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
community's views: 

1. How should agencies obtain this information from 
institutions? 

 Other agencies should obtain the information through 
IPEDS or accrediting agency annual reports. 
[San Francisco] 

 Requests should be made in writing to the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of 
the institution. [Kansas City] 

2. Should there be a standard information-sharing format? 

 There should be a standard information sharing format 
provided that the institution is allowed to report 
using its accounting system. [Kansas City] 

 There needs to be a standard information sharing format 
that can be completed readily and corresponds to the 
institution's fiscal year. [New York] 

 The Department should provide a single form that can be 
used for all agencies. [Atlanta] 

B. Section 487(a)(8)(B) requires institutions that advertise job 
placement rates to make available to prospective students 
relevant State licensing requirements for any job for which the 
course of instruction is designed to prepare the student. 

Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
community's views: 

1. How often should institutions be required to update 
licensing data? 

 Institutions should update the data whenever State 
licensing agencies require that updates or regulation 
must occur. [San Francisco, Kansas City, Atlanta] 

 Information always needs to be current. [New York] 

2. Should there be a standard format for providing this 
information to prospective students? 

 A typical brochure should be used to convey information 
to students. [San Francisco] 

 There should not be a standard format for providing 
this information to prospective students. 
[Kansas City, New York, Atlanta] 

 The institution should use the States required format 
for providing consumer data to students. If the 
Secretary requires additional information, the 
information should be consistent with the formats that 
the institution already uses. [Kansas City] 

C. Section 487(a)(13) provides that an institution may not deny 
Federal financial aid to an eligible student because the student 
is studying abroad in a program approved for credit by the home 
institution. 

Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
community's views: 

1. Should a consortium agreement be required? 

 A consortium agreement should not be required. 
[Kansas City, San Francisco] 

 A consortium agreement should be used for pre-approved 
work. Institutions need to ensure that two 
institutions are not giving aid at the same time. 
[New York] 

 A consortium agreement should be required if the 
student is paying tuition at the home institution and a 
second institution is involved. Otherwise no consortium agreement should be required. [Atlanta] 

2. Does the study-abroad program have to be part of the 
student's program at the home institution? 

 The study abroad program need not be a part of the 
student's program at the home institution, but must 
count toward a degree at the institution. 
[Kansas City] 

 The study abroad program should be a part of the 
student's home program. [San Francisco, Atlanta]

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940228-1-00156 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940228-1-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 An institution should not be obligated to enter into an 
agreement with a student who wants to study abroad. 
[New York] 

3. How should the term ``approved for credit'' be defined? 

 The term ``approved for credit'' should mean that credits 
are fully transferable (accepted for credit) into an 
eligible program offered by the home institution. 
[Kansas City] 

 ``Approved for credit'' should mean used toward a degree 
as defined by the institution. [San Francisco] 

 ``Approved for credit'' should mean that it is determined 
in advance that the credit is accepted at the home 
institution. [Atlanta] 

4. Should a standard format be developed for institutions to 
report study abroad programs? 

 A standard format for institutions to report study 
abroad programs is not needed. It does not appear that 
any reporting is required. [Kansas City, New York, 
San Francisco, Atlanta] 

D. Section 487(a)(14)(A) requires a new institution or an 
institution that undergoes a change of ownership or changes its 
status as a parent or subordinate institution to develop a 
Default Management Plan to participate in the FFEL program. The 
Secretary must approve the plan and the plan must be implemented 
for two years after the institution is initially certified as an 
eligible institution or for two years after its change of 
ownership or status. 

Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
community's views: 

1. Should the criteria in Appendix D of current regulations be 
used as the basis for the Secretary's approval of default plans? 

 Unless otherwise required, an institution should use 
Appendix D or submit any other approved default 
management plan. [Kansas City, Atlanta] 

 If a new institution uses Appendix D, it is subject to 
things it can't do as a new institution. What is in 
Appendix D that isn't in the new regulations already? 
New institutions will certify that they will adopt the 
stipulated plan they have in place (that has approval 
from the appropriate State and or accrediting body.) 
[New York] 

2. Should there be other criteria? 

 Other criteria should include: a) more follow up once 
the student leaves the institution; and b) additional 
cooperation with all partners in the program, i.e., 
lenders, institutions, and secondary markets. The 
Department should reassess the method for determining 
cohort default rate. It is not fair for most 
institutions. [San Francisco] 

 No other criteria is needed. [Atlanta] 

E. Section 487(a)(18)(A) requires an institution that offers 
athletically-related student aid to compile annually data on 
expenses and revenues of athletic activities and expenses and 
revenues of the institution. 

1. How should the terms ``revenues'' and ``expenses'' be defined? 

 There should be coordination with NCAA regulations and 
audit guides. [San Francisco] 

 Institutions should be allowed to use the accounting 
principles and terms they are currently using to define 
``revenues'' and ``expenses.'' [Kansas City] 

F. Section 487(a)(19) provides that if a student is unable to 
meet his or her financial obligation to the institution because 
of a delay in the disbursement of proceeds of a Title IV, HEA 
program loan (due to compliance with Title IV requirements or 
delays attributable to the institution), the institution may not 
penalize the student in any way, including assessing a late fee; 
denying the student access to class, the library, or other 
facilities; or requiring that the student borrow additional 
funds. 

1. How should the term ``denial of access to classes'' be 
interpreted? 

 ``Denial of access'' should mean the student is not given 
access to equipment or supplies. [San Francisco] 

2. What should be considered as a condition to meet the 
definition of a ``delay in the delivery of proceeds?''

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940228-1-00157 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940228-1-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 This section should not apply to: 1) delays by lenders 
or guarantors in delivering loan proceeds which are not 
caused by the necessity of complying with Title IV 
requirements; and 2) delays attributable to the 
student's not providing information by known, 
published, or noticed deadlines, that the institution, 
lender, or guarantor must have in order to comply with 
Title IV requirements. (Example, IRS 1040 forms for 
verification.) 
The Secretary should regulate in such a way that it is 
clear that institutions may charge reasonable interest 
on unpaid bills where the delay in Title IV delivery is 
attributed to the student or an agency other than the 
institution. [Kansas City] 
 This section does not address delays for which the 
student has not met public deadlines or performed all 
obligations necessary to ensure the delivery of timely 
aid. [Kansas City] 
 If the student does not provide documents, it is not 
applicable. It should relate only to a 30 day delayed 
disbursement. [Atlanta] 
 No constraints should be put on a student for the delay 
of that portion of tuition covered by the first-time 
Stafford loan or in the case of institutional delay. 
[New York] 
 Consideration should be given to the laws of various 
states since they differ as to when a student must meet 
his or her financial obligation at an institution. 
[San Francisco] 
3. If a delay is caused by the lender or institution can the 
guarantee agency take actions that are prohibited under other 
circumstances? 
 No, a guaranty agency should not be allowed to take 
action if the delay is caused by the lender or 
institution. [New York] 
 G. Section 487(a)(20) prohibits an institution from paying a 
commission, bonus or other incentive payment based directly or 
indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to 
any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or 
admission activities or in making decisions regarding the 
awarding of student financial assistance. 
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
community's views: 
1. How should the Department determine that an institution is 
not providing commissions, bonuses, and other incentive payments? 
 Compliance should be determined through the audit 
process. Auditors check employment and payroll 
records. [San Francisco, Atlanta] 
2. If an institution awards merit pay to salaried employees in 
increments as the student successfully completes portions of the 
course, graduates, or gets placed in a job, would the institution 
be in compliance? 
 Institutions should be allowed to provide merit 
incentives to employees as long as it cannot be 
attached to the enrollment process (i.e., servicing 
retaining, and placing students after the first day of 
class at the institution.) [Kansas City] 
Salaried employees should be rewarded for retention. 
Any compensation (non-salaried) for the enrollment of 
financial aid students is illegal. There appears to be 
opposition to compensating for the ``warm body count'' 
and financial aid packages, but it does seem that the 
statute allows for a legitimate basis for compensation 
above base salary for areas such as retention, however 
defined, and/or completion rates. [New York] 
 As the intent appears to be elimination of head count 
recruitment commissions, bonuses on merit pay may be 
made as long as they are not made solely as the basis 
of recruitment of the student. The Department should 
define who is an employee. [Atlanta] 
 The institution would be in compliance if an 
institution awards merit pay to salaried employees in 
increments as the student successfully completes 
portions or the course, graduates, or gets placed in a 
job. [Kansas City]

IV. Annual Audits 


A. The Secretary is authorized to prescribe regulations for 
institutional and third-party servicer audits. Section 
487(c)(1)(A)(i) requires an annual audit of the financial 
condition of the institution in its entirety and an annual audit 
of the institution's compliance with the requirements governing 
the Title IV programs. The institution must make these audits 
available to cognizant guaranty agencies, eligible lenders, State 
agencies, and the State review entities designated under subpart 
1 of part H of Title IV of the HEA. 
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
community's views: 
1. To what extent, if any, should the annual audit requirement 
be waived or limited? Should this requirement for annual audits 
be waived for institutions participating in the Quality Assurance 
Program? 
 Annual financial audit should be waived in all 
instances except in the case of new institutions, 
institutions undergoing a change in ownership, 
institutions with a cohort default rate in excess of 25 
percent for one year, and institutions that did not 
satisfy all factors of financial responsibility in 
their most recent financial statement issued to the 
Department. Furthermore, institutions would be required 
to submit no more than two consecutive annual audits 
before being considered released from the annual audit 
requirement. 
Annual compliance audit should be waived for all 
institutions except in the case of new institutions, 
institutions undergoing a change of ownership, and 
institutions which have undergone a compliance audit 
within the past three years which resulted in Title IV 
liabilities in excess of one percent of Title IV funds 
disbursed. 
A further suggestion was made to truncate the audit 
requirements if the Secretary continues to require an 
annual audit. A minority of the group felt that annual 
audits, both financial and compliance, should be 
required and not waived. Those institutions that meet 
quality assurance criteria would be required to submit 
a short form audit on a biannual basis. [Atlanta] 
 No further burden should be placed on institutions than 
their State already requires or than the IRS requires 
of them. If someone else wants the audit, the 
Department should be responsible for distributing them. 
There should be diminishing filing requirements based 
upon performance evaluation factors and general 
longevity of institutions to exempt an institution from 
an annual audit. A minority suggested that pledged 
assets be accepted at some level in lieu of a certified 
annual audit. [New York] 
 The annual audit requirement could be waived in certain 
areas, e.g., the institution could be exempt from the 
student compliance components but not from a financial 
audit if the institution is in the quality assurance 
program. [San Francisco] 
 The Department should develop a set of guidelines that 
would permit exemptions. [Atlanta] 
2. How should guaranty agencies, lenders, and other parties 
request audit information from institutions? 
 An audit correction action plan should be sent to 
guaranty agencies and lenders. Requests should be in 
writing with explanations of why the request is made. 
Freedom of Information Act procedures could be used. Requests should be made to the appropriate official on 
campus. Information may not be given to any 
third-party without the approval of the institution. 
[San Francisco] 
 Requests should be in writing to the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. A minority of 
the group believed that all requests should be made in 
writing to the Chief Financial Officer only. 
[Kansas City] 
 Institutions should be notified of any requests for 
information and when information is released to 
appropriate agencies. The information should be 
released only to the parties already listed in the 
statute. [Kansas City] 
 Information should be provided to guaranty agencies, 
lenders, and other parties upon request. [Atlanta] 
B. In matters not governed by specific provisions, section 
487(c)(1)(B) provides for the establishment of standards of 
financial responsibility and administrative capability that 
include any matter the Secretary deems necessary for the sound 
administration of the financial aid programs (such as the 
pertinent actions of any owner, shareholder, or person exercising 
control over an eligible institution.)

Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
community's views: 
1. What other administrative capability or financial 
responsibility standards should be considered? 
 Agencies other than the Department that are permitted 
to request the same information should only be allowed 
to request documents used by the Department. 
[New York] 
 No other standards of financial responsibility should 
be considered. [Kansas City, San Francisco] 


V. Institutional Refund Policy 


Section 484B(b)(2) requires that each institution participating 
in any Title IV, HEA program shall have a fair and equitable 
refund policy under which the institution refunds unearned 
tuition, fees, room and board, and other charges, to a student 
who received Title IV assistance (including Federal PLUS loans 
received on the student's behalf) for a student who does not 
register for the period of attendance for which assistance was 
intended or withdraws or otherwise fails to complete the period 
of enrollment for which assistance is provided. 
An institution's refund policy is considered to be fair and 
equitable if the policy provides for a refund in an amount of at 
least the largest of the amounts provided under_
(1) The requirements of applicable State law; 
(2) The specific refund standards established by the 
institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency if those 
standards are approved by the Secretary; 
(3) The pro rata 

refund calculation described in the 
statute for any student whose withdrawal date is on or before the 
60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for which 
the student has been charged. 
The term ``

pro rata 

refund,'' means a refund by the 
institution to a student attending that institution for the first 
time of not less than that portion of the tuition, fees, room, 
board, and other charges assessed the student by the institution 
equal to the portion of the period of enrollment for which the 
student has been charged that remains on the last recorded day of 
attendance by the student, rounded downward to the nearest 10 
percent of that period, less any unpaid charges owed by the 
student for the period of enrollment for which the student has 
been charged, and less a reasonable administrative fee not to 
exceed the lesser of five percent of the tuition, fees, room and 
board, and other charges assessed the student, or $100. 
``The portion of the period of enrollment for which the 
student has been charged that remains,'' is determined_
(1) In the case of an educational program that is measured 
in credit hours, by dividing the total number of weeks comprising 
the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged 
into the number of weeks remaining in that period as of the last 
recorded day of attendance by the student; 
(2) In the case of an educational program that is measured 
in clock hours, by dividing the total number of clock hours 
comprising the period of enrollment for which the student has 
been charged into the number of clock hours remaining to be 
completed by the student in that period as of the last recorded 
day of attendance by the student; and 
(3) In the case of a correspondence program, by dividing 
the total number of lessons comprising the period of enrollment 
for which the student has been charged into the number of lessons 
not submitted by the student. 


Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
community's views: 
1. How should the ``60 percent point in time'' be determined? 
Should this be based on scheduled time in the program or actual 
attendance?

 The ``60 percent point in time'' should be based on scheduled time in the program, not on actual attendance.
[Kansas City, San Francisco, Atlanta] 
 In the absence of formal withdrawal by the student, it is up to the institution to devise a mechanism to determine
the last date of attendance. [Kansas City] 

2. How should the term ``student who is attending the institution for the first time'' be defined? Should this mean
the first time ever or the first time at the institution? 

 Only first year, first-time students should be considered ``first time.'' [San Francisco] 

 ``A student who is attending such institution for the first time'' should be defined as the first time ever rather
than the first time at an institution. Some attendees favored defining ``first time'' as the first time at the institution.
Pro ration should continue until the student finishes his or her first period of enrollment for which they have been
charged, or until the student has withdrawn from that term, class, or program for which they have been charged. If the
student re-enters the institution, they would not be considered a first time student. [Kansas City] 

 ``First-time student'' is a student at that particular institution in their first scheduled period of enrollment
for which the student has been charged. [New York, Atlanta] 

 ``First-time student'' should be defined as a student enrolled for the first time at the institution in an eligible
program. [Atlanta] 

 The regulations should not determine a minimum program length to consider a student as attending at a prior
institution or current institution. [Kansas City] 

 If a student enrolls for any period of time, drops out, then returns, they are not considered enrolled for the
first time for the second enrollment period. If standard terms of enrollment are used, the student should be considered
first time for the first term of enrollment for which they were charged. If standard terms are not used, the lesser of
60 percent of the first academic year or 60 percent of the program should be used. [Atlanta] 
3. How should the term ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' be defined? 

 The term ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' should be left to the institution to
define based on scheduled time. [New York] 

 The ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' should be defined based on full charges
for the increment of the enrollment period defined by the institution as the ``period for charges.'' [Kansas City]


 The ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' should be defined as the length of time for
which the student was initially charged. For example, for an institution that charges by semester, the first semester
the student was charged is the relevant period of enrollment. [Atlanta] 

 The ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' should be defined as a minimum of one academic
term, quarter, or semester or, for clock hour institutions, as a minimum of one-third of an academic year. If the institution
charges for a full program, the length of the program should be defined as an academic period. [Kansas City] 

 The ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' should be defined as the length for which
a student would be eligible to receive Title IV assistance. [San Francisco] 

4. Should the regulations address specific requirements regarding the treatment of equipment or book costs to be
included in pro rata

 refund calculations? 

 Books and supplies should be excluded from the 

pro rata

 calculation. Only fees for services rendered over time, e.g., lab fees, should be included. Exclude ``up front''
fees (application) and books, supplies, and equipment up to a certain dollar amount. There is a difference between
a service fee and a purchase of supplies, equipment, and books. Purchases should be excluded. [New York] 

 The regulations should state that equipment, books supplies, telephone charges, parking fines, etc. should
not be included with 

pro rata

 requirements. [Kansas City, Atlanta] 

 Charges for equipment, instructional materials, etc. should not be included in the calculation for refund
purposes if separately charged by the institution. [San Francisco]

 If books and supplies are provided by the institution 
and the institution has delivered the books and 
supplies to the student, the books and supplies should 
be excluded from the 

pro rata

 refund policy. 
[Kansas City] 


 Certain fees assessed by the institution should be 
included in the 

pro rata

 refund where the students do 
not realize the benefits over the enrollment period to 
include one time charges, i.e., application fee, 
orientation charges, testing fees, and deferred payment 
fees. Other charges assessed by the institution should 
be excluded from the 

pro rata

 refund when the student 
does not realize the benefit over the enrollment period 
to include fines, penalties, and individual charges 
(i.e., parking fines, and health center charges.) 
Books and supplies should not be included in 

pro rata

 
refund unless they are considered a mandatory charge by 
the institution (i.e, not when the student has the 
option of buying from the institution or some other 
source.) [Atlanta] 


 If all equipment and books are purchased at one time or 
issued to the student before he or she terminates his 
or her enrollment, the cost should be included in the 
refund. The institution should charge the whole amount 
which is not returnable. Equipment must be returned 
and able to be used again. If equipment has not yet 
been issued, the student would be eligible for a 
100 percent refund. [San Francisco] 


5. Should the regulations address a time frame for student 
refunds? Should the regulations have a minimum program length 
that a student must complete before the student will not be 
considered to be attending ``for the first time?'' 


 The time frame for all refunds should be uniformly 
60 days from the date the institution becomes aware 
that a student has withdrawn. [San Francisco] 


 The regulations should indicate the time frame for 
issuing student refunds to be the same as current 
refund requirements- within 60 days of determination 
that a refund is in order. [Kansas City] 


 Refunds should be made 30 days from date of 
determination. [San Francisco] 


 Regulations should not address a time frame for refunds 
since it is already addressed by the State or 
accrediting agencies. [Atlanta] 


6. Should the regulations address how institutions will account 
for credit balances? Should these funds be kept in a restrictive 
account rather than the institution's general operating account? 


 The regulations should not address how institutions 
account for credit balances nor restrictive or general 
operating accounts. A minority of the group felt that 
students with a baccalaureate degree should be exempt 
from the language. [Kansas City] 


 The group recommends that regulations remain silent on 
the method by which institutions account for credit 
balances. [San Francisco, Atlanta] 


 After all returns have been made to the Federal program 
from which the funds came, there should be a reasonable 
period of time for the student to request his account 
balance if there are educational costs outstanding. 
[San Francisco] 

7. Since the statute would imply than an institution is 
required to calculate all three policies and make the payment on 
the one most generous, should the institution be allowed to 
determine which is generally most generous an make that the 
official refund policy? 


 Institutions should be allowed to determine the refund 
policy that is generally most generous and use that 
policy. Institutions would define ``generally most 
generous.'' [Kansas City, San Francisco, Atlanta] 


 The Department should issue guidelines for institutions 
to use in determining which method to use. If the 
institutions use average costs in awarding and 
packaging, average costs should be used in refunds. 
[San Francisco] 


 Institutions should not be allowed to determine which 
refund is ``generally most generous.'' This is 
inconsistent with the statute. The statute does, 
however, permit institution to develop an algorithm 
that integrates the three refund policies and yields 
the calculation ``most generous'' to each individual 
student. The requirements should apply only to the 
calculation of refunds for students who are recipients 
of financial aid under Title IV. [Kansas City] 


8. How should ``fair and equitable'' be defined? 


 Fair and equitable'' should be defined as most generous 
to the student. [San Francisco] 


 It is not necessary to define ``fair and equitable'' 
separately from the requirements of the statute and the 
regulations. The Student Commission addresses 
adequately the definition of ``fair and equitable.'' 
[Kansas City, Atlanta]

 The statutory mandates requiring 

pro rata

 refund should 
be viewed as a limitation and not as an example for the 
purposes of Title IV refund only. [Kansas City] 


VI. Student Consumerism Requirements 


A. Under section 485(a), additional provisions have been added 
to the list of information an institution must disclose, upon 
request, to students and prospective students as part of the 
student consumerism requirements. 
The institution's refund policy must identify that refunds 
will be credited in the following order: 
(a) To outstanding balances on Federal Family Education 
Loans; 
(b) To outstanding balances on Federal Direct Loans; 
(c) To outstanding balances on Federal Perkins Loans; 
(d) To awards under Federal Pell Grants program; 
(e) To awards under Federal SEOG program; 
(f) To awards under Federal Work Study program; 
(g) To other Title IV assistance; and 
(h) To the student. 


Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
community's views: 
1. Should regulations require institutions to publicize how 
refunds will be processed and what refunds students are entitled 
to receive in the event that the institution closes? 
 Regulations should require institutions to publicize 
how refunds will be processed and what funds students 
are entitled to receive in the event the institution 
closes. [Kansas City] 
 Institutions should not have to publicize how refunds 
will be processed and what funds students are entitled 
to receive in the event the institution closes. This 
is not a consumer information issue. This is 
information to be disbursed if the institution closes. 
Information should be available to students upon 
request. A statement could be put in the catalog that 
will lead the student to ask relevant questions. The 
Department should work with State Agencies to develop 
plans that should be made available to students on 
request. There is very little probability that certain 
strong institutions will close. All institutions 
should not be required to disclose this. 
[San Francisco, Atlanta] 
2. Should consumer information address teachouts or other State 
or accrediting agency mandated requirements to protect student 
consumers in the case of school closure? 
 Consumer information should not address teachouts or 
other state or accrediting agency mandated requirements 
to protect student consumers in the case of institution 
closure. [Kansas City, Atlanta] 
3. Should institutional discretion be permitted when 
determining the order in which loan funds under the FFEL program 
are returned? 
 Institutional discretion should be permitted when 
determining the order in which loan funds under the 
FFEL program are returned. [Kansas City, 
San Francisco, Atlanta] 
4. Should guarantee and origination fees be included in the 
refund to totally pay off a FFEL program loan? 
 Guaranty and origination fees should not be included in 
the refund to totally payoff an FFEL program loan. 
[Kansas City] 
 Guaranty and origination fees should be included in the 
refund to totally payoff an FFEL program loan. 
[Atlanta] 
 The full amount should be included in the refund as a 
deterrent to default on the small remaining amount. 
This should be done at the institution's discretion. 
Institutions should not be required to pay back money 
they have not received, i.e., guaranty and origination 
fees. Institution should be permitted to include these 
fees if they choose. [San Francisco] 
5. How should the guaranty agencies monitor students to ensure 
that multiple FFEL funds are treated as one for the purposes of 
billing and deferments from one lender? 
 Guaranty agency monitoring of students to ensure that 
multiple FFEL funds are treated as one for the purpose 
of billing and deferments from one lender should be 
handled under the FFEL program. This is not a consumer 
information issue. [Kansas City, San Francisco] 
 Guaranty agency monitoring of students to ensure that 
multiple FFEL funds are treated as one for the purpose 
of billing and deferments from one lender should be 
done through the National Student Loan Data Bank. 
Agencies should identify all loans obtained through 
that agency. [Atlanta] 
VII. Institutional Eligibility and Certification Procedures_Part H, Subpart 3 
A. Section 498(a), (b), and (f) of the HEA establish application 
requirements and procedures for the Secretary to use to determine 
an institution's legal authority to operate within a State, 
accreditation, financial responsibility, and administrative 
capability.

Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
community's views: 
1. What information should the Secretary require on the form to 
supplement the specific information required by the statute? 
 Information should include documentation of an 
institution's accreditation or preaccreditation, 
degree-granting authority, authority to provide 
postsecondary education, and State licensure. 
[Kansas City] 
 With one exception, participants were satisfied that 
information currently collected on the Department's 
application forms is adequate, and new requirements 
would needlessly add burden. One participant 
recommended a separate application for proprietary 
institutions. [New York] 
 Specific categories should be established for different 
types of institutions and academic functions. 
Information should include the names and social 
security numbers of key administrative personnel and 
board members. [San Francisco] 
 Provided that new information required by statute is 
collected (financial statements, description of student 
aid processing at the institution, information on main 
and branch campuses, and information on the 
institution's third-party servicers), information 
currently collected is sufficient. However, additional 
information should be collected on whether an 
institution's owner has had substantial control over a 
closed institution that owes refunds to students or 
lenders. [Atlanta] 
2. Should the Audit Guide be revised to require the auditor to 
verify the information on the application form? 
 Participants recommended no changes in the audit guide. 
[Kansas City, New York, San Francisco, Atlanta] 
 A minority of participants indicated that there should 
be changes, without specifying what changes are needed. 
[Kansas City] 
B. Section 498(c)(1) addresses financial responsibilities and 
requires an institution to show that it is able to provide 
promised services, to provide administrative resources necessary 
to Title IV duties, and the meet all of its financial obligations 
including refunds and repayments to the Secretary for Title IV 
liabilities. 
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
community's views: 
1. What information should be required from an institution to 
permit the Secretary to determine that the institution provides 
the services described in its official publications and 
statements? 
 No additional information needs to be collected from 
institutions. [Kansas City, San Francisco] 
 If the Secretary needs additional information, the 
Secretary should be able to collect it from data made 
available through State and accrediting functions. 
[Kansas City, New York, Atlanta] 
 The best way to obtain information would be through 
site visits. [New York, Atlanta] 
 The Department needs to take action on institutions 
with failing financial statements, rather than simply 
collect them. [New York] 
 The establishment of uniform financial standards would 
be difficult, because different standards need to apply 
to different types of institutions. [New York]

2. What supporting information should be submitted to establish 
that an institution has the administrative resources to comply 
with its program responsibilities? 
 The financial information concerning each branch campus 
of an institution should be evaluated, without simply 
relying on the financial information of an institution 
as a whole. [New York] 
 Employee biographies with social security numbers 
should be provided. [San Francisco] 
3. What level of financial resources are needed to demonstrate 
that an institution can meet potential refund and repayment 
obligations, and should institutions be required to set aside 
funds for these purposes? 
 An institution should be able to provide for the 
payment of refunds that could occur over a 30-day 
period, but the institution should not be required to 
set aside funds specifically for this purpose. 
[Kansas City] 
 The statutory provisions for institutions to maintain 
cash reserves unless they are covered by State tuition 
recovery plans should be sufficient. [New York] 
 No requirements are necessary. The Department should 
have the discretion to review and establish amounts 
when necessary. [San Francisco] 
C. Section 498(c)(2) requires that, notwithstanding section 
498(c)(1), if an institution fails to meet the criteria 
prescribed by the Secretary with respect to operating losses, net 
worth, asset-to-liabilities ratios, or operating fund deficits, 
the institution must provide the Secretary with satisfactory 
evidence of its financial responsibility in accordance with 
section 498(c)(3). 
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
community's views: 
1. What standards should be set for each of these criteria? 
 One standard should not be applicable to all 
institutions. [New York] 
 Institutions should be allowed to explain their 
financial statements before decisions in this area are 
reached. [New York] 
 The institutions financial condition should be examined 
over a certain time period so that decisions regarding 
its financial responsibility are based on a trend. 
[New York] 
 The Department should particularly consider an 
institution's statement of cash flow. [New York] 
 Ratios that are used to measure stability in the 
business world should be used. [New York] 
 Current standards should be used with Departmental 
discretion. [San Francisco] 
 Standards for these criteria should be: a ratio of 
assets to liabilities of 1:1, showing a positive net 
worth, and not having two consecutive years of negative 
operating cash flow or its equivalent for fund 
accounting purposes. These should be indicators of 
financial responsibility, not absolute minimums. The 
importance of each criteria should be given its proper 
weight. [Atlanta] 
D. Section 498(c)(3) provides that the Secretary may find an 
institution to be financially responsible, notwithstanding 
failure under 498(c)(1) and 498(c)(2), if the institution; 
(1) Provides third-party guarantees of at least one-half of 
annual potential liabilities, (2) is backed by the full faith and 
credit of a State or its equivalent, (3) establishes that it is a 
going concern capable of meeting all its obligations, or (4) has 
met comparable standards set by the Secretary. 
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
community's views: 
1. What type of third-party guarantees will be acceptable to 
the Secretary? 
 Acceptable third-party guarantees should include bonds, 
institutional collateral, or a tuition recovery fund. [New York] 
 Acceptable third-party guarantees should include 
performance bonds, letters of credit, or other 
comparable instruments. [Kansas City, Atlanta]

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940228-1-00165 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940228-1-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Acceptable third-party guarantees should include performance bonds, letters of credit, third-party escrow
arrangements, and certificates of deposit. [San Francisco] 

2. Under what conditions will each type of instrument be used? 

 These measures should be used for institutions that close or institutions that don't properly repay any required
refunds. [New York] 

 These measures should be used only if the institution can find no other way to prove its financial status. The
institution should have an opportunity to negotiate with the Department before the third-party guarantees are imposed.
[Kansas City] 

 These measures should be used anytime the Secretary determines that the institution is not meeting its financial
responsibilities. [San Francisco] 

 These measures should be used if an institution fails to satisfy a liability established by the Secretary after
an administrative review process. [Atlanta] 

3. How does the Secretary determine the amount equal to one-half of the annual potential liabilities of an institution,
which is the minimum guarantee amount? 

 This should be determined based on the institution's retention or refund history. [New York] 

 The annual potential liability should be defined as the sum of the difference between charges paid by the student
(regardless of the source of payment) and the pro rata

 amounts earned by the institution according to its applicable refund policy. [Atlanta] 

 The annual potential liability should be based upon the institution's annual Title IV funds multiplied by
one-half of its withdrawal rate. [San Francisco] 

4. What standards will be used to determine when guarantees in excess of the minimum amount will be required for an institution
that fails to demonstrate financial responsibility? 

 Guarantees in excess of the minimum amount should be required if the institution must also have funds to make
teach out arrangements. [New York] 

 Guarantees in excess of the minimum amount should not be imposed. [Kansas City, Atlanta] 

 Guarantees in excess of the minimum amount should be required when the institution cannot meet its current
financial obligations. [Atlanta] 

5. How can an institution that does not demonstrate financial responsibility otherwise show that it is capable of
meeting all of its financial obligations. 

 All factors must be analyzed as a whole. [New York] 

 The Department should use the process used by accrediting agencies to determine financial responsibility.
[New York] 

 Institutions should be considered financially responsible if they are on reimbursement. [Kansas City, Atlanta]


 Institutions should be considered financially responsible if they are funded through an escrow arrangement.
[San Francisco, Atlanta] 

E. Section 498(c)(4) provides that the determination that an institution has met certain standards of financial
responsibility will be based on an audited and certified financial statement, done in accordance with standards
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Additional audits may be required. 



Issues that the community was asked to address and the community's views:

 

1. When would the Secretary require additional audits, and what additional items should be requ
