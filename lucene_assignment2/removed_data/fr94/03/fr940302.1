Official Brucellosis Tests 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are proposing to amend the brucellosis regulations by revising standards established for the brucellosis testing
of cattle and bison with the particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay test. By revising the standards for
this test, we believe we would help designated epidemiologists to avoid incorrectly classifying cattle and bison
as brucellosis suspects.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Brucellosis is a serious infectious and contagious disease, caused by 
bacteria of the genus Brucella, that affects animals and man. The Secretary 
of Agriculture is authorized to cooperate with the States in conducting a 
brucellosis eradication program and in preventing the interstate spread of 
brucellosis. The regulations in 9 CFR part 78 (referred to below as the 
regulations) govern the interstate movement of cattle, bison, and swine in 
order to help prevent the spread of brucellosis. 

Official brucellosis tests are used to determine the brucellosis status of cattle, bison, and swine. The regulations
stipulate that testing negative to an official brucellosis test is a condition for certain interstate movements.
Additionally, official tests are used to determine eligibility for indemnity payments for animals destroyed because
of brucellosis. 

One official test is the particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay (PCFIA) test, an automated serologic
test for brucellosis in cattle, bison, and swine. Results of the PCFIA test are expressed as an S/N value, which is the
ratio of the test sample to a negative control. Currently, under 
the definition of 

Official test 

in  78.1(a)(10) of the regulations, cattle and bison are considered: (1) reactors when the S/N value of their
PCFIA test results is less than or equal to 0.25; (2) suspects when the S/N value is greater than or equal to 0.26, but
less than or equal to 0.70; and (3) negative when the S/N value is greater than 0.70.

We believe that the spectrum of S/N ratios indicating suspect status in cattle and bison is too broad. We have determined
that tested cattle and bison with S/N values between 0.60 and 0.70, and thus classified under the regulations as brucellosis
suspects, almost always prove to be noninfected after supplemental testing. Moreover, we have also determined that
the vast majority of tested cattle and bison with S/N values between 0.25 and 0.30, and thus classified as brucellosis
suspects, prove to be brucellosis reactors in subsequent testing. 

We propose, therefore, to revise the PCFIA test standards to reflect this new information. This would allow the brucellosis
disease status of test-eligible cattle and bison to be more accurately determined. Under this proposal, cattle and
bison tested with the PCFIA test would be considered: 
(1) reactors when the S/N value of their test results is less than or equal to 0.30; (2) suspects when the S/N value is
greater than 0.30, and less than or equal to 0.60; and (3) negative when the S/N value is greater than 0.60. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 

We are proposing to amend the brucellosis regulations by revising standards established for the brucellosis testing
of cattle and bison with the PCFIA test. We believe that the test result standards in the current regulations which
indicate the disease status of tested animals can be improved. 
Incorrect brucellosis classification of cattle and bison as a result of 
the current PCFIA test standards creates marketing delays and unnecessary costs for farmers. Under the regulations,
cattle and bison classified as brucellosis suspects must either be quarantined and retested within 30 days or sold
for slaughter (usually at a loss). Consequently, farmers may unnecessarily quarantine or slaughter, at a loss, incorrectly
classified cattle and bison. Therefore, we believe our proposal to revise the PCFIA test result standards would save
farmers both time and money. 

Though we believe that the economic impact of this proposal would be positive, we also believe it would be minimal.
We anticipate that only about 7,200 cattle and bison in 560 herds (less than one thousandth of a percent of all cattle
and bison in the United States) are classified incorrectly as brucellosis suspects under our current regulations.
We estimate that all of the cattle and bison affected by this proposal would be owned by farms classified as small entities
under Small Business Administration standards. 

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12372 



This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive
Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015,
subpart V.) 



Executive Order 12778 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted:
(1) All State and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule will be preempted; (2) no retroactive
effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file
suit in court challenging this rule. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



This proposed rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501

Change in Disease Status of Hungary Because of Rinderpest and Foot-and-Mouth Disease 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are proposing to declare Hungary free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease. As part of this proposed action,
we would add Hungary to the list of countries that, although declared free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease,
are subject to restrictions on meat and other animal products offered for importation into the United States. We would
also add Hungary to the list of countries from which the importation into the United States of llamas and alpacas is
restricted. This proposed rule would remove the prohibition on the importation into the United States, from Hungary,
of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of ruminants, although those importations would be subject to certain
restrictions. This proposed rule would also relieve restrictions on the importation, from Hungary, of milk and milk
products of ruminants. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The regulations in 9 CFR part 94 (referred to below as the regulations) govern the importation into the United States
of specified animals and animal products in order to prevent the introduction into the United States of various animal
diseases, including rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy, African swine
fever, hog cholera, and swine vesicular disease. These are dangerous and destructive communicable diseases of ruminants
and swine. 
Section 94.1(a)(1) of the regulations provides that rinderpest or FMD exists in all countries of the world except
those listed in  94.1(a)(2), which have been declared to be free of both diseases. We will consider declaring
a country to be free of rinderpest and FMD if there have been no reported cases of either disease in that country for at
least the previous 
1-year period and no vaccinations for rinderpest or FMD have been administered to swine or ruminants in that country
for at least the previous 1-year period. 
The last outbreak of rinderpest in Europe occurred prior to 1921, and there have been no outbreaks of FMD since 1973.
A limited FMD vaccination program that was conducted near the country's eastern borders was discontinued in 1989.
Based on these considerations, the government of Hungary requested that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
declare Hungary to be free of rinderpest and FMD. 
The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) reviewed the documentation submitted by the government of
Hungary in support of its request, and a team of APHIS officials traveled to Hungary in October 1993 to conduct an on-site
evaluation of the country's animal health program with regard to the FMD situation in Hungary. The evaluation consisted
of a review of Hungary's veterinary services, laboratory and diagnostic procedures, vaccination practices, and
administration of laws and regulations intended to prevent the introduction of rinderpest and FMD into Hungary through
the importation of animals, meat, or animal products. The APHIS officials conducting the on-site evaluation concluded
that Hungary is free of rinderpest and FMD. (Details concerning the on-site evaluation are available, upon written
request, from the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

.) 
Therefore, based on the information discussed above, we are proposing to amend  94.1(a)(2) by adding Hungary
to the list of countries declared to be free of both rinderpest and FMD. This proposed action would remove the prohibition
on the importation, from Hungary, of ruminants and any fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of ruminants, and would relieve
restrictions on the importation, from Hungary, of milk and milk products of ruminants. However, because Hungary
has not been declared free of hog cholera, the importation of pork and pork products would continue to be restricted
under  94.9 of the regulations, and the importation of swine from Hungary would continue to be prohibited under
 94.10. Similarly, for the reasons discussed below, we would make the importation of meat and other animal products
of ruminants or swine from Hungary subject to the restrictions contained in  94.11.

We are proposing to amend  94.11(a) by adding Hungary to the list of countries that have been declared free of
rinderpest and FMD but from which the importation into the United States of meat and other animal products is restricted.
The countries listed in  94.11(a) are subject to these restrictions because they: (1) Supplement their national
meat supply by importing fresh, chilled, or frozen meat of ruminants or swine from countries that are designated in
 94.1(a) as infected with rinderpest or FMD; (2) have a common land border with countries designated as infected
with rinderpest or FMD; or (3) import ruminants or swine from countries designated as infected with rinderpest or
FMD under conditions less restrictive than would be acceptable for importation into the United States. 

Hungary supplements its national meat supply by importing fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of ruminants and swine
from countries designated in 
 94.1(a)(1) as countries in which rinderpest or FMD exists. In addition, Hungary has common land borders with
Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania, Yugoslavia, Croatia, and Slovenia, which are designated in  94.1(a)(1) as countries
in which rinderpest or FMD exists. As a result, even though Hungary appears to qualify for designation as a country
free of rinderpest and FMD, there is the potential for meat or other animal products produced in Hungary to be commingled
with the fresh, chilled, or frozen meat of animals from a country in which rinderpest and FMD exists. This potential
for commingling constitutes an undue risk of introducing rinderpest or FMD into the United States. 

Therefore, we are proposing that meat and other animal products of ruminants or swine, as well as any ship's stores,
airplane meals, or baggage containing such meat or other animal products, offered for importation into the United
States from Hungary be subject to the restrictions specified in 
 94.11 of the regulations in addition to the applicable regulations of the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection
Service, which are located in 9 CFR chapter III. Section 94.11 generally requires that the meat and other animal products
of ruminants or swine be: (1) Prepared in an inspected establishment that is eligible to have its products imported
into the United States under the Federal Meat Inspection Act; and (2) accompanied by an additional certification
from a full-time salaried veterinary official of the national government of the exporting country, stating that
the meat or other animal product has not been commingled with or exposed to meat or other animal products originating
in, imported from, or transported through a country infected with rinderpest or FMD. 

We are also proposing to add Hungary to a third list, this one in 
 94.1(d)(1). All countries in which rinderpest or FMD has been known to exist that have been declared free of
rinderpest and FMD on or after September 28, 1990, must be added to this list. Adding Hungary to this list would mean
that no llama or alpaca could be imported or entered into the United States from Hungary unless in accordance with 9
CFR 92.435. We are not, however, aware of any llamas or alpacas in Hungary that are available for export. 



Miscellaneous 



In addition to the proposed changes set forth above, we would correct the paragraph designations used in  94.9(b)(1)(ii)
and (iii). In each of those paragraphs, italicized lowercase letters were used where normal uppercase letters are
needed. Also in  94.9, we would make several nonsubstantive editorial changes for the sake of clarity or to correct
grammatical errors. Finally, in  94.11(a), we would adjust the order in which three countries appear to restore
alphabetical order to the list of countries in that paragraph. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 

For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.


This proposed rule, if adopted, would amend the regulations in part 94 by adding Hungary to the list of countries declared
to be free of rinderpest and FMD. This action would remove the prohibition on the importation into the United States,
from Hungary, of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of ruminants, although those importations would be
subject to certain restrictions. This proposed revision would also relieve restrictions on the importation, from
Hungary, of milk and milk products of ruminants. 

Based on available information, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports of ruminants and fresh,
chilled, or frozen meat of ruminants from Hungary into the United States as a result of this proposed rule.

The value of total U.S. imports of cattle in 1992 was $1.24 billion, and the value of total U.S. imports of sheep in 1992
was about $2 million. The United States did not import any cattle or sheep from Hungary during 1992. In fact, with the
exception of a small number of cattle imported from the former Czechoslovakia, no cattle or sheep were imported into
the United States from any country in Europe during 1992 (USDA, Economic Research Service [ERS], ``Foreign Agricultural
Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1992 Supplement,'' 1992). Clearly, Europe is not a source of ruminants for
the United States, and it is unlikely that declaring Hungary free of rinderpest and FMD would have any effect on the
existing trade patterns. 

Due to current APHIS restrictions, the United States does not import any uncooked meat or meat products from Hungary.
Total U.S. meat production in 1991 (excluding pork) was just under 10.7 million metric tons, while Hungarian meat
production in 1991 reached approximately 115,000 metric tons, about 1 percent of the U.S. total (USDA, National Agricultural
Statistics Service, ``Agricultural Statistics, 1992,'' 1992). Therefore, even if Hungary exported a significant
portion of its meat production exclusively to the United States, which is unlikely, the effect of those exports on
U.S. domestic prices or supplies would be negligible. 

As with the ruminants and meat products discussed above, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports
of milk and milk products from Hungary into the United States as a result of this proposed rule. The importation into
the United States of all dairy products, except for casein and other caseinates, is restricted by quotas. Although
the importation of casein into the United States is not regulated by quotas, world prices of casein are competitively
set. The United States does not produce casein, but does import more than half of the casein produced in the world. The
regulations currently allow casein and other caseinates to be imported into the United States from countries where
rinderpest or FMD exists if the importer has applied for and obtained written permission from the Administrator.
The United States imported about 662 metric tons of casein from Hungary in 1992 (USDA, ERS, ``Foreign Agricultural
Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1992 Supplement,'' 1992). Declaring Hungary free of rinderpest and FMD,
thus removing the requirement for written permission from the Administrator, is not expected to have any effect on
the amount of casein imported into the United States from Hungary because the current restrictions do not substantially
impede imports. 

The importation of bovine semen and cattle embryos from countries affected with rinderpest and FMD is restricted
under 9 CFR part 98. Although this proposed rule would have the effect of removing certain restrictions on the importation
of bovine semen and cattle embryos from Hungary, the economic effect of this proposed rule on the bovine semen and cattle
embryo industries is also expected to be minimal. The United States is a net exporter of bovine semen and cattle embryos.
In 1992, the value of U.S. bovine semen and cattle embryo imports was $4 million and $195,000, respectively, while
the value of U.S. bovine semen and cattle embryo exports was $49.3 million and $6.8 million, respectively (USDA, ERS,
``Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1992 Supplement,'' 1992). Although it is likely
that a few U.S. importers would be interested in importing bovine semen or cattle embryos from Hungary if this proposed
rule is adopted, the amount of each that might be imported would be minimal when compared to U.S. domestic production.


Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Executive Order 12778 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted:
(1) All State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule will be preempted; (2) no retroactive
effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file
suit in court challenging this rule. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this proposed rule have been approved by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and there are no new requirements. The assigned OMB control number is 0579-0015.

Change in Disease Status of Austria Because of Rinderpest, Foot-and-Mouth Disease, and Swine Vesicular Disease

 Proposed rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are proposing to declare Austria free of rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease, and swine vesicular disease. As
part of this proposed action, we would add Austria to the lists of countries that, although declared free of rinderpest,
foot-and-mouth disease, and swine vesicular disease, are subject to restrictions on meat and other animal products
offered for importation into the United States. We would also add Austria to the list of countries from which the importation
into the United States of llamas and alpacas is restricted. Declaring Austria free of rinderpest, foot-and-mouth
disease, and swine vesicular disease appears to be appropriate because the last outbreak of rinderpest in Europe
occurred prior to 1921, there have been no outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in Austria since 1981, and there have
been no outbreaks of swine vesicular disease since 1979. This proposed rule would remove the prohibition on the importation
into the United States, from Austria, of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of ruminants, although those
importations would be subject to certain restrictions. This proposed rule would also relieve restrictions on the
importation, from Austria, of milk and milk products of ruminants.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 



The regulations in 9 CFR part 94 (referred to below as the regulations) govern the importation into the United States
of specified animals and animal products in order to prevent the introduction into the United States of various animal
diseases, including rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy, African swine
fever, hog cholera, and swine vesicular disease (SVD). These are dangerous and destructive communicable diseases
of ruminants and swine.

Section 94.1(a)(1) of the regulations provides that rinderpest or FMD exists in all countries of the world except
those listed in  94.1(a)(2), which have been declared to be free of both diseases. Section 94.12(a) of the regulations
provides that SVD is considered to exist in all countries of the world except those listed in  94.12(a), which
have been declared to be free of SVD. We will consider declaring a country to be free of rinderpest, FMD, and SVD if there
have been no reported cases of the diseases in that country for at least the previous 1-year period and no vaccinations
for rinderpest or FMD have been administered to swine or ruminants in that country for at least the previous 1-year
period. 
The last outbreak of rinderpest in Europe occurred prior to 1921. There have been no outbreaks of FMD in Austria since
1981, and there have been no vaccinations for FMD in Austria since that 1981 outbreak. There have been no outbreaks
of SVD since 1979. Based on these considerations, the government of Austria has requested that the U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA) declare Austria to be free of rinderpest, FMD, and SVD. 
The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) reviewed the documentation submitted by the government of
Austria in support of its request, and a team of APHIS officials traveled to Austria in October 1993 to conduct an on-site
evaluation of the country's animal health program with regard to the rinderpest, FMD, and SVD situation in Austria.
The evaluation consisted of a review of Austria's veterinary services, laboratory and diagnostic procedures, vaccination
practices, and administration of laws and regulations intended to prevent the introduction of rinderpest, FMD,
and SVD into Austria through the importation of animals, meat, or animal products. The APHIS officials conducting
the on-site evaluation concluded that Austria is free of rinderpest, FMD, and SVD. (Details concerning the on-site
evaluation are available, upon written request, from the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.

) 
Therefore, based on the information discussed above, we are proposing to amend  94.1(a)(2) by adding Austria
to the list of countries declared to be free of both rinderpest and FMD. We are also proposing to amend  94.12(a)
by adding Austria to the list of countries declared to be free of SVD. These proposed actions would remove the prohibition
on the importation, from Austria, of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of ruminants, and would relieve
restrictions on the importation, from Austria, of milk and milk products of ruminants. However, because Austria
has not been declared free of hog cholera, the importation into the United States, from Austria, of pork and pork products
would continue to be restricted under  94.9 of the regulations, and the importation of swine from Austria would
continue to be prohibited under  94.10. Similarly, for the reasons discussed below, we would make the importation
of the meat and other animal products of ruminants or swine from Austria subject to the restrictions contained in   94.11
and 94.13. 
We are proposing to amend  94.11(a) by adding Austria to the list of countries that have been declared free of
rinderpest and FMD but from which the importation of meat and other animal products is restricted. Similarly, we are
proposing to amend  94.13(a) by adding Austria to the list of countries that have been declared free of SVD but
from which the importation of pork and pork products is restricted. The countries listed in   94.11(a)
and 94.13(a) are subject to these restrictions because they: (1) Supplement their national meat supply by importing
fresh, chilled, or frozen meat of ruminants or swine from countries that are designated in  94.1(a) as infected
with rinderpest or FMD or in  94.12 as infected with SVD; (2) have a common land border with countries designated
as infected with rinderpest, FMD, or SVD; or (3) import ruminants or swine from countries designated as infected with
rinderpest, FMD, or SVD under conditions less restrictive than would be acceptable for importation into the United
States. 
Austria supplements its national meat supply by importing fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of ruminants and swine
from countries designated in 
  94.1(a)(1) and 94.12(a) as countries in which rinderpest, FMD, or SVD exists. In addition, Austria
has common land borders with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Italy, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. Those
countries are designated in  94.1(a)(1) as countries in which rinderpest or FMD exists and, except for Switzerland,
are also designated in  94.12(a) as countries where SVD exists. As a result, even though Austria appears to qualify
for designation as a country free of rinderpest, FMD, and SVD, there is the potential for meat or other animal products
produced in Austria to be commingled with the fresh, chilled, or frozen meat of animals from a country in which rinderpest,
FMD, or SVD exists. This potential for commingling constitutes an undue risk of introducing rinderpest, FMD, or SVD
into the United States. 
Therefore, we are proposing that meat and other animal products of ruminants or swine, as well as any ship's stores,
airplane meals, or baggage containing such meat or other animal products, offered for importation into the United
States from Austria be subject to the restrictions specified in 
  94.11 and 94.13 of the regulations and to the applicable requirements contained in the regulations
of the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service at 9 CFR chapter III. Sections 94.11 and 94.13 generally require that
the meat and other animal products of ruminants or swine be: (1) Prepared in an inspected establishment that is eligible
to have its products imported into the United States under the Federal Meat Inspection Act; and (2) accompanied by
an additional certification from a full-time salaried veterinary official of the national government of the exporting
country, stating that the meat or other animal product has not been commingled with or exposed to meat or other animal
products originating in, imported from, or transported through a country infected with rinderpest, FMD, or SVD.

We are also proposing to add Austria to another list, this one in 
 94.1(d)(1). All countries in which rinderpest or FMD has been known to exist that have been declared free of
rinderpest and FMD on or after September 28, 1990, must be added to this list. Adding Austria to this list would mean
that no llama or alpaca could be imported or entered into the United States from Austria unless in accordance with 9
CFR 92.435. We are not, however, aware of any llamas or alpacas in Austria that are available for export. 



Miscellaneous



In addition to the proposed changes set forth above, we would make several nonsubstantive editorial changes in  94.13
for the sake of clarity or to correct grammatical errors. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 

For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.


This proposed rule, if adopted, would amend the regulations in part 94 by adding Austria to the list of countries declared
to be free of rinderpest and FMD and to the list of countries declared free of SVD. This action would remove the prohibition
on the importation into the United States, from Austria, of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of ruminants,
although those importations would be subject to certain restrictions. This proposed revision would also relieve
restrictions on the importation, from Austria, of milk and milk products of ruminants. 

Based on available information, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports of ruminants and fresh,
chilled, or frozen meat of ruminants from Austria into the United States as a result of this proposed rule. 

The value of total U.S. imports of cattle in 1992 was $1.24 billion, and the value of total U.S. imports of sheep in 1992
was about $2.0 million. The United States did not import any cattle or sheep from Austria during 1992. In fact, with
the exception of a small number of cattle imported from the former Czechoslovakia, no cattle or sheep were imported
into the United States from any country in Europe during 1992 (USDA, Economic Research Service [ERS], ``Foreign Agricultural
Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1992 Supplement,'' 1992). Clearly, Europe is not a source of ruminants for
the United States, and it is unlikely that declaring Austria free of rinderpest and FMD would have any effect on the
existing trade patterns. 

Due to current APHIS restrictions, the United States does not import any uncooked meat or meat products from Austria.
Total U.S. meat production in 1991 (excluding pork) was just under 10.7 million metric tons, while Austrian meat production
in 1991 reached approximately 230,000 metric tons, about 2 percent of the U.S. total (USDA, National Agricultural
Statistics Service, ``Agricultural Statistics, 1992,'' 1992). Therefore, even if Austria exported a significant
portion of its meat production exclusively to the United States, which is unlikely, the effect of those exports on
U.S. domestic prices or supplies would be negligible. 

As with the ruminants and meat products discussed above, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports
of milk and milk products from Austria into the United States as a result of this proposed rule. The importation into
the United States of all dairy products, except for casein and other caseinates, is restricted by quotas. Although
the importation of casein into the United States is not regulated by quotas, world prices of casein are competitively
set. The United States does not produce casein, but does import more than half of the casein produced in the world. The
regulations currently allow casein and other caseinates to be imported into the United States from countries where
rinderpest or FMD exists if the importer has applied for and obtained written permission from the Administrator.
The United States did not import any casein from Austria in 1992 (USDA, ERS, ``Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United
States: Calendar Year 1992 Supplement,'' 1992). Declaring Austria free of rinderpest and FMD, thus removing the
requirement for written permission from the Administrator, is not expected to have any effect on the amount of casein
imported into the United States from Austria because the current restrictions do not substantially impede imports.


The importation of bovine semen and cattle embryos from countries affected with rinderpest and FMD is restricted
under 9 CFR part 98. Although this proposed rule would have the effect of removing certain restrictions on the importation
of bovine semen and cattle embryos from Austria, the economic effect of this proposed rule on the bovine semen and cattle
embryo industries is also expected to be minimal. The United States is a net exporter of bovine semen and cattle embryos.
In 1992, the value of U.S. bovine semen and cattle embryo imports was $4 million and $195,000, respectively, while
the value of U.S. bovine semen and cattle embryo exports was $49.3 million and $6.8 million, respectively (USDA, ERS,
``Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1992 Supplement,'' 1992). Although it is likely
that a few U.S. importers would be interested in importing bovine semen or cattle embryos from Austria if this proposed
rule is adopted, the amount of each that might be imported would be minimal when compared to U.S. domestic production.


Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Executive Order 12778 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted:
(1) All State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule will be preempted; (2) no retroactive
effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file
suit in court challenging this rule. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this proposed rule have been approved by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and there are no new requirements. The assigned OMB control number is 0579-0015.

Loan Guaranty: Acceptance of Partial Payments; Indemnification of Default 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Veterans Affairs.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed regulatory amendments.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend its loan guaranty regulations to comply with certain
provisions of the Veterans Home Loan Indemnity and Restructuring Act of 1989. Changes made by this law which VA proposes
to incorporate into the regulations by these amendments are: The addition of a requirement that the holder provide
notice to the Secretary when refusing to accept partial payment on a loan in default; and a clarification of when a veteran
has liability to the Secretary for a loss due to a loan default. These changes will ensure that no veteran loses a home
because a loan holder returned partial payments in violation of VA requirements and will aid VA in obtaining the cooperation
of veterans in reducing loan guaranty losses by pursuing alternatives to foreclosure.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 VA is proposing to incorporate into its regulations two changes to comply with provisions of Public Law 101-237,
the Veterans Home Loan Indemnity and Restructuring Act of 1989. 


Sections 36.4275(f) and 36.4315(b) of 38 CFR part 36 provide that except under certain conditions described in the
regulations the holder must accept from the borrower partial payment on a loan in default. Public Law 101-237
requires the holder to notify the Secretary when refusing to accept partial payment and provides that the Secretary
may require certain specific information in the notice. VA proposes to amend   36.4275(f) and 36.4315(b)
to incorporate the requirement that the holder notify the Secretary within 10 days after refusing a partial payment.
These sections will also be amended to require that the notice include the date of the tender, the amount tendered,
the date the payment was returned, and the reason for the holder's refusal. This information will enable VA to verify
that the lender's reason for refusal is in compliance with the regulations. 
Section 36.4323(e) provides that the veteran owes a debt to the United States equal to any amount paid by the Secretary
on account of the veteran's liability for the loan. Public Law 101-237 provides that an individual obtaining
a guaranteed or insured loan closed after December 31, 1989, shall have no liability to the Secretary for loss resulting
from a default on the loan, except: (1) In the case of fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith by the individual in obtaining
the loan or in connection with the loan default; or (2) where under 38 U.S.C. 3729(b) an individual pays a fee or is exempt
from paying a fee to assume a loan; or, (3) where an individual obtains a loan for any purpose specified in 38 U.S.C. 3712,
which pertains to manufactured homes. VA proposes to amend 38 CFR 36.4323 to reflect this change and to add a definition
of bad faith to the loan guaranty regulations.

The proposed definition of bad faith is largely consistent with that promulgated at 58 FR 3841 on January 12, 1993 (38
CFR 1.965). There are, however, some differences. Reasons for the differences include: 
1. The 38 CFR 1.965 definition is strictly for use by the Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC). The COWC has jurisdiction
over waiver and compromise of all benefit overpayments, including Loan Guaranty debts, but within its jurisdiction
the COWC only applies the definition of ``bad faith'' to define a condition which will bar waiver of an indebtedness
which has been found to be valid. The COWC is not involved in determining whether a debt is valid. 
2. The examples included with the proposed definition in 38 CFR 36.4202 and 4301 definition are strictly for use by
Loan Guaranty and apply only to home loans. In Loan Guaranty ``bad faith'' is used in a number of contexts which are quite
different from the way in which it is used by the COWC. For example: A Loan Guaranty finding of bad faith is a basis for
establishing a valid debt against a veteran on a GI loan originated after December 31, 1989; it is also the standard
for deciding a veteran's appeal of such a finding.





Note: 

Appeal of the validity of a Loan Guaranty debt is processed by Loan Guaranty_the veteran has the right to file a subsequent
Notice of Disagreement with the Board of Veterans Appeals.

 

For another example: A finding of bad faith on a real estate loan originated before January 1, 1990, prevents Loan Guaranty
from granting a pre-foreclosure waiver of VA's right to establish and collect a veteran's liability account under
38 CFR 36.4323(e)(1). 
3. Loan Guaranty debts differ from other overpayments in that the veteran often bears no direct role in their creation
(i.e., foreclosure often occurs as a result of circumstances outside the veteran's control), in that the veteran
has not profited personally by receiving a benefit (i.e., an overpayment) to which he or she was not entitled, and in
that the amount of the debt which would ultimately be established can often be greatly reduced by the veteran cooperating
with VA. Accordingly, for Loan Guaranty purposes ``bad faith'' must take into account the element of cooperation.

As the examples illustrate, the definition will permit a finding of lack of ``bad faith'' when the veteran is willing
to cooperate with VA but prevented from doing so by circumstances beyond his or her control (e.g., the veteran is willing
to offer a deed in lieu of foreclosure, but his or her spouse refuses to sign). 
Many Loan Guaranty debts are established after foreclosure in cases where less costly alternatives could not be considered
because the veteran did not respond to VA outreach efforts. This proposed regulation permits such a failure to respond
to be deemed a ``failure to cooperate with VA representatives in resolving an insoluble default in a manner which will
minimize the amount of claim payable.'' ``Compelling reasons'' which would justify such failure would be heard by
VA Loan Guaranty if offered after foreclosure inconnection with a veteran's dispute of the validity of an indebtedness.
For example:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940302-1-00015 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940302-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Assume a debt is established against a veteran on a loan originated after December 31, 1989, because he or she did not
respond to VA outreach efforts. After foreclosure, the veteran explains and documents that he or she did not contact
VA and pursue alternatives to foreclosure because, at the time, there was insufficient family income available to
obtain any other housing. The veteran therefore intentionally took advantage of the time required to complete foreclosure
to provide shelter for his or her family. 

If the veteran questioned the validity of the debt by asserting that, under the circumstances, he or she did not show
bad faith, the case would be reviewed by Loan Guaranty. (It could not be reviewed by the COWC because the COWC lacks jurisdiction
over cases where the validity of debt is at issue.) Loan Guaranty could determine there were compelling reasons for
the veteran's action, which would permit recission of the finding of bad faith, thereby invalidating the debt. 

The examples included with the definition are considered appropriate because Loan Guaranty debts arise from substantially
different circumstances than other VA liability accounts. The proposed regulation is intended to clarify the types
of conduct which would be considered ``bad faith'' with respect to Loan Guaranty debts. Comments are specifically
invited on these points. 

Other changes required by Public Law 101-237 are being incorporated into the regulations through separate
amendments. In addition, an amendment has been made to  36.4275 to conform to the requirements of the Fair Housing
Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq. which make it unlawful to discriminate in residential housing transactions against
any person because of familial status or handicap. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



Sections 36.4275 and 36.4315 of these regulations contain information collection requirements which will result
in a reporting burden. The reporting burden is estimated to average 10 minutes per response for a total of 16,667 hours.


The average estimated time per response includes the time for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining
the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. 

As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Department of Veterans Affairs is submitting to
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request that it approve this information collection requirement. Organizations
and individuals desiring to submit comments for consideration by OMB on these proposed information collection requirements
should address them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 3002, New Executive Office Building,
Washington, DC 20503; Attention: Joseph F. Lackey. 

The Secretary hereby certifies that these proposed regulatory amendments will not, if promulgated, have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5
U.S.C. 601-612. The proposed amendments update VA regulations to implement the changes made by Public Law 101-237.
The clarification of when a veteran has liability due to a loan default directly affects individual veterans, not
small entities. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these regulations are exempt from the initial and final regulatory
analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604. 

The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program numbers are 64.114 and 64.119. 



List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 36

On January 7, 1994 (59 FR 3534, January 24, 1994) EPA proposed a rule for the imposition of discretionary sanctions
on the State of California under section 110(m) of the Clean Air Act for failure to submit a complete SIP revision for
an enhanced motor vehicle I/M Program. In the proposed rule, EPA announced its intention to finalize sanctions on
California on May 15, 1994 if sufficient progress had not been made by the State toward the implementation of an approvable
I/M program to be operational on or before January 1, 1995. The proposed rule announced a public hearing on the proposed
action on March 3, 1994 to be held in Los Angeles. 


Following the January 17, 1994 earthquake in California, on January 24, 1994 EPA Administrator Carol Browner sent
a letter to California Governor Pete Wilson advising him that in light of the earthquake in California and the resulting
damage to the state's highway system and economy, EPA was cancelling the May 15, 1994 deadline contained in the proposed
rule for finalizing sanctions on California. Based on Administrator Browner's January 24th letter, EPA is cancelling
the previously scheduled public hearing of March 3, 1994. At this time EPA is not accepting public comment on this proposal.



The public hearing was scheduled to be held on March 3, 1994 in the auditorium of the Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power, 111 North Hope, 
Los Angeles, California 90012 from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. and from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.

List of Regulated Substances for Accidental Release Prevention 
Under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act as Amended; Risk 
Management Programs for Chemical Accident Release Prevention 
Under Section 112(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act as Amended 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Supplemental notice; extension of comment period. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, signed into law on 
November 15, 1990, include provisions for chemical accident 
prevention. On January 31, 1994, the Environmental Protection 
Agency promulgated the list of regulated substances and 
thresholds required under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act as 
Amended (59 FR 4478). The list and threshold quantities will 
identify facilities subject to chemical accident prevention 
regulations to be promulgated under section 112(r) of the Clean 
Air Act as Amended; a proposed regulation for such requirements 
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 20, 1993 (58 FR 
54190). In promulgating the list, EPA deferred action on the 
proposed threshold quantities exemption for listed flammable 
substances when used solely for facility consumption as fuel (see 
58 FR 5102, 5120, (January 19, 1993)). A supplemental notice was 
published on January 31, 1994 (59 FR 4500), requesting additional 
public comment on the hazards associated with flammable 
substances used as fuel and the appropriateness of the proposed 
exemption. In addition, EPA also requested comments on the 
impacts of proposed accident prevention requirements in the 
absence of an exemption, and on ways of reducing the impacts of 
these requirements. This notice extends the public comment 
period for the supplemental notice.

Polyvinyl Alcohol; Tolerance Exemption 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes that an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established for residues of polyvinyl
alcohol (CAS Registry No. 9002-89-5) when used as an inert ingredient (surfactant) in pesticide formulations applied
to food animals. This proposed regulation was requested by Farnum Companies, Inc.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Farnum Cos., Inc., 301 West Osborn, Phoenix, AZ 85013-3928, submitted pesticide petition (PP) 3E4176, requesting
that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(e),
amend 40 CFR 180.1001(e) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of polyvinyl
alcohol (CAS Registry No. 9002-89-5) when used as an inert ingredient (surfactant) in pesticide formulations applied
to food animals.


Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active.
The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statement
on inert ingredients published in the 

Federal Register

 of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risk
posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. Where it can be determined that the inert ingredient
will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not need some or all of the listed studies to rule on the proposed
tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for an inert ingredient. The Agency has decided that any
data, in addition to that described below, normally required to support polyvinyl alcohol will not need to be submitted.
The rationale for this decision is described below.
1. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is very poorly absorbed by the oral and dermal route.
2. Although PVA produces sarcomas, widespread cardiovascular lesions, severe glomerulonephritis and various
organ enlargements when administered by subcutaneous injection, feeding studies indicate a low order of toxicity.
When PVA was fed to rats (2 grams in 45 grams of feed for the first 2 weeks, followed by 4 grams in 45 grams of feed for the
next 2 weeks), no toxic effects were observed and necropsy did not reveal any gross lesions of the internal organs.
3. PVA is cleared as an indirect food additive for use in adhesives (21 CFR 175.105), resinous and polymeric coatings
(21 CFR 175.300 and 175.320), components of paper and paperboard in contact with food (21 CFR 176.170 and 176.180),
with cellophane in food packaging (21 CFR 177.1200), in food-contact film (21 CFR 177.1670), in resin-bonded filters
(21 CFR 177.2260), and in textiles and textile fibers (21 CFR 177.2800).
4. PVA is exempt from the requirement of a tolerance under 40 CFR 180.1001(d) when used as a binder, water soluble bag
container, or film tape for encapsulating seeds. 
Based upon the above information and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural
practice, this ingredient is useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA
proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below.
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request
within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating he document control number, [OPP-300327]. All written comments filed in response to this petition will
be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday, except legal holidays.
 
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12866.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Pesticide Tolerances for Cyromazine




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 








</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA proposes to establish tolerances for combined residues of the insecticide cyromazine and its metabolite melamine
in or on the raw agricultural commodities Chinese cabbage and Chinese mustard. The proposed regulation to establish
maximum permissible levels for residues of the insecticide was requested in petitions submitted by the Interregional
Research Project No. 4 (IR-4). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Interregional Research Project No. 4 (IR-4), New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, P.O. Box 231, Rutgers
University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, has submitted pesticide petitions (PP) 9E3752 and 9E3791 on behalf of the Agricultural
Experiment Station of Florida. These petitions requested that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), amend 40 CFR 180.414 by establishing tolerances
for combined residues of the insecticide cyromazine (

N

-cyclopropyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine) and its metabolite melamine (1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine),
calculated as cyromazine, in or on the raw agricultural commodities Chinese cabbage (PP 9E3752) and Chinese mustard
(PP 9E3791) at 3.0 parts per million (ppm). The petitioner proposed that these uses of cyromazine be limited to Florida
based on the geographical representation of the residue data submitted. Additional residue data will be required
to expand the area of usage. Persons seeking geographically broader registration should contact the Agency's Registration
Division at the address provided above.




The scientific data submitted in the petitions and other relevant material have been evaluated. A discussion of the
toxicological data considered in support of the proposed tolerances as well as a discussion of the risk of cyromazine
and its metabolite melamine can be found in a rule (FAP 2H5355/P344) published in the 

Federal Register

 of April 27, 1984 (49 FR 18120); in the Notice of Conditional Registration for Larvadex 0.3% Premix, published in the


Federal Register

 of May 15, 1985 (50 FR 20373); and in the proposed rule regarding the establishment of a tolerance for residues of cyromazine
and its metabolite melamine, calculated as cyromazine, in or on mushrooms at 10.0 ppm in the 

Federal Register

 of June 30, 1993 (58 FR 34975).




A dietary exposure/risk assessment was performed for cyromazine using a Reference Dose (RfD) of 0.0075 mg/kg body
weight/day. The RfD is based on a NOEL of 0.75 mg/kg/day from a 6-month feeding study in dogs, which demonstrated decreased
hematocrit and hemoglobin levels, and an uncertainty factor of 100. The Theoretical Maximum Residue Contribution
(TMRC) from established tolerances for cyromazine utilizes 60 percent of the RfD for the overall U.S. population
and 66 percent of the RfD for children aged 1 through 6 years. This dietary exposure/risk assessment includes tolerances
for cyromazine on the cucurbit vegetables and leafy vegetables (except Brassica) crop groupings, which are published
elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

 (document control number PP 1F4016 and 2F4053/R2039). The proposed tolerances for Chinese cabbage and Chinese mustard
would utilize less than 1 percent of the RfD for the overall U.S. population and approximately 1% of the RfD for children
aged 1 through 6 years. Since the risk estimates are based on the TMRC, typically an overestimate of actual exposure,
and do not exceed the Reference Dose, the chronic dietary risk of cyromazine does not appear to be of concern.




The nature of the residue in plants is adequately understood for the purposes of these tolerances. An adequate analytical
method, high-pressure liquid chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes in the Pesticide Analytical
Manual, Vol. II (PAM II).




There is no reasonable expectation that secondary residues will occur in milk, eggs, or meat of livestock and poultry
since there are no livestock or poultry feed items associated with this action.




Based on the information and data considered, the Agency has determined that the tolerances established by amending
40 CFR part 180 would protect the public health. Therefore, it is proposed that the tolerances be established as set
forth below.

Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request
within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA.

Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [PP 9E3752 and 9E3791/P575]. All written comments filed in response to these
petitions will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8
a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.

Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.

Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Kansas; Approval of State Underground Storage Tank Program 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Tentative Determination on Application of the State of Kansas for Final Approval, Public Comment Period.




 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The State of Kansas has applied for final approval of its underground storage tank (UST) program under subtitle I of
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Kansas'
application and has made the tentative decision that Kansas' UST program satisfies all of the requirements necessary
to qualify for final approval. Thus, EPA intends to grant final approval to Kansas to operate its program in lieu of
the federal program. Kansas' application for final approval is available for public review and comment and a public
hearing will be held to solicit comments on the application, if there is significant interest.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



A. Background 



Section 9004 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) enables EPA to approve State UST programs to operate
in the State in lieu of the Federal UST program. Program approval is granted by EPA if the Agency finds that the State
program is: (1) ``No less stringent'' than the Federal program in new tank standards, upgrading existing tanks, general
operating requirements, release detection, release reporting, corrective action, tank closure, financial responsibility
and notification requirements of section 9004(a)(8), 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a)(8); and (2) provides for adequate enforcement
of compliance with UST standards (section 9004(a), 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a)).

B. Kansas 


Kansas promulgated its first UST regulations in 1981 under the authority of the water pollution control statutes.
With the enactment of the Kansas Storage Tank Act, K.S.A. 65-34,101 through 65-34,124, promulgated on
May 18, 1989, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment now has specific authority to regulate underground
storage tanks and enforce compliance of these regulations. Over the years the regulations have undergone a series
of revisions which now are consistent with and no less stringent than the Federal program. The program includes standards
for: new tanks, upgrading existing tanks, general operating requirements, release detection, release reporting,
corrective action, tank closure, financial responsibility and notification requirements. These regulations
have been in effect since November 26, 1990. 
On September 1, 1993, Kansas submitted an official application for ``complete'' program approval which includes
regulation of both petroleum and hazardous substance tanks. Kansas also regulates heating oil tanks with the exception
of tanks used to store heating oil for consumptive use on a single family residence. However, this part of the Kansas
program is broader in scope than the Federal program and is not included in this tentative approval. Prior to its submission,
Kansas provided an opportunity for public notice and comment in the development of its underground storage tank program
as required under 40 CFR 281.50(b). EPA has reviewed Kansas' application and has tentatively determined that the
State's program meets all of the necessary requirements to qualify for final approval. Consequently, EPA intends
to grant Kansas final approval to Kansas to operate its program in lieu of the Federal program. 
The public may submit comments regarding EPA's tentative determination as provided in the ``Submission of Comments''
section of this notice. 


Compliance With Executive Order 12866 


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.



Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The approval effectively suspends the applicability of certain
Federal regulations in favor of Kansas' program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for owners and operators
of underground storage tanks in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. 


Submission of Comments 


The public may submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination 
until April 1, 1994. EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public
comment period or which may be received at the public hearing. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a
decision to deny final approval to Kansas. EPA expects to make a final decision on whether or not to approve Kansas'
program by May 31, 1994 and will give notice of it in the 

Federal Register

. The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments.

A public hearing will be held only if significant public interest on substantive issues is shown. Any request for a
hearing and all comments on Kansas' final approval application must be received at the EPA Region 7 office by the close
of business on April 1, 1994. If a public hearing is held, all those making comments or requesting a hearing will be notified
by EPA of the place and time.

NASA FAR Supplement Coverage on Uncompensated Overtime 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Procurement, Procurement Policy Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule proposes to amend the NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation (NFS) to include coverage on evaluation of uncompensated
overtime. NASA's policy is to consider uncompensated overtime in the evaluation of proposals and professional compensation.
Contracting officers are required to conduct a risk assessment of proposals for technical and professional services
that include low labor rates and/or a high level of uncompensated overtime. A solicitation provision is prescribed
for use in solicitations for professional and technical services estimated at $500,000 or more. Use of the provision
is optional between $100,000 and $500,000. The provision requires offerors to identify uncompensated overtime
hours and the effective hourly rate for all Fair Labor Standards Act-exempt personnel included in their proposals
and subcontractor proposals.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



The proposed coverage was generated in response to industry and internal NASA requests for a uniform uncompensated
overtime policy within the Agency. 



Impact



NASA certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.). It requires offerors to identify
uncompensated overtime hours in their proposals, including their uncompensated overtime policy and the historical
basis for those hours. This information is in many cases already being provided by offerors for proposal evaluation
and is not required for lower dollar value procurements. NASA will request OMB approval of any reporting or recordkeeping
requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act.

(a) To the maximum extent practicable, it is the policy of NASA to acquire services on the basis of the task to be performed
rather than on a labor-hour basis.
(b) The use of uncompensated overtime (as defined in 1852.237-71) is neither encouraged nor discouraged. When
the proposed uncompensated overtime is consistent with an offeror's written policies and practices, NASA will consider
it in proposal evaluation and the evaluation of professional compensation (see (FAR) 48 CFR 22.11).


1837.110 

[Amended]


b. Section 1837.110 is revised to read as follows:


1837.110 

Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.


(a) The contracting officer shall obtain the Associate Administrator for Procurement's (Code HC) approval before
using in a solicitation, contract, or negotiated contract modification for additional work any installation-developed
clause involving pension portability.
(b) When professional and technical services are acquired on the basis of the number of hours to be provided, rather
than on the task to be performed, and the resulting contract is expected to exceed $500,000, the contracting officer
shall insert the provision at 1852.237-72, Identification of Uncompensated Overtime, in the solicitation.
Use of this provision is optional between $100,000 and $500,000. This provision requires offerors to identify uncompensated
overtime hours and the effective hourly rate for all Fair Labor Standards Act-exempt personnel included in their
proposals and subcontractor proposals. This includes uncompensated overtime hours that are in indirect cost pools
for personnel whose regular hours are normally charged direct (see 1815.608-72).


PART 1852_SOLICITATION PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT CLAUSES


4. Section 1852.237-72 is added to read as follows:


1852.237-71 

Identification of Uncompensated Overtime.


As prescribed in 1837.110(b), insert the following provision:


Identification of Uncompensated Overtime (XXX 1993)


(a) 

Definitions.

 As used in this provision:


Uncompensated overtime

 means the hours worked in excess of an average of 40 hours per week, by direct charge employees who are exempt from the
Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) without additional compensation. Compensated personal absences, such as holidays,
vacations, and sick leave shall be included in the normal work week for purposes of computing uncompensated overtime
hours.


Effective hourly rate

 is the rate which results from multiplying the hourly rate for a 40-hour work week by 40, and then dividing by the proposed
hours per week. For example, 45 hours proposed on a 40-hour work week basis at $20.00 per hour would be converted to an
effective hourly rate of $17.78 per hour [($20.00 x 40) divided by 45 = $17.78.]

(b) For any hours proposed against which an effective hourly rate is applied, the Offeror shall identify in its proposal
the hours in excess of an average of 40 hours per week, at the same level of detail as compensated hours, and the effective
hourly rate, whether at the prime or subcontract level. This includes uncompensated overtime hours that are in indirect
cost pools for personnel whose regular hours are normally charged direct. The proposal shall include the rationale
and methodology used to estimate the proposed amount of uncompensated overtime.


(c) The Offeror's accounting practices used to estimate uncompensated overtime must be consistent with its cost
accounting practices used to accumulate and report uncompensated overtime hours.

(d) Proposals which include unrealistically low labor rates, or which do not otherwise demonstrate cost realism,
will be considered in a technical and cost risk assessment and evaluated for award in accordance with that assessment.




(e) The Offeror shall include with its proposal a copy of its policy addressing uncompensated overtime, including
a description of the timekeeping and accounting systems used to record all hours worked by FLSA-exempt employees,
and the historical basis for the uncompensated overtime hours proposed.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes to alter the Charlotte, NC, Class B airspace area. This proposal would maintain the upper limit
of the Charlotte, Class B airspace area at 10,000 feet mean sea level (MSL) and redefine several existing subareas
to improve air traffic procedures. The primary goal of this Class B airspace area modification is to improve safety
while providing the most efficient use of the terminal airspace. This action is intended to improve the flow of traffic
and increase safety in the Charlotte/Douglas terminal area. Airspace Reclassification, in effect as of September
16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``Terminal Control Area,'' replacing it with the term ``Class B airspace
area.''

Related Rulemaking Actions




On May 21, 1970, the FAA published Amendment 91-78 to part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (35 FR 7782),
which provided for the establishment of Terminal Control Areas (TCA's).


On February 3, 1987, the FAA published a final rule that established requirements pertaining to the use, installation,
inspection, and testing of Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) and Mode S transponders in U.S.-registered
civil aircraft (53 FR 3380). The rule did not affect the requirement to have an operable transponder in a TCA.

On June 21, 1988, the FAA published a final rule that requires aircraft to have Mode C equipment when operating below
10,000 feet MSL within 30 nautical miles of any designated TCA primary airport, except for those aircraft not originally
certified with an engine driven electrical system or which have not subsequently been certified with such a system
installed (53 FR 23356).


On October 14, 1988, the FAA published a final rule that revised the classification and pilot/equipment requirements
for conducting operations in a TCA (53 FR 40318). Specifically, the rule: (a) Established a single-class TCA; (b)
requires the pilot-in-command of a civil aircraft operating within a TCA to hold at least a private pilot certificate,
except for a student pilot who has received certain documented training; and (c) eliminated the helicopter exception
from the minimum navigational equipment requirement.



On December 17, 1991, the FAA published a final rule on airspace reclassification (56 FR 65655). As a result of this
reclassification, that airspace formerly referred to as the Charlotte, NC, Terminal Control Area was reclassified
to Charlotte, NC, Class B airspace area, effective September 16, 1993.

Background


The Class B airspace area (Terminal Control Area prior to September 16, 1993) program was developed to reduce the midair
collision potential in the congested airspace surrounding airports with high density air traffic by providing an
area in which all aircraft will be subject to certain operating rules and equipment requirements. The density of traffic
and the types of operations being conducted in the airspace surrounding major terminals increase the probability
of midair collisions. In 1970, an extensive study found that the majority of midair collisions occurred between a
general aviation (GA) aircraft and an air carrier, military or another GA aircraft. The basic causal factor common
to these conflicts was the mix of uncontrolled aircraft operating under visual flight rules (VFR) and controlled
aircraft operating under instrument flight rules (IFR). Class B airspace areas provide a method to accommodate the
increasing number of IFR and VFR operations. The regulatory requirements of Class B airspace area afford the greatest
protection for the greatest number of people by giving air traffic control (ATC) increased capability to provide
aircraft separation service, thereby minimizing the mix of controlled and uncontrolled aircraft. To date, the FAA
has established a total of 29 Class B airspace area designations. The FAA is proposing to take action to modify or implement
additional Class B airspace area, to provide greater protection of air traffic in the airspace regions most commonly
used by passenger-carrying aircraft.


Pre-NPRM Public Input


The North Carolina State Department of Transportation, Division of Aviation, coordinated the establishment and
oversight of an ad hoc committee to develop a viable Class B airspace area design recommendation. Representation
from airport users and local aviation groups, including those that participated in the original Terminal Control
Area ad hoc committee, was solicited and attained. Local control tower facility representatives provided technical
input to the ad hoc committee. The committee's comments and recommendations were forwarded to the FAA's Southern
Region for evaluation, on February 19, 1992, for review and incorporated into the proposed Charlotte, Class B airspace
area modification. As announced in the 

Federal Register

, 57 FR 14745, April 22, 1992, pre-NPRM airspace meetings were held on June 17 and 18, 1992, at the North Carolina Air
National Guard Dining Facility, to allow other local interested airspace users an opportunity to provide input to
the proposed Charlotte, Class B airspace area modification. As a result of those informal airspace meetings, seven
letters were received from aviation organizations, soaring organizations and private citizens. The ad hoc committee
report, letters submitted to the FAA, and the minutes of both airspace meetings are contained in the FAA airspace docket.
The context of these letters, airspace meeting comments/concerns, and the FAA's findings, are summarized as follows:



1. Some persons were disappointed because they were not selected to be members of the ad hoc committee. The ad hoc committee
members were chosen by the committee chairman, Mr. J.L. Bondurant, under the oversight of the North Carolina State
DOT, Aviation Division. All significant aviation interests were represented by the committee. Any persons who did
not participate on the committee had the opportunity during this phase to express their views for the FAA's consideration.
2. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) requested that the Class B airspace area altitude be lowered
from 10,000 feet MSL to 8,000 feet MSL. The FAA rejected that proposal. Lowering the ceiling of the Class B airspace
area would encourage VFR flight over the Class B airspace area between 8,000 feet MSL and 10,000 feet MSL, especially
east/west operations. Should VFR pilots begin operating in that area, they would encounter heavy arrival and departure
traffic within 15 miles of the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport. Traffic routinely descends on the downwind
leg of the landing pattern, from altitudes above 8,000 feet MSL. Additionally, VFR pilots would conflict with traffic
on VOR Federal Airway V-37, a route commonly used for IFR operations into and out of the Class B airspace area.
3. One commenter stated that lowering the floor of the Class B airspace area from 6,000 feet MSL to 3,600 feet MSL within
the 20 to 25 mile segment north and south of the airport would allow placement of aircraft at a dangerously low altitude
a long way from the runway. Aircraft outside the existing Class B airspace area are at these altitudes because of the
requirements necessary to conduct simultaneous instrument approaches to parallel runways within the Class B airspace
area. Under those approach procedures, it is not unusual or dangerous to have aircraft at these altitudes and distances
on the final approach course.
4. Members of the Soaring Association proposed that the Class B airspace area not be amended until actual air traffic
growth warrants further change. They also questioned whether more airspace would increase the airport's ability
to handle a higher number of aircraft. The decision to propose modifying the Class B airspace area was based on the current
air traffic growth and operational requirements (See discussion of specific growth figures later in this document).
At times, aircraft cross the boundary of the Class B airspace area during simultaneous instrument approaches to parallel
runways. Since modification is being pursued at this time for operational reasons, it is desirable for the FAA to consider
all factors, including future airport and air traffic growth forecast.
5. Several commenters noted that other existing Class B airspace areas have primary airports with runway configurations
similar to Charlotte/Douglas International, and the Class B airspace area does not extend beyond 20 miles in any direction.
The commenters stated that, because the runway configuration of the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport is
similar to those other primary airports, the FAA's proposal, which includes Class B airspace area out to 30 miles,
is inappropriate. The FAA's responsibility is to manage effectively the airspace surrounding the Charlotte area,
while providing the requisite level of safety. Comparison with other airports is generally inappropriate, since
no two airports are the same. Each Class B airspace area must be site specific; and to meet the operational needs of the
Charlotte area, the Charlotte Class B airspace area is required to extend out to 30 nautical miles.
6. The Chester Soaring Association questioned the need to modify the airspace to accommodate simultaneous instrument
approaches that occur less than 50 percent of the time. Regardless of the percentage of use, it is unacceptable to the
FAA to have any aircraft routinely vectored beyond the boundaries of the Class B airspace area into airspace where
aircraft separation is not provided to all aircraft.

7. The Chester Soaring Association also objected to lowering the Class B airspace area floor southwest and southeast
of the airport from 8,000 feet MSL to 6,000 feet MSL. It also shared the opinion of the Soaring Society of America that
lowering the floor of the Class B airspace area will render the Chester Soaring site unusable for competition. The
proposed design was submitted by the ad hoc committee as a means of containing aircraft descending on base leg, within
the Class B airspace area while conducting simultaneous instrument approaches. While the FAA understands the concerns
of the soaring community, those concerns can be accommodated only to the extent that they do not compromise the FAA's
ability to manage efficiently the Charlotte Class B airspace area and provide the optimum level of safety to the flying
public.

All comments were considered in developing the proposal to modify the Class B airspace area. If these modifications
are adopted, the revised Charlotte Class B airspace area chart will depict VFR flyways and specific access instructions
to facilitate alternatives to flight within the Class B airspace area.



The Proposal




The FAA proposes to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the existing Charlotte
Class B airspace area, based on safety and operational needs. The FAA's responsibility is to manage efficiently the
airspace surrounding the Charlotte area while providing the optimum level of safety to the flying public. The number
of enplaned passengers at Charlotte/Douglas International Airport was 7,784,047 in 1991 and 8,425,447 in 1992,
an increase of 8.2 percent. The airport operations were 440,956 in 1991 and 466,351 in 1992, more than a 5.8 percent
increase in traffic.

Section 91.131 of part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 91.131) prescribes rules for aircraft operating
in airspace designated as a Class B airspace area. The Class B airspace area rule provides, in part, that prior to entering
the Class B airspace area, any pilot at any airport within the Class B airspace area or flying through the Class B airspace
area must: (1) Obtain appropriate authorization from ATC; (2) comply with applicable procedures established by
ATC for pilot training operations at an airport within a Class B airspace area; and (3) hold at least a private pilot
certificate or meet the requirements of  61.95 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 61.95), if the aircraft
is operated by a student pilot.

Any person operating an aircraft within a Class B airspace area must have the aircraft equipped with an operable two-way
radio capable of communications with ATC on appropriate frequencies for that Class B airspace area, and the applicable
operating transponder and automatic altitude-reporting equipment specified in paragraph (b)(1) of  91.215
of the Federal Aviation Regulations. Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, all large, turbine-powered aircraft operating
to or from a Class B airspace area-primary airport must be operated at or above the designated floors of the Class B airspace
area while within the lateral limits of the Class B airspace area. The pilot of any aircraft departing from an airport
located within the surface area of a Class B airspace area is required to receive a clearance from ATC prior to takeoff.

All aircraft operating within a Class B airspace area are required to comply with all ATC clearances and instructions.
However, ATC may authorize deviations from any of the operating requirements of the rule when safety considerations
justify the deviation. Ultralight vehicle operations and parachute jumps in a Class B airspace area may only be conducted
under the terms of an ATC authorization. Definitions and operating requirements applicable to Class B airspace area
may be found in 14 CFR 71.41, 91.1, 91.117, 91.131, 91.215, SFAR No. 62, and appendix D to part 91 of the FAR.

The standard configuration of a Class B airspace area consists of 3 concentric circles centered on the primary airport
extending to 10, 20, and 30 nautical miles respectively. Generally, the vertical limits of the Class B airspace are
10,000 feet MSL, with the floor established at the surface in the inner area and at levels appropriate to containment
of operations in the outer areas. Variations of these criteria may be necessary contingent upon terrain, adjacent
regulatory airspace, and other factors unique to the terminal area. The site specific airspace configuration proposed
herein is the result of an extensive FAA study, conducted after obtaining public input through an ad hoc committee,
informal airspace meetings and written comments. Copies of the report of this study are contained in the FAA docket
and are available on request. The FAA has determined that the proposed alteration of airspace for the Charlotte Class
B airspace area would be consistent with Class B airspace area objectives. The proposed configuration considers
the present terminal area flight operations and terrain.

The following proposed modification of the Charlotte Class B airspace area reflects public comments and user group
inputs:
Area A. That airspace extending upward from the surface to and including 10,000 feet MSL within a 7-mile radius of the
Charlotte VOR/DME.
This airspace is necessary to contain large turbine-powered aircraft within the Class B airspace area, while operating
to and from the primary airport, and allow for ingress/egress to secondary airports.
Area B. That airspace extending upward from 1,800 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL between the 7- and 11-mile
radius of the Charlotte VOR/DME, excluding that airspace within a 2-mile radius of the Gastonia Airport.
This airspace is required for vectoring aircraft arriving at, and departing from, the primary airport.
Area C. That airspace extending upward from 3,600 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL between the 11- and 25-mile
radius of the Charlotte VOR/DME, including that airspace within a 2-mile radius of the Gastonia Airport, excluding
that airspace within and below Areas D, E, and F hereinafter described.
This airspace configuration would provide an area to contain aircraft during climb and descent transition maneuvers
between the terminal and enroute structures.
Area D. That airspace extending upward from 4,600 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL between the 20- and 25-mile
radius northwest of the Charlotte VOR/DME, bounded on the west by U.S. Highway 321, and bounded on the east by the Marshall
Steam Plant Rail Spur; and that airspace between the 20- and 25-mile radius southwest of the Charlotte VOR/DME, bounded
on the east by U.S. Highway 21, and bounded on the west by a line due south from the Charlotte VOR/DME 218
  radial 20-mile fix to the intersection of the 25-mile arc.
This airspace is required to provide an area to contain aircraft using Charlotte/Douglas International Airport
during profile descent. The proposed floor would allow sufficient airspace for VFR operations underneath the Class
B airspace area.
Area E. That airspace extending upward from 6,000 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL beginning at lat. 35

  radial, thence direct to the point of beginning, excluding that airspace east of U.S. Highway 601 between the
Charlotte VOR/DME 062
  radial clockwise to the 120
  radial.
This airspace is required to provide an area to contain aircraft descending into the Charlotte/Douglas International
Airport. The proposed boundaries would allow sufficient airspace for VFR aircraft operations outside the Class
B airspace area.
Area F. That airspace extending upward from 8,000 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL between the 20- and 25-mile
radius of the Charlotte VOR/DME from the 242

between the 062
  radial of the Charlotte VOR/DME clockwise to the 120
  radial and east of U.S. Highway 601.
This airspace is necessary to provide descent profile for aircraft en route to Charlotte/Douglas International
Airport and to allow sufficient airspace to VFR operations at area airports.

The preceding summary of the proposed alteration to the Class B airspace area configuration identifies that airspace
which is necessary to contain large turbojet aircraft operations at the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport.
ATC would provide control and separation service for all flights within the proposed airspace boundaries. Furthermore,
ATC clearance is required for aircraft operations within that airspace. Modifying this Class B airspace area would
greatly enhance the safety of flight within the congested airspace overlying the Charlotte metropolitan area by
facilitating the separation of controlled and uncontrolled flight operations.

Class B airspace area designations are published in Paragraph 3000 of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, and is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298), July 6, 1993. The Class B airspace
area designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the order.



Regulatory Evaluation



In keeping with the ``principles of regulation'' contained in Executive Order 12866, this section summarizes the
regulatory evaluation prepared by the FAA on the proposed amendment to 14 CFR part 71_to alter the Charlotte, Class
B airspace area, Charlotte, NC. The full regulatory evaluation, contained in the docket, assesses and quantifies,
to the extent practicable, estimated costs and anticipated benefits to the private sector, consumers, and Federal,
state, and local governments. Additionally, the FAA has determined that this proposed rule is not a ``significant
regulatory action''.

Operational requirements mandate that the Class B airspace area shelves be lowered between 20 and 25 nautical miles
of the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport (CLT) to more easily accommodate large turbine-powered aircraft
operating in the Class B airspace area. This situation is particularly critical when conducting simultaneous ILS
operations due to the present lack of maneuvering airspace for aircraft on final approach to CLT or taking off from
CLT.

The proposed modifications of the Charlotte Class B airspace area are the result of a staff study conducted by the local
FAA authority. The staff's goal was to determine a better Class B airspace area design that would provide greater safety
for aircraft operating to and from CLT. The airspace design reflects user feedback and information obtained during
Informal Airspace Meetings held June 17 and 18, 1992 at the North Carolina Air National Guard Facility at Charlotte
Douglas International Airport.

The proposed modifications were chosen after reviewing three options. The FAA does not recommend the first option,
to retain the existing Class B airspace area design, because the area boundaries do not conform to current guidelines
for regulated airspace at busier terminal facilities (FAA Order 7400.2), nor do these boundaries provide the necessary
Class B airspace area to handle levels of traffic experienced today and projected for the future. The second option,
which is also not recommended, would modify the existing Class B airspace area to the standard configuration as contained
in FAA Order 7400.2. This option does not have any visual references and the amount of airspace involved would be greater
than needed. The FAA chose the third option, which would establish a site specific Class B airspace area configuration
based on the operational needs of the Air Traffic facility and input from the Charlotte Class B airspace area ad hoc
committee. This option provides necessary Class B airspace area that would contain Charlotte present and future
traffic flows. It would also minimize the impact on airspace users and would also enhance the visual means for boundary
definition. Finally, it would provide airspace below the floor of the Class B airspace area for VFR operators desiring
to remain clear of the Class B airspace area. It would, however, require site-specific charting, and a non-standard
design would require heightened area awareness by users. It would also establish controlled airspace where it currently
does not exist thereby impacting some users.



Cost Analysis



The proposed rule would impose little or no administrative costs to the FAA. Additional personnel and equipment are
not needed to implement this rule. The FAA's controller workforce would be trained in the aspects and procedures of
the proposed Class B airspace area during regularly scheduled briefing sessions at no additional costs to the FAA.

The Charlotte Sectional Chart and the Charlotte Terminal Area Chart would have to be revised, but the FAA would make
these changes when those charts are routinely updated. These changes are considered part of the ordinary cost of chart
revision, and therefore, the FAA would incur no additional costs. Because pilots normally use current charts, they
should not incur any additional charting costs either; as the charts become obsolete, pilots should replace them
with charts that depict the modified Class B airspace area.

The proposed rule would impose little costs to VFR users for several reasons. The FAA expects that Lincolnton, Jaars/Townsend,
and Lake Norman airports would be the only public airports affected by the lower floor. North of Charlotte, the Class
B airspace area floor would change from 6,000 feet to 4,600 feet (over Lincolnton) and would create a 6,000 foot floor
over Lake Norman. South of Charlotte, the Jaars/Townsend airport would be affected by the floor of the Class B airspace
area 



changing from 6,000 feet to 3,600 feet. Those pilots who currently use this airspace and wish to remain free of Class
B airspace area control would incur circumnavigational costs. However, the added time and cost to circumnavigate
is expected to be minimal. Those pilots who continue to operate in this airspace by participating in the Charlotte,
Class B airspace area would be inconvenienced.

VFR operators who do not routinely fly inside the Charlotte, Class B airspace area may be potentially inconvenienced
by having to participate in the Class B airspace area, (i.e., contact ATC and follow operational rules), if they operate
in the areas of proposed Class B airspace area expansion. The FAA believes that most VFR operators would not be significantly
inconvenienced because they are already participating in the Class B airspace area, either by voluntarily contacting
ATC when in areas adjacent to or under the Class B airspace area by monitoring ATC frequencies.

Those aircraft operators who wish to avoid the Class B airspace area could face circumnavigational costs in those
areas where the floor would be lowered north and south of the airport. However, the FAA believes that the costs would
be negligible. Nevertheless, the FAA welcomes comments from those individuals that could potentially be affected
by increased circumnavigational costs.

Finally, sailplane pilots, such as those representing the Chester Soaring Association, could face increased costs
by having 


to relocate to a new airport should they not be able to fly at Chester. In general, these users could incur costs if the
FAA determines that a desired level of safety to the flying public could not be maintained if sailplanes a
