Eldorado National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan; Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for resource management activities, including
biomass removal, timber harvest, fuelbreak construction and wildlife habitat improvement work on the Whale Rock
Forest Health Multi-resource Project, involving a total planning area size of about 4,500 acres on the Pacific Ranger
District of the Eldorado National Forest. The agency invites written comments and suggestions on the scope of the
analysis. The agency also gives notice of the full environmental analysis and decisionmaking process that will occur
on the proposal so that interested and affected people are aware of how they may participate and contribute to the final
decision.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Eldorado National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan was completed in January 1989. The Whale Rock Forest
Health Multi-resource Project EIS will tier to the approved Eldorado National Forest Land and Resource Management
Plan. Most of the land in the analysis area is identified in the approved Plan as having a general management direction
of timber management.




There are no known permits or licenses required to implement the proposed action.

In preparing the EIS, the Forest Service will identify and consider a range of alternatives for this project. The proposed
alternatives will include the following tentative alternative themes:




1. No Action

2. Forest Health_timber product, including biomass, management emphasis

3. Forest Health_wildlife management emphasis

4. Forest Health_fuels management emphasis

5. Forest Health_multiple use management emphasis.




These alternatives will consider varying levels and distribution of vegetation manipulation, timber harvest and
fuels management. No new specified road construction is anticipated. Road reconstruction needs will include drainage
work, clearing and minor realignment. The amount of road reconstruction necessary for this project will vary between
alternatives. Harvest prescriptions will include understory removal of both merchantable and sub-merchantable
trees, commercial thinning, and fuelbreak construction guidelines. All harvest prescriptions will conform with
the California Spotted Owl Sierran Province Interim Guidelines Environmental Assessment and Decision Notice.
Adaptive management strategies for the Spotted Owl may be included under certain alternatives where benefits to
the spotted owl can be shown, that is, wildlife habitat activities or fuel management activities that are designed
to better maintain future management options of the spotted owl by improving or retaining stand components most at
risk.

Volume estimates of timber to be harvested range from 0 to 10 mmbf of commercial sawtimber. Biomass estimates range
from 0 to 30,000 tons. These estimates will be dependent on which alternative is chosen.

Preliminary issues that have been identified during the internal scoping process include:




1. The potential for cumulative watershed effects within the project area.

2. The selection and application of adaptive management strategies to best achieve the habitat needs of the spotted
owl.




Public participation will be especially important at several points during the analysis. The first point is during
the scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7).

The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments, and assistance from federal, state, and local agencies
and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed project. This input will
be used in preparation of the draft EIS. The scoping process includes:




1. Defining the scope of the analysis and nature of the decision to be made.

2. Identifying the issues and determining the significant issues for consideration and analysis within the EIS.

3. Defining the proper interdisciplinary team make-up.

4. Determining the effective use of time and money in conducting the analysis.

5. Identifying potential environmental, technical, and social impacts of the EIS and alternatives.

6. Determining potential cooperating agencies.

7. Identifying groups or individuals interested or affected by the decision.




Robert Harris, Acting Forest Supervisor, Eldorado National Forest, is the responsible official.

The draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to be available for public
review by June 1994. At that time EPA will publish a notice of availability of the draft EIS in the 

Federal Register

. The comment period on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date that EPA's notice of availability appears in the 

Federal Register.



The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewers's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.

 v. 

NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978).

 Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement stage, but that
are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed by the
courts. 

City of Angoon

 v. 

Hodel, 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986)

 and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.

 v. 

Harris, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980).

Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by
the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest
Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final environmental impact statement.

To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

After the comment period ends on the draft EIS, the comments will be analyzed and considered by the Forest Service in
prearing the final EIS. The final EIS is scheduled to be completed by October 1994. In the final EIS the Forest Service
is required to respond to the comments and responses received (40 CFR 1503.4). The responsible official will considered
the comments, responses, and enviornmental consequences discussed in the draft EIS; and applicable laws, regulations,
and policies in making a decision regarding this project. The responsible official will document the decision and
reasons for the decision in the Record of Decision. That decision will be subject to appeal pursuant to 36 CFR part 215.

Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic of China: Notice of Court Decision; Exclusion From the Application of the
Antidumping Duty Order, in Part; Termination of Administrative Reviews; and Amended Final Determination and Order



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of amendment to amended final determination of sales at less-than-fair-value, exclusion from the application
of the amended antidumping duty order, and termination of administrative reviews in accordance with decision upon
remand.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On January 5, 1994, the United States Court of International Trade (``CIT'') affirmed the Department's May 14, 1993,
remand determination without comment. See 

CEC Electrical Manufacturing (Int'l) Company Ltd. 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 94-2 (CIT January 5, 1994). The remand resulted in a finding of a 

de minimis 

margin for CEC Electrical Manufacturing (International) Company, Ltd./CEC Industries (Shenzhen) Ltd./CEC (USA)
Texas Group, Inc. (``CEC'') and, consequently, a negative determination of sales at less than fair value for the investigation
of CEC. Therefore, CEC is excluded from the application of the antidumping duty order on ceiling fans from the People's
Republic of China (``PRC''). Because CEC is excluded from the application of the antidumping duty order, we are also
terminating both ongoing administrative reviews with respect to CEC. In addition, the exclusion of CEC results in
a change in the all others rate.


 </SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background: 


On June 5, 1991, the Department published its Preliminary Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Oscillating
Fans and Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic of China (56 FR 25664). In that determination, the Department found
CECs weighted-average dumping margin for the ceiling fans class or kind of merchandise to be 0.37 percent, 

de minimis. 

(CEC was not identified as a producer or exporter of products within the oscillating fans class or kind of merchandise.)
However, in the final determination the Department found CEC's weighted-average dumping margin for the ceiling
fans to be 2.70 percent. See Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Oscillating Fans and Ceiling Fans
From the People's Republic of China, 56 FR 55271 (October 25, 1991). Consequently, we instructed the U.S. Customs
Service to begin suspension of liquidation of all entries of ceiling fans manufactured by CEC entered into U.S. Customs
territory on or after October 25, 1991, the date of publication of the final determination. On December 9, 1991, the
Department published an amendment to its final determinations, and antidumping duty orders in this proceeding.
See Antidumping Duty Orders and Amendments to Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Oscillating
Fans and Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic of China, 56 FR 64240 (December 9, 1991) (``Fans LTFV Final and Order'').

CEC instituted an action at the CIT challenging the Department's final less-than-fair-value determination.

1

 

See CEC Electrical Manufacturing (Int'l) Company Ltd. 

v. 

United States, 

Court No. 92-01-0014 (``

CEC Electrical

''). On December 7, 1992, the Department filed a motion before the CIT for voluntary remand in 

CEC Electrical, 

and on December 8, 1992, the CIT granted the Department's request. Pursuant to the court's order granting voluntary
remand, on May 14, 1993, the Department presented to the court the 

Final Results of Redetermination Pursuant To Grant Of Voluntary Remand: CEC Electrical Manufacturing Company Ltd.


v. 

United States 

(``

Voluntary Remand

''). 




In that remand redetermination, the Department considered four issues raised by CEC. These were:

 

1. Double-counting of certain inputs in the downrod assembly; 
2. Double-counting of the raw material input in the paddle brackets; 



</SUPPLEM>
</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940302-2-00008 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940302-2-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

3. Misreported price of a specific input for one fan model; and 
4. The Department's use of surrogate equivalents for certain inputs.

 

Regarding issues one and two, the Department determined that double-counting had occurred in both instances in the


Fans LTFV Final and Order. 

For the remand redetermination we eliminated all such double-counting. Regarding issue three, we corrected the
misreported price. Finally, issue four involves CEC's challenge of certain applications of surrogate data in valuing
factors of production. CEC claimed that the Department is required to adjust surrogate data for such factors as: the
number of fan blades; the size of the fan; and variations in packing materials. In the remand redetermination we rejected
CEC's arguments. The basis for our rejection is that section 773(c)(1) of the Act provides for valuation of factors
of production on the ``best available information'' from an appropriate surrogate country, not on the basis of perfectly
conforming information. Therefore, we maintained that we were not required to make the adjustments CEC requested.
The Department's redetermination on remand was affirmed by the CIT on January 5, 1994. See 

CEC Electrical Manufacturing (Int'l) Company Ltd. 

v. 

United States,

 Slip Op. 94-2 (CIT January 5, 1994). 
As a result of these three modifications to our antidumping duty calculations, the final weighted-average dumping
margin for CEC is 0.37 percent, and is, therefore, 

de minimis, 

pursuant to 
section 353.6(a) of the Department's regulations. Consequently, our final less-than-fair-value determination
for CEC is negative. 


Exclusion From the Application of the Antidumping Duty Order, in Part


Pursuant to section 735(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.21(c), we are excluding CEC from the application of the antidumping
duty order on imports of ceiling fans. However, if the Department has reasonable cause to believe or suspect at any
time during the existence of the antidumping duty order that CEC has sold or is likely to sell the subject merchandise
to the United States at less than its foreign market value, the Department may institute an administrative review
of CEC under section 751(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. 
Because CEC obtained an injunction during the court proceeding, the effective date of the exclusion is retroactive
to October 25, 1991, the publication date of the Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Oscillating
Fans and Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic of China, and the date we began suspension of liquidation for entries
of CEC ceiling fans from the PRC. 


Termination of Administrative Reviews


Since publication of the 

Fans LTFV Final and Order, 

the Department has initiated, pursuant to section 751 of the Act, first and second administrative reviews of the antidumping
duty order. Those reviews are investigating imports of subject merchandise during the respective review periods
by CEC (as well as other producers). (See our published notices of initiation of administrative reviews, 58 FR 11026
(February 23, 1993) and 59 FR 2593 (January 18, 1994), respectively.) Because we are retroactively excluding CEC
from the application of this antidumping duty order, we are also hereby terminating both administrative reviews
with regard to imports by CEC. 


Termination of Suspension of Liquidation


Pursuant to section 516(e)(2) of the Act, the Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to terminate the suspension
of liquidation of ceiling fans from the PRC, entered or withdrawn for consumption on or after October 25, 1991, by CEC
and to proceed with liquidation of the subject merchandise, which entered the United States on or after that date without
regard to antidumping duties. Additionally, the Department will instruct U.S. Customs Service to release any bond
or other security with respect to entries of subject merchandise, pursuant to section 735(c)(3)(B) of the Act. 


Change in All Others Rate


The exclusion of CEC changes the all others antidumping rate from 2.05 to 1.65 percent, which is the rate of the only
remaining company from the investigation (Wing Tat Electric Manufacturing Co., Ltd./China Miles Co., Ltd.) with
a margin above 

de minimis. 

The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to begin collecting antidumping duty deposits equal to 
1.65 percent of the entered value of the subject merchandise from all other producers/exporters, effective January
15, 1994.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final results of antidumping duty administrative review.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On November 18, 1993, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of the administrative review
of the antidumping duty order on mechanical transfer presses from Japan. The review covers four manufacturers/exporters
of subject merchandise to the United States and the period February 1, 1992, through January 31, 1993. We gave interested
parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received comments from the petitioner and two respondents.
Based on our analysis, we have changed the final results from those presented in the preliminary results of review.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background



On November 18, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 60843) the preliminary results of the third administrative review of the antidumping duty order on mechanical
transfer presses (MTPs) from Japan (55 FR 5642, February 16, 1990). The Department has now completed the review in
accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). 



Scope of the Review



Imports covered by the review include MTPs currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers
8462.99.0035 and 8466.94.5040. The HTS numbers are provided for convenience and for U.S. Customs purposes. The written
description remains dispositive. 

The term ``mechanical transfer presses'' refers to automatic metal-forming machine tools with multiple die stations
in which the workpiece is moved from station to station by a transfer mechanism designed as an integral part of the press
and synchronized with the press action, whether imported as machines or parts suitable for use solely or principally
with these machines. These presses may be imported assembled or unassembled. 

This review covers four manufacturer/exporters of MTPs from Japan entered into the United States during the period
February 1, 1992, through January 31, 1993. This review does not cover spare and replacement parts and accessories,
which were determined to be outside the scope of the order. See ``Final Scope Ruling on Spare and Replacement Parts,''
U.S. Department of Commerce, March 20, 1992. On November 23, 1993, the Department determined that Aida's FMX series
cold forging press is within the scope of the order. See ``Final Scope Ruling_Antidumping Duty Order on Mechanical
Transfer Presses from Japan: Aida Engineering, Ltd.,'' U.S. Department of Commerce, November 23, 1993. We have included
the FMX press in our analysis for these final results. 



Analysis of Comments Received



We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results of review, as provided by 19 CFR 353.38.
We received comments from the petitioner, Verson Division of Allied Products Corp., and two respondents, Aida Engineering,
Ltd. (Aida), and Komatsu Ltd. (Komatsu).

Comment 1:

 The petitioner argues that the Department should have used an exchange rate based on either the date of shipment or
the date of entry, instead of employing the exchange rate in effect on the date of sale to the United States, because
of the extended time between the sale and shipment of MTPs, and the appreciation of the yen against the dollar during
the review period.

Aida and Komatsu state that the Department correctly employed the exchange rate in effect on the date of the U.S. sale,
according to the Department's regulations, 19 CFR 353.60, 353.46, 353.49 and 353.50.



Department's Position:

 We agree with respondents that we have properly employed the exchange rate that was in effect on the date the merchandise
was sold to the United States. According to our regulations and long-standing practice, when the U.S. price is based
on purchase price and the foreign market value (FMV) is based on constructed value (CV), the conversion of currency
is directly tied to the date the merchandise is sold for exportation to the United States. See 19 CFR 353.60 and 19 CFR
353.50(b)(1).



Comment 2:

 Aida states that it is reserving the right to challenge the Department's inclusion of the FMX press within the scope
of the order and within the final results of this review.

The petitioner claims that the Department should include home market and U.S. sales of Aida's FMX press and its optional
transfer unit in its analysis for these final results, because the Department has determined that the FMX press is
within the scope of the order.



Department's Position:

 We agree with petitioner. We did not include the FMX press in our preliminary results of review, but stated we would
do so in our final results if an affirmative scope determination were made by that time. On November 23, 1993, the Department
determined that Aida's FMX cold forging press is within the scope of the antidumping duty order on MTPs. See ``Final
Scope Ruling_Antidumping Duty Order on Mechanical Transfer Presses from Japan: Aida Engineering, Ltd.,'' U.S.
Department of Commerce, November 23, 1993. We verified the sales and CV data Aida submitted with respect to the FMX
press sold in the United States during the review period, and have included this sale in our final analysis.

Comment 3:

 Aida states that, subsequent to verification, it analyzed the year-end warranty cost adjustments discovered at
verification, and concluded that only a portion thereof should be allocated to warranty cost. In its case brief, Aida
presents a recalculation of the warranty expense factor, and asks that the Department use this revised factor to calculate
warranty costs for the final results.



Department's Position:

 At verification, the Department discovered that Aida's records indicated an amount for additional warranty costs
that Aida had not reported. At that time, Aida claimed that these costs were related to non-subject merchandise, but
was unable to satisfactorily document this position. See sales verification report dated October 19, 1993, page
13.

According to 19 CFR 353.31(a)(1)(ii), the time limit for submitting factual information in an administrative review
is not later than the earlier of the date of publication of the notice of preliminary results of review or 180 days after
the date of publication of the notice of initiation of the review. As Aida submitted its explanation of the additional
unreported warranty expenses and recalculation of the warranty expense factor after the date of publication of the
preliminary results, this information was untimely submitted. Therefore, we did not consider this information
for these final results. As in the preliminary results of review, we used warranty costs as adjusted for the additional
costs discovered at verification.



Comment 4:

 Aida states that the Department erred in adding related-party commissions on U.S. sales to FMV, and offsetting the
commissions by deducting home market indirect selling expenses up to the amount of the commissions. Aida believes
that the Department should have treated the commissions as internal transfers, which do not require any adjustment
to FMV or offsetting adjustment for indirect home market selling expenses.



Department's Position:

 Aida reported commissions to a related party that varied directly with the sale price of an MTP. We verified the commissions
paid, and have no reason to believe that these directly related selling expenses were not, in fact, in the nature of
commissions. The fact that these commissions were paid to a related party does not change their nature as commissions.
Therefore, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a), we are adjusting FMV for the differences in home market and U.S. commissions.
Because there were commissions on both U.S. and home market sales, 19 CFR 353.56(b), which calls for an offset when
there are commissions in one market but not the other, does not apply.

Comment 5: 

The petitioner asserts that the Department did not evaluate or adjust Aida's transfer prices from a certain related
party supplier for such things as direct materials, labor, and/or overhead, as applicable, to reach a fully-loaded
cost of production. The petitioner further states that the only adjustment made to the related party inputs was an
adjustment made by the Department to include the general and administrative expense of the related supplier. 
Aida contends that it made an adjustment for the difference between the transfer price of components purchased from
its related party supplier and the related party supplier's cost of manufacturing the components. Aida acknowledges
that it inadvertently failed to take into account its related party's processing cost variance and general and administrative
expense, but notes that the Department made an adjustment for these, based on verification findings, in its preliminary
results. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with Aida. The Department was able to verify Aida's adjustment to restate related party inputs to fully-loaded
costs. Aida's adjustment included direct materials, labor, and overhead. Based on the Department's findings at
verification, an adjustment was made to not only general and administrative expenses, but also to the related party's
processing variance. (See cost verification report dated October 22, 1993, page 9.) 


Comment 6: 

Petitioner contends that the Department failed to verify, but should establish, whether transfer prices of inputs
acquired by Aida from other related parties were at or above cost. 
Aida states that the only material purchased for the subject presses from a related company, other than those from
the related party discussed in 

Comment 5, 

above, consisted of control panels purchased from a partially-owned subsidiary. Aida further states that the reasonableness
of the transfer prices used to determine the cost of these components was reviewed and confirmed at verification.
With respect to subcontracted work, Aida states that, with the exception of the related party the Department verified,
all subcontractors are unrelated. 


Department's Position:

 We agree with Aida. At verification, the Department analyzed all transactions with related parties. Based on our
analysis, we found these transactions to have been made at or above cost. (See cost verification report dated October
22, 1993, page 9.)

Comment 7: 

Komatsu argues that the adjustment that the Department made, in its preliminary results, to costs of subcontracted
work performed by a particular related-party supplier, was based on a misunderstanding regarding the method used
to calculate costs for that work. In fact, Komatsu claims, in calculating the actual cost of the related-party inputs,
it inadvertently overstated the costs by a specific profit percentage. Komatsu contends that, given the above, the
costs of the related-party inputs should be reduced rather than increased. 


Department's Position: 

We disagree with Komatsu. Komatsu did not clearly demonstrate at verification its alleged overstatement of the actual
costs of the related-party inputs by a profit margin. Given that the information reviewed at verification indicates
an understatement, rather than an overstatement, of costs, an upward adjustment to the value of these related-party
inputs for a portion of the period loss incurred by the related party is warranted. (See cost verification report dated
October 25, 1993, pages 7 and 8.) 


Comment 8: 

The petitioner asserts that the Department should increase Komatsu's submitted costs to account for losses incurred
by certain other related suppliers during the review period. The petitioner notes that the Department failed to verify
the costs of inputs from these suppliers. 
Komatsu argues that the amount of Komatsu's purchases from those suppliers was clearly insignificant, as would have
been any adjustment the Department might have made. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with Komatsu. At verification, the Department tested those related party transactions that made significant
contributions to the subject merchandise. See cost verification report dated October 25, 1993, page 7. Adjustments
to costs for transactions with other related party suppliers, even if warranted, would not have significantly affected
the margin analysis. 


Comment 9: 

Komatsu argues that the Department should allow an offset to the general and administrative expenses for the gains
on sales of plant assets recorded at its head office, which relate to the company's general and administrative activities.
Komatsu adds that these gains should be offset against the company-wide general and administrative expenses, in
addition to the offset the Department allowed for the gain on sales of plant assets at the Komatsu plant.

Petitioner argues that these gains do not appear to relate to the production operations for subject merchandise,
and therefore should be excluded from the general and administrative expenses calculation. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with the petitioner. During verification, the respondent provided an exhibit that specifically identified
the gains that related to the Komatsu plant manufacturing the subject merchandise. (See cost verification exhibit
number 29.) No documentation or other support was provided to establish a basis on which to allow an offset for the gains
on sales of the other plant assets. 



Comment 10: 

Aida states that the Department double counted an adjustment it made to the cost variance and general and administrative
expenses in applying these adjustments to the CV format for one of the U.S. sales. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with Aida and have corrected the adjustment to the cost variance and general and administrative expenses.




Comment 11: 

Aida states, in its case brief, that the Department made certain clerical errors in its calculations, with respect
to inland freight, packing, credit and warranty. 


Department's Position: 

We agree, and have adjusted our calculations accordingly. 


Final Results of Review 


As a result of our review, the Department has determined that the following margins exist for the period February 1,
1992, through January 31, 1993: 






Parties to the proceeding may request disclosure within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice. The Department
will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences
between U.S. price and FMV may vary from the percentages stated above. The Department will issue appraisement instructions
on each exporter directly to the Customs Service. 
Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of this notice of final results
of review for all shipments of MTPs from Japan entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the
publication date, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rates for the reviewed
companies will be those established in the final results of this administrative review; (2) for previously reviewed
or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published
for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review or the less than fair value (LTFV)
investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period
for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will
be the ``all others'' rate established in the final notice of the LTFV investigation of this case, in accordance with
the Court of International Trade's decisions in 

Floral Trade Council

 v. 

United States,

 Slip Op. 93-79, and 

Federal Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company

 v. 

United States,

 Slip Op. 93-83. The all others rate is 14.51 percent. These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain
in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. 
This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 
This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective orders (APOs) of their responsibility
concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d).
Timely written notification of the return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order
is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of APO is a sanctionable violation. 
This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

<DOCTITLE>Polyethylene Terephthalate Film, Sheet, and Strip from Japan; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative
Review </DOCTITLE>

ACTION:

 Notice of preliminary results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In response to requests from one respondent and one U.S. producer the Department of Commerce has conducted an administrative
review of the antidumping duty order on polyethylene terephthalate film, sheet, and strip (PET film) from Japan.
The review covers three manufacturers/exporters of this merchandise to the United States and the period November
30, 1990, through May 31, 1992. We preliminarily determine that margins exist for the period. 


Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On June 8, 1992, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request an Administrative
Review'' (57 FR 24244) of the antidumping duty order on PET film (56 FR 25660, June 5, 1991). On June 30, 1992, one respondent,
Toray Industries Inc. (Toray), requested an administrative review and one U.S. producer, Toray Plastics America
(TPA) (see Decision Memorandum dated December 28, 1992, regarding Toray's status as a producer in the United States),
requested an administrative review for two other Japanese manufacturers/exporters of PET film. We initiated the
review on Toray, covering November 30, 1990, through May 31, 1992, on July 22, 1992 (57 FR 32521) and the reviews on Teijin,
Ltd. (Teijin) and Diafoil Co. Ltd. (Diafoil), on August 26, 1992 (57 FR 38668). The Department has now conducted the
review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). 


Scope of the Review 


Imports covered by the review are shipments of all gauges of raw, pretreated, or primed PET film, whether extruded
or co-extruded. The films excluded from the scope of this order are metallized films and other finished films that
have had at least one of their surfaces modified by the application of performance-enhancing resin or inorganic layer
more than 0.00001 inches (0.054 micrometers) thick. Roller transport cleaning film which has at least one of its surfaces
modified by the application of 0.5 micrometers of SBR latex has also been ruled as not within the scope of the order.

PET film is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) subheading 3920.62.00.00. The HTS subheading
is provided for convenience and for Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. 
The review covers three Japanese manufacturers/exporters of this merchandise to the United States, Toray, Teijin,
and Diafoil, and the period November 30, 1990, through May 31, 1992. 


Such or Similar Comparisons 


As stated in the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation, we have determined that the subject merchandise constitutes
a single class or kind of merchandise. Each company had sufficient home market sales of PET film to unrelated customers
to serve as a basis for calculating foreign market value (FMV).

Best Information Available 



Diafoil did not respond to the Department's questionnaire. Therefore, we are using best information available for
the purposes of this review. As best information for Diafoil, we preliminarily determine the dumping margin to be
14.00 percent, the highest margin calculated in the original investigation. 



United States Price 



For Toray, we calculated the United States price based on purchase price as all U.S. sales were made to unrelated parties
prior to importation into the United States, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Tariff Act. 

For Toray, we calculated purchase price based on f.o.b. Japanese port or delivered U.S. customer prices. We made deductions,
where appropriate, for price adjustments (rebates). We also made deductions, where appropriate, for the costs of
foreign inland freight, containerization, warehousing, credit expense, foreign brokerage and handling, ocean
freight, marine insurance, U.S. duty, U.S. brokerage and handling, and U.S. inland freight in accordance with section
772(d)(2) of the Tariff Act. 

For Teijin, we calculated purchase price based on f.o.b. Japanese port or delivered U.S. customer prices. We made
deductions, where appropriate, for price adjustments (rebates). We also made deductions, where appropriate, for
the costs of foreign inland freight and insurance, bank charges, foreign brokerage and handling, ocean freight,
warehousing, commissions, credit insurance, indirect selling expenses (U.S. and non-U.S.), inventory carrying
charges, other expense, U.S. duty, harbor and U.S. Customs user fees, U.S. brokerage and handling, and U.S. inland
freight and insurance in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Tariff Act. 

In addition, for both Toray and Teijin, we made adjustments for the value added tax applied in the home market. On October
7, 1993, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT), in 

Federal-Mogul Corp. and The Torrington Co. 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-194 (CIT, October 7, 1993), rejected the Department's methodology for calculating an addition
to U. S. price (USP) under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act to account for taxes that the exporting country would
have assessed on the merchandise had it been sold in the home market. The CIT held that the addition to USP under section
772(d)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act should be the result of applying the foreign market tax rate to the price of the United
States merchandise at the same point the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market
sales. 

Federal-Mogul,

 Slip Op. 93-194 at 12. 

The Department has changed its methodology in accordance with the 

Federal-Mogul

 decision. The Department will add to USP the 
result of multiplying the foreign market tax rate by the price of the United States merchandise at the same point in
the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales. The Department will also adjust
the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax included in FMV. These adjustments will deduct the portions of the foreign
market tax and the USP tax adjustment that are the result of expenses that are included in the foreign market price used
to calculate the foreign market tax and are included in the United States merchandise price used to calculate the USP
tax adjustment and that are later deducted to calculate FMV and USP. These adjustments to the amount of the foreign
market tax and the USP tax adjustment are necessary to prevent our new methodology for calculating the USP tax adjustment
from creating antidumping duty margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied upon foreign market sales.

<DOCNO> FR940302-2-00018 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940302-2-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This margin creation effect is due to the fact that the bases for calculating both the amount of tax included in the price
of the foreign market merchandise and the amount of the USP tax adjustment include many expenses that are later deducted
when calculating USP and FMV. After these deductions are made, the amount of tax included in FMV and the USP tax adjustment
still reflects the amounts of these expenses. Thus, a margin may be created that is not dependent upon a difference
between USP and FMV, but is the result of the price of the United States merchandise containing more expenses that the
price of the foreign market merchandise The Department's policy to avoid the margin creation effect is in accordance
with the United States Court of Appeals' holding that the application of the USP tax adjustment under section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Tariff Act should not create an antidumping duty margin if pre-tax FMV does exceed USP. 

Zenith Electronics Corp.

 v. 

United States,

 988 F.2d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In addition, the CIT has specifically held that an adjustment should be made to
mitigate the impact of expenses that are deducted from FMV and USP upon the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax included
in FMV. 

Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd.

 v. 

United States,

 7609 F. Supp. 200, 208 (CIT, 1991). However, the mechanics of the Department's adjustment and the foreign market tax
amount as described above are not identical to those suggested in 

Daewoo.

 



Foreign Market Value 



In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of PET film in the home market to serve as a viable basis for
calculating foreign market value (FMV), we compared the volume of home market sales of PET film to the volume of third
country sales of PET film, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of Tariff Act. Each respondent had a viable home
market with respect to sales of PET film made during the period of review. 

For Toray, we calculated the FMV based on delivered prices to unrelated customers in the home market. We did not use
related party sales because the prices to related parties were determined not to be at arm's length, in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.45(a). We made deductions, where appropriate, for rebates and inland freight. We deducted home market
packing cost and added U.S. packing costs. 

Pursuant to section 353.56, we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in claimed
warranty expenses, post-sale warehousing expenses, credit expenses, and credit interest revenue. 

We made a difference-in-merchandise adjustment, where appropriate, based on differences in the variable costs
of manufacture. 

For Teijin, we calculated FMV based on delivered prices to unrelated and three related customers in the home market.
These related party sales were determined to be at arm's length, in accordance with section 353.45(a) of our regulations.
We made deductions, where appropriate, for rebates, inland freight, and insurance. We deducted home market packing
cost and added U.S. packing costs. 

Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56, we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in post-sale
warehousing expenses, and credit expenses.

<PARENT> FR940302-2-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

For both Toray and Teijin, in order to simplify analysis, we decided to test the home markets sales to determine whether
we could use annual FMVs as a basis of comparison to U.S. sales. To determine whether a period of review (POR) weighted-average
price was representative of the transactions under consideration we performed a three-step test. 

We first compared the monthly weighted-average home market price for each model with the weighted-average POR price
of that model. We calculated the proportion of each model's sales whose POR weighted-average price did not vary more
than plus or minus ten percent from the monthly weighted-average prices. We did this test for each model. We then compared
the volume of sales of all models of whose POR weighted-average price did not vary more than plus or minus ten percent
from the monthly weighted-average price from the total volume of sales. If the POR weighted-average price of at least
90 percent of sales did not vary more than plus or minus ten percent from the monthly weighted-average price, we consider
the POR weighted-average price to be representative of the sales under consideration. Finally, we tested whether
there was any correlation between fluctuations in price and time for each model. Where the correlation was less than
0.05 (where a coefficient approaching 1.0 indicates a direct relationship between price and time), we concluded
that there was no significant relationship between price and time. Since home market prices of both companies passed
all of these tests we used annual FMV's as a basis of comparison for both companies. 



Preliminary Results of the Review 



As a result of this review, we preliminarily determine that the following margins exist for the period November 30,
1990, through May 31, 1992: 





Case briefs and/or written comments from interested parties may be submitted no later than 30 days after the date of
publication of this notice. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttals to written comments, limited to issues raised in the case
briefs and comments, may be filed not later than 37 days after the date of publication of this notice. 


Within 10 days of the date of publication of this notice, interested parties to this proceeding may request a disclosure
and/or a hearing. The hearing, if requested, will take place not later than 44 days after publication of this notice.
Persons interested in attending the hearing should contact the Department for the date and time of the hearing. 


The Department will subsequently publish the final results of 
this administrative review, including the results of its analysis of issues raised in any such written comments or
a hearing. 

The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
Individual differences between United States price and foreign market value may vary from the percentages stated
above. The Department will issue appropriate appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service upon completion
of this review. 

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of our final results of review
for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after that
publication date of the final results of this administrative review, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff
Act: 

(1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed companies will be those rates established in the final results of this review;


(2) The cash deposit rate for subject merchandise exported by manufacturers or exporters not covered in this review
but covered in previous reviews or in the original LTFV investigation will be based upon the most recently published
rate in a final result or determination for which the manufacturer or exporter received a company-specific rate;

(3) The cash deposit rate for subject merchandise exported by an exporter not covered in this review, a prior review,
or the original investigation, but where the manufacturer of the merchandise has been covered by this or a prior final
results or determination will be based upon the most recently published company-specific rate for that manufacturer,
and 
(4) The cash deposit rate for merchandise exported by all other manufacturers and exporters who are not covered by
these or any previous administrative review conducted by the Department will be the ``all others'' rate established
in the LTFV investigation. 
On March 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade (CIT), in 

Floral Trade Council

 v. 

United States,

 Slip Op. 93-79, and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation

 v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-83, decided that once an ``all others'' rates is established for a company, it can only be changed
through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is
appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for
correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in the proceeding governed by antidumping duty orders.

Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping duty order, the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of this
review will be 
6.32 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the LTFV investigation (56 FR 25660, June 5, 1991). 
These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review. 
This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file
a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during
this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 
This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act and 19 CFR 353.22.

 Notice of final results of antidumping duty administrative review and revocation in part of the antidumping duty
order.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On November 30, 1993, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its administrative review
of the antidumping duty order on titanium sponge from Japan and its intent to revoke the order in part. We have now completed
this review and found no dumping margin for Showa Denko K.K. (Showa) during the period November 1, 1991 to October 31,
1992. We also determine that Showa has met the requirements for revocation. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On November 30, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 63,155) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on titanium sponge
from Japan (49 FR 47,053; November 30, 1984). The Department has now completed this administrative review in accordance
with section 751(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). 


Scope of Review 


Imports covered by the review are shipments of unwrought titanium sponge. Titanium sponge is a porous, brittle metal
which has a high strength-to-weight ratio and is highly ductile. It is an intermediate product used to produce titanium
ingots, slabs, billets, plates, and sheets. During the review period, such merchandise was classified under subheading
8108.10.50.10 of the 

Harmonized Tariff Schedule

 (HTS). The HTS number is provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.
The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of the subject merchandise to the United States, Showa, and the period
November 1, 1991 through October 31, 1992.

Analysis of Comments Received 



We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received a written comment from
the respondent, Showa. 



Comment 1: 

Respondent argues that the Department should use Showa's reported general and administrative (G&A) expenses
in its calculation of constructed value. Instead, in its preliminary results of review, the Department allocated
Showa's, the parent company, G&A costs to Showa Titanium (STIC) based on the ratio of Showa's equity ownership
in STIC to Showa's total equity. The respondent maintains that its methodology for calculating G&A expense in
this review is in accordance with its books and records, and is consistent with Showa's reporting in previous review
periods. Moreover, in both the fourth and fifth reviews, the Department specifically rejected petitioner's arguments
that Showa's reported G&A expense should be recalculated. However, should the Department choose to reverse
its position and reject Showa's internal allocation methodology, it should allocate Showa's headquarters G&A
based on cost of goods sold, following the Department's established allocation methodology. 



Department's Position: 

The respondent's submitted G&A costs included STIC's G&A expenses and a portion of Showa parent company
G&A expenses allocated to STIC based on a formula used in its ordinary course of business. As a result, we recalculated
constructed value utilizing Showa's submitted G&A allocation methodology, which had no effect on the margin.




Final Results of Review 



As a result of our comparison of United States price to foreign market value, as discussed in the preliminary results
of this review, we determine the dumping margin to be: 




 

Based on information submitted by Showa during this and two previous reviews (

See Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review on Titanium Sponge from Japan

 (58 FR 18,202; April 8, 1993), and 

Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review on Titanium Sponge from Japan

 (57 FR 9,688; March 20, 1992)), we further determine that Showa has met the requirements for revocation set forth in
sections 353.25(a) and 353.25(b) of the Department's regulations. Showa has demonstrated three consecutive years
of sales at not less than foreign market value and has submitted the required certifications. On the basis of no sales
at less than foreign market value for a period of three consecutive years, an agreement by Showa to immediate reinstatement
of the order if it should make such sales in the future, and the lack of any indication to the contrary, the Department
concludes that Showa is not likely to sell subject merchandise at less than foreign market value in the future. Therefore,
the Department is revoking the order with respect to Showa.

The Department will instruct the Customs Service to liquidate, without regard to antidumping duties, all shipments
of this merchandise entered by Showa on or after November 1, 1991 and on or before October 31, 1992. The Department also
will instruct Customs to terminate suspension of liquidation and to cease collecting cash deposits with regard to
Showa.

is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise;
and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will be 28.25 percent, the ``all others'' rate
established in the final notice of LTFV investigation by the Department, as amended (50 FR 32,459, August 12, 1985),
in accordance with the decisions of the Court of International Trade (CIT) in 

Floral Trade Council 

v. 

United States,

 Slip Op. 93-79 (CIT May 25, 1993), and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation 

v. 

United States,

This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during the review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.

Notice is hereby given that the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Policy, Planning and Program Evaluation will
hold two stakeholder meetings to gather comments on a draft report titled ``Energy Infrastructure of the United States
and Projected Siting Needs: Scoping Ideas, Identifying Issues and Options; Draft Report of the Department of Energy
Working Group on Energy Facility Siting to the Secretary.'' This report was noticed for public comment in the 

Federal Register

 on December 16, 1993; the public comment period has been extended to April 30, 1994, as noticed in the 

Federal Register 

on February 4, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The U.S. Department of Energy issued on December 16, 1993 this draft report and an accompanying documentation summary
under the authority provided by the Department of Energy Organization Act. The draft report is the result of over a
year-long effort on behalf of staff representing DOE's various subdivisions reflecting diverse expertise and knowledge.
The report examines the possible need for expanding the nation's energy infrastructure, and issues related to that
potential growth, based on projections of energy supply and demand developed by the Energy Information Administration,
with the goal of developing appropriate policy direction for the Department.



The agenda for each stakeholder meeting will cover topics such as siting needs, siting problems and constraints,
the ideas presented in the draft report, and constructive roles for the Department of Energy and other federal agencies
in improving energy facility siting processes. The meetings will be structured to elicit individual views, not to
reach consensus. Members of the general public are invited to observe the meetings and offer comment during a portion
of the agenda, within space and time constraints. The views expressed at the meetings will be considered in preparing
the final report.

<USBUREAU>Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</USBUREAU>





Arizona Public Service Company; Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Assessment and Conduct Public Scoping
Meetings and Site Visit




February 24, 1994.



The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application for relicense of the existing Childs
Irving Hydroelectric Project, Project No. 2069-003. The project is located on Fossil Creek, a tributary of
the Verde River, in Yavapai and Gila counties, Arizona. The project is entirely within the Coconino and Tonto National
Forests, administered by the U.S. Forest Service (Forest Service).

The FERC staff, in cooperation with the Forest Service, intends to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) on this
hydroelectric project in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act.

The EA will objectively consider both site-specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the project and reasonable
alternatives, and will include an economic, financial, and engineering analysis.

The FERC staff will issue and circulate a draft EA for review by all interested parties. The staff will analyze and consider
all comments filed on the draft EA in a final EA. The staff will then present its conclusions and recommendations to
the Commission for consideration in reaching its final licensing decision.



Scoping Meetings



The FERC staff will conduct two scoping meetings on March 15, 1994. A scoping meeting oriented toward the agencies
will be held at 9:30 a.m. at the Cliff Castle Best Western, 333 Middle Verde Road, Camp Verde, Arizona. A scoping meeting
oriented toward the public will be held at 7 p.m. at the Cliff Castle Best Western.

Interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend either or both meetings and help the staff
identify the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EA.

To help focus discussions at the meetings, the staff will mail a Scoping Document 1, outlining subject areas to be addressed
in the EA to agencies and interested individuals on the FERC mailing list. Copies of Scoping Document 1 will also be
available at the scoping meetings.



Objectives



At the scoping meetings the FERC staff will: (1) Identify preliminary environmental issues related to the project;
(2) identify preliminary resource issues that are not important and do not require detailed analysis; (3) identify
reasonable alternatives to be addressed in the EA; (4) solicit from the meeting participants all available information,
especially quantified data, on the resource issues; and (5) encourage statements from experts and the public on issues
that should be analyzed in the EA, including points of view in opposition to, or in support of, the staff preliminary
views.



Procedures



A court reporter will record the meetings and all statements (oral and written) thereby become a part of the formal
record of the Commission proceedings on the Childs Irving Project. Individuals representing statements at the meetings
will be asked to clearly identify themselves for the record.

Individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns are encouraged to attend the
meetings and define and clarify issues to be addressed in the EA.

Persons choosing not to speak at the meetings, but who have views on the issues or information relevant to the issues,
may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record at the meetings. In addition, written scoping comments
may be filed with Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC
20426, until April 15, 1994.

All written correspondence should clearly show the following caption on the first page: Childs Irving Project, FERC
Project No. 2069-003.

Intervenors_those on the Commission's service list for this proceeding (parties)_are reminded of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure, requiring parties filing documents with the Commission to serve a copy of the document
on each person whose name appears on the official service list. Further, if a party or interceder files comments or
documents with the Commission relating to the merits of an issue that may affect the responsibilities of a particular
resource agency, they must also serve a copy of the document on that resource agency.



Site Visit



A site visit to the Childs Irving Hydro Project is planned for March 16, 1994. Those who wish to attend should plan to
meet at the Cliff Castle Best Western at 8 a.m. or contact Ken Anderson at the Beaver Creek Ranger District, Coconino
National Forest, (602) 567-4501 for details.

Any questions regarding this notice may be directed to Dianne Rodman at (202) 219-2830.

with the Commission Third Revised Sheet No. 22 in its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, containing changes
in rates for effectiveness on February 1, 1994. 

According to Granite State, it was authorized to collect a special volumetric surcharge of $0.0043 per Dth in its rates
to reimburse it for $200,000 for costs incurred in acquiring a supply of Canadian gas for its system. Granite State
Gas Transmission, Inc., 61 FERC 61,335 (1992). It is further said that Granite State began collecting the surcharge
in its rates for sales to Bay State Gas Company (Bay State) and Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities) on February
1, 1993 and, after November 1, 1993 in the rates for firm transportation service under Rate Schedule FT-NN in
its restructuring compliance tariff.

February 24, 1994.



Take notice that on February 18, 1994, Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company (Williston Basin), filed a request
for a one-time waiver of the requirements of its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1 (tariff), so as to allow
any shipper to change its method of fuel reimbursement effective April 1, 1994.

Williston Basin states that its tariff allows shippers to change its election of the method to be used to reimburse
Williston Basin for fuel use, lost and unaccounted for gas on the dates Williston Basin revises its fuel reimbursement
rate (February 1 and August 1 of each year) pursuant to Section 38 of the General Terms and Conditions of such Tariff.
Since this was the shippers' first opportunity to make such a change in its election and due to certain shippers' confusion
over the implementation dates of the fuel reimbursement election, Williston Basin herewith seeks a one-time waiver
of its tariff requirements to allow any and all shippers the one-time opportunity to change its method of fuel reimbursement
effective April 1, 1994. Any such changes made effective pursuant to this waiver would be effective from April 1, 1994,
forward until changed in accordance with Section 38 of the General Terms and Conditions of Williston Basin's Tariff.
Williston Basin will post this one-time waiver of its tariff on its Electronic Bulletin Board and notify each shipper
via written correspondence.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211
and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214). All such motions or protests
should be filed on or before March 3, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate
action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a
party to the proceeding must file a motion to intervene. Copies of the filing are on file with the Commission and are

and its expected cost and burden.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Office of Water





Title: 

Information Collection Request for Combined Sewer Overflow Policy (EPA No. 1680.01).



Abstract: 

This is a new collection of information in support of the 1993 Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Policy, a national guidance
that was issued earlier as a draft Policy in 1992, and is partially based on the 1989 Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Strategy,
as published at 54 FR 37370. The Clean Water Act (CWA), as promulgated at 40 CFR Parts 121 through 125, provides the authority
to regulate Combined Sewer Systems (CSSs) as point sources subject to National Pollution Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit requirements. CSSs are wastewater collection systems designed to transport both wastewater
and stormwater to publicly-owned treatment works (POTWs). CSSs may periodically experience flows that exceed capacity,
resulting in discharges of untreated wastes into surface waters. The CSO policy requires POTWs to provide information
to EPA, or the delegated State authority, that will be used to ensure the adequacy of existing CSO controls, to establish
permit terms and conditions, to track performance, and to conduct compliance assessment and enforcement of CWA requirements.

Under the CSO Policy, municipal POTWs are expected to document the implementation of nine control measures develop
a Long Term CSO Control Plan (LTCCP), and perform ongoing compliance monitoring. The information provided by CSOs
may include: 1) operation and maintenance plans; 2) revised sewer-use ordinances for industrial users; 3) infiltration/inflow
studies; 4) descriptions of pollution prevention programs; 5) public notification plans; 6) facility plans for
maximizing the capabilities of existing collection, storage and treatment systems; 6) contracts and schedules
for minor construction programs; and 7) information or data relevant to assessing the extent to which the nine minimum
controls satisfy water quality standards.

Documentation, monitoring and reporting by POTWs will occur over the normal five year duration of their NPDES permit.
POTWs will be required to retain records for a period of three years.



Burden Statement: 

Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 565 hours per response for POTWs
and 1,052 hours for States operating NPDES programs including time for reviewing the policy, searching existing
data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the information. Annual public
recordkeeping is estimated to average 25 hours per POTW and 6 hours for each State operating an NPDES program.



Respondents: 

Municipal POTWs and States operating NPDES programs.



Estimated number of respondents; 

1100 POTWs, 30 States.



Estimated number of responses per respondent: 

1.



Frequency of Collection: 

Twice every five years.



Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 

591 hours for POTWs, 1,058 hours for States.


Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing the burden, to:




Sandy Farmer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (2136), 401 M Street, SW., Washington,
DC 20460. and

<DOCTITLE>Alabama: Final Determination of Adequacy of State/Tribal Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final partial program determination of adequacy of the State of Alabama's municipal solid waste landfill
permit program. 







</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will
comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate
issuance of a rule governing such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal
Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal
landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications
are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of
the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition,
States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early
approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal permit programs provide interaction between the State/Tribe
and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in State/Tribes
with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal
permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the
permit status of any facility, the Federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities.


Alabama applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA Region IV reviewed Alabama's MSWLF
application and made a tentative determination of adequacy for those portions of the MSWLF permit program that are
adequate to ensure compliance with the revised MSWLF criteria. After reviewing all comments received, EPA today
is granting final approval to Alabama's partial program.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



A. Background



On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure
that facilities comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA
determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply
with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing
a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs
must satisfy to be determined adequate. 
EPA intends to propose in STIR to allow partial approval if: (1) The Regional Administrator determines that the State/Tribal
permit program largely meets the requirements for ensuring compliance with part 258; (2) changes to a limited narrow
part(s) of the State/Tribal permit program are needed to meet those requirements; and (3) provisions not included
in the partially approved portions of the State/Tribal permit program are a clearly identifiable and separable subset
of part 258. As provided in the October 9, 1991, municipal landfill rule, EPA's national Subtitle D standards took
effect on October 9, 1993. Consequently, any portion of the Federal Criteria that are not included in an approved State/Tribal
program by October 9, 1993 apply directly to the owner/operator without any approved State/Tribal flexibility.
On October 1, 1993, the October 9, 1993, effective date was extended for certain smaller landfills and for certain
landfills receiving waste from flood disaster areas (58 FR 51536). The effective date is now April 9, 1994, for MSWLFs
that accept less than 100 tons of waste per day, are not a Superfund National Priority List site, and are either in a State
that has submitted an application to EPA for approval before October 9, 1993, or are located on Tribal lands. The effective
date has been extended to October 9, 1995, for very small (less than 20 tons of waste per day), remote landfills in arid
climates that lack a practicable alternative for waste disposal or experience significant disruption of surface
transportation. Certain large facilities receiving waste from flood disaster areas also are allowed an extension
of the compliance date if the State determines that they are needed to dispose of flood debris. The requirements of
the STIR, if promulgated, will ensure that any mixture of State/Tribal and Federal rules that take effect will be fully
workable and leave no significant gaps in environmental protection. These practical concerns apply to individual
partial approvals granted prior to the promulgation of the STIR. Consequently, EPA reviewed the program approved
today and concluded that the State/Tribal and Federal requirements mesh reasonably well and do not leave significant
gaps. Partial approval would allow the Agency to approve those provisions of the State/Tribal permit program that
meet the requirements and provide the State/Tribe time to make necessary changes to the remaining portions of its
program. As a result, owners/operators will be able to work with the State/Tribal permitting agency to take advantage
of the flexibility allowed under the Federal criteria for approved states for those portions of the State's program
that have been approved.



EPA will review State/Tribal requirements to determine whether they are ``adequate'' under section 4005(c)(1)(C)
of RCRA. EPA interprets the requirements for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other
forms of prior approval to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards
for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe
must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction.
The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section
7004(b) of RCRA. Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring
and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved
MSWLF program.
EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation
outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal
Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program
before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program. EPA also is requesting States/Tribes seeking partial program approval
to provide a schedule for the submittal of all remaining portions of their MSWLF permit programs. EPA notes that it
intends to propose to make submissions of a schedule mandatory in the STIR.
As a State's/Tribe's regulations and statutes are amended to comply with the Federal MSWLF landfill regulations,
unapproved portions of a partially approved MSWLF permit program may be approved by the EPA. The State/Tribe may submit
an amended application to EPA for review and an adequacy determination will be made using the same criteria as for the
initial application. This adequacy determination will become effective sixty (60) days following publication
if no adverse comments are received. If EPA receives adverse comments on its adequacy determination, another 

Federal Register

 notice will be published either affirming or reversing the initial decision while responding to the public comments.



B. State of Alabama


On July 9, 1993, the State of Alabama submitted a final application for partial program adequacy determination for
their MSWLF permit program. On December 17, 1993, EPA published a tentative determination of adequacy for all portions
of Alabama's program except for the Financial Assurance Criteria set forth in Subpart G. Further background on the
tentative determination of adequacy appears at 58 FR 65982, (December 17, 1993).
Along with the tentative determination, EPA announced the availability of the application for public comment and
the date of a public hearing on the application. Region IV of EPA held a public hearing on February 10, 1994, at 7 p.m.
in Montgomery, Alabama.
The State of Alabama has the authority to issue permits that incorporate all the requirements of the Revised Federal
MSWLF Criteria, except Financial Assurance, to all MSWLFs in the State, with the exception of those located on Tribal
Lands. 
The EPA has determined that the State of Alabama's statutes and administrative regulations provide for a state-wide
comprehensive program of solid waste management including specific provisions for public participation, compliance
monitoring and enforcement. 
The State of Alabama requested approval for all portions of the Federal criteria except Subpart G-Financial
Assurance Criteria. The Alabama Department of Environmental Management does not currently have statutory authority
to develop and enforce financial assurance regulations for MSWLFs. The schedule that Alabama submitted indicates
that the necessary changes to the laws, regulations, and guidance to comply with the remaining part 258 requirements
will be completed by January, 1995. 



C. Public Comment


One written comment was submitted during the public comment period. The commenter supported the tentative decision
to partially approve Alabama's MSWLF permit program. There were no written or oral comments submitted during the
public hearing. 



D. Decision


After reviewing the public comments submitted in response to the tentative decision, I conclude that Alabama's application
for partial program adequacy determination meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established
by RCRA. Accordingly, Alabama is granted a partial program determination of adequacy for all portions of its MSWLF
permit program except Subpart G-Financial Assurance Requirements. Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that
citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR
part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF
criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by
EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991). 
This action takes effect on the date of publication. EPA believes it has good cause under section 553(d) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C 553(d), to put this action into effect less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. All of the requirements and obligations in the State's program are already in effect as a matter of State law. EPA's
action today does not impose any new requirements that the regulated community must begin to comply with. Nor do these
requirements become enforceable by EPA as Federal law. Consequently, EPA finds that it does not need to give notice
prior to making its approval effective.



Compliance with Executive Order 12866 


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order
12866.



Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This action,
therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.






Authority:

 This notice of final partial program adequacy determination of Alabama's municipal solid waste permit program is
issued under the authority of section 4005 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended; 42 U.S.C. 6946.

<DOCTITLE>State of Florida; Adequacy Determination of State/Tribal Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of tentative determination on Florida application for full program adequacy determination, public hearing
and public comment period. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will
comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate
issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation
Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill
permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are
submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the
STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes
may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have
an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal permit programs provide for interaction between the State/Tribe and
the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes
with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal
permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the
permit status of any facility, the federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities.




Florida has applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA Region IV has reviewed Florida's
MSWLF application and has made a tentative determination that Florida's MSWLF permit program meets the requirements
for full program approval and ensures compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). 

Florida's application for program adequacy determination is available from EPA Region IV and the State for public
review and comment. Although, RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve a State's/Tribe's
MSWLF program, Region IV has scheduled a public hearing on this determination. The date, location and time of the hearing
is discussed below in the 

DATES

 section. Anyone requiring additional information regarding the hearing, may call the person listed in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

A. Background 



On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure
that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine
the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised
Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal
Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to
be determined adequate. 

As provided in the October 9, 1991 municipal solid waste landfill rule, EPA's national Subtitle D standards took effect
on October 9, 1993. Consequently, any remaining portions of the Federal criteria that are not included in an approved
State/Tribal program apply directly to the owner/operator without any approved State/Tribal flexibility. On October
1, 1993, EPA published the Final Rule to extend the effective date of the landfill criteria for certain classifications
of landfills (58 FR 51536). On October 14, 1993, EPA published corrections to the Final Rule to extend the effective
date (58 FR 53137). 

EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements
for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several
minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that
are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue
a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also
must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA.
Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement
authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.


EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation
outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal
Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of an MSWLF program
before it gives full approval to an MSWLF program. 



B. State of Florida 



On July 20, 1993, Florida submitted a final application to EPA Region IV for adequacy determination. Region IV reviewed
the final application and submitted substantive comments to Florida. Florida addressed EPA's comments and submitted
an extensively revised final application in September 1993. Region IV has completed technical review of Florida's
revisions and has tentatively determined that, as revised, all portions of Florida's Subtitle D MSW landfill permit
program meet the requirements necessary to qualify for full program approval and ensure compliance with the revised
Federal Criteria. 

The public may submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination until close of the public hearing to the person
listed in the ``Contacts'' section of this notice. Copies of Florida's application are available for inspection
and copying at the location(s) indicated in the ``Addresses'' section of this notice. Comments may also be submitted
during the scheduled public hearing, as transcribed from the discussion of the hearing or in writing at the time of
the hearing.

Florida's revised application includes new regulations which the State developed to be technically comparable
to the requirements of the federal criteria. Florida's revised regulations became effective on January 2, 1994,
and have been deemed technically comparable to the federal criteria. 

Although regulatory language and structure in certain of Florida's regulations may not reflect the exact language
and structure in the corresponding EPA requirements, EPA has determined that Florida will ensure compliance with
40 CFR part 258. The following paragraphs detail the major issues for which Florida was required to demonstrate technical
comparability. 

1. Daily Cover_40 CFR 258.21 requires that six (6) inches of earthen material be placed over the working face of MSWLFs
at the end of each working day to control blowing litter, scavenging, etc. Directors of EPA-approved states have the
flexibility to allow daily covers made of alternative materials and thicknesses. Florida's regulations previously
provided MSWLFs owner/operators an exemption from daily cover if the period between cessation of operation on one
day and start of operation the next was 18 hours or less. Florida revised their regulatory language to eliminate this
exemption and require daily cover. Florida also added language to allow a reusable tarpaulin (to be rolled out over
the working face at the end of one day and taken up at the beginning of the next) as an acceptable alternative to a soil
daily cover. 

2. Liner Design_40 CFR 258.40 requires that new landfills and lateral expansions to existing landfills be constructed
with a specific composite liner and leachate collection system or an alternative which ensures that drinking-water-based
maximum concentration limits (MCLs) are not exceeded in the uppermost groundwater aquifer at a predetermined point
of compliance (POC). The POC must be on the landfill owner/operator's property and within 150 meters (approximately
500 feet) of the landfill unit boundary. 

EPA Headquarters has interpreted the federal criteria to also afford states the opportunity to present alternative
liner designs to regional offices for review. If a state demonstrates, via mathematical modelling, that the proposed
alternative(s) meet the minimum federal performance standard based on ``worst-case'' conditions (considering
hydrology, geology, climate, groundwater flow, etc.), then the EPA regional office can approve the alternative(s)
to be used as state standard(s) in lieu of the federal standard composite liner system. 

Florida's regulations allow several alternative composite liner designs and a double synthetic liner design with
primary and secondary leachate collection systems. Florida has presented information, including analysis data
from the MultiMed mathematical modeling program, to adequately demonstrate that each of their liners meets the federal
performance standards. Additionally, Florida determines the need for corrective action due to contaminant releases
from the landfill into the subsurface based on analysis of groundwater sampled at distances within 100 feet of the
landfill unit boundary (as compared to the federal range of 0 to 150 meters (or approximately 500 feet) from the unit
boundary). Further, in addition to sampling and analyzing groundwater, Florida performs annual analysis of leachate
collected from the landfill, to determine which constituents might be expected to be found in groundwater in the event
that a release does occur. 

3. Groundwater Monitoring and Corrective Action_40 CFR 258.54 requires detection monitoring for sixty-two (62)
constituents. Florida's original detection monitoring program required analysis of fewer and several different
constituents than the federal. Florida has revised their regulatory language to include analysis of all constituents
listed in 40 CFR part 258.54 in addition to their original parameters.

4. Final Closure Cover_40 CFR 258.60 requires that a MSWLF final closure cover include a composite cap which consists
of a minimum 6 inch earthen erosion/vegetative layer and an infiltration layer of at least 18 inches of soil compacted
to a permeability of 1 x 10

^5

 cm/sec or the permeability of the bottom liner system, whichever is less. EPA Headquarters has interpreted this description
to imply that MSW landfills with a synthetic in their liner system must be closed with a cap that includes a synthetic
in the infiltration layer. Directors of EPA-approved states have the flexibility to allow infiltration layers of
alternative materials and/or thicknesses. 

Florida's original regulations did not require a synthetic in the final closure cover of a synthetically lined MSW
landfill. Florida has revised their regulatory language to require that final closure covers on MSW landfills include
``a barrier layer which is substantially equivalent to, or less than, the permeability of the bottom liner system.''
Florida also specifically requires that, ``If the landfill uses a geomembrane in the bottom liner system, the barrier
layer shall also incorporate a geomembrane.'' 

5. Financial Assurance for Corrective Action_40 CFR 258.73 requires that landfill owner/operators required to
undertake corrective action procedures, have financial assurance based on a written estimate, in current dollars,
of the cost of hiring a third party to perform the corrective action. Florida's original program did not address this
issue. Florida has revised their regulatory language to require an acceptable mechanism by which owner/operators
must provide financial assurance in the event that corrective action activities are necessary at their facility.


EPA Region IV will consider all public comments on its tentative determination which are received by close of the scheduled
public hearing. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy for Florida's program.
EPA Region IV will make a final decision on whether or not to approve Florida's program after all comments are received
and reviewed, and will give notice of that decision in the 

Federal Register

. The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments received
by the end of the scheduled public hearing. 

Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained
in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal
program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October
9, 1991). 



Compliance With Executive Order 12866 



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order
12866. 



Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established the Clean Air Act Advisory Committee (CAAAC) on November
19, 1990 to provide independent advice and counsel to EPA on policy issues associated with the implementation of the
Clean Air Act of 1990. The charter for the CAAAC was reissued and the Committee was authorized to be extended until November
19, 1994 under regulations established by the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). 



On August 4, 1993 EPA requested nominations for new members to the committee. In February 1994 all new and reappointed
members of the Clean Air Act Advisory Committee were contacted and informed of their selection. The membership of
the Committee represents a balance of interested persons with diverse perspectives and professional qualifications
and experience to contribute to the functions of the Advisory Committee. Members were drawn from: business and industry;
academic institutions; state and local governmental bodies; environmental and nongovernmental organizations;
unions and service groups. 

Fifty-two individuals were selected to participate as members of the CAAAC. The Advisory Committee will be authorized
to form subcommittees to consider specific issues or actions and report back to the Committee. 



Open Meeting Notice: 

Notice is hereby given that the reauthorized Clean Air Act Advisory Committee will hold its initial open meeting on
March 29, 1994 from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., at the Washington Renaissance Hotel, 999 9th Street, NW. in Washington, DC.
Seating will be available on a first come, first served basis. 

The CAAAC was established to advise EPA on the development, implementation, and enforcement of the new and expanded
regulatory and market-based programs required by the Clean Air Act of 1990. At this initial meeting, the Committee
will highlight implementation priorities for the next year; consider potential sub-committee formation, and;
receive a report from the existing New Source Review Sub-committee.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has received a specific exemption request from the California Environmental Protection Agency (hereafter referred
to as the ``Applicant'') to use the pesticide bifenthrin [CAS 82657-04-3 

cis isomer

 and CAS 83322-02-5 

trans isomer

] to treat up to 200,000 acres of cucurbits (cucumbers, melons, pumpkins, and squash) to control the sweet potato whitefly.
In accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant
the exemption. 



 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific
exemption for the use of bifenthrin on cucurbits to control the sweet potato whitefly. Information in accordance
with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this request. 



The sweet potato whitefly (SPWF) is a relatively new pest on cucurbits. The SPWF has caused severe economic damage
to several other commodities nationwide including cotton, lettuce, squash, beans, peanuts, and ornamentals. SPWF
causes damage through feeding activities, and also indirectly through the production of a honeydew, which encourages
growth of sooty mold and other fungi. The Applicant claims that adequate control of the SPWF is not being achieved with
the currently registered compounds. The Applicant claims that significant economic losses are expected in California
cucurbit production if the SPWF is not adequately controlled, and is therefore requesting this use of bifenthrin.


The Applicant proposes to apply bifenthrin at a maximum rate of 0.1 lb. active ingredient (a.i.) (6.4 oz. of product)
per acre with up to three applications allowed, and a maximum of 0.3 lb. a.i. per acre per season, on a total of 200,000
acres of cucurbits. It is possible to produce two cucurbit crops per calendar year on a given acre, and therefore, the
acreage could potentially receive 6 applications, (maximum of 0.6 lb. a.i. per acre) per calendar year. Therefore,
use under this exemption could potentially amount to a maximum total of 120,000 lbs. of active ingredient. This notice
does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. This is the third time that the Applicant has applied
for the use of bifenthrin on cucurbits, and the fourth year that this use has been requested under section 18. The regulations
governing section 18 require that the Agency publish notice of receipt in the 

Federal Register

 and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption proposing use of a pesticide if an emergency
exemption has been requested or granted for that use in any 3 previous years, and a complete application for registration
of that use and/or a petition for tolerance for residues in or on the commodity has not been submitted to the Agency [40
CFR 166.24(a)(6)].

Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the
address above. The Agency will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining
whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the California Environmental Protection Agency.

OMB Control No.:

 3060-0590.



Title:

 In the Matter of Transport Rate Structure and Pricing, CC Docket No. 91-213, Second Report and Order, released
January 31, 1994.



Expiration Date:

 04/30/94.



Estimated Annual Burden:

 110 total hours; 2 hours per response.



Description:

 In the Second Report and Order in CC Docket No. 91-213 (released 1/31/94), the Commission modified certain features
of the price cap regulatory system applicable to local exchange carriers (LECs) to accommodate the recent restructure
of the LECs local transport rates. Transport services, including all the transmission-related elements, the tandem
switching charge, and the interconnection charge, were moved out of the price cap basket for traffic sensitive services
and placed into a combined ``trunking'' basket containing transport and special access services. The Commission
realigned the service categories and subcategories within the trunking basket to reflect the similarities between
certain special access and flat-rated transport services, and to accommodate the new density zone pricing system
that were adopted for both special access and transport. The pricing bands applicable to the service categories and
subcategories were also adapted. All LECs subject to the price cap rules are required to file a supplemental tariff
review plan to recalculate their price cap indexes pursuant to the decision in the Order. The recalculated indexes
should be used as the basis of any price cap filing that changes rates of services in the trucking or traffic sensitive
baskets subsequent to the effective date of the initial restructured transport tariffs. Subsequent tariff filings
must be made pursuant to the modified rules. The information will be used to aid in the review of the LECs transport service
restructure by the Commission and interested parties.



OMB Control No.:

 3060-0484.



Title:

 Amendment of part 63 of the Commission's Rules to Provide for the Notification of Common Carriers of Service Disruptions_R&O,
 63.100.



Expiration Date:

 06/30/96.



Estimated Annual Burden:

 239 total hours; 2.3 hours per response.



Description:

 In the Memorandum Opinion and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, in CC Docket No. 91-273, released
December 1, 1993, the Commission amended 47 CFR 63.100 to include competitive access providers among those required
to report outages lasting 30 or more minutes and potentially affecting 50,000 or more of their customers. This action
is necessary to ensure the Commission's ability to monitor outages and determine what steps may be necessary to ensure
network reliability. The amendment will provide the Commission with the additional information it needs to perform
this task. OMB approval also includes the Commission's proposal to amend  63.100 to require that local exchange
and interexchange common carriers that operate either transmission or switching facilities report outages affecting
30,000 or more customers or special facilities.



OMB Control No.:

 3060-0583.



Title:

 Amendment of part 32 and 64 of the Commission's rules to Account for Transactions Between Carriers and Their Nonregulated
Affiliates_CC Docket No. 93-251 (Proposed Rules).



Expiration Date:

 10/31/96.



Estimated Annual Burden:

 320,020 total hours; 4980 total hours per response.



Description:

 OMB approved the proposed requirements contained in the Commission's notice of proposed rulemaking (notice) in
CC Docket No. 93-453, released October 20, 1993. The notice sought comments to amend the Commission's affiliate
transaction rules and on the specific procedures telephone companies would use in implementing the proposed rules.
The FCC proposed these measures to enhance its ability to keep telephone companies from imposing the costs of nonregulated
activities on interstate ratepayers, and to keep ratepayers from being harmed by the telephone companies imprudence.
The Notice proposed new and modified information requirements to help ensure that carriers adhere to the proposed
affiliate transactions rule amendments.

<DOCTITLE>Savannah River Site Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project; Public Meetings</DOCTITLE>



The National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the
Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) announce the following meetings.







Date: 

Wednesday, March 16, 1994, Wednesday, March 30, 1994.


Time: 

1 p.m.-7 p.m., 1 p.m.-7 p.m.


Place: 

City of Aiken Conference Center, 215 ``The Alley,'' Aiken, South Carolina 29801; Savannah Coastal Georgia Conference
Center, 305 Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard, Savannah, Georgia 31401.



Date: 

Tuesday, April 12, 1994.


Time: 

1 p.m.-7 p.m.,


Place: 

Ramada Hotel, 8105 Two Notch Road, Columbia, South Carolina 29223.



Status: 

Open to the public for observation and comment, limited only by space available. The meeting room will accommodate
approximately 100 people.



Purpose: 

Under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in December 1990 with the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department
of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been given the responsibility and resources for conducting analytic epidemiologic
investigations of residents of communities in the vicinity of DOE facilities and other persons potentially exposed
to radiation or to potential hazards from non-nuclear energy production and use. HHS delegated program responsibility
to CDC.

In addition, an MOU was signed in October 1990 and renewed in November 1992 between ATSDR and DOE. The MOU delineates
the responsibilities and procedures for ATSDR's public health activities at DOE sites required under sections 104,
107, and 120 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), or ``Superfund'').
These activities include health consultations and public health assessments at DOE sites listed on, or proposed
for, the Superfund National Priorities List and at sites that are the subject of petitions from the public; and other
health-related activities such as epidemiologic studies, health surveillance, exposure and disease registries,
health education, substance-specific applied research, emergency response, and preparation of toxicological
profiles.

Community involvement is a critical part of the HHS energy-related research and activities. With an environmental
dose reconstruction for DOE's Savannah River Site near Augusta, Georgia, as well as a worker study at the same site,
the availability of a formal site-specific advisory committee composed of South Carolina and Georgia citizens to
provide consensus advice regarding these projects is necessary. CDC and ATSDR are currently taking steps to obtain
authorization for a ``Citizen' Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research at Department
of Energy Sites'' to be chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act.

The draft charter for this proposed committee states, ``Because of the varying concerns within communities at each
DOE site, operational guidelines at each site must be developed separately to clarify the scope of activities and
the responsibilities of the Committee members and agencies.'' Therefore, CDC and ATSDR are holding a series of public
meetings to begin developing operational guidelines at specific DOE sites. The purpose of these public meetings
is to update the public on the status of CDC's and ATSDR's community involvement plans and to seek individual advice
and recommendations from interested parties concerning operational guidelines. A copy of the proposed ``Citizens'
Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research at DOE Sites'' draft charter is available upon
request from the contact person listed below.

Agenda items are subject to change as priorities dictate.

Contact Person for More Information: Paul Renard, Radiation Studies Branch, Division of Environmental Hazards
and Health Effects, NCEH, CDC, 4770 Buford Highway, NE., (F-35), Atlanta, Georgia 30341-3724, telephone
404/488-7040, FAX 404/488-7044.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Public notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Public notice is hereby given that the National Park Service proposes to award a concession contract authorizing
continued thermal water bathhouse facilities and services for the public at Hot Springs National Park, Arkansas,
for a period of ten (10) years from the date of final execution of the concession contract.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This contract renewal has been determined to be categorically excluded from the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act and no environmental document will be prepared.




The existing concessioner has performed its obligations to the satisfaction of the Secretary under an existing contract
which expired by limitation of time on December 31, 1990, and has been operating under interim letter of authorization
since that time, and therefore pursuant to the provisions of section 5 of the Act of October 9, 1965 (79 Stat. 969; 16
U.S.C. 20d), is entitled to be given preference in the renewal of the contract and in the negotiation of a new contract,
providing that the existing concessioner submits a responsive offer (a timely offer which meets the terms and conditions
of the Prospectus). This means that the contract will be awarded to the party submitting the best offer, provided that
if the best offer was not submitted by the existing concessioner, then the existing concessioner will be afforded
the opportunity to match the best offer. If the existing concessioner agrees to match the best offer, then the contract
will be awarded to the existing concessioner.



If the existing concessioner does not submit a responsive offer, the right of preference in renewal shall be considered
to have been waived, and the contract will then be awarded to the party that has submitted the best responsive offer.

The Secretary will consider and evaluate all proposals received as a result of this notice. Any proposal, including
that of the existing concessioner, must be received by the Regional Director not later than the sixtieth (60th) day
following publication of this notice to be considered and evaluated.

and the Government of Mexico engage in a joint project for immediate emergency removal of sediment in the lower Colorado
River in Mexico from Morelos Dam to the Northerly International Boundary (NIB) is not a major federal action that would
have a significant adverse effect on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, pursuant to section 102(2)(C)
of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; the Council on Environmental Quality Final Regulations (40 CFR
parts 1500 through 1508); and the USIBWC's Operational Procedures for Implementing Section 102 of NEPA, published
in the 

Federal Register

 September 2, 1981 (46 FR 44083-44094); the USIBWC hereby gives notice that an environmental impact statement
will not be prepared for the proposed project.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Proposed Action



The action proposed is for the United States Government and the Government of Mexico to engage in a joint project to
remove sediment in the lower Colorado River in Mexico from Morelos Dam to the Northerly International Boundary (NIB).


The need for the project arises from extraordinary winter storm runoff in 1993 in the Gila River basin which resulted
in the filling and spilling of Painted Rock Dam, located some 116 miles (187 kilometers) upstream of the Gila River's
confluence with the Colorado River. The sustained high flows carried a large sediment load, causing dangerous accumulations
in the international boundary segment of the Colorado River. 

The sediment removal is necessary to provide immediate flood control relief in the vicinity of Morelos Dam and to enable
Mexico to receive full deliveries of their 1944 Treaty waters. All sediment removal activities will be conducted
in Mexico. 



Alternatives Considered



Three alternatives, including the No Action Alternative and the Proposed Action Alternative, were considered:


The No Action Alternative would result in accumulated sediment not being removed from the lower Colorado River in
the vicinity of Morelos Dam. Mexico would not be able to divert full domestic and irrigation allotments. Serious impacts
to human health could result from an absence of an adequate domestic water supply. Sediment accumulation in the Morelos
Dam system would increase flood stage elevations. The United States would not be acting in furtherance of the 1944
Water Treaty requirement to recommend and carry out flood control activities and the 1970 Boundary Treaty requirements
for boundary preservation. 

The Proposed Action Alternative is a joint United States/Mexico emergency project to remove sediment upstream of
the Morelos Dam flood control gates for a distance yet to be determined, but no further upstream than the NIB, and downstream
of the Morelos Dam intake gates. The IBWC, on behalf of the United States and Mexico, would coordinate the work utilizing,
as authorized in the 1944 Water Treaty, the resources of the U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation),
and the Mexican National Water Commission.

The project includes the removal of an estimated minimum 183,000 cubic yards (140,000 cubic meters) of sediment downstream
of the Morelos Dam intake structure in Mexico, assigned to Mexico, and removal of an estimated minimum 314,000 cubic
yards (240,000 cubic meters) of sediment, assigned to the United States, immediately upstream of Morelos Dam in the
Colorado River, also in Mexico, up to the NIB. The Mexican government has requested the United States government perform
the part of the work assigned to Mexico at full reimbursement to the United States Government because the existing
Mexican equipment does not have the capacity to remove the amount of sediment necessary to restore the intake canal
capacity to 5,650 cubic feet per second (160 cubic meters per second).

Work will be performed utilizing dredging equipment. It may also be necessary to use earth moving equipment along
the Mexican bank of the Colorado River. The spoil material will be temporarily placed in Mexico just upstream of Morelos
Dam. Mexico will remove the spoil material to a permanent disposal site in Mexico in the near future. The United States
will advise Mexico on disposal site preparation in that country. The sediment has been tested for the presence of pesticides
and heavy metals. The result of the tests will be furnished to the interested resource agencies when they become available.

This alternative will improve the flood carrying capacity in the Colorado River to pass flood flows through the NIB
similar to those experienced during the 1993 Gila River floods. The Morelos Dam system will also allow Mexico to fully
divert the waters delivered by the United States under the 1944 Water Treaty along with small flood flows that may arrive
at the NIB. The United States would be acting in furtherance of the 1944 Water Treaty requirement to recommend and carry
out flood control activities and the 1970 Boundary Treaty requirements for boundary preservation.

The Sediment Removal and Flood Control Alternative would result in the United States and Mexico concluding an international
agreement through a Minute of the IBWC for sediment removal in the Colorado River from the confluence of the Gila River
to the lower end of the Mexicali Valley Irrigation District, including the Morelos Dam intake canal. This action would
restore the carrying capacity of the river channel to about 25,000 cubic feet per second (708 cubic meters per second)
to permit passage of the 100-year flood discharge of approximately 40,000 cubic feet per second (1,130 cubic meters
per second) with overbank discharges that will not overtop or endanger flood control levees in either the United States
or in Mexico. This activity would also improve the Colorado River channel gradient in the lower end of the Mexicali
Valley Irrigation District to increase the velocity of flood flows into the Laguna Salada diversion channel and to
the Gulf of California. This alternative would also allow the United States and Mexico to resolve existing boundary
issues and other differences in a cooperative manner.

This alternative would be a major federal undertaking which could not be accomplished within the short time needed
to correct water diversion problems or handle potential significant flood events during 1994. An undertaking of
this magnitude would also involve a consideration of river stabilization and river rectifications in addition to
sediment removal. Such activities would require extensive cost-benefit analysis and environmental impact evaluation.
This alternative was therefore not given further consideration. Instead, the elements of this alternative were
considered as elements that merit considerable binational study for a possible longer term activity.



Revised Draft Environmental Assessment



The USIBWC met with the interested resource agencies on February 15, 1994, in Yuma, Arizona, to discuss the proposed
action. The Revised Draft Environmental Assessment (RDEA) for the proposed project was completed on February 16,
1994, and made available for review and comment.

On the basis of the consensus reached with the interested resource agencies and the RDEA, the USIBWC has determined
that an environmental impact statement is not required for the United States Government and the Government of Mexico
to engage in a joint project for immediate emergency removal of sediment in Mexico from Morelos Dam to the NIB and hereby
provides notice of a finding of no significant impact.

An environmental impact statement will not be prepared unless additional information which may affect this decision
is brought to our attention within thirty (30) days of the date of this Notice.

The RDEA and Draft Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) have been forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency
and various Federal, State, and local agencies and interested parties. A limited number of copies of these documents
are available to fill single copy requests at the above address.

Extension of Designation of Liberia Under Temporary Protected Status Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice extends, until March 28, 1995, the Attorney General's designation of Liberia under the Temporary Protected
Status program provided for in section 244A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act). Accordingly, eligible
aliens who are nationals of Liberia, or who have no nationality and who last habitually resided in Liberia, may re-register
for Temporary Protected Status and extension of employment authorization. This re-registration is limited to persons
who already registered for the initial period of Temporary Protected Status, which ended on March 27, 1992. In addition
during the extension period, some aliens may be eligible for late initial registration pursuant to 8 CFR 240.2(f)(2).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under section 244A of the Act, as amended by section 302(a) of Public Law 101-649 and section 304(b) of Public
Law 102-232 (8 U.S.C. 1254a), the Attorney General is authorized to grant Temporary Protected Status in the
United States to eligible aliens who are nationals of a foreign state designated by the Attorney General, or who have
no nationality and who last habitually resided in that state. The Attorney General so designates a state, or a part
thereof, upon finding that the state is experiencing ongoing armed conflict, environmental disaster, or certain
other extraordinary and temporary conditions that prevent nationals or residents of the country from returning
in safety.





Effective on March 27, 1991, the Attorney General designated Liberia for Temporary Protected Status for a period
of 12 months, 56 FR 12746. The Attorney General extended the designation of Liberia under the Temporary Protected
Status program for additional 12-month periods until March 28, 1993, 57 FR 2932, and until March 28, 1994, 58 FR 7898.

This notice extends the designation of Liberia under the Temporary Protected Status program for an additional 12
months, in accordance with sections 244A(b)(3) (A) and (C) of the Act. This notice also describes the procedures with
which eligible aliens who are nationals of Liberia, or who have no nationality and who last habitually resided in Liberia,
must comply in applying for continuation of Temporary Protected Status.

In addition to timely re-registrations and late re-registrations authorized by this notice's extension of Liberia's
Temporary Protected Status designation, late initial registrations are possible for some Liberians as the result
of addition of 8 CFR 240.2(f)(2) under the interim rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 5, 1993, at 58 FR 58935-58938. Such late initial registrants must still meet the initial presence
requirement for all Liberians and the status requirements contained in the November 5, 1993, interim rule.



Notice of Extension of Designation of Liberia Under Temporary Protected Status Program



By the authority vested in me as Attorney General under section 244A of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended,
and pursuant to sections 244A(b)(3) (A) and (C) of the Act, I have determined that, as a result of the ongoing civil unrest
in that country, there still exist extraordinary and temporary conditions in Liberia that prevent aliens who are
nationals of Liberia, and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia, from returning to
Liberia in safety. I have further determined that permitting nationals of Liberia, and aliens having no nationality
who last habitually resided in Liberia, to remain temporarily in the United States, is not contrary to the national
interest of the United States. Accordingly, it is ordered as follows:

(1) The designation of Liberia under section 244A(b) of the Act is extended for an additional 12-month period from
March 29, 1994, to March 28, 1995.

(2) I estimate that there are approximately 4000 nationals of Liberia, and aliens having no nationality who last habitually
resided in Liberia, who have been granted Temporary Protected Status and who are eligible for re-registration.

(3) A national of Liberia, or an alien having no nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia, who received a
grant of Temporary Protected Status during the initial period of designation from March 27, 1991, to March 27, 1992,
and who re-registered for the third period which ends on March 28, 1994, must comply with the re-registration requirements
contained in 8 CFR 240.17, which are described in pertinent part in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this notice.

(4) A national of Liberia, or an alien having no nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia, who previously
has been granted Temporary Protected Status, must re-register by filing a new Application for Temporary Protected
Status, Form I-821, together with an Application for Employment Authorization, Form I-765, within the
30-day period beginning on March 2, 1994, and ending on April 1, 1994, in order to be eligible for Temporary Protected
Status during the period from March 29, 1994, until March 28, 1995. Late re-registration applications will be allowed
for ``good cause'' pursuant to 8 CFR 240.17(c).

(5) There is no filing fee for the Form I-821 filed as part of the re-registration application. The fee prescribed
in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1) will be charged for the Form I-765, filed by an alien requesting employment authorization
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this notice. An alien who does not request employment authorization
must file Form I-821 together with Form I-765 for information purposes, but in such cases both Form I-821
and Form I-765 will be without fee.

(6) Pursuant to section 244A(b)(3)(A) of the Act, the Attorney General will review, at least 60 days before March 28,
1995, the designation of Liberia under the Temporary Protected Status program to determine whether the conditions
for designation continue to exist. Notice of that determination, including the basis for the determination, will
be published in the 

Federal Register

.

(7) Information concerning the Temporary Protected Status program for nationals of Liberia, and aliens having no
nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia, will be available at local Immigration and Naturalization Service
offices upon publication of this notice.

<DOCTITLE>Biweekly Notice</DOCTITLE>


Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations

I. Background


Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from February 5, 1994, through
February 17, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on February 16, 1994 (59 FR 7685).



Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing



The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register 

a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register 

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By April 1, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to 

(Project Director)

: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number
of this 

Federal Register 

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified
in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). 
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection
at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the
local public document room for the particular facility involved.

Station, Unit Nos. 1, 2, and 3, Maricopa County, Arizona




Date of amendment requests: 

January 13, 1994


Description of amendment requests: 

Request for NRC consent to the indirect transfer of control of El Paso Electric Company's interest in Operating License
Nos. NPF-41, NPF-51, NPF-74 and to amend Operating License Nos. NPF-51 and NPF-74 to delete provisions for El Paso
Electric Company's sale-leaseback arrangements.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensees have provided their analysis about the issue of no significant hazards
consideration, which is presented below: 




Standard 1 

-- Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
This amendment request does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated because the proposed change is administrative in nature. The proposed change deletes Sections
2.B.(7)(a) and (b) of License No. NPF-51, and Sections 2.B.(6)(a) and (b) of License No. No. NPF-74. These section
describe the structure of the financing of El Paso's interest in Palo Verde, specifically authorizing sale and leaseback
transactions. The proposed change does not affect the assumptions used in the accident analyses, nor does the proposed
change result in changes to the physical configuration of the facility, design parameters, technical specifications,
or operation and maintenance of the facility. Therefore, this amendment request does not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.



Standard 2 

-- Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed.

This amendment request does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
analyzed because the proposed change is administrative in nature. The proposed change deletes Sections 2.B.(7)(a)
and (b) of License No. NPF-51, and Sections 2.B.(6)(a) and (b) of License No. NPF-74. These sections describe the structure
of the financing of El Paso's interest in Palo Verde, specifically authorizing sale and leaseback transactions.
The proposed change does not involve modifications to any of the existing equipment nor does the change affect the
operation and maintenance of the facility. Therefore, this amendment request does not create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident not previously analyzed.



Standard 3 

-- Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

This amendment request does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because it is administrative
in nature. The proposed change deletes Sections 2.B.(7)(a) and (b) of License No. NPF-51, and Sections 2.B.(6)(a)
and (b) of License No. NPF-74. These sections describe the structure of the financing of El Paso's interest in Palo
Verde, specifically authorizing sale and leaseback transactions. The proposed change does not involve changes
to any existing plant equipment or accident analyses that provide for or establish margins of safety. There are no
changes to the operation or maintenance of the facility and the existing margins of safety are not changed by the proposed
change. Therefore, this amendment request does not involve a signigicant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensees' analysis and, based on that review, it appears that the proposed license
amendment reflects only a change in the structure of the financing of El Paso's interest in Palo Verde and the three
standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests
involve no significant hazards consideration.

Chatham Counties, North Carolina




Date of amendment request: 

February 4, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification 3/4.6.4, Containment Systems Combustible Gas Control,
by eliminating the 12-hour channel check surveillance requirement for the containment hydrogen monitoring system
in conformance with the new Standard Technical Specifications, NUREG-1431.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

Final Safety Analysis Report [FSAR] section 6.2.5.2.3 states that the Hydrogen Analyzer is only required to be functioning
(continuously indicating and recording hydrogen concentration) within 30 minutes of safety injection initiation.
The performance of an analog operational test every 31 days and a channel calibration test every 92 days verifies this
operability. Based on this, the monitors will be fully capable of performing their intended design function following
a safety injection initiation. Therefore, the elimination of the 12-hour channel check would not increase the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

The Hydrogen Monitors perform an ``indication'' function only, [sic] to help ensure that hydrogen concentrations
within containment are maintained below flammable limits during a post-LOCA [loss-of-coolant accident] condition.
The proposed changes do not involve any modifications or additions to plant equipment and the design and operation
of the plant will not be affected. Therefore, the elimination of the 12-hour channel check does not affect any parameters
which relate to the margin of safety as defined in the Technical Specifications or the FSAR. Therefore, the proposed
changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed elimination of the 12-hour channel check does not affect any parameters which relate to the margin of
safety as defined in the Technical Specifications or the FSAR. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

March 26, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would modify trip level settings for the Isolation Condenser and High Pressure Core Injection
(HPCI) System Steam lines to more conservative values. In addition, the proposed amendment would revise the Emergency
Core Cooling System Low-Low Water Level initiation trip level setting tolerance. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because:



HPCI Steamline High Flow Isolation Trip Level Setting

The purpose of the HPCI leak detection systems are to detect breaks in the system piping. Normal steam flows within
the system can fluctuate in excess of 250% rated flow and exceed 500% rated steam flow after experiencing a break. During
the original licensing of the plant, it was analytically determined by GE that three times maximum steam flow (300%)
is the optimum setpoint for the isolation of HPCI. A 300% steam flow setpoint ensures that spurious trips are avoided
and that breaks in the piping are identified. Because the HPCI High Steamline Flow Isolation setpoint is not assumed
as an accident precursor, the probability of any previously evaluated accident is not increased by the changed setpoint.


The proposed changes to the setpoint allow a more accurate and conservative value for 300% steam flow. The proposed
change in conjunction with a more conservative field setting ensures HPCI isolation occurring between the range
of 300% and 500% steam flow, thus ensuring HPCI isolation in the event of a pipe break. Because the HPCI high steamline
flow setpoint will be maintained above normally found operational values (272% steam flow) and below expected conditions
with a pipe break (500% steam flow), the consequences of any previously evaluated accident are not increased with
the proposed setpoint change. 

solation Condenser Steamline High Flow Isolation Trip Level Setting

The purpose of the Isolation Condenser leak detection instrumentation is to detect breaks in the system piping. Normal
steam flows within the system can fluctuate in excess of 250% rated flow and exceed 500% rated steam flow after experiencing
a break. During the original licensing of the plant, it was analytically determined by GE that three times rated steam
flow (300%) is the optimum setpoint for the isolation of the Isolation Condenser. A 300% steam flow Isolation setpoint
ensures that spurious trips are avoided and that breaks in the piping are identified. Because the Isolation Condenser
High Steamline Flow setpoint is not assumed as an accident precursor, the probability of any previously evaluated
accident is not increased by the changed setpoint. The proposed changes to the setpoint provide a more accurate and
conservative field setting for 300% steam flow. 

The proposed changes in conjunction with a more conservative field setting results in Isolation Condenser isolation
occurring between the range of 300% and 500% steam flow, thus ensuring Isolation Condenser isolation in the event
of a pipe break. Because the Isolation Condenser High Steamline Flow Isolation setpoint will be maintained above
normally found operational values (272% steam flow) and below expected conditions with a pipe break (500% steam flow),
the consequences of any previously evaluated accident are not increased with the proposed setpoint change. 

Reactor Low-Low Water Level Trip Level Setting Tolerance

The Low-Low Reactor Water Level trip setting is designed to initiate ECCS when reactor water level is less than or equal
to 444 inches above vessel zero. Top of active fuel (TAF) is defined as 360 inches above vessel zero. -59 inches is 84
inches above TAF. The present trip setting tolerance (84 inches, + 4, - 0, above TAF) only allows a deviation of 4 inches
in the conservative direction. The proposed change (greater than or equal to 84 inches) does not impose a restriction
on the limit toward the conservative direction. Because a level switch trip level setting by itself is not assumed
as an accident precursor, the probability of any previously evaluated accident is not increased by the changed setpoint.


The proposed change eliminates a restriction on the trip level setting for Low-Low Reactor Water Level. Dresden proposes
modifying the acceptance limit of the Low-Low trip setting such that the instrument field setting will not deviate
below 84 inches. Therefore, the actuation of appropriate ECCS are unchanged and the consequences of any previously
evaluated accident are not increased with the proposed setpoint change. 

Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because:

HPCI Steamline High Flow Isolation Trip Level Setting

The purpose of the HPCI Steamline High Flow Isolation trip level setting is to detect breaks in system piping and initiate
isolation of the system if breaks are discovered. Normal steam flows within the system can fluctuate as high as 250%
rated flow and exceed 500% rated steam flow after experiencing a break. 300% steam flow has been used as the setpoint
to ensure that spurious trips are avoided and that breaks in the piping are identified. The changes to the HPCI High
Steamline Flow setpoint ensure that isolation occurs at 300% rated steam flow (below 500% rated steam flow). The current
setpoint will also isolate below 500% rated steam flow. Because the new setpoint continues to allow normal operational
flexibility and ensures isolation in the event of a pipe break, the proposed changes do not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident than previously evaluated. 
 
Isolation Condenser Steamline High Flow Isolation Trip Level Setting

The purpose of the Isolation Condenser Steamline High Flow Isolation trip level setting is to detect breaks in system
piping and initiate isolation of the system if breaks are discovered. Normal steam flows within the system can fluctuate
in excess of 250% rated flow and exceed 500% rated steam flow after experiencing a break. 300% steam flow has been used
as the setpoint to ensure that spurious trips are avoided and ensures that isolation occurs at 300% rated steam flow
(below 500% rated steam flow). The current setpoint will also isolate below 500% rated steam flow. Because the new
setpoint continues to allow normal operational flexibility and ensures isolation in the event of a pipe break, the
proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident than previously evaluated. 

Reactor Low-Low Level Trip Level Setting Tolerance

The Reactor Low-Low Water Level trip setting is designed to initiate the appropriate ECCS when Reactor Water Level
is decreasing. The proposed change to the setpoint only eliminates the overly burdensome restriction within the
setpoint tolerances. The absolute low limit of 84 inches is unchanged, thus maintaining all assumptions related
to 84 inches (-59 inches indicated level) within Dresden's Safety Analysis. The removal of the upper tolerance will
not increase the probability of inadvertent ECCS initiation since the actual field setting will be at a reactor vessel
level which has not been reached in 40 + years of operation at Dresden Units 2 and 3. Therefore, the proposed changes
do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident than previously evaluated. 

Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because:

High Pressure Coolant Injection Setpoint

The HPCI high steamline flow setpoint ensures that isolation occurs at 300% maximum steam flow (below 500% rated steam
flow). The current Technical Specification setpoint will also allow isolation below 500% rated steam flow but at
a value greater than 300%. Thus, the proposed setpoint isolates at a lower steam flow rate than the current limit. Therefore,
because isolation of HPCI would occur at a lower steam flow rate during a pipe break, the proposed changes do not involve
a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 

Isolation Condenser Steamline High Flow Isolation Trip Level Setting

The Isolation Condenser High Steamline Flow Isolation Trip Level setting ensures that isolation occurs at 300% rated
steam flow (below 500% rated steam flow). The current setpoint will also isolate below 500% rated steam flow but at
a value greater than 300%. Thus, the proposed setpoint isolates at a lower steam flow rate than the current limit. Therefore,
because isolation of the Isolation Condenser would occur at a lower steam flow rate during a pipe break, the proposed
changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 

Reactor Low-Low Level Trip Level Setting Tolerance
 
The Reactor Low-Low Water Level trip setting tolerance ensures the proper initiation of appropriate ECCS in the event
of a loss of inventory to the vessel. The proposed change to the setpoint only eliminates the restriction within the
setpoint tolerances. The absolute low limit of 84 inches is unchanged, thus maintaining all assumptions related
to 84 inches (minus 59 inches indicated) within Dresden's Safety Analysis. Therefore, the proposed changes do not
involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Island County, Illinois




Date of amendment request: 

December 20, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise a minimum critical power ratio (MCPR) safety limit from 1.06 to 1.07 based on General
Electric Standard Application for Reactor Fuel II (GESTAR II) NEDE-24011-P-A-10 for GE10 fuel design. The NRC staff
has previously reviewed and approved the GE10 fuel design. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because: 

The change is based on GE's generic rule licensing document GESTAR II (NEDE-24011-P-A-10) which has conservatively
addressed the use of GE10 fuel in D-lattice cores with NRC approved methods and therefore does not adversely affect
the consequences of previously evaluated accidents. The Safety Limit MCPR change does not affect the probability
of analyzed accidents because it does not adversely impact any equipment important to safety. Increasing the Safety
Limit MCPR from 1.06 to 1.07 upon implementation of GE10 fuel for Cycle 14 operation of Quad Cities Units 1 and 2 therefore
does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated
in the FSAR. 

The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because: 

The Safety Limit MCPR change results from the use of NRC approved methods in GESTAR II NEDE-24011-P-A-10 for application
to GE10 fuel for Cycle 14 for Quad Cities Units 1 and 2. The Safety Limit MCPR change does not result in any new interaction
with equipment related to the safe shutdown of the plant. The change does not adversely impact equipment important
to safety and, therefore does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident scenario. Therefore,
the Safety Limit MCPR change from 1.06 to 1.07 in no way creates the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
scenario from any accident previously evaluated. 

The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because: 

Since the GE10 design in a D-lattice core has a geometry between C-lattice and D-lattice designs and the C-lattice
design has a higher, more restrictive safety limit MCPR that the D-lattice design, the use of C-lattice safety limit
MCPR for the GE10 design is a conservative approach. The GE10 fuel design has been generically analyzed with approved
methods per GESTAR II NEDE-24011-P-A-10 and the use of the 1.07 Safety Limit MCPR value has been previously approved
as conservative for application to GE10 fuel in D-lattice plants such as Quad Cities. Therefore, the proposed change
to increase the Safety Limit MCPR from 1.06 to 1.07 maintains the margin to safety relative to the current level. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

County, New York




Date of amendment request: 

December 10, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment request would revise the Technical Specifications to amend (1) Section 5.3.A (Reactor Core)
to allow the use of VANTAGE + fuel with ZIRLO cladding and fuel with filler rods to allow fuel reconstitution, and (2)
the Basis to Section 2.1 (Safety Limit: Reactor Core) to allow the use of departure from nucleate boiling (DNB) Correlations
applicable to VANTAGE + fuel.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



Consistent with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.92, the enclosed application involves no significant hazards based
on the following information:

1. Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated?

Response:

Neither the probability nor the consequences of an accident previously analyzed is increased due to the proposed
changes. As discussed in [Letter from Thadani to Tritch, ``Acceptance 
for Referencing of Topical Report WCAP-12610, VANTAGE + Fuel Assembly Reference Core Report'' (TAC No. 77258) July
1, 1991] the fuel containing ZIRLO clad will meet all the same material and mechanical design criteria as the Zircaloy
clad fuel. The use of approved Westinghouse Methodology for fuel assembly reconstitution as documented in [Letter
from Thadani to Tritch, ``Acceptance for Referencing of Topical Report WCAP-13060-P, Westinghouse Fuel Assembly
Reconstitution Evaluation Methodology'' (TAC No. M821391), March 30, 1993] will ensure that all criteria are met.
The change to the basis of Section 2.1 more accurately describes DNB methodology and application.

2. Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated?

Response:

The changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. The proposed changes involve approved
methodology which have been shown to meet design and safety criteria. In addition, approved procedures will be used
to implement the changes.

Response:

3. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety?

The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The changes involve the use
of approved methodology which meet design and safety criteria. The change to the Section 2.1 basis is descriptive
and will more accurately describe the DNB methodology used in conjunction with the use of VANTAGE + fuel.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Duke Power Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-413 and 50-414, Catawba Nuclear Station, Units 1 and 2, York County, South
Carolina




Date of amendment request: 

September 28, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The requested amendments would delete the portion of the 18-month surveillance requirement on the autoclosure interlock
(ACI) contained in TS 4.5.2.d associated with verifying that the decay heat removal system suction isolation valves
automatically close on a reactor coolant system pressure signal. The terms decay heat removal (ND) and residual heat
removal (RHR) are used interchangeably here. Also, an obsolete footnote to TS 4.5.2.e relating to the completion
of the first Unit 1 refueling outage is proposed to be deleted. 

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
 


The requested amendments reference Westinghouse topical report WCAP-11736-A, ``Residual Heat Removal System
Autoclosure Interlock Removal Report for the Westinghouse Owners Group'', for the general justification and safety
analysis for removing the ACI feature from the Catawba ND suction isolation valves. This WCAP, which specifically
covers the Catawba Nuclear station, has been deemed an acceptable reference by the NRC for use in making plant-specific
licensing submittals. Additional Catawba-specific information/ improvements and analyses, as required by the
WCAP and associated NRC safety evaluation, have been either completed or committed to, thereby ensuring that the
WCAP/SE conclusion that removal of the RHR ACI produces a net safety benefit remains valid.



Criterion 1

The requested amendments will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The deletion of the RHR ACI was analyzed in the WCAP for Callaway Nuclear Station in terms of
(1) the frequency of an interfacing LOCA, (2) the availability of the RHR system, and (3) the effect on overpressure
transients. Callaway is the WCAP's reference plant for Catawba Units 1 and 2, and a Catawba-specific Probabilistic
Risk Assessment (PRA) review of the WCAP determined that removal of the ND ACI at Catawba will not invalidate the basic
conclusions of the WCAP. Consequently, the following information from the Callaway analysis is considered applicable
to Catawba Units 1 and 2.

With the removal of the ACI and addition of a control room alarm, the probabilistic risk analysis predicts a decrease
in the frequency of interfacing LOCAs from 1.52E-06/year to 1.16E-06/year, a decrease of approximately 24%.

The availability of the RHR system was analyzed in three phases: initiation, short term cooling, and long term cooling.
The probabilistic analysis indicated that deletion of the RHR ACI has no impact on the failure probability for RHR
initiation. During short term cooling (72 hours after initiation), RHR ACI deletion decreased the RHR failure probability
by 12%, from 1.64E-02 to 1.44E-02. The long term cooling RHR failure probability was calculated to decrease by 70%,
from 3.91E-02 to 1.17E-02.

Appendix D of the WCAP presents the analysis used to determine the effect of removal of the ACI on overpressurization
transients. The analysis categorizes the types of initiating events, determines their frequency of occurrence,
and then identifies the consequences of these occurrences both with and without the ACI feature. The result is a list
of overpressure consequence categories with associated failure probabilities (reference the WCAP's Appendix
D, Tables D-14, -15, and -16). For the charging/safety injection event, consequence frequencies increased on the
order of 1.0E-12/shutdown year. This is an insignificant increase, as the overall consequence frequency of the charging/safety
injection event is 1.25E-01. Likewise, for the letdown isolation with RHR system operable case, one frequency category
was increased on the order of 1.0E-15. Again, this is insignificant when compared with the total frequency of these
events of 1.25E-01. For the letdown isolation with RHR system isolated event, the overall consequence frequency
was reduced from 4.45E-01 to 2.22E-01. This occurs because many spurious closures of the RHR isolation valves cause
the isolation of letdown. Removing the RHR ACI reduces the frequency of this event by approximately 50%. It is concluded
that the removal of the RHR ACI circuitry has an insignificant impact on the frequency of overpressurization events
at Callaway (and thus Catawba) Nuclear Station.

Criterion 2

The requested amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The effect of an overpressure transient at cold shutdown conditions will not be altered by removal of the
ND ACI function. With or without the ACI function, the ND system could be subject to overpressrue for which the ND relief
valves must be relied upon to limit pressure to within ND design parameters. While it is true that the ACI initiates
an automatic closure of the ND suction/isolation valves on high NC system pressure, overpressure protection of the
ND system is provided by the ND system relief valves and not by the suction/isolation valves that isolate the ND system
from the NC system. (Refer to NUREG-0954, ``Safety Evaluation Report related to the operation of Catawba Nuclear
Station, Units 1 and 2,'' Section 5.4.4.3.)

The purpose of the ACI feature is to ensure that there is a double barrier between the ND system and the NC system when
the plant is at normal operating conditions (i.e., heated and pressurized) and not in the ND cooling mode. Thus, the
ACI feature serves to preclude conditions that could lead to a LOCA outside of containment due to operator error. The
safety function of the ACI is not to isolate the ND system from the NC system when the ND system is operating in the decay
heat removal mode.

There are several methods to ensure that there is a double barrier between the ND system and the NC system when the plant
is at normal operating conditions. First, plant operating procedures instruct the operators to isolate the ND system
during plant heatup. Second, the alarm that will be installed as part of this change will annunciate in the control
room given an open or intermediate valve position signal in conjunction with a high NC pressure signal. This alarm
will alert operators that any of the four suction/isolation valves is (are) not fully closed and that double isolation
has not been achieved. In conjunction with this alarm, operators will be trained using an annunciator response procedure
to ensure that they act to restore double isolation or return to a safe shutdown condition. Third, the Open Permissive
Interlock (OPI), which is not being removed, will prevent the opening of the valves whenever NC system pressure is
greater than 385.5 psig.

Since relief valves prevent overpressurization of the ND system during shutdown conditions and since several methods
are in place to ensure that the ND system is isolated from the NC system during normal plant conditions, removal of the
ACI will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

Criterion 3
 
The requested amendments will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The ND ACI function is not
a consideration in a margin of safety in the basis for any technical specification. Since the probabilistic analysis
of the WCAP for Callaway (which is applicable to Catawba as discussed above) indicates that the availability of the
RHR system is increased with the removal of the ACI, overall safety will be increased. 
In addition, similar amendments for other Westinghouse plants in the past have been determined to not involve significant
hazards considerations.

Based upon the preceding analyses, Duke Power Company concludes that the requested amendments do not involve a significant
hazards consideration.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

January 27, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The requested amendments delete the verification that each upper and lower Containment Purge System (VP) supply
and exhaust valve actuates to its isolation position on a High Relative Humidity (>70%) isolation test signal
and will allow elimination of the humidity control function of the VP System humidistats.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:





CRITERION 1

This TS [Technical Specification] amendment will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident which
has been previously evaluated. No physical changes will be made to the plant that would impact fuel handling inside
containment, therefore, there is no increase in the probability of an accident. Control wiring changes that remove
the humidistats from the [Containment Purge] System control circuits will be the only physical change.

The heaters will be maintained providing additional margin over analyzed conditions. For the reasons stated above,
there will be no increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

CRITERION 2

This proposed TS amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. This proposed TS amendment will not cause any physical changes to the plant that will impact
the handling of fuel inside containment or changes to fuel handling procedures. Because the plant will operate the
same way it does now, this proposed amendment does not create the possibility of any new or different accident from
any previously evaluated.

CRITERION 3 
This proposed TS change will not cause a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The test method use[d] to evaluate
the carbon after TS changes #90 ([Unit] 1) and #84 ([Unit] 2) does not consider heater availability. However the heaters
will be tested and maintained per Technical specification 4.9.4.2.d.2. Therefore, the relative humidity of the
air entering the carbon adsorber is never expected to reach 95% [relative humidity].



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Entergy Operations, Inc., Docket No. 50-313, Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit No. 1 (ANO-1), Pope County, Arkansas




Date of amendment request: 

January 13, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

This amendment revises the specifications governing the reactor protection (RPS). It modifies the use of the RPS
channel bypass as specified by Technical Specification (TS) 3.5.1.3 and revises a note with Table 3.5.1-1, to refer
to a more appropriate action.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



Criterion 1 - Does Not Involve a Significant Increase in the Probability or Consequences of an Accident Previously
Evaluated.

The RPS and EFIC [emergency feedwater initiation and control] system provide accident mitigation features and are
not considered to be accident initiators. The accident mitigation features of the plant are not affected by the proposed
amendment. In any configuration allowed by the revised specifications, the trip logic instituted on the RPS is at
least equivalent to the trip logic instituted by placing a channel in channel or maintenance bypass. The RPS remains
single-failure proof with one channel in channel bypass, manually tripped, or with an inoperable function unbypassed
in the untripped state. Therefore, upon receipt of an initiating signal, a single failure will not prevent the proper
actuation of RPS. Should a channel of RPS contain an inoperable function unbypassed in the untripped condition which
does not affect an EFIC channel, any channel of EFIC may be placed in maintenance bypass. RPS and EFIC remain single-failure
proof in this configuration.
 
Administrative controls are established to ensure that all inoperable RPS functions are evaluated for continued
operation in the untripped state. Upon detection of a failed function in any channel of RPS, the administratively
controlled condition reporting process evaluates the failure and its effect on other systems for continued operability.
The operator is informed of the continuing status of inoperable functions through the use of Station Log entries and
Plant Status board entries. In addition, during operation with an inoperable function in the untripped, unbypassed
condition, the remaining RPS channel key-lock channel bypass switches will be ``Hold Carded'' (tagged) to prevent
their operation without prior management approval consistent with the requirements of TS Table 3.5.1-1. Plant management
maintains the responsibility to approve continued operation with inoperable functions unbypassed in the untripped
state to ensure that the plant is operated in the safest configuration with regard to the extent of the failure, and
the plant operating conditions. Prior to placing any channel of RPS or EFIC in bypass, the operator checks the status
of redundant systems for operability and TS compliance and takes the proper action as required by existing plant conditions,
plant operating procedures and TS.

The clarification to TS 3.5.1.3 which directs the operator to the appropriate actions if multiple channels become
inoperable, or in the event of an inoperable channel or inoperable function occurring concurrent with one channel
in bypass is considered to be administrative in nature. The change to Note 6 of Table 3.5.1-1 results in the correction
of misleading information and directs the Operator to place the plant in a safe mode depending on the system which is
affected by a failure, and is also considered to be administrative in nature. The Bases changes add additional information
to clarify the specifications.

Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident
previously evaluated.

Criterion 2 - Does Not Create the Possibility of a New or Different Kind of Accident from any Previously Evaluated.

The probability or consequences of equipment important to safety malfunctioning will not be increased. In any configuration
allowed by the revised specifications, the trip logic instituted on the RPS is at least equivalent to the trip logic
instituted by placing a channel in channel bypass. The RPS remains single-failure proof with one channel in channel
bypass, manually tripped, or with an inoperable function unbypassed in the untripped state. Therefore, upon receipt
of an initiating signal, a single failure will not prevent the proper actuation of RPS. Should a channel of RPS contain
an inoperable function unbypassed in the untripped condition which does not affect an EFIC channel, any channel of
EFIC may be placed in maintenance bypass. RPS and EFIC remain single-failure proof in this configuration.

The clarification to TS 3.5.1.3 which directs the operator to the appropriate actions if multiple channels become
inoperable, or in the event of an inoperable channel or inoperable function occurring concurrent with one channel
in bypass is considered to be administrative in nature. The change to Note 6 of Table 3.5.1-1 is also considered to be
administrative in nature, in that misleading information in the specification has been corrected to an appropriate
requirement. The Bases changes add additional information to clarify the specifications.

Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
 


Criterion 3 - Does Not Involve a Significant Reduction in the Margin of Safety.



The RPS and EFIC system have the same capabilities to mitigate and/or prevent accidents as they had prior to this proposed
change. Allowing flexibility in the response to a function failure in one channel of RPS allows placing the plant in
the safest operating condition for the existing plant conditions considering the extent of the function failure.
Operation of an RPS channel with an inoperable function unbypassed in the untripped state results in placing the inoperable
function in a 2-out-of-3 trip logic (equivalent to channel bypass) while the remainder of the RPS functions remain
in the normal 2-out-of-4 trip logic. The ANO-1 RPS has been reviewed as a 3 channel system with one channel in bypass.
Implementing this change results in additional conservatism with respect to any postulated single-failures.

Administrative controls are established to ensure that all inoperable RPS functions are evaluated for continued
operation in the untripped state. Upon detection of a failed function in any channel of RPS, the administratively
controlled condition reporting process evaluates the failure and its effect on other systems for continued operability.
The operator is informed of the continuing status of inoperable functions through the use of Station Log entries and
Plant Status board entries. In addition, during operation with an inoperable function in the untripped, bypassed
condition, the remaining RPS channel key-lock channel bypass switches will be ``Hold Carded'' (tagged) to prevent
their operation without prior management approval consistent with the requirements of TS Table 3.5.1-1. Plant management
maintains the responsibility to approve continued operation with inoperable functions unbypassed in the untripped
state to ensure that the plant is operated in the safest configuration with regard to the extent of the failure, and
the plant operating conditions. Prior to placing any channel of RPS or EFIC in bypass, the operator checks the status
of redundant systems for operability and TS compliance and takes the proper action as required by existing plant conditions,
plant operating procedures and TS. Should a channel of RPS contain an inoperable function unbypassed in the untripped
condition which does not affect an EFIC channel, any channel of EFIC may be placed in maintenance bypass. RPS and EFIC
remain single-failure proof in this configuration.

The clarification of TS 3.5.1.3 which directs the operator to the appropriate actions if multiple channels become
inoperable, or in the event of an inoperable channel or inoperable function occurring concurrent with one channel
in bypass is considered to be administrative in nature. The change to Note 6 or Table 3.5.1-1 results in the correction
of misleading information and directs the Operator to place the plant in a safe mode depending on the system which is
affected by a failure, and is also considered to be administrative in nature. The Bases changes add additional information
to clarify the specifications.
 
Therefore, this change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of

no significant hazards consideration.

Entergy Operations, Inc., et al., Docket No. 50-416, Grand Gulf Nuclear Station, Unit 1, Claiborne County, Mississippi




Date of amendment request: 

January 13, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

This amendment requests the removal of the interim technical specification limit on the number of spent fuel assemblies
that may be stored in the spent fuel pool at Grand Gulf Nuclear Station. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


1. No significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated results from this
change.

The NRC approved the installation of high density spent fuel storage racks in Amendment 17 to the Grand Gulf Nuclear
Station (GGNS) Operating License. This amendment also brought GGNS into compliance with Standard Review Plan criteria
which required maintaining the spent fuel pool at less than or equal 140
 F. The 140
 F Technical Specifications (TS) limit remains in effect thereby preventing operation at excessive temperatures.

The only outstanding question from Amendment 17, which resulted in a 2324 assembly technical specification limit,
was whether the fuel pool cooling system could handle the heat load of a full fuel pool without excessive reliance on
residual heat removal for extensive fuel pool cooling assist. Entergy Operations' proposed solution to this question
was accepted in the NRC's letter dated July 30, 1992. The NRC accepted the solution pending submittal of results from
tests to verify the specified flows. These results were submitted in a letter dated November 08, 1993.

With previous approval of the installation of the high density spent fuel storage racks, the confirmation of adequate
heat removal capability, and the 140
 F TS temperature limit, removal of the 2324 limit to allow full use of the spent fuel pool would not cause an increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. This change would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

The additional heat load generated by a full spent fuel pool (4348 assemblies) was evaluated. The evaluation concluded
that full use of the spent fuel pool storage spaces would not exceed the temperature limits as are currently in place
with the 2324 limit. The NRC letter dated July 30, 1992 and Entergy Operations letter dated November 08, 1993 resolved
all outstanding heat removal questions. Therefore, this change would not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
 
3. This change would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Entergy Operations demonstrated in their November 01, 1991 letter that the fuel pool temperature could be maintained
at or below 140*F as specified in TS 3/4.7.9. This letter also demonstrated the ability to handle single active failures.
Approval of measures outlined in this letter was provided in a Safety Evaluation Report contained in an NRC letter
dated July 30, 1992.

Given the 140
 F maximum temperature requirement as contained in TS 3/4.7.9 and compliance with single active failure criteria,
this change would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Based on the above evaluation in accordance with 10CFR50l92(c), Entergy Operations, Inc. has concluded that operation
in accordance with the proposed amendment involves no significant hazards considerations.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Florida Power and Light Company, Docket Nos. 50-250 and 50-251, Turkey Point Plant Units 3 and 4, Dade County, Florida





Date of amendment request: 

December 28, 1993 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) for Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 to incorporate
features for steam generator (SG) overfill protection. Specifically, TS Tables 3.3-2, 3.3-3, 4.3-2 and the associated
BASES section would be revised to add SG Water Level-High-High protection logic, instrumentation trip setpoints
and surveillance requirements. The proposed TS changes would be in accordance with NRC Generic Letter (GL) 89-19,
``Safety Implication of Control Systems in LWR Nuclear Power Plants.''


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As a result of the technical resolution of USI A-47, ``Safety Implications of Control Systems in LWR Nuclear Power
Plants,'' the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or the staff) concluded that all Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR)
plants should provide automatic SG overfill protection. On September 20, 1989, the staff issued GL 89-19 and recommended
that plant procedures and TS include provisions for automatic SG overfill protection including surveillance requirements
to assure that automatic overfill protection is available to mitigate main feedwater overfeed events during reactor
power operation. 
The licensee proposed TS changes in response to GL 89-19. No physical changes to the plant would be required as a result
of the proposed license amendments.
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 


(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Including the SG Overfill protection requirements in the Technical Specifications is not assumed in the initiation
of any analyzed event. These amendments will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated since the SG overfill event is not required or assumed for accident mitigation in any Updated Final Safety
Analysis Report (UFSAR) safety analyses that comprise Turkey Point licensing basis. The additional requirements
for the SG overfill system helps ensure that continuous addition of feedwater and carryover of excessive moisture
to the turbine, is prevented. As a result, equipment protection is improved by the availability of this system function.
As such, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not create the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The operation of the facility will not change as a result of the proposed license amendments, since Turkey Point currently
maintains this protection logic. This change involves only the inclusion of the systems requirements into the Technical
Specifications. The proposed change will not impose any new or unique requirements. Therefore, operation of the
facility in accordance with the proposed amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any accident previously evaluated.

(3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety as the function, operation and testing
of the installed SG Overfill protection is not described in the UFSAR. In addition, the SG overfill protection logic
is not required or assumed for accident mitigation in any of the safety analyses that comprise the Turkey Point licensing
basis. The proposed change formalizes the existing design, operating and testing requirements in the Technical
Specifications. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed change would allow a one time extension of the allowable outage time for each residual heat removal (RHR)
pump from 3 to 7 days to allow modifications to the RHR system while the plant is in Mode 1.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 


1. The proposed change to the Technical Specifications does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because the redundant train will remain available to assure
that the RHR will respond to an accident as assumed in the accident analysis. A one time increase in the allowable outage
time from 3 to 7 days has been shown to have only a small effect on the calculated frequency of core damage.

2. The proposed change to the Technical Specifications does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of
accident from any accident previously evaluated because the change only results in a one time increase of the allowable
outage time. It does not result in an operational condition different from that which has already been considered
by the Technical Specifications.

3. The proposed addition to the Technical Specifications does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety
because the effects of increasing the allowed outage time on the calculated core damage frequency has been evaluated
and determined to be small.

Date of amendment requests: 

January 17, 1994


Description of amendment requests: 

The proposed amendments would change Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.1.3 for both units to increase the limit for
control rod misalignment at or below 85% rated thermal power (RTP). The proposed changes would also increase the TS
limit for control rod 8misalignment about 85% RTP if there is sufficient margin in the heat flux (F

Q

(Z)) and the nuclear enthalpy (F

N

delta H

) hot channel factors.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


Per 10 CFR 50.92, a proposed amendment to an operating license will not involve a significant hazards consideration
if the proposed amendment satisfies the following three criteria:

1. Does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed,

2. Does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed or evaluated,
or

3. Does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



Criteria 1 and 3

As seen in Attachment 4 [of the amendment request], sufficient margin exists in power distribution at 85% RTP to allow
for increased misalignment. At 100% RTP, increased misalignment is allowed only if there is adequate margin in the
peaking factors. Therefore, initial conditions remain unchanged from that assumed in the safety analyses. As far
as the dropped rod and rod ejection accidents are concerned, the analyses were performed with conservative assumptions
to envelope the increased misalignment. It should be noted that the power dependent insertion limit for Unit 1 will
be changed in a conservative manner at the beginning of cycle 14. Based on these analyses, it is concluded that the proposed
T/S changes do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of a previously analyzed accident or constitute
a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 

Criterion 2

The proposed T/S changes will not result in physical changes to the plant. Therefore, we believe that the proposed
T/S changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. Also,
operation of the reactor with possible deeper rod insertion will not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve
no significant hazards consideration.

Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, Docket No. 50-220, Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1, Oswego County, New
York 




Date of amendment request: 

January 21, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 4.6.3, (Emergency Power Sources) to eliminate
unnecessary testing of an operable emergency diesel generator (EDG) when the redundant EDG becomes inoperable.
Eliminating unnecessary testing will potentially increase EDG reliability by reducing the stresses caused by such
testing. The licensee stated that this proposed change is consistent with the guidance provided in NUREG-1366, ``Improvements
to Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements,'' and NUREG-1433, ``Improved Standard Technical Specifications,
General Electric Plants.''


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Technical Specification 4.6.3.e requires that the operable diesel-generator be manually started and operated
at rated load for a minimum time of one hour immediately and once per week thereafter in the event any diesel-generator
becomes inoperable.

Niagara Mohawk proposes to revise Technical Specification 4.6.3.e such that if a diesel-generator is declared inoperable
due to preplanned maintenance or testing or due to a support system being inoperable, redundant diesel-generator
testing would not be required. Declaring a diesel-generator inoperable due to preplanned maintenance or testing
or due to a support system being inoperable does not affect the reliability of the operable diesel-generator nor does
it in any way imply that a common cause failure exists.

The normally required Technical Specification surveillance testing schedule demonstrates acceptable reliability
and assures that the operable diesel-generator is capable of performing its intended safety function.

Niagara Mohawk proposes to add wording to Technical Specification 4.6.3.e to permit an operator to evaluate a diesel-generator
failure to determine if a common cause failure exists before requiring testing of the redundant diesel-generator.
As noted above, the intent of the additional diesel-generator testing is, in part, to determine if a common cause failure
exists. Once the potential for a common cause failure has been examined and dismissed, testing beyond the normal surveillance
schedule is excessive and does not contribute to improved diesel-generator reliability. Within eight (8) hours,
the determination that no common cause failure exists is required to be completed or the operable diesel-generator
will be tested. Eight (8) hours is consistent with the guidance provided in NUREG-1366, ``Improvements to Technical
Specifications Surveillance Requirements.''

Technical Specification 4.6.3.e requires that the operable diesel-generator be operated at rated load (i.e., connected
to offsite power) to demonstrate its operability in the event any diesel-generator becomes inoperable. As indicated
in Information Notice 84-69, when a diesel-generator is operated connected to offsite or non-vital loads, the emergency
power system is not independent of disturbances on the non-vital and offsite power systems. Therefore, diesel-generator
availability is potentially lessened by a demonstration of operability requiring connection of the diesel-generator
to offsite power sources. At a time when at least one diesel-generator is already inoperable, this Surveillance Requirement
could add further risk to losing the remaining operable diesel-generator. Therefore, Niagara Mohawk proposes that
Surveillance Requirement 4.6.3.e be changed such that a diesel-generator does not have to be operated at rated load.
These changes will preclude offsite power source disturbances from affecting diesel-generator reliability.

Existing Technical Specification 4.6.3.e requires that the operable diesel-generator be started immediately
in the event a diesel-generator becomes inoperable. The requirement to immediately test a diesel-generator is overly
burdensome when compared to more recent diesel-generator Technical Specification requirements. As previously
discussed, Niagara Mohawk proposes to add wording to Technical Specification 4.6.3.e to give an operator eight (8)
hours to determine whether a common cause failure exists or to test the operable diesel-generator when a diesel-generator
is declared inoperable for a reason other than an inoperable support system or preplanned maintenance or testing.
Eight (8) hours is consistent with the guidance provided in NUREG-1366, ``Improvements to Technical Specifications
Surveillance Requirements.''

Existing Technical Specification 4.6.3.e requires that the operable diesel-generator be tested immediately and
once per week thereafter. Technical Specification 3.6.3.c requires that an inoperable diesel-generator be returned
to an operable condition within seven (7) days to meet the Limiting Condition for Operation. Therefore, the requirement
to test the operable diesel-generator ``once a week thereafter'' is not applicable. In addition, testing the operable
diesel-generator one time is adequate to confirm operability of a diesel-generator. Repetitive testing following
initial confirmation of operability is unwarranted. Therefore, Niagara Mohawk proposes to delete the requirement
to test the operable diesel-generator weekly following the initial test.

Because the proposed change does not affect the design or performance of the diesel-generators nor adversely affect
the reliability of the diesel-generators, the change will not result in an increase in the consequences of an accident
previously evaluated (i.e., Station Blackout analyses). Because this change does not affect the probability of
accident precursors, the proposed change does not affect the probability of an accident previously evaluated.

The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated

The proposed change to Technical Specification 4.6.3.e does not introduce any new operating configurations or new
accident precursors and does not involve any physical alterations to plant configurations which could initiate
a new or different kind of accident. The proposed change does not affect the design or performance characteristics
of the diesel-generators nor does the change create the possibility of the loss of both diesel-generators because
common cause failure assessments will be performed. The change will delete excessive diesel-generator testing
and therefore increase overall plant safety by increasing diesel-generator reliability. Therefore, the proposed
amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety

The proposed change to Technical Specification 4.6.3.e will not reduce the number of emergency power sources required
by Technical Specification Limiting Condition for Operation 3.6.3 or affect the normal surveillance requirements
as described in Technical Specification 4.6.3. The normal surveillance tests demonstrate acceptable reliability
and assure that the operable diesel-generator is capable of performing its intended function. The proposed change
to delete the excessive testing requirements does not affect the design or performance of any diesel-generator and
does not adversely affect diesel-generator reliability. Eliminating unnecessary testing will potentially increase
diesel-generator reliability by reducing the stresses caused by such testing. Therefore, the proposed change does
not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Northern States Power Company, Docket No. 50-263, Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant, Wright County, Minnesota




Date of amendment request: 

November 30, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would change sections 3.2/4.2, Protective Instrumentation, and 3.17/4.17, Control Room
Habitability, by deleting the requirements for a chlorine detection system and revises the limiting conditions
for operation for the Control Room Ventilation System to be more consistent with Standard Technical Specifications.
Due to design changes at the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant, chlorine is no longer stored onsite as a liquified
gas and regulations requiring early warning of an onsite chlorine release do not apply.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




1. Concerning Deletion of Requirements for the Chlorine Detection System

The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

Postulated chemical releases of chlorine have been shown to be such that incapacitation of the control room operators
would not occur within allowed time frames for the donning of protective breathing equipment, or that the probability
of a chlorine trucking transportation accident which causes incapacitation of control room operators with potential
consequences of a radioactive release in excess of 10 CFR 100 guidelines is well below the level of concern as established
in regulatory guidance. Therefore, this amendment will not cause a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated for the Monticello plant.

The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
analyzed.

The performance of a new toxic chemical analysis for the Monticello site has demonstrated that human detection may
be relied upon to detect chlorine toxic chemical releases. Operator protection is established via the donning of
protective breathing equipment. The capability to manually isolate the control room with dampers is retained. The
ability of the operators to cope with a chlorine toxic gas hazard remains consistent with the protection measures
available for other toxic chemicals stored onsite, stored in the vicinity of the site, or transported near the plant
site. The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. 

The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The performance of a new toxic chemical analysis for the Monticello site has demonstrated that incapacitation of
the control room operators would not occur within allowed time frames for the donning of protective breathing equipment
and that a postulated hazardous chemical release due to a trucking transportation accident involving chlorine is
of a sufficiently low probability of occurrence that it need not be considered. The basis of the chlorine detectors
and associated Technical Specifications is to provide protection against an accident scenario which has been demonstrated
to be of extremely low probability (a trucking transportation accident involving chlorine within five miles of the
plant), therefore removal of the chlorine detectors from the plant design and the associated Technical Specifications
will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

2. Concerning the Limiting Conditions for Operation for the Control Room Ventilation System and Technical Specification
Bases

The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

The Control Room Ventilation system ensures that Main Control Room habitability is maintained such that personnel
and equipment located in the control room can respond to mitigate the consequences of an accident. The system does
not contribute to the probability of occurrence of any design basis accident. The operability requirements as proposed
for the revised specification 3.17.A ensure that the Control Room Ventilation system is operable during plant conditions
for which significant radioactive releases are postulated consistent with the Standard Technical Specification.
The proposed changes ensure the Control Room Ventilation system is restored to an operable status or that actions
are taken to minimize the importance of the system function within time frames which take into consideration the low
probability of an event occurring which would require Control Room Ventilation system function. Therefore, this
amendment will not cause a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated
for the Monticello plant.

The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
analyzed.

The proposed changes to Technical Specifications 3.17.A do not alter the function of the Control Room Ventilation
system or its interrelationships with other systems. The proposed changes provide requirements to ensure the Control
Room Ventilation system is capable of performing its required function or that actions are taken to minimize the potential
for its function being required consistent with regulatory guidance; therefore, this amendment will not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed.

The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The operability requirements as proposed for the revised specification 3.17.A ensure that the Control Room Ventilation
system is operable during plant conditions for which significant radioactive releases are postulated. The performance
of a new toxic chemical analysis for the Monticello site has demonstrated that a postulated hazardous chemical release
due to a trucking transportation accident involving chlorine is of a sufficiently low probability of occurrence
that it need not be considered. As the basis of the chlorine detectors and current operability requirements for the
control Room Ventilation system is to provide protection against an accident scenario which has been demonstrated
to be of extremely low probability, the proposed revision to the Control Room Ventilation operability requirements
will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed changes to Technical Specification 3.17.A ensure that both trains of the Control Room Ventilation system
are restored to an operable status within a time frame which takes into consideration the low probability of an event
occurring requiring Control Room Ventilation system function, the availability of the redundant Control Room Ventilation
train and the capability of the safety related Emergency Filtration Train to pressurize the control room without
the Control Room Ventilation system. The proposed changes provide requirements to ensure the Control Room Ventilation
system is capable of performing its required function or that actions are taken to minimize the potential for its function
to be required consistent with regulatory guidance; therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant
reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

January 3, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the requirements of Technical Specification 4.6.E.1.a, which currently specifies
that a minimum of seven safety/relief valves shall be bench checked or replaced with a bench checked valve each refueling
outage. The proposed amendment would change this specification to require the valves to be tested in accordance with
the Section XI Inservice Testing Requirements of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The proposed change is
consistent with the Improved Standard Technical Specifications, NUREG-1433.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




a. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

The proposed amendment is limited to changes to the surveillance testing requirements (bench checking or replacement)
applicable to the main steam system safety/relief valves. This surveillance requirement is performed while the
plant is in a cold shutdown condition at a time when the safety/relief valves are not required to be operable. The performance
of this evolution is not an input or consideration in any accident previously evaluated, thus the proposed change
will not increase the probability of any such accident occurring. Current safety analyses conclude that the pressure
relief capabilities of the Safety Relief valves are adequate assuming that one of the eight safety/relief valves
fails to open upon demand. The proposed change will not adversely affect the reliability of the valves and will therefore
not reduce the conservatism of this assumption.

Similarly, the proposed amendment specifies testing requirements consistent with accepted industry codes and
regulatory guidance to provide assurance that the valves will function as designed. The amendment will not diminish
the capability of the safety/relief valves to perform as required during any accident previously evaluated and will
therefore not increase the consequences of any such accident.

b. The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
analyzed.

The proposed amendment does not involve any modification to plant equipment or operating procedures, nor will it
introduce any new safety/relief valve failure modes that have not been previously considered. The net result of the
proposed amendment will be to allow the plant staff the option of decreasing the frequency of safety/relief valve
testing to a level that has been acknowledged as acceptable by the ASME Code and NUREG-1433. We therefore conclude
the proposed changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
analyzed.

c. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed amendment does not involve a decrease in the number or capacity of safety/relief valves that are provided
in the system, nor does it involve any change in safety/relief valve setpoints, operability requirements, or limiting
conditions for operation. Based on these considerations, we conclude the proposed amendment will not involve a significant
reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

January 4, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would change Technical Specifications section 3.11, Reactor Fuel Assemblies, by removing
information concerning the analytical method to determine average planar linear heat generation rate (APLHGR)
and providing reference to the presentation of the information in the Core Operating Limits Report. In addition,
this proposed amendment would change section 6.7, Reporting Requirements, by revising the listing of approved analytical
methods for developing the Core Operating Limits Report, and it would revise the Technical Specification Bases for
section 3.11 concerning the calculation methodology for MCPR [minimum critical power ratio]. The proposed change
to specification 3.11.A would eliminate the duplication of requirements specified in specification 6.7.A.7 and
the Core Operating Limits Report for establishing APLHGR limits. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

The APLHGR limits originate from and are associated with LOCA [loss-of-coolant accident] analyses. Standard exposure
dependent APLHGR limits are generated from LOCA analyses initiated from rated power and flow conditions. For any
allowable off power and off flow condition the APLHGR limit is the smaller of the flow dependent or power dependent
limit. These limits are also used in the fuel thermal-mechanical analysis and transient analysis. Flow dependent
APLHGR requirements will continue to be established based on analysis and fuel type specific limits determined using
NRC approved methodologies to ensure that peak transient average planar heat generation rate during these events
is not increased above the fuel design basis values. Power dependent APLHGR limits will continue to be established
based on analysis and fuel type specific limits determined using NRC approved methodologies to ensure that peak transient
average planar heat generation rate during any transient is not increased above the rated fuel design basis transient
values. The proposed amendment establishes appropriate controls to ensure that the APLHGR limits will continue
to be determined and established using NRC approved methodology; therefore, this amendment will not cause a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated for the Monticello plant.

The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
analyzed.

The proposed amendment does not involve any modifications to plant equipment or operating procedures, nor will it
introduce any new failure modes. The proposed amendment ensures that cycle specific APLHGR limits are determined
and established using approved methodologies and will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.

The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed amendment removes duplication which exists in the Monticello Technical Specification for the identification
of the approved analytical methods for establishing the APLHGR core operating limit. In addition the proposed amendment
adds the NRC approved Siemens' analytical method for the determination of APLHGR limits based on LOCA/ECCS [emergency
core cooling system] analyses. Inclusion of the NRC approved Siemens' analytical method ensures proper coordination
of the methodology employed to establish the APLHGR limiting condition for operation for each type of fuel as a function
of axial location and average planar exposure. APLHGR limits will continue to be determined using NRC approved methodology
as established in specification 6.7.A.7.b. The established APLHGR limits will be verified to be consistent with
the accident analysis contained in the Monticello Updated Safety Analysis Report. The proposed amendment will not
involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendments request: 

September 21, 1992, as revised December 29, 1992, and November 24, 1993 


Description of amendments requests: 

The proposed amendments would change various Technical Specification (TS) sections and associated Bases for surveillance
test intervals and allowed outage times for the engineered safety features and reactor protection system instrumentation
consistent with the NRC Staff position as documented in NRC letters to the Westinghouse Owners Group.
The proposed license amendment request also updates operation modes to be consistent with Westinghouse Standard
Technical Specification operational modes and also includes several editorial changes to the Prairie Island TS
that are unrelated to the changes described above.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:





1. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

The determination that the results of the proposed change are within all acceptable criteria have been established
in the SERs prepared for WCAP-10271, WCAP-10271 Supplement 1, WCAP-10271 Supplement 2 and WCAP-10271 Supplement
2, Revision 1 issued by References 1, 2, and 5 [of the November 24, 1993, application]. Implementation of the proposed
changes is expected to result in an acceptable increase in total Reactor Protection and Engineered Safety Features
Systems yearly unavailability. This increase, which is primarily due to less frequent surveillance, results in
a[n] increase of similar magnitude in the probability of an Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS) and in the
probability of core melt resulting from an ATWS and also results in a small increase in core damage frequency (CD) due
to Engineered Safety Features unavailability.
 
Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in a significant reduction in the probability of core
melt from inadvertent reactor trips. This is a result of a reduction in the number of inadvertent reactor trips (0.5
fewer inadvertent reactor trips per unit per year) occurring during testing of Reactor Protection System instrumentation.
This reduction is primarily attributable to less frequent surveillance.

The reduction in inadvertent core melt frequency is sufficiently large to counter the increase in ATWS core melt probability
resulting in an overall reduction in total core melt probability.
 
The values determined by the Westinghouse Owners Group and presented in the WCAP for the increase in core damage frequency
were verified by Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) as part of an audit and sensitivity analyses for the NRC Staff.
Based on the small value of the increase compared to the range of uncertainty in the core damage frequency, the increase
is considered acceptable.

The changes of an editorial nature, including the change to Standard Technical Specification format for the instrumentation
Technical Specifications and mode definitions, have no impact on the severity or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

The proposed changes do not result in an increase in the severity or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
Implementation of the proposed changes affects the probability of failure of the Reactor Protection System and Engineered
Safety Features but does not alter the manner in which protection is afforded nor the manner in which limiting criteria
are established.

2. The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
analyzed.

The proposed changes do not involve hardware changes and do not result in a change in the manner in which the Reactor
Protection System and Engineered Safety Features provide plant protection. No change is being made which alters
the functioning of the Reactor Protection System or Engineered Safety Features. Rather the likelihood or probability
of the Reactor Protection System or Engineered Safety Features functioning properly is affected as described above.
Therefore the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.

The changes of an editorial nature, including the change to Standard Technical Specification format for the instrumentation
Technical Specifications and mode definitions does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any previously evaluated.

. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed changes do not alter the manner in which safety limits, limiting safety system setpoints or limiting
conditions for operation are determined. The impact of reduced testing other than as addressed above is to allow a
longer time interval over which instrument uncertainties (e.g., drift) may act. Experience has shown that the initial
uncertainty assumptions are valid for reduced testing.

Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in an overall improvement in safety by:

a. Less frequent testing will result in less inadvertent reactor trips and actuation of Engineered Safety Features
components.

b. Higher quality repairs leading to improved equipment reliability due to longer repair times. 
c. Improvements in the effectiveness of the operating staff in monitoring and controlling plant operation. This
is due to less frequent distraction of the operator and shift supervisor to attend to instrumentation testing.

The changes of an editorial nature, including the change to Standard Technical Specification format for the instrumentation
Technical Specifications and mode definitions [do] not lead to a reduction in any margin of safety.

Unit No. 1, Washington County, Nebraska




Date of amendment request: 

December 28, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment to the Technical Specifications would revise the surveillance test frequency from monthly
to quarterly for several channel functional tests for Reactor Protective System and Engineered Safety Feature Instrumentation
and Controls based on Generic Letter 93-05.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



The proposed change does not involve significant hazards considerations because operation of Fort Calhoun Station
Unit (FCS) No. 1 in accordance with this change would not:

(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Increasing the surveillance test interval (STI) from monthly to quarterly for the Reactor Protective System (RPS)
and Engineered Safety Features Actuation System (ESFAS) instrumentation has two principal effects with opposing
impacts on core melt risk. The first impact is a slight increase in core melt frequency that results from the increased
unavailability of the instrumentation in question. The unavailability of the tested instrumentation 
components is translated to result in a failure of the reactor to trip, an Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS),
or a failure of the appropriate engineered safety features to actuate when required. The opposing impact on core melt
risk is the corresponding reduction in core melt frequency that would result due to the reduced exposure of the plant
to test-induced transients. This results in a net decrease in core melt frequency of approximately 4.1x10

-8

 per year.

Representative fault tree models were developed for FCS and the corresponding changes in core melt frequency were
quantified in evaluations CEN-327-A and CEN-327-A, Supplement 1. The NRC issued a Safety Evaluation Report (SER)
which found that these evaluations were acceptable for justifying the extensions in the STIs for the RPS and ESFAS
from 30 days to 90 days and that the RPS unavailabilities resulting from extending the STIs were not considered to be
significant. Estimates of the reduction in scram frequency from the reduction in test-induced scrams and the corresponding
reduction in core melt frequency were found acceptable. STIs of 90 days were found to result in a net reduction in core
melt risk.

A plant specific calculation/setpoint drift analysis was conducted, as required by the NRC SER, that analyzed the
effect on instrument drift of extending the RPS and ESF instrumentation and controls functional STI from monthly
to quarterly. The results demonstrated that the observed changes in instrument uncertainties for the extended STI
do not exceed the current 30-day setpoint assumptions. Therefore, it is unnecessary to change any setpoints to accommodate
the proposed extended STI.

Operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change, therefore, will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change does not involve any changes in equipment and will not alter the manner in which the plant will be
operated. RPS and ESFAS setpoints will not be changed as the instrument uncertainties resulting from the proposed
STI (calculated using actual plant data) are less than the instrument uncertainties assumed for 30 days. Thus, this
proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

There are no changes to the equipment or plant operations. RPS and ESFAS setpoints will not be changed as the instrument
uncertainties resulting from the proposed STI (calculated using actual plant data) are less that the instrument
uncertainties assumed for 30 days.

Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in an overall improvement in plant safety due to the fact
that reduced testing intervals will result in fewer inadvertent reactor trips and less frequent actuation of ESFAS
components. The conclusions of the accident analyses in the FCS Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) remain valid
and the safety limits continue to be met. Thus, this proposed change does not reduce a margin of safety. 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Power Authority of the State of New York, Docket No. 50-333, James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego County,
New York




Date of amendment request: 

December 28, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment to the James A. FitzPatrick Technical Specifications (TSs) clarifies Limiting Condition
for Operation (LCO) 3.5.D.4. Amendment No. 179 to the TS added LCO 3.5.D.4 to permit hydrostatic and leakage testing
at temperatures up to 300
 F without requiring certain equipment, including the automatic depressurization system (ADS), to be operable.
However, LCO 3.5.D.4 can be mistakenly interpreted to require the ADS be operable at temperatures less than 212
 F. Requiring the ADS to be operable during hydrostatic and leakage testing with temperatures below 212
 F was clearly not the intent of Amendment No. 179. The proposed change will clarify LCO 3.5.D.4 to resolve this
concern. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment would not involve a significant hazards
consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not:

1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The plant accident analyses are not affected by the proposed Technical Specification change. Prior to implementation
of Amendment 179, hydrostatic and leakage testing of the RCS was performed with reactor coolant temperatures below
212
 F while the ADS was inoperable. Amendment 179 revised the Technical Specifications in anticipation of increased
pressure temperature limits requiring hydrostatic and leakage testing at or above 212
 F. Requiring the ADS to be operable during hydrostatic or leakage testing with temperatures below 212
 F was clearly not the intent of Amendment 179. The change will not increase the probability or consequences of
previously evaluated accidents.

2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated.

The proposed change involves no modifications to hardware, analyses, operations or procedures. The change clarifies
LCO 3.5.D.4 to allow hydrostatic and leakage testing of the RCS below 300
 F without requiring the ADS to be operable. The change is administrative in nature since it only clarifies the
intent of the Technical Specifications as agreed to with the NRC and cannot create a new or different kind of accident.

3. involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed change will not affect any plant safety margins. The existing plant accident analyses are not affected
by the proposed change. This revision of LCO 3.5.D.4 is intended to clarify that the ADS is not required to be operable
during hydrostatic or leakage testing of the RCS. This position is substantiated by the NRC safety evaluation for
Amendment 179 which acknowledges that hydrostatic and leakage testing can not be performed without making the ADS,
and other systems, inoperable. 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

New York




Date of amendment request: 

January 31, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment to the James A. FitzPatrick Technical Specifications would revise the limiting conditions
for operation (LCO), surveillance requirements, and Bases section for the main condenser steam jet air ejectors
(SJAE). The proposed changes correct a typographical error, clarify the modes of operation during which the SJAE
LCOs and surveillance requirements are applicable, revise the action required upon entering a SJAE LCO, and establish
a threshold level below which there will be no requirement to perform grab samples and isotopic analyses of SJAE effluent.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment would not involve a significant hazards
consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not:

1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed amendment revision involves no hardware changes, no changes to the operation of any systems or components
and no changes to structures. The changes clarify the Technical Specifications by specifying the modes of operation
during which the LCOs and Surveillance Requirements of Specification 3.5 are applicable. The changes also include
specific guidance for the operators to prevent or minimize the release of radioactive gases to the environment. These
changes can not cause an increase in the probability of, nor alter the consequences of, an accident previously evaluated.

The establishment of a threshold below which grab samples are not required will alter procedures by allowing SJAE
operation without grab samples to determine effluent content at low levels of radioactivity (i.e., less than 5,000
micro Ci/sec). This will not affect the monitoring system's ability to detect, alarm, and isolate the offgas system
if the concentration of radioactive material in the effluence reaches the appropriate setpoint.

The surveillance requirement for taking a grab sample after a greater than 50% increase in release rate is intended
to assist operators in determining if there is any increase in fuel failure during steady state operations. This would
assure that routine operational limits are maintained. The grab samples do not provide any automatic protective
function (e.g., MSIV [main steam isolation valve] or Offgas System isolation) for mitigating an accident but provide
radionuclide concentration data.

The performance of SJAE effluent grab samples is not credited towards detecting nor mitigating any design basis accidents
since spontaneous fuel failure is not a FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report] accident initiator but a consequence
of an accident. Therefore, the use of a 5,000 micro Ci/sec threshold, which is approximately 1% of the trip setpoint,
would not alter the consequences or probabilities of established accident scenarios.

2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated.

The proposed changes provide improved clarity concerning applicability of the specifications and specific guidance
for preventing/mitigating the release of radioactive gases to the environment. The proposed changes also provide
guidance for limiting the number of unnecessary grab samples.

These changes do not affect the manner in which the main condenser steam jet air ejector is operated. The proposed changes
to the Technical Specifications reflect either established plant practice (i.e., applicable modes or mitigation
procedures) or new surveillance guidelines to minimize unnecessary grab samples. In all cases, the proposed changes
have no affect on any parameters which would be considered or used in an accident analysis. The changes, therefore,
do not pose a safety issue different from those analyzed previously for the FSAR.

3. involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications will not alter the intent of the surveillance requirement to
monitor for the possibility of fuel failure. Considering the difference between the proposed threshold value and
the current alarm setpoint, a reduction in grab samples during plant operation with low concentrations of radioactivity
in the primary coolant will not affect any plant safety margins.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Power Authority of the State of New York, Docket No. 50-333, James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego County,
New York




Date of amendment request: 

January 31, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment to the James A. FitzPatrick Technical Specifications would revise Specification 3.8 to adopt
the Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) of Section 3/4.7.6, ``Sealed Source Contamination,'' as stated in NUREG-0123,
``Standard Technical Specifications for General Electric Boiling Water Reactors (BWR/5)'' (STS). In addition,
the proposed change reformats Specifications 3.8 and 4.8 to make them consistent with the remainder of the FitzPatrick
Technical Specifications.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant hazards
consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not:

1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Adopting the LCO described in the ``Sealed Source Contamination'' section of NUREG-0123 (STS) does not increase
the probability or the consequences of an accident or malfunction of a safety-related structure, system, or component
previously reviewed in the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report]. The proposed changes do not increase the probability
of causing, either directly or indirectly an uncontrolled release of significant amounts of radiation. Deleting
10 CFR 30.71 as the basis for exempting sealed sources for the leak testing requirements removes a requirement that
is redundant to other federal regulations requirements. The proposed changes to reformat Specifications 3.8 and
4.8 are administrative in nature and do not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated
in the FSAR. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.

2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes do not alter the radioactive materials controls established at the restricted area boundaries
and do not increase the amount of radioactive materials on site. There are no modifications to safety systems as a result
of the proposed changes. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of
accident from any accident previously evaluated in the FSAR.

3. involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Adopting the wording of the STS regarding the sealed sources limiting conditions for operations will not reduce the
ability of the operators to detect a leaking sealed radioactive source. Established radiological controls (i.e.,
handling techniques and good health physics practices) implemented through plant procedures will ensure that the
sealed sources will continue to be tested as required by the Technical Specifications and applicable regulations.
The proposed changes do not alter the radioactive materials controls established at the restricted area boundary
and do not increase the amount of radioactive materials on site. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. 
Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Docket No. 50-312, Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station, Sacramento
County, California




Date of amendment request: 

December 9, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would change the Rancho Seco Permanently Defueled Technical Specifications (PDTS) to implement
and ensure consistency with the revisions in 10 CFR Part 20.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



A significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the SAR (Safety
Analysis Report) will not be created, because the proposed changes are editorial in nature, are designed to implement
the 10 CFR Part 20 regulations, and have no affect on any accidents evaluated in the Rancho Seco Defueled Safety Analysis
Report (DSAR), i.e., the dropped fuel assembly accident, the loss of offsite power condition, or a radwaste tank rupture.

PA-187 (Proposed Amendment) will not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident evaluated in the
SAR, because the changes are editorial in nature, implement the new 10 CFR Part 20 radiation protection regulations,
and do not provide any new mechanisms by which an accident can occur.

The proposed PDTS amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety, because the District
will continue to maintain the appropriate radiation protection controls, through implementation of the new 10 CFR
Part 20 regulations, that are necessary to ensure Rancho Seco continues to be operated safely from a personnel radiation
exposure standpoint during the Permanently Defueled Mode.



The NRC staff has reviewed the analysis of the licensee and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards
of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no
significant hazards consideration.

Tennessee Valley Authority, Docket No. 50-328, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Unit 2, Hamilton County, Tennessee




Date of amendment request: 

February 8, 1994 (TS 94-02) 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed change would revise Operating License Condition 2.C.(17) to temporarily extend the surveillance interval
for certain specified instruments from the normal 18-month interval to a maximum of 28 months for 18-month surveillances
and 46 months for the 3-year Containment fire hose hydrostatic surveillance test in order to prevent exceeding the
allowable testing frequency prior to the refueling outage that has been rescheduled to start in July 1994. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determined that it does not represent
a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear
Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change is temporary and allows a one-time extension of specific surveillance requirements (SRs) for
Cycle 6 to allow surveillance testing to coincide with the sixth refueling outage. The proposed surveillance interval
extension is short and will not cause a significant reduction in system reliability nor affect the ability of the systems
to perform their design function. Current monitoring of plant conditions and continuation of the surveillance testing
required during normal plant operation will continue to be performed to ensure conformance with TS operability requirements.
Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

Extending the surveillance interval for the performance of specific testing will not create the possibility of any
new or different kind of accidents. No changes are required to any system configurations, plant equipment, or analyses.
Therefore, this change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Surveillance interval extensions will not impact any plant safety analyses since the assumptions used will remain
unchanged. The safety limits assumed in the accident analyses and the design function of the equipment required to
mitigate the consequences of any postulated accidents will not be changed since only the surveillance test interval
is being extended. Historical performance generally indicates a high degree of reliability, and surveillance testing
performed during normal plant operation will continue to be performed to verify proper performance. Therefore,
the plant will be maintained within the analyzed limits, and the proposed extension will not significantly reduce
the margin of safety. 



The NRC has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards
consideration.

used to meet 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R (Fire Protection) requirements and specifies a new special report requirement
for TS 6.9.2.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below, indicating that the proposed changes would:



1a. Not involve a significant increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated because none of the
proposed changes are associated with the initiation of any design bases accident. The addition of Limiting Condition
for Operation (LCO) 3.3.3.5.2 and Surveillance Requirement (SR) 4.3.3.5.2 to the Technical Specifications will
require each control circuit and transfer switch that is required for a serious control room or cable spreading room
fire to be operable during Modes 1, 2 and 3 and to be verified at least once per 18 months as capable of performing the intended
function. New Action b will require restoration of an inoperable control circuit or transfer switch (required for
a serious control room or cable spreading room fire) within 30 days or a Special Report submitted to the NRC pursuant
to Specification 6.9.2 within the next 30 days. Surveillance testing procedures will be prepared, reviewed and approved
in accordance with Technical Specification (TS) 6.5.3, Technical Review and Control, which will ensure an unreviewed
safety question is not created. To support the addition of the new LCO, Action and SR, the existing LCO, Action and SR
are proposed to be administratively re-numbered or re-lettered. The new Special Report requirement is proposed
to be administratively added to TS 6.9.2.

1b. Not involve a significant increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated because no equipment,
accident conditions, or assumptions are affected which could lead to significant increases in radiological consequences.
The addition of LCO 3.3.3.5.2 and SR 4.3.3.5.2 to the Technical Specifications will require each control circuit
and transfer switch that is required for a serious control room or cable spreading room fire to be operable during Modes
1, 2 and 3 and to be verified at least once per 18 months as capable of performing the intended function. New Action b will
require restoration of an inoperable control circuit or transfer switch (required for a serious control room or cable
spreading room fire) within 30 days or a Special Report submitted to the NRC pursuant to Specification 6.9.2 within
the next 30 days. Surveillance testing procedures will be prepared, reviewed and approved in accordance with Technical
Specification (TS) 6.5.3, which will ensure an unreviewed safety question is not created. To support the addition
of a new LCO, Action and SR, the existing LCO, Action and SR are proposed to be administratively re-numbered or re-lettered.
The new Special Report requirement is proposed to be administratively added to TS 6.9.2.

2a. Not create the possibility of a new kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because no new accident
initiators are introduced by the proposed changes. The addition of LCO 3.3.3.5.2 and SR 4.3.3.5.2 to the Technical
Specifications will require each control circuit and transfer switch that is required for a serious control room
or cable spreading room fire to be operable during Modes 1, 2 and 3 and to be verified at least once per 18 months as capable
of performing the intended function. New Action b will require restoration of an inoperable control circuit or transfer
switch (required for a serious control room or cable spreading room fire) within 30 days or a Special Report submitted
to the NRC pursuant to Specification 6.9.2 within the next 30 days. Surveillance testing procedures will be prepared,
reviewed and approved in accordance with TS 6.5.3, which will ensure an unreviewed safety question is not created.
To support the addition of the new LCO, Action and SR, the existing LCO, Action and SR are proposed to be administratively
re-numbered or re-lettered. The new Special Report requirement is proposed to be administratively added to TS 6.9.2.

2b. Not create the possibility of a different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because no different
accident initiators are introduced by the proposed changes. The addition of LCO 3.3.3.5.2 and SR 4.3.3.5.2 to the
Technical Specifications will require each control circuit and transfer switch that is required for a serious control
room or cable spreading room fire to be operable during Modes 1, 2, and 3 and to be verified at least once per 18 months
as capable of performing the intended function. New Action b will require restoration of an inoperable control circuit
or transfer switch (required for a serious control room or cable spreading room fire) within 30 days or a Special Report
submitted to the NRC pursuant to Specification 6.9.2 within the next 30 days. Surveillance testing procedures will
be prepared, reviewed and approved in accordance with TS 6.5.3, which will ensure an unreviewed safety question is
not created. To support the addition of the new LCO, Action and SR, the existing LCO, Action and SR are proposed to be

Union Electric Company, Docket No. 50-483, Callaway Plant, Unit 1, Callaway County, Missouri




Date of amendment request: 

September 24, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specifications to extend the reporting period of the Semiannual Radioactive
Effluent Release Report from semiannually to annually. Additionally, the report submission date would change from
60 days after January 1 and July 1 of each year to before May 1 of each year. The changes to the reporting period and report
date are being made to implement the August 31, 1992, amendment to 10 CFR 50.36a. The affected Technical Specifications
Sections are 1.18, 3.11.1.4, 3.11.2.6, 6.9.1.7, 6.14c, and the Index.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


The proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration because operation of Callaway Plant with
these changes would not:

(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes do not affect accident initiators or assumptions. The radiological consequences of any accident
previously evaluated remain unchanged.

(2)Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

These changes do not impact any administrative controls nor do they involve physical alterations to the plant with
respect to radioactive effluent. There is no new type of accident or malfunction created and the method and manner
of plant operation will not change.

(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

The margin of safety remains unaffected since no design change is made and plant operation remains the same. The proposed
changes do not affect any safety limits or boundary or system performance.

As discussed above, the proposed changes are strictly administrative in nature and have no affect on plant operations.
They do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated
or create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. These changes do not
result in a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Therefore, it has been determined that the proposed changes
do not involve a significant hazards consideration.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Union Electric Company, Docket No. 50-483, Callaway Plant, Unit 1, Callaway County, Missouri




Date of amendment request: 

October 6, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specifications Section 3.8.3, Electrical Power Systems - Onsite
Power Distribution, to make the limiting conditions for operation for four emergency busses (NG05E, NG06E, NG07,
and NG08) consistent with other technical specifications. The proposed revision would make the allowed outage time
(AOT) for any of these emergency busses 72 hours. This is equivalent to the AOT for one train of the ESW per Technical
Specification 3.7.4 and equivalent to the AOT for one train of the UHS cooling tower per Technical Specification 3.7.5.
This amendment request also proposes an editorial change by removing the number sign (#) before each electrical bus,
battery, and battery charger listed in Technical Specifications Section 3.8.3 in order to clarify the specifications
and make the nomenclature consistent with other sections.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


The proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration because operation of the Callaway Plant
with these changes would not:

(1)Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The implementation of the proposed technical specification changes does not involve any modifications to the physical
plant. Even though the MCCs themselves will have an allowed outage time of 72 hours instead of 8 hours, the operability
requirements of the ESW system itself have not been lessened. The addition of LCs NG07 and NG08 to the technical specifications
and surveillances serves to clarify the 480-volt power supply requirements in the technical specifications. The
proposed changes do not affect accident initiators or assumptions. The radiological consequences of any accident
previously evaluated remain unchanged.

(2)Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

As noted above, the proposed change eliminates inconsistent requirements from the technical specifications, but
overall does not lessen the requirements on ESW system operability imposed by the technical specifications. The
implementation of the proposed technical specification changes do not involve any modifications to the physical
plant or any significant change to the methods of operation of plant systems. The proposed changes do not create any
new accident initiators. 

(3)Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

The requirements of Technical Specification 3.7.4, Plant Systems - Essential Service Water System, provide specific
limiting conditions for operation applicable to the ESW System. In accordance with the definition of operability
contained in the technical specifications, the operability of the ESW MCCs has always been included within these
requirements. The existing technical specification requirements for onsite A.C. power distribution systems are
intended to assure the availability of A.C. power sources supplying multiple safety systems. The NG05E and NG06E
MCCs identified by this proposed change provide power for a single safety system (ESW) and associated equipment.
The use of the 72 hour limit for the ESW MCCs is consistent with the requirements of Regulatory Guide 1.93, ``Availability
of Electrical Power Sources'' and has an insignificant impact on the Callaway Probabilistic Risk Analysis. LCs NG07
and NG08 also only provide power for a single safety system (ESW) and associated equipment (UHS cooling tower). Since
the technical specification requirements relative to the ESW system operability are not lessened by this change,
there will be no reduction in the margin of safety as defined in the basis for the technical specifications.

As discussed, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated or create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated. These changes do not result in a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Therefore, it has been determined
that the proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, Docket No. 50-305, Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant, Kewaunee County, Wisconsin




Date of amendment request: 

February 1, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specifications (TS) by removing
the review of the Emergency Plan and its implementing procedures from the list of responsibilities of the Plant Operations
Review Committee (PORC). Guidance for this change was provided in Generic Letter 93-07, ``Modification of the Technical
Specification Administrative Control Requirements for Emergency and Security Plans,'' dated December 28, 1993.
Several other administrative TS changes are proposed including removing specific titles from the list of PORC members
in TS 6.5.a.2 and deleting TS 6.5.b which describes the Corporate Support Staff. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:



The proposed changes were revised in accordance with the provision of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist.
The proposed changes will not:

1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
The likelihood that an accident will occur is neither increased or decreased by these TS changes. These TS changes
will not impact the function or method of operation of plant equipment. Thus, there is not a significant increase in
the probability of a previously analyzed accident due to these changes. No systems, equipment, or components are
affected by the proposed changes. Thus, the consequences of the malfunction of equipment important to safety previously
evaluated in the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) are not increased by these changes.

The proposed changes are administrative in nature and, therefore, have no impact on accident initiators or plant
equipment, and thus, do not affect the probabilities or consequences of an accident.

2)create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed TS changes would not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes do not involve changes to the physical plant or operations. Since these administrative changes
do not contribute to accident initiation, they do not produce a new accident scenario or produce a new type of equipment
malfunction. Also, these changes do not alter any existing accident scenarios; they do not affect equipment or its
operation, and thus, do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.

3)involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed TS would not involve a significant reduction in a margin
of safety. The proposed changes do not affect the plant equipment or operation. The requirements previously contained
in the TS's that are being deleted are redundant and are contained in other controlled documents. Safety limits and
limiting safety system settings are not affected by these proposed changes.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

<DOCTITLE>Forms Under Review by Office of Management and Budget</DOCTITLE>





Agency Clearance Officer: 

John J. Lane (202) 942-8800.



Upon Written Request Copy Available From: 

Securities and Exchange Commission Office of Filings, Information and Consumer Services, Washington, DC 20549.






Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget the following
requests for extension of previously approved forms and rules under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act).

Form N-6F permits a company that has lost its exclusion from the 1940 Act because it intends to make a public offering
as a business development company, but is not ready to file Form N-54A, to remain exempt from the Act for up to ninety
days. It is estimated that Form N-6F takes .5 hours per response.

Form N-8B-2 is the registration statement form used by unit investment trusts currently issuing securities
to register under the 1940 Act. It is estimated that Form N-8B-2 takes 1,626 hours per response.

Form N-54A is the notification of election to be regulated as a business development company. It is estimated
that Form N-54A takes .5 hours per response.

Form N-54C is used to notify the Commission that a company withdraws its election to be regulated as a business
development company. It is estimated that Form N-54C takes 1 hour per response.

Rule 24f-1 permits certain investment companies which have inadvertent oversales of their shares to register
such shares. The reporting burden under Rule 24f-1 is estimated to be 2 hours per response.

Rule 30a-1 requires every registered investment company to file a semi-annual report with the Commission.
The burden of meeting the requirement of this rule is the burden of filing Form N-SAR, the reporting form prescribed
under the rule. Approval for Form N-SAR has been given separately.

General comments regarding the estimated burden hours should be directed to Gary Waxman at the address below. Any
comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated average burden hours for compliance with Commission rules and
forms should be directed to John J. Lane, Associate Executive Director, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of a Proposed Rule Change
by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to a Modification of the Trading Hours for Amex Biotechnology Index
Options</DOCTITLE>



February 23, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 23, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which items
have been prepared by the Amex. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change
from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Amex proposes to modify the trading hours for options on its Biotechnology Index (``BTK''). The text of the proposed
rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Amex, and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



Currently, Exchange rules generally provide that, except as otherwise indicated or under unusual conditions, the
trading hours for broad-based index option contracts shall be from 9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Four narrow-based index
options (Computer Index, Oil Index, North American Telecommunications Index, and the Pharmaceutical Index) presently
have trading hours of 9:30 a.m. to 4:10 p.m. The BTK, although narrow-based, currently has trading hours identical
to those assigned to the Exchange's broad-based index options. The purpose of the current proposal is to modify the
trading hours for options on the BTK from a 4:15 p.m. New York time close to a 4:10 p.m. New York time close.

The Amex believes that market professionals (including the specialist and market-makers) in BTK options are exposed
to undue risk during the five-minute interval between the closing of equity options at 4:10 p.m. and the closing of
BTK options at 4:15 p.m. Unlike specialists and market-makers in broad-based index options who can hedge their positions
in the index futures market (for which trading terminates at 4:15 p.m. New York time), market-makers in a narrow-based
index option such as BTK are best able to hedge their risks by taking or liquidating positions in options on the individual
securities that comprise that index. However, since trading in equity options terminates on the Amex and on other
option markets at 4:10 p.m. New York time, the Amex believes that Specialists and market-makers in narrow-based index
options (such as BTK options) who are required to maintain a trading market until 4:15 p.m. are unnecessarily exposed
to market risk during the five-minute interval between the closings of equity options and BTK options. The Exchange
also believes that the proposed change will eliminate potential investor confusion by creating uniform trading
hours for all narrow-based indexes on the Exchange as well as with other options markets.






The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of section 6(b)(5) in particular, in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of
trade and prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Amex does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.

<TEXT>
 

(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others 



No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. 



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action 



The Exchange requests that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
of the Act. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and in particular, the requirements
of Section 6(b)(5) thereunder.
 Specifically, the Commission concludes that the proposed rule change promotes just and equitable principles of
trade by creating uniform trading hours for all Amex narrow-based indexes, thereby eliminating the possibility
of investor and market participant confusion. 





The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change proposal prior to the thirtieth day after the
date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register 

so that the change in trading hours can become effective as soon as possible, allowing the Amex to implement uniform
trading hours for all Amex narrow-based indexes.
 





IV. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested person are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-93-43
and should be submitted by March 23, 1994. 



It is therefore ordered, 

Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-Amex-93-43) is approved.

 




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change
Relating to Audit Trail Account Identification Codes</DOCTITLE>



February 23, 1994.



On December 17, 1991, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to introduce new account identification codes to indicate orders for the account of a competing
dealer for audit trail reporting purposes.






The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30142 (January 2, 1992),
57 FR 728 (January 8, 1992). No comments were received on the proposal.






NYSE Rule 132 presently requires that clearing member firms submitting a transaction to comparison must include
certain audit trail data elements, including a specification of the account type for which the transaction was effected
according to defined account categories.
 Under NYSE Rule 132, the NYSE has established account identification codes which differentiate trades executed
for customers from trades executed for the proprietary account of a member/member organization
 and trades executed by a member/member organization as agent for another member/member organization.
 The new indicators being approved herein will identify transactions effected for the account of a competing dealer.







New indicators of O, T, and R will denote that a transaction was effected for the account of a competing dealer. The identifier
``0'' denotes a proprietary order for the account of a competing dealer. The identifier ``T'' denotes an order where
one member is acting as an agent for another member's competing dealer account. Finally, the identifier ``R'' denotes
an order for the account of a non-member competing dealer.
 In addition, the rule change adds the following definitions:




Competing Dealer: a specialist or market-maker registered as such on a registered stock exchange (other than the
NYSE), or market-maker bidding and offering over-the-counter, in a New York Stock Exchange-traded security.

Proprietary, Competing Dealer: a member or member organization trading for its own competing dealer account.

As Agent for Other Member, Competing Dealer: a member or member organization trading as agent for another member's
competing dealer account.




The Exchange states that the new account categories for order identification will enhance the efficiency and accuracy
of audit trail information. Furthermore, the NYSE believes that the identifiers will improve the Exchange's ability
to assess the extent of activity by competing dealers and market makers in NYSE-listed securities and the impact of
this activity on the NYSE market.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of section 6(b) of the Act.
 Specifically, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public.





The Commission believes that the proposed identification codes should prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
by improving the accuracy and efficiency of audit trail information used for surveillance purposes. Specifically,
the Commission believes that the new, more precise identifier codes should facilitate surveillance investigations
by clearly and more specifically demarcating competing dealers proprietary trading. In addition, more accurate
audit trail information should increase the effectiveness of the Exchange's automated surveillance procedures
and provide Exchange staff with a more comprehensive reconstruction of trading activity. In summary, we believe
the proposed identifier codes should permit the NYSE to perform its surveillance responsibilities more thoroughly
and therefore, for this sole reason, find the proposal consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act.

The Commission notes that the approval of this proposal is limited solely to establishing competing dealer identifier
codes for audit trail and surveillance purposes.
 The proposal does not limit or restrict the activity of competing dealers or their access to the NYSE. Thus, any competitive
burden on competing dealers would be minimal and outweighed by the surveillance benefits to be obtained by the NYSE.









It is therefore ordered, 

Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 
 that the proposed rule change (SR-NYSE-91-46) is approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change
and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change Relating to
Listing Standards for Non-U.S. Companies</DOCTITLE>



February 23, 1994.
 


I. Introduction



On December 16, 1993, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'')

1

 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,

2

 a proposed rule change to permit non-U.S. issuers to distribute summary annual reports to U.S. holders of NYSE-listed
foreign securities and American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) (``U.S. Holders'') under certain circumstances.

3

 On February 15, 1994, the NYSE submitted Amendment No. 1 to the rule filing.

4

 








The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33400 (December 29, 1993),
59 FR 642 (January 5, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.



II. Description of the Proposal



Current NYSE policy requires all listed companies to submit to shareholders an annual report with financial information
as detailed in Paragraph 203.01 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. The Exchange is modifying its annual report requirements
to allow U.S. Holders to receive summary annual reports if it is the practice in the home country of the foreign issuer
and certain other conditions are met. The following is the text of the rule, with italics representing the language
added:

103.00 Non-U.S. Companies 



* * * * * 



Where it appears to the Exchange that a non-U.S. Company's interim earnings reporting or corporate governance practices
are not prohibited by the law in the country in which it is domiciled, such practices need not necessarily be barriers
to listing or continued listing. 

In addition, the Exchange will permit non-U.S. issuers to follow home-country practices regarding the distribution
of annual reports to shareholders, if, at a minimum, (a) shareholders are provided at least summary annual reports,
including summary financial information, (b) shareholders have the ability, upon request, to receive an annual
report that complies with the requirements of Para. 203.01 (a ``full annual report''), and (c) the financial information
contained in the summary annual report is reconciled to U.S. generally-accepted accounting principles to the extent
that such reconciliation would be required in the full annual report.





The rule change is, in part, in response to an amendment, adopted in 1990, to the U.K. Companies Act that permits issuers
listed on the London Stock Exchange to provide holders of their ordinary shares a choice to receive a full annual report
or a summary annual report.
 Certain U.K. issuers sought permission from the NYSE to provide holders of ADRs with summary reports in place of full
annual reports if the shareholders do not object. 





The NYSE rule is formulated to permit foreign issuers to distribute summary annual reports consistent with the practices
of their home countries. The rule does not attempt to specify particular financial requirements.
 Instead, the Exchange will review specific proposals to ensure that U.S. Holders receive adequate information.
 






The rule also does not mandate any specific method for providing U.S. Holders with summary annual reports. As with
the substantive requirements, the NYSE proposal recognizes that foreign countries will develop their own procedures
for issuers to provide summary reports in lieu of full annual reports. The Exchange, however, has indicated that it
will review all proposed programs to ensure that U.S. Holders have reasonable access to the full annual report and
receive full disclosure of their option to receive the full report.






III. Discussion 



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change to permit non-U.S. issuers to distribute summary annual reports
to U.S. Holders according to the home country practice of the foreign issuer is consistent with the requirements of
the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular,
with the requirements of section 6(b) of the Act.
 Specifically, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest, in that it accommodates foreign practices while
ensuring that U.S. shareholders of foreign securities and holders of ADRs continue to receive adequate information
concerning the companies in which they invest. 





As the securities markets of the world become increasingly interconnected, it is inevitable that application of
certain exchange rules conflict with customs and market practices in other jurisdictions.
 The Commission believes that the NYSE's rule reflects an appropriate balance between the need to protect U.S. investors
and the costs associated with requiring non-U.S. companies to provide U.S. investors with full annual reports while
the companies home country law permits summary reports to foreign investors. Accordingly, for the reasons discussed
in more detail below, we believe it is appropriate, in this limited situation pursuant to the conditions set forth
in NYSE Rule 103.00, to allow foreign issuers to comply with their home country practices for the distribution of annual
reports to U.S. Holders.

First, the rule sets forth certain minimum requirements before summary reports can be used, including that financial
information contained in the summary annual report be reconciled to U.S. generally-accepted accounting principles,
and that all shareholders have the ability upon request to receive a full annual report. Second, the NYSE will evaluate
each country's program for providing shareholders with summary annual reports to verify that U.S. Holders are receiving
adequate information under the laws of the foreign country. Finally, the NYSE will also review the procedure the country
has provided for disclosing to shareholders the option to receive a full annual report. If the Exchange determines
that either the substance or the procedure provided by a foreign country's law is unsatisfactory, the Exchange may
prescribe additional requirements before the summary annual report can be distributed to U.S. Holders under the
NYSE rule. In this regard, the NYSE has stated it will ensure, under its new rule, that shareholders receive adequate
information and are provided with full and meaningful disclosure of their choices to receive the full annual report
as opposed to the summary report.
 Based on the above, the Commission believes the Exchange's review and oversight, combined with the minimum requirements
set forth in the rule, should ensure the continued protection of investors and the public interest consistent with
section 6(b)(5) of the Act. 





The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the rule change prior to the thirtieth day after publication
of notice of filing thereof. Amendment No. 1 added language to subsection (a) of the proposed rule to clarify the Exchange's
intention that summary annual reports include summary financial information.
 The NYSE's proposed rule change was published in the 

Federal Register

 for the full statutory period and no comments were received.
 






IV. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NYSE-93-47
and should be submitted by March 23, 1994. 



V. Conclusion 



It is therefore ordered, 

Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-NYSE-93-47) is approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

National Fire Protection Association Technical Committee on Fire Protection of Merchant Vessels



<AGENCY>

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard announces it will be participating in a new National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) technical
committee on Fire Protection of Merchant Vessels. The goal of this technical committee will be the development of
codes and standards applicable to fire protection of merchant vessels. The committee is intended for technical experts
knowledgeable in the field who are interested in volunteering to participate in the development effort.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) recently established a new technical committee on fire protection
of merchant vessels. The NFPA has a long and successful history of developing codes and standards which cover a broad
range of fire protection subjects for land based occupied structures. Additionally, the NFPA has developed maritime
standards pertaining to recreational craft, control of gas hazards aboard ships, and fire protection of vessels
during shipbuilding, repair, and lay-up.



With this new committee the NFPA will develop codes and standards for fire protection of merchant vessels. The committee
may also develop marine supplements to existing land based standards for application aboard ships. All merchant
vessel types currently regulated by the Coast Guard will be considered by this committee in developing codes and standards.

The Coast Guard may determine that the codes and standards developed by the committee would provide a level of safety
greater or equal to current regulations. If so, the Coast Guard may allow vessel owners and operators the option to
comply with the codes and standards in lieu of current regulations. The Coast Guard may also adopt all or part of the
standard(s) developed by the committee through future rulemaking projects. The information, codes, and standards
developed by the committee will also be of value in developing U.S. positions at the International Maritime Organization
(IMO) and at the International Standards Organization (ISO).

The Committee may meet as often as three to four times per year within the United States. The NFPA typically limits membership
on a technical committee to 30. However, additional specialized subcommittees may be created in the future to deal
specifically with certain vessel types. All members serve without compensation (neither travel nor per diem) from
the Federal Government.

<DOCTITLE>Marine Safety Issues Related to Uninspected Towing Vessels</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of meeting and study availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

A Coast Guard prepared study, entitled Review of Marine Safety Issues Related to Uninspected Towing Vessels, is available
to the public. The Coast Guard will also conduct a public meeting to discuss issues of towing vessel safety.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

As a result of the fatal barge/railroad bridge accident near Mobile, Alabama on September 22, 1993, the Secretary
of Transportation directed the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to review the circumstances
surrounding the accident, and undertake initiatives to minimize the risk of any similar tragedy in the future. Therefore,
the Coast Guard commissioned a study to review marine safety issues related to uninspected towing vessels and recommend
ways to increase safety and minimize further risk of future accidents.



The study includes the Coast Guard's marine casualty statistics for towing vessels, over a twelve year period (1980-1991).
Correlations are drawn from towing vessel casualties based on the area of operation, gross tonnage and horsepower.
As a result, the Study group made 19 recommendations based on five major areas: (1) Requirements for Licensing for
Operator of Uninspected Towing Vessel; (2) Requirements for Reporting Marine Casualties and Hazardous Conditions;
(3) Bridge Fendering Systems and Navigational Lighting; (4) Adequacy of the Navigation Equipment for Uninspected
Towing Vessels; (5) and, Adequacy of the Aids to Navigation System for Marking the Approaches to Bridges Over Navigable
Waterways.

Conclusions drawn from towing vessel casualty statistics indicate the majority of personnel and vessel casualties
involving uninspected towing vessels are directly attributable to human error. As a result, 10 of the 19 recommendations
surround the qualifications, training and issuance of an operator of uninspected towing vessel license.

Legislation has been introduced in Congress that would mandate implementation of some of the study recommendations,
including enhanced licensing requirements and requirements for navigational equipment.

The Coast Guard will hold a public meeting on April 4, 1994 to review the study and seek public comment on the recommendations
identified in the study. The study, along with public comment may be used to develop future rulemaking projects. Of
particular interest, and likely to be the subject of expedited rulemaking, are actions which could provide the necessary
means and improve the navigational ability of the operator, including requiring charts, publications and a radar
system, and requiring the operator to be qualified as a radar observer. Comments on the practical utility of these
requirements for various classes or sizes of vessels or areas of operation, the costs involved, and the length of time
appropriate for implementation would be especially helpful.

The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to submit written data, views, or arguments. Persons submitting comments
should include their names and addresses, identify the study by Docket number CGD 94-014 and give the reason
for each comment. Each person wanting acknowledgment of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed
postcard or envelope.




Dated: February 25, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Special Local Regulations; Annual Marine Events Within the Second Coast Guard District</DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is announcing the exact dates, times and locations for those annual marine events that will occur in
the Second Coast Guard District in 1994. The Coast Guard has previously published a list of marine events which occur
annually in the Second Coast Guard District, which were codified at 33 CFR 100.201. However, because the exact dates,
times and locations of these events change from year to year, 33 CFR 100.201 contains only approximate dates and locations.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Various public and private organizations sponsor marine events, which are scheduled to occur on an annual basis,
on navigable waters of the United States within the Second Coast Guard District. However, the exact date, time and
location of each event varies from year to year. The table below gives the exact dates, times and locations for those
annual marine events, scheduled to occur in 1994, which are listed in 33 CFR 100.201. It should be noted that this list
is not a complete list of all marine events that will occur in the Second Coast Guard District. It does not include events
which the District Commander has determined do not require establishment of regulations for the safety of life and
property on or adjacent to navigable waters. It also does not include non-annual events or events which have been scheduled
in time for this publication.




The events listed in Table One include slow-moving boat parades, raft races, high-speed hydroplane races, steamboat
races, fireworks displays, and other water-related events. The nature of each event is such that special local regulations
are deemed necessary to ensure the safety of life and property on and adjacent to navigable waters during the events.
During these events the river may be closed during portions of the effective periods to all vessel traffic except participants,
official regatta vessels and patrol craft. Actual river closures will not exceed three hours in duration at any one
time for events that last longer than four hours. Sponsors requiring more than three hours for their event will provide
a suitable break for vessel traffic to transit the regulated area. Mariners will be afforded enough time between closure
periods to transit the area.
