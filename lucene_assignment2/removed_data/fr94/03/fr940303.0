Oranges, Grapefruit, Tangerines, and Tangelos Grown in Florida; Relaxation of Gift Fruit Exemption Provisions




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule finalizes without change an interim final rule that relaxed the handling requirements which permit handlers
to increase shipments of gift packages of Florida citrus fruit to individuals and distributors, under specific conditions.
This rule will enable handlers to ship greater quantities of gift fruit to meet market needs.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 905 (7 CFR part 905) regulating the handling
of oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, hereinafter referred to as the order. This order
is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C 601-674), hereinafter
referred to as the Act. 



The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 

Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are about 100 Florida citrus handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering oranges, grapefruit,
tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, and about 11,000 producers of these citrus fruits in Florida. Small agricultural
producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts
of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than
$3,500,000. A minority of these handlers and a majority of the producers may be classified as small entities.

The Citrus Administrative Committee (committee) met November 16, 1993, and unanimously recommended this action.
The committee meets prior to and during each season to review the rules and regulations effective on a continuous basis
for citrus fruit regulated under the order. Committee meetings are open to the public, and interested persons may
express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews committee recommendations and information, as well
as information from other sources, and determines whether modification, suspension, or termination of the rules
and regulations would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 

Section 905.140 (7 CFR 905.140) provides the terms and conditions under which handlers can ship fruit in gift packages
exempt from handling regulations in effect under   905.52 and 905.53 of the order. Certain gift fruit
packages are exempted from such regulations, since they contain fruit of mixed varieties and non-fruit items, and
thus, would not meet the grade and size requirements of the handling regulations. Prior to the effective date of the
interim rule (58 FR 65538, December 15, 1993), handlers could only ship one or two gift packages per day exempt from
such regulations, depending on the circumstances, to individuals and distributors. The interim final rule increased
the number of gift packages of fruit which handlers can ship under this exemption provision, enabling handlers to
ship an unlimited number of packages of gift fruit to individuals and distributors, provided certain safeguards
are met by the handler of the fruit. These safeguards specify that each gift package must be individually addressed
to the person using the fruit, and that gift packages shipped to any gift fruit distributor must either be individually
addressed or marked ``not for resale''. 

The interim final rule was effective on December 9, 1993, and published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 65538, December 15, 1993). The interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period ending January 14, 1994,
and no comments were received. 

This final rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to relax the exemption provisions
for gift fruit shipments as specified. Such relaxation will enable handlers to ship more packages of gift fruit to
meet consumer needs, exempt from grade and size requirements issued under the order. This action is in the interest
of producers, handlers, distributors, and consumers, and is expected to increase returns to Florida citrus fruit
growers. The Department's view is that this action will have a beneficial impact on Florida citrus fruit producers
and handlers, since it will permit the industry to make additional gift fruit available to meet consumer needs. 

Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committee,
and other information, it is found that the relaxation as set forth below will tend to effectuate the declared policy
of the Act.

Navel and Valencia Oranges Grown in Arizona and Designated Parts of California; Suspension of Form 8 and Form 3



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; suspension.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule changing reporting requirements prescribed under the California-Arizona navel and Valencia orange
marketing orders. The marketing orders regulate the handling of navel and Valencia oranges grown in Arizona and designated
parts of California and are administered locally by the Navel and Valencia Orange Administrative Committees (committees).
This rule suspends language in the orders and in the orders' rules and regulations to discontinue the use of Form 8 (Certificate
of Assignment of Allotment) and Form 3 (Daily Manifest Report of Oranges Subject to Allotment). These changes reduce
the burden of information collection requirements currently provided for under the marketing orders.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Order Nos. 907 and 908 (7 CFR parts 907 and 908), as amended, regulating the
handling of navel and Valencia oranges grown in Arizona and designated parts of California, hereinafter referred
to as the ``orders.'' These orders are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended
(7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 



The Department of Agriculture is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

There are approximately 140 handlers of navel oranges and 125 handlers of Valencia oranges who are subject to regulation
under the respective marketing order and approximately 3,750 producers of navel oranges and 3,700 producers of Valencia
oranges in the regulated areas. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration
(13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000, and small agricultural producers are defined
as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers of California-Arizona
navel and Valencia oranges may be classified as small entities. 

This rule finalizes two changes in the reporting requirements prescribed under the California-Arizona orange marketing
orders. This rule suspends language in the orders and in the orders' rules and regulations to discontinue the use of
Form 8 (Certificate of Assignment of Allotment) and Form 3 (Daily Manifest Report of Oranges Subject to Allotment).
These changes were unanimously recommended by the committees. 

An interim final rule on this issue was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 1268, January 10, 1994), with an effective date of January 10, 1994. That rule suspended   907.58,
907.71, 908.58, and 908.71 of the orders, and   907.112, 907.141, 908.112, and 908.141 of the rules and
regulations in effect under the orders. That rule provided a 30-day comment period which ended February 9, 1994. No
comments were received. 

Sections 907.58 and 908.58 of the navel and Valencia orange marketing orders specify that, for the handling of oranges
other than by rail car (primarily truck shipments), handlers issue to the consignee an assignment of allotment certificate
covering each quantity of oranges so handled. Sections 907.112 and 908.112 of the orders' rules and regulations require
handlers to submit such information on Form 8. Handlers are also required to segregate the information on Form 8 by
size of oranges shipped and destination (i.e., U.S. and Alaska or Canada). 

Since the inception of the orders, the committees have utilized Form 8 primarily for tracking and verifying truck
shipments of oranges that were subject to volume regulation. However, with the volume regulation features of the
orders suspended (58 FR 53,114; October 14, 1993), the committees believe that continued submission of Form 8 creates
an additional burden on handlers that is unnecessary. 

According to the committees, many handlers have long questioned the value of Form 8 (commonly referred to in the industry
as ``the daily truck ticket'') during periods of no volume regulation. Shipment information from Form 8 is transferred
to Form 4 (Weekly Report). Handlers maintain their own manifest records of these shipments and, without weekly volume
regulation, Form 4 provides similar data with the exception of number of cartons shipped by size. The committees plan
on requesting size information from handlers as needed on a voluntary basis and anticipate revising the weekly Form
4 at a later time to provide for the collection of size information. 

Thus, the committees believe that continued submission of Form 8, particularly during periods of no volume regulation,
is not necessary. Accordingly, the committees have recommended suspending   907.58 and 908.58 of the
orders and   907.112 and 908.112 of the orders' rules and regulations so that Form 8 will be discontinued.


The second change that the committees recommended concerns Form 3 (Daily Manifest Report of Oranges Subject to Allotment).
Currently,   907.71 and 908.71 of the orange orders provide that handlers furnish to the committees information
regarding cartons of oranges handled, segregated by size, within 24 hours of shipment. Handlers must also indicate
whether the shipments were destined to points in the U.S. and Alaska or Canada. Sections 907.141 and 908.141 of the
orders' rules and regulations require handlers to submit this information for rail car shipments on Form 3.

The information collected on Form 3 is similar to the information collected on Form 8 described earlier, but pertains
to rail car shipments rather than truck shipments. Again, this information has historically been utilized primarily
for tracking and verifying shipments of oranges that were subject to volume regulation. However, with the volume
regulation features of the orders suspended, the committees believe that continued submission of Form 3, like Form
8, creates an additional burden on handlers that is unnecessary. Handlers are also required to submit similar information
on rail car shipments on the weekly Form 4. As with size information pertaining to truck shipments, the committees
plan on requesting size information from handlers for rail car shipments on a voluntary basis until the weekly Form
4 is appropriately revised. 

Like Form 8, the committees believe that continued submission of Form 3, particularly during periods of no volume
regulation, is not necessary. Accordingly, the committees have recommended suspending   907.71 and
908.71 of the orders and   907.141 and 908.141 of the orders' rules and regulations so that Form 3 will be
discontinued. 

Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB numbers
0581-0116 for navel oranges and 0581-0121 for Valencia oranges. This rule reduces the reporting burden
on approximately 265 handlers of navel and Valencia oranges who have been completing Form 8, taking about .40 hour
to complete each report. This rule also reduces the reporting burden on about 80 orange handlers who ship by rail at
some point during a season and utilize Form 3, taking about 0.20 hours to complete each report. 

After consideration of all relevant material presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committees,
and other information, it is found that the provisions detailed in the interim final rule, at this time, do not tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Therefore, this rule finalizes the interim final rule, without change,
as published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 1268, January 10, 1994).

Fresh Pears and Peaches Grown in California; Suspension of the Pear Provisions and Certain Nomination Provisions,
and Referendum Order Under Marketing Order No. 917 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Suspension and referendum order.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule suspends all the provisions applicable to pears and certain nomination provisions under Federal Marketing
Order (M.O.) No. 917. This rule also directs that a referendum be conducted among eligible pear producers in California
to determine whether they favor continuance of the pear provisions under M.O. 917. This suspension is being implemented
because the California Bartlett pear industry is now using a California State pear program, and is no longer using
the pear provisions under M.O. 917.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
This rule is issued under the provisions of section 8c(16)(A) of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937,
as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act; and of  917.42 (b) of Marketing Order
No. 917 (7 CFR Part 917) regulating the handling of fresh pears and peaches grown in California, hereinafter referred
to as the order. 


The order authorizes minimum grade, maturity, quality, and size requirements; container size, pack, and marking
requirements; and reporting and special purpose shipment requirements. The order also provides for the establishment
of production and marketing research, market development, and paid advertising. 
The referendum will be conducted in accordance with the procedure for the conduct of referenda to determine whether
continuation of the order's pear provisions is favored by producers, who during the representative period were engaged,
in the State of California, in the production of pears covered by the order. The procedure applicable to the referenda
is the ``Procedure for the Conduct of Referenda in Connection with Marketing Orders for Fruits, Vegetables, and Nuts
Pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as Amended'' (7 CFR Part 900.400 

et seq.

). The representative production period for the conduct of such referendum is hereby determined to be June 1, 1994,
through November 30, 1994. The referendum will be conducted within the period beginning December 1, 1994, and ending

February 15, 1995. 
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are about 45 California pear handlers subject to regulation under the order, and about 300 producers of pears
in the production area. Small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than
$3,500,000, and small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601)
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. A majority of these handlers and producers may be classified
as small entities. 

This rule indefinitely suspends all of the pear provisions in the order, along with the rules and regulations issued
thereunder, including: (1) Provisions pertaining to the administration of the order, including committee nominations
and selections; (2) the establishment of grade, size, quality, maturity, pack and container, and inspection requirements;
(3) the issuance of administrative rules and regulations related to exemptions and special purpose shipments; and
(4) information collection and reporting requirements. The pear provisions being suspended are in   917.4,
917.15, 917.20, 917.21, 917.24, 917.25, 917.26, 917.28, 917.29, 917.34, and 917.35 of the order; and in   917.100,
917.121, 917.143, 917.149, 917.176, 917.179, and 917.461 of the rules and regulations issued thereunder. 

This rule also suspends certain provisions in  917.18 pertaining to nomination of Control Committee members,
to enable the Control Committee to continue to function with only peach members upon suspension of the order's pear
provisions. Since the pear provisions are being suspended, there is no need for the pear industry members to serve
on the Control Committee. 

The Pear Commodity Committee (committee) unanimously recommended suspension of most of the pear provisions under
the order, because such provisions are no longer needed. The California Bartlett pear industry is now functioning
under the California Pear Marketing Program (State pear program), and is no longer using the pear order provisions.
The State pear program, developed by the California Bartlett pear industry and the California Department of Food
and Agriculture, is similar to the Federal pear program. 

The committee recommended suspension, not termination, of the order's pear provisions to provide the California
Bartlett pear industry with an opportunity to review operations under the State pear program for an indefinite period
of time. The committee wants to maintain the option of reactivating the Federal pear program, if the State pear program
does not operate satisfactorily. The California pear industry will have the opportunity to examine the effectiveness
of the State pear program until the end of the 1994 marketing season. At that time, the Department will conduct a referendum
of eligible pear producers to determine whether they favor continuance of the Federal pear program. 

The Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) has the authority to conduct a continuance referendum to determine whether
producers affected by a marketing order favor continuance of their order. The Secretary has determined that continuance
referenda are an effective means for ascertaining whether producers favor continuance of marketing order programs.


The Secretary would consider termination of the order's pear provisions if less than two-thirds of the pear producers
voting in the referendum and producers of less than two-thirds of the volume of pears represented in the referendum,
favor continuance. In evaluating the merits of continuance versus termination, the Secretary would consider the
results of the continuance referendum, other relevant information concerning the operation of the order's pear
provisions, and the relative benefits and disadvantages to producers, handlers, and consumers. Through such analysis,
the Secretary would determine whether continued existence of the order's pear provisions would tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act. 

In any event section 8c(16)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to terminate an order whenever the Secretary finds
that a majority of all producers favor termination, and that majority produced for market more than 50 percent of the
commodity covered by the order. 

In the event the Secretary terminates the order's pear provisions, the Control Committee shall, for the purpose of
liquidating the affairs of the committee, continue as trustees of any and all the funds and property in its possession,
or under its control, including claims for any funds unpaid or property not delivered.

Upon termination, the said trustees shall (1) continue in such capacity until discharged by the Secretary; (2) from
time to time account for all receipts and disbursements and deliver all property on hand, together with all books and
records of the committee and of the trustees, to such persons as the Secretary may direct; and (3) upon the request of
the Secretary, execute such assignments or other instruments necessary or appropriate to vest in such person, full
title and right to all of the funds, property, and claims vested in the committee or the trustees pursuant hereto. 
Any person to whom funds, property, or claims have been transferred or delivered, shall be subject to the same obligation
imposed upon the committee and upon the trustees. 
After a statement of total claims and debts, any remaining funds held in the reserve account will be returned, on a pro
rata basis, to those pear handlers who paid assessments under the order during the 1991-92 fiscal period. 
It is hereby directed that a referendum be conducted in accordance with the procedure for the conduct of referenda
(7 CFR 900.400 et seq.) to determine whether continuance of the order's pear provisions regulating the handling of
pears is approved or favored by producers who during the representative period were engaged in the production of such
pears grown in California. 
The referendum agents of the Secretary to conduct the referendum are hereby designated as Kurt J. Kimmel and Terry
Vawter, California Marketing Field Office, USDA/AMS, 2202 Monterey St., suite 102-B, Fresno, California
93721; telephone: 209-487-5901. 

Ballots will be mailed to all pear producers of record. Ballots may also be obtained at County Extension Service Offices,
or by contacting the California Marketing Field Office. Copies of the order may also be obtained by contacting the
California Marketing Field Office. 

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), information and collection requirements
for pears under the order have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB Control No.
0581-0080). The ballot material to be used in the referendum herein ordered has been submitted to and approved
by OMB, and it has been estimated that it will take an average of 30 minutes to read and complete the ballot for each of
the approximately 300 producers who elect to participate in the voluntary referendum balloting. 

Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the committee's recommendations, and other
available information, it is found and determined that the pear provisions in the order and the rules and regulations
issued thereunder, along with certain provisions in  917.18 pertaining to the nomination of members to the
Control Committee, do not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act at this time, and that such provisions should
be suspended. It is further found that suspending all the rules and regulations pertaining to pears issued under the
order will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

Milk in the New Orleans-Mississippi Marketing Area; Suspension of Certain Provisions of the Order 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Suspension of rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document suspends, for 23 months, the 45 percent delivery requirement for a plant operated by a cooperative association
that is located within the New Orleans-Mississippi marketing area. The suspension was requested by Gulf Dairy Association,
Inc., which operates a manufacturing plant at Kentwood, Louisiana. The association states that without the suspension
it will be forced to make inefficient qualifying shipments of milk merely to keep the milk of its producers qualified
for pooling under the order.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Prior document in this proceeding: 




Notice of Proposed Suspension: Issued January 3, 1994; published January 10, 1994 (59 FR 1307). 




The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens
the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensure that dairy farmers will continue to
have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. 

The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This final rule also has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended
to have a retroactive effect. This action does not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of
an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in
any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date
of the entry of the ruling. 

This order of suspension is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and of the
order regulating the handling of milk in the New Orleans-Mississippi marketing area. 

Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 10, 1994 (59 FR 1307), concerning a proposed suspension of certain provisions of the order. Interested
persons were afforded opportunity to file written data, views, and arguments thereon. No comments were received.


After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal in the notice, and other available information,
it is hereby found and determined that for the period commencing with publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

 and extending through December 31, 1995, the following provisions of the order do not tend to effectuate the declared
policy of the Act: 

In  1094.7(c), the words ``45 percent or more of the''. 



Statement of Consideration 


The order will suspend through December 1995 the 45 percent delivery requirement for a cooperative association plant
that is located in the New Orleans-Mississippi marketing area. 

Gulf Dairy Association, Inc., which operates a manufacturing plant at Kentwood, Louisiana, that is regulated under
Order 94, submitted the suspension request. The cooperative stated that because of the present 45 percent delivery
requirement applicable to a cooperative association that wishes to qualify a manufacturing plant for pooling, it
has had to shift some of its producers to neighboring Greater Louisiana (Order 96) pool plants to keep its Kentwood
plant qualified as a pool plant under Order 94. It indicated that Order 96 requires that six days' production of a producer
must be received at pool plants each month in order to qualify the milk for pooling by diversion to a nonpool plant. Accordingly,
it has had to move the milk of selected producers to Order 96 pool plants six days per month. Since this milk is not actually
needed by these pool plants, the cooperative has then had to back-haul the milk to its Kentwood manufacturing plant
for processing. The problem is now particularly acute, according to the cooperative, because two Order 94 pool plants
have notified Gulf Dairy Association that they will no longer purchase milk from them after February 1, 1994. 

Gulf Dairy Association noted that the problem it is experiencing could be resolved through the proposed merger of
milk orders that is now under consideration by the Department. It urged that the proposed suspension be effective
pending the completion of that proceeding. 

The suspension is found to be necessary for the purpose of assuring that producers' milk will not have to be moved in
an uneconomic and inefficient manner to assure that producers whose milk has long been associated with the New Orleans-Mississippi
marketing area will continue to benefit from pooling and pricing under the order.

It is hereby found and determined that thirty days' notice of the effective date hereof is impractical, unnecessary
and contrary to the public interest in that: 
(a) The suspension is necessary to reflect current marketing conditions and to assure orderly marketing conditions
in the marketing area, in that such rule is necessary to permit the continued pooling of the milk of dairy farmers who
have historically supplied the market without the need for making costly and inefficient movements of milk; 
(b) This suspension does not require of persons affected substantial or extensive preparation prior to the effective
date; and 
(c) Notice of proposed rulemaking was given interested parties and they were afforded opportunity to file written
data, views or arguments concerning this suspension. No comments were received. 
Therefore, good cause exists for making this order effective less than 30 days from the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

Airworthiness Directives; Teledyne Continental Motors Models C75, C85, C90, C125, C145, O-200, O-300,
and GO-300 Series Reciprocating Engines 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) Models
C75, C85, C90, C125, C145, O-200, O-300, and GO-300 series reciprocating engines, that requires
inspection of the cylinder rocker shaft bosses for cracks, and inspection of the cylinder rocker shaft for looseness
and replacement, if necessary, with a serviceable part. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracked or improperly
repaired cylinder rocker shaft bosses. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent engine power loss
and engine failure.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) Models C75, C85, C90, C125, C145, O-200, and O-300 series
reciprocating engines was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 2, 1993 (58 FR 31348). That action proposed to require fluorescent penetrant or etching inspections of the
cylinder rocker shaft bosses for cracks, and dimensional inspections of the cylinder rocker shaft bosses for looseness,
at the next overhaul, in accordance with TCM Overhaul Manual Form X-30013, dated June 1982, applicable to TCM
Models C125, C145, and O-300 series engines; and TCM Overhaul Manual Form X-30010, dated January 1984,
applicable to TCM Models C75, C85, C90, and O-200 series engines. If the cylinder rocker shaft bosses are cracked,
the cylinder must be replaced. Modified cylinders must be further inspected for cracks that may have been introduced
during the repair process. Cylinders with loose rocker shafts must be replaced with serviceable cylinders, or modified
by installing bushings. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
One commenter states that the AD should require compliance at the next 100 hour or annual inspection, whichever occurs
first. The commenter further states that the AD should require visual inspection for wear, broken bosses, or loose
bushings at the earlier compliance time because cylinders with cracked bosses or loose bushing will likely fail before
the cylinder requires overhaul. The FAA does not concur. Service Difficulty Reports and engineering analysis do
not indicate that the shorter compliance time is necessary, and the comment did not include any data as a basis for the
shorter compliance time. Furthermore, it is unlikely that a visual inspection without disassembly could detect
cracks or looseness in the cylinder rocker shaft bosses. 
The commenter further states that the TCM GO-300 series engines should be included in the AD. Production of new
cylinders has been standardized by manufacturing the TCM GO-300 type cylinder only for use on all C-75
through C-145, as well as the O-200 and O-300 series engines. The commenter maintains that used GO-300
cylinder assemblies may find their way onto other engines. The GO-300 shares nearly identical valve train components
with the other engines and is subject to the same type of rocker boss wear and possible failures. The FAA concurs. The
GO-300 cylinders have been added to the applicability paragraph of this AD.

The commenter further states that TCM Service Bulletin (SB) No. M73-13 specifies a minimum edge thickness for
the center rocker bosses only. The commenter argues that this requirement for minimum thickness should be redefined
to be a minimum thickness anywhere on any boss because many cylinders have bosses with adequate material on the edges
of the center bosses, but very little material between the edges. The commenter concludes by stating that outer bosses,
also require close scrutiny for thickness, and if an outer boss fails, the center boss will likely be overloaded and
also fail. The FAA does not concur. The center bosses are thinner by design and will therefore wear to the limit sooner
than the outer bosses. If the center bosses have the correct edge to wall thickness, then the outer bosses will be correct
also. 

The commenter further states that consideration should be given to securing rocker boss repair bushings with a dowel
pin to prevent rotation after installation. The commenter argues that any lack of concentricity between bushing
ID and OD can severely overload bosses if one or more bushings rotate after installation. The FAA does not concur. If
the repair is accomplished correctly, the bushing will be pressed in and this press fit will prevent rotation. 

The commenter further states that when performing inspections for cracked bosses on cylinders that have been removed
from the engine, dye penetrant inspection should be allowed in addition to the fluorescent penetrant inspection.
The commenter maintains that dye penetrant inspection is quite effective and reliable when properly performed and
is in widespread use by approved cylinder head repair facilities. The FAA concurs. Dye penetrant inspection has been
added to the AD as an option for compliance. In addition, the FAA has added industry-accepted procedures to the AD for
performing dye penetrant, fluorescent penetrant, and etching inspections in order to standardize the method of
inspection. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 

The FAA estimates that 35,600 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this AD, approximately
20,000 four-cylinder engines and 15,600 six-cylinder engines. The FAA estimates that it will take approximately
one-half work hour per cylinder to inspect or install the bushings, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts will cost approximately $11 per cylinder. Based on these figures, the cost impact of the AD for four-cylinder
engines is estimated to be $154 per engine, the cost impact of the AD for six-cylinder engines is estimated to be $231
per engine, and the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $6,683,600. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

To prevent engine power loss and engine failure, accomplish the following: 

(a) At the next cylinder or engine overhaul after the effective date of this AD, inspect the cylinder rocker shaft bosses
for cracks using one of the following methods, and if cracked replace with a serviceable cylinder:






Note: 

Certain cylinder cracks may be repaired by FAA-approved repair stations specifically rated to do those repairs.





(1) Fluorescent penetrant inspection, as follows: 

(i) The penetrant shall be a nontoxic, noncorrosive, highly fluorescent liquid capable of penetrating fine discontinuities
and, for aluminum castings, conforming to Aerospace Material Specification (AMS) 3156. If a darkened enclosure
is not used for examination, AMS 3157 penetrant shall be used.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940303-0-00017 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940303-0-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) The emulsifier shall be composed of suitable oil or oil-like components together with such additives as are necessary
to provide a stable, nontoxic, noncorrosive, oil-miscible, oil-emulsifying solution. Emulsifier shall not be
used when AMS 3156 is used. 

(iii) The developer shall be a highly absorbent, nonfluorescent and nontoxic powder, capable of being used dry or
a similar powder capable of being suspended in water. When the suspension is used, the powder shall be thoroughly mixed
with water to a concentration, unless otherwise permitted, of not less than 0.2 lb per gallon and a uniform distribution
maintained by mechanical agitation. 

(iv) The penetrant, the emulsifier (if used) and the developer shall be checked as often as necessary to maintain proper
control. The penetrant shall be discarded if it shows a noticeable loss in penetrating power or marked contamination
or when wax begins to form on the sides of the tank and dip basket. 

(v) A darkness booth or a similar darkness area with a filtered black light shall be provided. The black light shall
be at least equal to that produced by a 100 watt mercury vapor projection spot lamp equipped with a filter to transmit
wave lengths of between 3200 and 4000 Angstrom units and absorb substantially all visible light. The intensity of
the light at normal working distance shall be as specified by the purchaser but in no case shall be lower than 580 micro-watts
per square centimeter as measured with an appropriate black light meter. 

(vi) All parts shall be cleaned and dried in such a manner as to leave them free from grease, oil, soaps, alkalies and
other substances which would interfere with inspection. Vapor degreasing is generally suitable for this purpose.


(vii) Parts shall be immersed in the penetrant or shall be sprayed or brushed with the penetrant and shall be allowed
to remain immersed in the penetrant or to stand for sufficient time to allow satisfactory penetration into all discontinuities.
This time shall, unless otherwise specified, not be less than 5 minutes. The time for immersion or standing will depend
upon the character and fineness of the discontinuities, the effectiveness of penetration increasing with time.
Parts may be resprayed or re-immersed after standing to increase sensitivity and aid in removal of penetrant. 

(viii) Parts shall be removed from the penetrant and cleaned thoroughly using a medium which will remove penetrant
from the surface of parts; washing with water shall be used when the penetrant is water washable or when an emulsifying
agent is applied to surfaces of parts to render the penetrant water washable. When emulsifiers are used, the parts
shall be dipped in the emulsifier and removed slowly for draining or shall be sprayed with emulsifier and drained.
Unless otherwise specified, the combined dipping and draining time shall be 1 to 5 minutes. When other than water washable
penetrants are used, the penetrant shall be removed with a suitable cleaner or a suitable cleaner and lint-free cloths.
During cleaning, the parts may be viewed under a suitable black light to ensure removal of the penetrant from the subrace
of the part. Excessive cleaning which would remove the penetrant from discontinuities shall be avoided. 

(ix) When a wet developer is used, the developer shall be applied to the parts, immediately after washing, by immersing
the parts in the tank containing the water-suspended powder or by spraying or flowing the suspension onto the parts.
The suspension shall be suitably agitated either during or immediately prior to application to parts. Immersed parts
shall be removed from the wet developer; excess developer shall be allowed to drain off all parts. Special care shall
be taken to remove excess developer from pockets, recesses, holes, threads, and corners so that the developer will
not mask indications. 

(x) When a dry developer or no developer is used, the parts shall be dried as thoroughly as possible by exposure to clean
air. Drying of parts may be accomplished by evaporation at room temperature or by placing the parts in a circulating
warm air oven or in the air stream of a hot air dryer. Excessive drying time or part temperatures higher than 80
 C (180
 F) should be avoided to prevent evaporation of the penetrant. 

(xi) When a dry developer is used, the developing powder shall be applied uniformly over the areas of the parts to be
inspected by either dusting or powder-box immersion. 

(xii) After sufficient time has been allowed to develop indications, parts shall be examined under a black light.
Examination shall be made in a darkened enclosure unless AMS 3157 penetrant is used, in which case examination may
be made under normal shop lighting but shaded from direct sunlight. 

(xiii) When greater sensitivity is desired, the parts may be heated to 65
 -85
 C (150
 -185
 F) before immersion in the penetrant and/or before black light examination. To prevent evaporation, preheated
parts shall remain fully immersed in the penetrant until cooled. 

(xiv) Parts shall be cleaned, as necessary, to remove penetrant and developer. 

(xv) Interpretation of the indications revealed by this inspection procedure and final disposition of the parts
shall be the responsibility of only qualified personnel having experience with fluorescent penetrant inspection.


(xvi) Parts having discontinuities (cracks) shall be rejected.

and E165-9 contain additional information on dye penetrant inspection processes.




(i) 

Preparation: 

clean and dry all parts in such a manner as to leave the surfaces free from grease, oil, soaps, alkalies, and other substances
which would interfere with inspection. Vapor degreasing is generally suitable for this purpose. 


(ii) 

Penetrant Application Procedure: 

after preparation, spray or brush the parts with the penetrant, and allow to stand for not less than 5 minutes. The effectiveness
of the penetrant increases if left standing for a longer time, as the penetrant will reach finer discontinuities.



(iii) 

Penetrant Cleaning: 

clean the parts thoroughly using a medium which will remove penetrant from the surfaces of parts; wash with water when
the penetrant is water soluble. When other than water soluble penetrants are used, the penetrant shall be removed
with a suitable cleaner. Avoid excessive cleaning which would remove the penetrant from discontinuities. 


(iv) 

Drying: 

dry the parts as thoroughly as possible. Drying of parts may be accomplished by evaporation at room temperature or
by placing the parts in a circulating warm air oven or in the air stream of a hot air dryer. Avoid excessive drying time
or drying temperatures above 75
 C (165
 F) to prevent excessive evaporation of the penetrant. If heat is used for drying parts, cool parts to approximately
50
 C (120
 F) before proceeding to the developing procedure. 


(v) 

Developing: 

apply the developer to the dry parts as lightly and as evenly as possible, using as thin a coating of developer as is possible.
A translucent film is adequate. Mix wet developer by agitation immediately prior to applying it. After applying the
developer, take care that no penetrant indication is disturbed or obliterated in subsequent handling. 


(vi) 

Examination: 

examine the developed penetrant indications in accordance with the dye penetrant manufacturer's instructions.
Examine parts for indications of discontinuities open to the surface. 


(vii) 

Final cleaning: 

clean the parts following the inspection to remove penetrant and developer. 







Note 1: 

Caution: 

because of differences among penetrants, take care to ensure that the final cleaner, the penetrant, the penetrant
remover, and the developer are suitable for use with each other. 







Note 2: 

Caution: 

all penetrant materials should be kept as free from moisture as possible. 







Note 3: 

Caution: 

most penetrants, cleaning agents, and developer suspensions are low flash point material; use caution to prevent
fires. 





(3) Etching inspection, as follows: 


(i) For TCM C75, C85, C90, and O-200 series engines, in accordance with paragraph 13-7 of TCM Overhaul Manual
Form X-30010, dated January 1984. 


(ii) For TCM C125, C145, O-300, and GO-300 series engines, in accordance with paragraphs 5(b)(1), 5(b)(2),
and 5(b)(3) of TCM Overhaul Manual Form X-30013, dated June 1982. 


(b) At the next cylinder or engine overhaul after the effective date of this AD, dimensionally inspect cylinders for
looseness of the rocker shaft in accordance with page 22, paragraph 5, and Table IX of TCM Overhaul Manual Form 
X-30013, dated June 1982, for TCM Models C125, C145, O-300, and GO-300 series engines; page 75, paragraph
13-6, and the dimensions table in paragraph 13-8 of TCM Overhaul Manual Form X-30010, dated January
1984, for TCM Models C75, C85, C90, and O-200 series engines; as applicable. 


(1) Cylinders that do not exhibit dimensional looseness of the rocker shaft beyond the limits specified in the applicable
TCM overhaul manual may be returned to service.

(2) For cylinders that exhibit dimensional looseness of the rocker shaft, beyond the limits specified in the applicable
TCM overhaul manual, accomplish the following: 
(i) Replace with a serviceable cylinder; or 
(ii) Install bushings in accordance with the instructions on page 27 of TCM Overhaul Manual, Form X-30013, dated
June 1982, for TCM Models C125, C145, O-300, and GO-300 series engines; or the instructions on page 85 of
TCM Overhaul Manual Form X-30010, dated January 1984, for TCM Models C75, C85, C90, and O-200 series engines;
as applicable. 
(iii) After repairing a cylinder perform an additional inspection of the cylinder rocker shaft bosses for cracks
using fluorescent penetrant, dye penetrant, or etching methods, and replace, if necessary, with a serviceable cylinder.

(c) Thereafter, at each subsequent cylinder or engine overhaul, reinspect cylinder rocker bosses and rocker shafts
in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this AD. 
(d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office. The request should be forwarded
through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Atlanta Aircraft
Certification Office.



 


Note:

 Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this airworthiness directive,
if any, may be obtained from the Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office.



(e) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with FAR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location
where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. 
(f) This amendment becomes effective on May 2, 1994.




Issued in Burlington, Massachusetts, on February 18, 1994.

Organization and Delegation of Powers and Duties; Delegations to the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy,
to the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, to the Assistant to the Secretary and Director
of Public Affairs, and to the Assistant General Counsel for Environmental, Civil Rights, and General Law



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Secretary, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends the relevant regulations which contain delegations of authority to the Assistant Secretary
for Policy and International Affairs. The title of the delegatee has been changed either to the Assistant Secretary
for Transportation Policy or to the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, as appropriate,
because a new Assistant Secretary position has been created. This rule is necessary to clarify which current delegations
apply to the new Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy and which apply to the new Assistant Secretary for
Aviation and International Affairs.



This document also amends the relevant regulations which contain delegations of authority to the Assistant Secretary
for Public Affairs. The title of the delegatee has been changed to the Assistant to the Secretary and Director of Public
Affairs to reflect the new title of the head of that Office. Finally, this document also amends the relevant regulations
which contain all remaining delegations of authority that should have been transferred in an earlier reorganization
from the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs to the Office of the General Counsel. These latter authorities are
hereby delegated to the Assistant General Counsel for Environmental, Civil Rights, and General Law.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 27, 1993, the Secretary of Transportation approved a reorganization of the Office of the Secretary by creating
a new position of Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy and a new position of Assistant Secretary for Aviation
and International Affairs. The title of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs was also changed by this reorganization
to the Assistant to the Secretary and Director of Public Affairs. Thus, it is necessary to amend the relevant parts
of the CFR in order to: (1) Clarify which current CFR delegations apply to the new Assistant Secretary for Transportation
Policy and which apply to the new Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs; (2) reflect the new
title of the head of the Office of Public Affairs; and (3) bring certain other provisions of 49 CFR part 7 into conformity
with 49 CFR 1.57b, now entitled, Delegations to the Assistant General Counsel for Environmental, Civil Rights, and
General Law. Until now, all of these CFR parts have referred either to the Assistant Secretary for Policy and International
Affairs, or to the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. A summary of the CFR parts affected follows.

One CFR part (44 CFR part 403), which places restrictions on transportation movements and the transportation of goods
to North Korea or the Communist-controlled area of Vietnam, is jointly administered by the Department of Transportation
and the Department of Commerce. This part will be the subject of joint agency rulemaking at a later date.

14 CFR parts 300, 302, 303, 325 and 385 are procedural and organizational regulations concerning aviation economic
proceedings. All references to the Assistant Secretary for Policy and International Affairs are being changed to
the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, and a minor editorial change is being made to  302.22a(b)(1).

49 CFR part 1 describes the organization of the Department of Transportation and provides for the performance of duties
imposed upon, and the exercise of powers vested in, the Secretary of Transportation by law. Delegations to the Assistant
Secretary for Policy and International Affairs are being transferred to the Assistant Secretary for Transportation
Policy and to the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, as appropriate. Delegations to the
Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs are being transferred to the Assistant to the Secretary and Director of Public
Affairs. Further,   1.22 and 1.23 are being revised not only to reflect the structure and responsibilities
of the Office of the Secretary as a result of these delegations, but also to reflect the structure and responsibilities
of the Office as a result of earlier reorganizations. Finally, minor editorial changes are being made to   1.43(c)
and 1.65(c).

49 CFR part 7 implements the Freedom of Information Act, and prescribes rules governing the availability to the public
of records of the Department of Transportation. Consistent with the delegation of authority to the Assistant General
Counsel for Environmental, Civil Rights, and General Law in 49 CFR 1.57b, references to the Assistant Secretary for
Public Affairs in part 7 are being changed to the Assistant General Counsel for Environmental, Civil Rights, and General
Law. A minor editorial change is also being made to  7.53(c).

49 CFR part 8 sets forth procedures for the classification and declassification of national security information
and material. Authority to classify information is being transferred from the Assistant Secretary for Policy and
International Affairs to both the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy and the Assistant Secretary for
Aviation and International Affairs, and a minor editorial change is being made to  8.11(b)(1).

Finally, 49 CFR part 28 carries out provisions of existing law that prohibit discrimination on the basis of handicap
in programs or activities conducted by Executive agencies, including this Department. Certain compliance procedures
for which the Assistant Secretary for Policy and International Affairs was responsible will now be the responsibility
of the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy.

Since this rule relates to departmental management, organization, procedure, and practice, notice and public comment
are unnecessary. For the same reason, good cause exists for not publishing this rule at least 30 days before its effective
date, as is ordinarily required by 5 U.S.C. 553(d). Therefore, this rule is effective on the date of its publication.

In consideration of the foregoing, and under the authority of 49 U.S.C. 322, parts 300, 302, 303, 325 and 385 of title
14 and parts 1, 7, 8, and part 28 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, are amended as follows:

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of 2,2
'-(1,2-ethenediyldi-4,1-phenylene)bis(benzoxazole) as an optical brightener for food-contact polymers.
This action is in response to a petition filed by Eastman Chemical Co., Eastman Kodak Co.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5415), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 1B4240) had been filed by Eastman
Chemical Co., Eastman Kodak Co., P.O. Box 511, Kingsport, TN 37662, proposing that the food additive regulations
in  178.3297 

Colorants for polymers

 (21 CFR 178.3297) be amended to provide for the safe use of 2,2
'-(1,2-ethenediyldi-4,1-phenylene)bis(benzoxazole) as an optical brightener for food-contact polymers.
Subsequently, after a company reorganization, Eastman Chemical Co. is no longer part of Eastman Kodak Co.; it is now
referred to only as Eastman Chemical Co.


FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material. The agency concludes that the proposed food additive
use is safe, and that 21 CFR 178.3297 should be amended as set forth below.
In accordance with  171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.
Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before April 4, 1994, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Certificates of Compliance with Income Tax Laws by Departing Aliens 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulations.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains final Income Tax Regulations that exempt certain alien students, industrial trainees, and
exchange visitors from the requirement of obtaining a certificate of compliance with income tax laws before departing
the United States. This action is necessary because of changes to the applicable tax laws made by the Technical and
Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988.


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On January 28, 1991, the IRS published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 3061) by cross reference to temporary regulations (56 FR 3034) that proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations
under section 6851 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. These regulations implemented section 1001(d) of the Technical
and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, Public Law 100-647, 102 Stat. 3342. Comments responding to the notice
of proposed rulemaking were received but no public hearing was requested or held. After consideration of the written
comments, the IRS adopts the proposed regulations as revised by this Treasury decision. 



Explanation of Provisions 



The regulations exempt certain alien students, industrial trainees, and exchange visitors, and their spouses and
children, from the requirement of obtaining a certificate of compliance with the U.S. income tax laws before they
depart the United States. Aliens exempt from the requirements are those admitted to the United States solely on an
F-1, F-2, H-3, H-4, J-1, or J-2 visa, who have received no gross income from U.S.
sources other than: (1) 
Allowances to cover expenses incident to study in the United States, (2) the value of any services or accommodations
furnished incident to that study, (3) income derived in accordance with the employment authorizations in 8 CFR 274a.12(b)
and (c) that apply to the alien's visa or (4) interest on deposits described in section 871(i)(2)(A). Furthermore,
aliens admitted solely on an M-1 or M-2 visa who have received no gross income other than that derived in
accordance with the employment authorization in 8 CFR 274a.12 (c)(6) or described in section 871(i)(2)(A) are also
exempt from the requirement.

Comments received were very positive. Accordingly, the regulations adopt the provisions of the notice of proposed
rulemaking, with only minor changes. In response to a comment, the words ``or training'' are added immediately after
the word ``study'' in  1.6851-2(a)(2)(ii) (A) (

1

) and (

2

) to clarify that the regulations apply to payments incident to training as well as study. In addition, a commentator
suggested that the exemption should apply to amounts, such as travel allowances, that may be received by students
or trainees when not physically present in the United States. These regulations clarify that such amounts are covered
by the exemption as well, assuming that the other requirements of the regulations have been met. The final regulations
also provide that the exemption covers amounts received that are exempt from United States taxation under section
871(i)(2)(A), relating to certain interest on deposits. 



Special Analyses 



It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business. 



Drafting Information 



The principal author of these regulations is Thomas L. Ralph of the Office of Associate Chief Counsel (International),
within the Office of Chief Counsel, IRS. Other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their
development. 



List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 1

Background 


On December 29, 1992, the IRS published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 61852) proposing amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 42 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended. These amendments provide guidance on several requirements of the low-income housing tax
credit and incorporate and expand upon the guidance provided by Notices 89-1 and 89-6. 
Written comments responding to the notice of proposed rulemaking were received. A public hearing was scheduled for
February 16, 1993, pursuant to a notice of public hearing published simultaneously with the notice of proposed rulemaking.
However, the IRS received no requests to speak at the public hearing by the designated date. On February 8, 1993, the
IRS published a notice (58 FR 7497) cancelling the public hearing on the proposed regulations. After consideration
of the comments received, the proposed regulations are adopted as revised by this Treasury decision. 


Explanation of Provisions 


Carryover Allocations 


Section 42 provides for a low-income housing credit that may be claimed as part of the general business credit under
section 38. In general, the credit is allowable only to the extent that the owner of a qualified low-income building
receives a housing credit allocation from a State or local housing credit agency (Agency). 
Under section 42(h)(1)(E), an allocation may be made to a qualified building that has not yet been placed in service,
provided the building is placed in service not later than the close of the second calendar year following the calendar
year of the allocation (a carryover allocation). Section 42(h)(1)(E)(ii) defines a qualified building as any building
that is part of a project if the taxpayer's basis in the project (as of the close of the calendar year of the allocation)
is more than 10 percent of the taxpayer's reasonably expected basis in the project (as of the close of the second calendar
year following the calendar year of the allocation). For these purposes, the taxpayer's basis equals the taxpayer's
basis in land and depreciable property. See 2 H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1104, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. II-82 (1988), 1988-3
C.B. 572. A carryover allocation may also be made to a multiple-building project under section 42(h)(1)(F). 
Commentators requested clarification on when a carryover allocation is treated as if it had never been made. The final
regulations clarify that only a failure to satisfy a requirement of section 42(h)(1) (E) or (F) that must be satisfied
by the close of the calendar year of allocation will cause a carryover allocation to be treated as if it had not been made.

The proposed regulations provide that a taxpayer does not 
have carryover-allocation basis in a project unless, by the 
close of the calendar year of allocation, the taxpayer is the 
owner, for federal income tax purposes, of land or depreciable 
real property expected to be part of the project. The final 
regulations do not explicitly contain this requirement. After 
further consideration, the IRS believes that satisfaction of the requirements of  1.42-6 is sufficient
to ensure that a 
taxpayer intends to complete a qualified low-income housing 
project. For example, if a taxpayer has basis in land or 
depreciable property that is reasonably expected to be part of 
a project and the requirements of  1.42-6 are otherwise 
satisfied, the taxpayer has carryover-allocation basis with 
respect to the land or depreciable property. This basis 
includes all items that are properly capitalizable with 
respect to the land or depreciable property. Thus, 
notwithstanding the rule in Notice 89-1 to the contrary, a 
nonrefundable downpayment for, or an amount paid to acquire an 
option to purchase, land or depreciable property may be 
included in carryover-allocation basis if properly 
capitalizable into the basis of land or depreciable property 
that is reasonably expected to be part of a project. 

Commentators objected to the exclusion of credit 
application fees from carryover-allocation basis and requested 
that the final regulations permit these fees to be included in 
carryover-allocation basis. On further consideration, it 
appears that an absolute prohibition against the inclusion of 
application fees (and compliance monitoring fees, which were 
also not included) in carryover-allocation basis is not 
warranted. Accordingly, the final regulations subject credit 
application and compliance monitoring fees to the same 
standards imposed upon other fees under the regulations. For 
example, if a fee is properly capitalizable as part of the 
taxpayer's basis in land or depreciable property that is 
reasonably expected to be part of a project, the fee is 
included in carryover-allocation basis. 



Verification of Basis 



The proposed regulations provide verification requirements 
and procedures that an Agency must follow to ensure that the 
minimum basis requirement that is required to be met by the 
close of the year of allocation is, in fact, met. A 
commentator suggested that the basis verification requirements 
are too burdensome to Agencies and that Agencies lack the 
expertise to verify the costs includible in basis. The 
IRS does not expect Agencies to audit projects or make 
legal determinations. Rather, the proposed regulations 
provide that an Agency may verify the basis requirement by 
requiring the taxpayer to obtain a certification from an 
attorney or certified public accountant that the taxpayer has 
incurred the minimum required basis by the close of the 
calendar year of allocation. Accordingly, the final 
regulations adopt the basis verification requirement of the 
proposed regulations.

Requirements for Making Carryover Allocations 



The proposed regulations provide guidance on the 
information needed for carryover allocation documents. A 
commentator suggested that the final regulations clarify 
whether a newly constructed building that receives an 
allocation of credit in different calendar years must have a 
separate Form 8609 for each allocation and, if so, whether the 
same building identification number (B.I.N.) should be used. 

The final regulations clarify that, in this and similar 
situations, a separate Form 8609 is necessary for both 
allocations and that the B.I.N. assigned to the building for 
the first allocation also is used for the subsequent 
allocation. 



Use by the General Public 



The legislative history of section 42 provides that 
residential rental units must be for use by the general 
public. Residential rental units are not for use by the 
general public, for example, if the units are provided only 
for members of a social organization or provided by an 
employer for its employees. The proposed regulations provide 
an exception for an employer-provided resident manager unit 
that is a facility reasonably required by a project. 

Commentators suggested that the exception for a resident 
manager unit be expanded to include a unit occupied by a full-time maintenance person. After further review, IRS the
Service 
and the Treasury have concluded that the reference to a 
resident manager unit in the proposed regulations was 
inappropriate because the general public use requirement only 
applies to residential rental units. A unit that is occupied 
by a full-time resident manager or a full-time maintenance 
person is not a residential rental unit but is a facility 
reasonably required by a project. See Rev. Rul. 92-61, 
1992-2 C.B. 7. Accordingly, the final regulations remove the 
reference to a resident manager unit. 



Utility Allowances 



A commentator suggested that the final regulations provide 
that in areas where there is a utility allowance increase 
without a corresponding increase in area median gross income, 
an owner may adjust the rent upwards so that rent receipts do 
not decrease below the minimum rent floor of section 
42(g)(2)(A). Because a change of this nature requires an 
amendment to the statute, the final regulations do not adopt 
this suggestion. 



Special Analyses 



It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a 
significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 
12866. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply 
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility 
Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the 
Internal Revenue Code, the notice of the proposed rulemaking 
for the regulations was submitted to the Chief Counsel for 
Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on 
their impact on small business. 



Drafting Information 



The principal author of these regulations is Christopher J. 
Wilson, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (Passthroughs 
and Special Industries), Internal Revenue Service. However, 
other personnel from the IRS and the Treasury Department 
participated in their development.

(a) 

Carryover allocations. 

A carryover allocation is an allocation that meets the requirements of section 42(h)(1) (E) or (F). If the requirements
of section 42(h)(1) (E) or (F) that are required to be satisfied by the close of the calendar year are not satisfied,
the allocation is treated as if it had not been made. For example, if the taxpayer's basis in the project as of the close
of the calendar year of allocation is not more than 10 percent of the taxpayer's reasonably expected basis in the project
as of the close of the second calendar year following the year of allocation, the carryover allocation is not valid
and is treated as if it had not been made.

(b) 

Carryover-allocation basis

_(1) 

In general

. Subject to the limitations of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a taxpayer's basis in a project for purposes of section
42(h)(1) (E)(ii) or (F) (carryover-allocation basis) is the taxpayer's adjusted basis in land or depreciable property
that is reasonably expected to be part of the project, whether or not these amounts are includible in eligible basis
under section 42(d). Thus, for example, if the project is to include property that is not residential rental property,
such as commercial space, the basis attributable to the commercial space, although not includible in eligible basis,
is includible in carryover-allocation basis. The adjusted basis of land and depreciable property is determined
under sections 1012 and 1016, and generally includes the direct and indirect costs of acquiring, constructing, and
rehabilitating the property. Costs otherwise includible in carryover-allocation basis are not excluded by reason
of having been incurred prior to the calendar year in which the carryover allocation is made.

(2) 

Limitations

_For purposes of determining carryover-allocation basis under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the following
limitations apply.

(i) 

Taxpayer must have basis in land or depreciable property related to the project. 

A taxpayer has carryover-allocation basis to the extent that it has basis in land or depreciable property and the land
or depreciable property is reasonably expected to be part of the project for which the carryover allocation is made.
This basis includes all items that are properly capitalizable with respect to the land or depreciable property. For
example, a nonrefundable downpayment for, or an amount paid to acquire an option to purchase, land or depreciable
property may be included in carryover-allocation basis if properly capitalizable into the basis of land or depreciable
property that is reasonably expected to be part of a project.

(ii) 

High cost areas

. Any increase in eligible basis that may result under section 42(d)(5)(C) from a building's location in a qualified
census tract or difficult development area is not taken into account in determining carryover-allocation basis
or reasonably expected basis.

<TEXT>
 

(iii) 

Amounts not treated as paid or incurred

. An amount 
is not includible in carryover-allocation basis unless it is 
treated as paid or incurred under the method of accounting 
used by the taxpayer. For example, a cash method taxpayer 
cannot include construction costs in carryover-allocation 
basis unless the costs have been paid, and an accrual method 
taxpayer cannot include construction costs in carryover- 
allocation basis unless they have been properly accrued. See 
paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section for a special rule for 
fees. 
(iv) 

Fees

. A fee is includible in carryover-allocation 
basis only to the extent the requirements of paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii) of this section are met and_ 
(A) The fee is reasonable; 
(B) The taxpayer is legally obligated to pay the fee; 
(C) The fee is capitalizable as part of the taxpayer's 
basis in land or depreciable property that is reasonably 
expected to be part of the project; 
(D) The fee is not paid (or to be paid) by the taxpayer to 
itself; and 
(E) If the fee is paid (or to be paid) by the taxpayer to a 
related person, and the taxpayer uses the cash method of 
accounting, the taxpayer could properly accrue the fee under 
the accrual method of accounting (considering, for example, 
the rules of section 461(h)). A person is a related person if 
the person bears a relationship to the taxpayer specified in 
sections 267(b) or 707(b)(1), or if the person and the 
taxpayer are engaged in trades or businesses under common 
control (within the meaning of subsections (a) and (b) of 
section 52). 
(3) 

Reasonably expected basis

. Rules similar to the rules 
of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply in determining 
the taxpayer's reasonably expected basis in a project (land 
and depreciable basis) as of the close of the second calendar 
year following the calendar year of the allocation. 
(4) 

Examples

. The following examples illustrate the rules 
of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. 





Example 1

. (i) 

Facts

. C, an accrual-method taxpayer, 
receives a carryover allocation from Agency, the state housing credit agency, in September of 1993. As of that date,
C has 
not begun construction of the low-income housing building C 
plans to build. However, C has owned the land on which C 
plans to build the building since 1985. C's basis in the land 
is $100,000. C reasonably expects that by the end of 1995, 
C's basis in the project of which the building is to be a part 
will be $2,000,000. C also expects that because the project 
is located in a qualified census tract, C will be able to 
increase its basis in the project to $2,600,000. Before the 
close of 1993, C incurs $150,000 of costs for architects' fees 
and site preparation. C properly accrues these costs under 
its method of accounting and capitalizes the costs. 

(ii) 

Determination of carryover-allocation basis

. C's 
$100,000 basis in the land is includible in carryover-allocation basis even though C has owned the land since 1985.

The $150,000 of costs C has incurred for architects' fees and 
site preparation are also includible in carryover-allocation 
basis. The expected increase in basis due to the project's 
location in a qualified census tract is not taken into account 
in determining C's carryover-allocation basis. Accordingly, 
C's carryover-allocation basis in the project of which the 
building is a part is $250,000. 

(iii) 

Determination of whether building is qualified

. C's 
reasonably expected basis in the project at the close of the 
second calendar year following the calendar year of allocation 
is $2,000,000. The expected increase in eligible basis due to 
the project's location in a qualified census tract is not 
taken into account in determining this amount. Because C's 
carryover-allocation basis is more than 10 percent of C's 
reasonably expected basis in the project of which the building 
is a part, the building for which C received the carryover 
allocation is a qualified building for purposes of section 
42(h)(1)(E)(ii) and paragraph (a) of this section. 



Example 2

. (i) 

Facts

. D, an accrual-method taxpayer, 
receives a carryover allocation from Agency, the state housing 
credit agency, on September 11, 1993. As of that date, D has 
not begun construction of the low-income housing building D 
plans to build and D does not have basis in the land on which 
D plans to build the building. In 1993, D incurs some costs 
related to the planned building, including architects' fees. 
However, at the close of 1993, these costs do not exceed 10 
percent of D's reasonably expected basis in the project. 

(ii) 

Determination of whether building is qualified

. 
Because D's carryover-allocation basis is not more than 10 
percent of D's reasonably expected basis in the project of 
which the building is a part, the building for which D 
received a carryover allocation is not a qualified building 
for purposes of section 42(h)(1)(E)(ii) and paragraph (a) of 
this section. The carryover allocation to D is not valid, and 
is treated as if it had not been made. 



(c) 

Verification of basis by Agency

_(1) 

Verification 
requirement

. An Agency that makes a carryover allocation to a 
taxpayer must verify that, as of the close of the calendar 
year of allocation, the taxpayer has incurred more than 10 
percent of the reasonably expected basis in the project (land 
and depreciable basis).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940303-0-00037 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940303-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) 

Manner of verification

. An Agency may verify that a 
taxpayer has incurred more than 10 percent of its reasonably 
expected basis in a project by obtaining a certification from 
the taxpayer, in writing and under penalty of perjury, that 
the taxpayer has incurred by the close of the calendar year of 
the allocation more than 10 percent of the reasonably expected 
basis in the project. The certification must be accompanied 
by supporting documentation that the Agency must review. 
Supporting documentation may include, for example, copies of 
checks or other records of payments. Alternatively, an Agency 
may verify that the taxpayer has incurred adequate basis by 
requiring that the taxpayer obtain from an attorney or 
certified public accountant a written certification to the 
Agency, that the attorney or accountant has examined all 
eligible costs incurred with respect to the project and that, 
based upon this examination, it is the attorney's or 
accountant's belief that the taxpayer has incurred more than 
10 percent of its reasonably expected basis in the project by 
the close of the calendar year of the allocation. 
(3) 

Time of verification

. An Agency may require that the 
basis certification be submitted to or received by the Agency 
prior to the close of the calendar year of allocation or 
within a reasonable time after the close of the calendar year 
of allocation. The Agency will need to verify basis in order 
to accurately complete the Form 8610, Annual Low-Income 
Housing Credit Agencies Report, for the calendar year. If 
certification is not timely made, or supporting documentation 
is lacking, inadequate, or does not actually support the 
certification, the Agency should notify the taxpayer and try 
to get adequate documentation. If the Agency cannot verify 
before the Form 8610 is filed that the taxpayer has satisfied 
the basis requirement for a carryover allocation, the 
allocation is treated as if it had not been made and the 
carryover allocation document should not be filed with the 
Form 8610. 
(d) 

Requirements for making carryover allocations

_
(1) 

In general

. Generally, an allocation is made when an Agency 
issues the Form 8609, Low-Income Housing Credit Allocation 
Certification, for a building. See  1.42-1T(d)(8)(ii). An 
Agency does not issue the Form 8609 for a building until the 
building is placed in service. However, in cases where 
allocations of credit are made pursuant to section 42(h)(1)(E) 
(relating to carryover allocations for buildings) or section 
42(h)(1)(F) (relating to carryover allocations for multiple-building projects), Form 8609 is not used as the allocating

document because the buildings are not yet in service. When 
an allocation is made pursuant to section 42(h)(1) (E) or (F), the allocating document is the document meeting the

requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. In 
addition, when an allocation is made pursuant to section 
42(h)(1)(F), the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section must be met for the allocation to be valid. An 
allocation pursuant to section 42(h)(1) (E) or (F) reduces the 
state housing credit ceiling for the year in which the 
allocation is made, whether or not the Form 8609 is also 
issued in that year. 
(2) 

Requirements for allocation

. An allocation pursuant to 
section 42(h)(1) (E) or (F) is made when an allocation document 
containing the following information is completed, signed, and 
dated by an authorized official of the Agency_

<TEXT>
 

(i) The address of each building in the project, or if none exists, a specific description of the location of each building;


(ii) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the taxpayer receiving the allocation; 

(iii) The name and address of the Agency; 

(iv) The taxpayer identification number of the Agency; 

(v) The date of the allocation; 

(vi) The housing credit dollar amount allocated to the building or project, as applicable; 

(vii) The taxpayer's reasonably expected basis in the project (land and depreciable basis) as of the close of the second
calendar year following the calendar year in which the allocation is made; 

(viii) The taxpayer's basis in the project (land and depreciable basis) as of the close of the calendar year in which
the allocation is made and the percentage that basis bears to the reasonably expected basis in the project (land and
depreciable basis) as of the close of the second following calendar year; 

(ix) The date that each building in the project is expected to be placed in service; and 

(x) The Building Identification Number (B.I.N.) to be assigned to each building in the project. The B.I.N. must reflect
the year an allocation is first made to the building, regardless of the year that the building is placed in service.
This B.I.N. must be used for all allocations of credit for the building. For example, rehabilitation expenditures
treated as a separate new building under section 42(e) should not have a separate B.I.N. if the building to which the
rehabilitation expenditures are made has a B.I.N. In this case, the B.I.N. used for the rehabilitation expenditures
shall be the B.I.N. previously assigned to the building, although the rehabilitation expenditures must have a separate
Form 8609 for the allocation. Similarly, a newly constructed building that receives an allocation of credit in different
calendar years must have a separate Form 8609 for each allocation. The B.I.N. assigned to the building for the first
allocation must be used for the subsequent allocation. 

(3) 

Special rules for project-based allocations

_(i) 

In general.

 An allocation pursuant to section 42(h)(1)(F) (a project-based allocation) must meet the requirements of this section
as well as the requirements of section 42(h)(1)(F), including the minimum basis requirement of section 42(h)(1)(E)(ii).


(ii) 

Requirement of section 42(h)(1)(F)(i)(III).

 An allocation satisfies the requirement of section 42(h)(1)(F)(i)(III) if the Form 8609 that is issued for each building
that is placed in service in the project states the portion of the project-based allocation that is applied to that
building. 

(4) 

Recordkeeping requirements

_(i) 

Taxpayer.

 When an allocation is made pursuant to section 42(h)(1) (E) or (F), the taxpayer must retain a copy of the allocation
document and file an additional copy with the Form 8609 that is issued to the taxpayer for a building after the building
is placed in service. The taxpayer need only file a copy of the allocation document with the Form 8609 for the building
for the first year the credit is claimed. However, the Form 8609 must be filed for the first taxable year in which the
credit is claimed and for each taxable year thereafter throughout the compliance period, whether or not a credit is
claimed for the taxable year.

<PARENT> FR940303-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) 

Agency.

 The Agency must retain a copy of the allocation document and file the original with the Agency's Form 8610 that accounts
for the year the allocation is made. The Agency must also retain a copy of the Form 8609 that is issued to the taxpayer
and file the original with the Agency's Form 8610 that reflects the year the form is issued. 
(5) 

Separate procedure for election of appropriate percentage month.

 If a taxpayer receives an allocation under section 42(h)(1) (E) or (F) and wishes to elect under section 42(b)(2)(A)(ii)
to use the appropriate percentage for a month other than the month in which a building is placed in service, the requirements
specified in  1.42-8 must be met for the election to be effective. 
(e) 

Special rules.

 The following rules apply for purposes of this section. 
(1) 

Treatment of partnerships and other flow-through entities. 

With respect to taxpayers that own projects through partnerships or other flow-through entities (e.g., S corporations,
estates, or trusts), carryover-allocation basis is determined at the entity level using the rules provided by this
section. In addition, the entity is responsible for providing to the Agency the certification and documentation
required under the basis verification requirement in paragraph (c) of this section. 
(2) 

Transferees.

 If land or depreciable property that is expected to be part of a project is transferred after a carryover allocation
has been made for a building that is reasonably expected to be part of the project, but before the close of the calendar
year of the allocation, the transferee's carryover-allocation basis is determined under the principles of this
section and section 42(d)(7). See also Rev. Rul. 91-38, 1991-2 C.B. 3 (see  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter). In addition, the transferee is treated as the taxpayer for purposes of the basis verification requirement
of this section, and therefore, is responsible for providing to the Agency the required certifications and documentation.





 1.42-7 


Substantially bond-financed buildings. [Reserved] 



 1.42-8 


Election of appropriate percentage month. 



(a) 

Election under section 42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) to use the appropriate percentage for the month of a binding agreement

_(1) 

In general.

 For purposes of section 42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I), an agreement between a taxpayer and an Agency as to the housing credit
dollar amount to be allocated to a building is considered binding if it_ 

(i) Is in writing; 

(ii) Is binding under state law on the Agency, the taxpayer, and all successors in interest; 
(iii) Specifies the type(s) of building(s) to which the housing credit dollar amount applies (i.e., a newly constructed
or existing building, or substantial rehabilitation treated as a separate new building under section 42(e)); 
(iv) Specifies the housing credit dollar amount to be allocated to the building(s); and 
(v) Is dated and signed by the taxpayer and the Agency during the month in which the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)
(i) through (iv) of this section are met. 
(2) 

Effect on state housing credit ceiling.

 Generally, a binding agreement described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is an agreement by the Agency to allocate
credit to the taxpayer at a future date. The binding agreement may include a reservation of credit or a binding commitment
(under section 42(h)(1)(C)) to allocate credit in a future taxable year. A reservation or a binding commitment to
allocate credit in a future year has no effect on the state housing credit ceiling until the year the Agency actually
makes an allocation. However, if the binding agreement is also a carryover allocation under section 42(h)(1) (E)
or (F), the state housing credit ceiling is reduced by the amount allocated by the Agency to the taxpayer in the year
the carryover allocation is made. For a binding agreement to be a valid carryover allocation, the requirements of
paragraph (a)(1) of this section and  1.42-6 must be met. 
(3) 

Time and manner of making election.

 An election under section 42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) may be made either as part of the binding agreement under paragraph
(a)(1) of this section to allocate a specific housing credit dollar amount or in a separate document that references
the binding agreement. In either case, the election must_

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940303-0-00040 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940303-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(i) Be in writing; 

(ii) Reference section 42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I); 

(iii) Be signed by the taxpayer; 

(iv) If it is in a separate document, reference the binding 
agreement that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section; and 

(v) Be notarized by the 5th day following the end of the 
month in which the binding agreement was made. 

(4) 

Multiple agreements_

(i) 

Rescinded agreements. 

A 
taxpayer may not make an election under section 
42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) for a building if an election has 
previously been made for the building for a different month. 
For example, assume a taxpayer entered into a binding 
agreement for allocation of a specific housing credit dollar 
amount to a building and made the election under section 
42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) to apply the appropriate percentage for the 
month of the binding agreement. If the binding agreement 
subsequently is rescinded under state law, and the taxpayer 
enters into a new binding agreement for allocation of a 
specific housing credit dollar amount to the building, the 
taxpayer must apply to the building the appropriate percentage 
for the elected month of the rescinded binding agreement. 
However, if no prior election was made with respect to the 
rescinded binding agreement, the taxpayer may elect the 
appropriate percentage for the month of the new binding 
agreement. 

(ii) 

Increases in credit. 

The election under section 
42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I), once made, applies to any increase in the 
credit amount allocated for a building, whether the increase 
occurs in the same or in a subsequent year. However, in the 
case of a binding agreement (or carryover allocation that is 
treated as a binding agreement) to allocate a credit amount 
under section 42(e)(1) for substantial rehabilitation treated 
as a separate new building, a taxpayer may make the election 
under section 42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) notwithstanding that a prior 
election under section 42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) is in effect for a 
prior allocation of credit for a substantial rehabilitation 
that was previously placed in service under section 42(e). 

(5) 

Amount allocated. 

The housing credit dollar amount 
eventually allocated to a building may be more or less than 
the amount specified in the binding agreement. Depending on 
the Agency's determination pursuant to section 42(m)(2) as to 
the financial feasibility of the building (or project), the 
Agency may allocate a greater housing credit dollar amount to 
the building (provided that the Agency has additional housing 
credit dollar amounts available to allocate for the calendar 
year of the allocation) or the Agency may allocate a lesser 
housing credit dollar amount. Under section 42(h)(7)(D), in 
allocating a housing credit dollar amount, the Agency must 
specify the applicable percentage and maximum qualified basis 
of the building. The applicable percentage may be less, but 
not greater than, the appropriate percentage for the month the 
building is placed in service, or the month elected by the 
taxpayer under section 42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I). Whether the 
appropriate percentage is the appropriate percentage for the 
70-percent present value credit or the 30-percent present 
value credit is determined under section 42(i)(2) when the 
building is placed in service. 

(6) 

Procedures_

(i) 

Taxpayer. 

The taxpayer must give the 
original notarized election statement to the Agency before the close of the 5th calendar day following the end of the
month 
in which the binding agreement is made. The taxpayer must 
retain a copy of the binding agreement and the election 
statement and must file an additional copy of each with the 
taxpayer's Form 8609, Low-Income Housing Credit Allocation 
Certification, for the first taxable year in which credit is 
claimed for the building. 

(ii) 

Agency. 

The Agency must file with the Internal 
Revenue Service the original of the binding agreement and the 
election statement with the Agency's Form 8610, Annual Low-Income Housing Credit Agencies Report, that accounts
for the 
year the allocation is actually made. The Agency must also 
retain a copy of the binding agreement and the election 
statement.

Examples.

 The following examples illustrate the 
provisions of this section. In each example, X is the 
taxpayer, Agency is the state housing credit agency, and the 
carryover allocations meet the requirements of  1.42-6 and are 
otherwise valid. 






Example 1. 

(i) In August 1993, X and Agency enter into an 
agreement that Agency will allocate $100,000 of housing credit 
dollar amount for the low-income housing building X is 
constructing. The agreement is binding and meets all the 
requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The 
agreement is a reservation of credit, not an allocation, and 
therefore, has no effect on the state housing credit ceiling. 
On or before September 5, 1993, X signs and has notarized a 
written election statement that meets the requirements of 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The applicable percentage 
for the building is the appropriate percentage for the month 
of August 1993. 

(ii) Agency makes a carryover allocation of $100,000 of 
housing credit dollar amount for the building on October 2, 
1993. The carryover allocation reduces Agency's state housing 
credit ceiling for 1993. Due to unexpectedly high 
construction costs, when X places the building in service in 
July 1994, the product of the building's qualified basis and 
the applicable percentage for the building (the appropriate 
percentage for the month of August 1993) is $150,000, rather 
than $100,000. Notwithstanding that only $100,000 of credit 
was allocated for the building in 1993, Agency may allocate an 
additional $50,000 of housing credit dollar amount for the 
building from its state housing credit ceiling for 1994. The 
appropriate percentage for the month of August 1993 is the 
applicable percentage for the building for the entire $150,000 
of credit allocated for the building, even though separate 
allocations were made in 1993 and 1994. Because allocations 
were made for the building in two separate calendar years, 
Agency must issue two Forms 8609 to X. One Form 8609 must 
reflect the $100,000 allocation made in 1993, and the other 
Form 8609 must reflect the $50,000 allocation made in 1994. 

(iii) X gives the original notarized statement to Agency on or before September 5, 1993, and retains a copy of the binding

agreement, election statement, and carryover allocation 
document. X files a copy of the binding agreement, election 
statement, and carryover allocation document with X's Form 
8609 for the first taxable year in which X claims credit for 
the building. 

(iv) Agency files the original of the binding agreement, 
election statement, and 1993 carryover allocation document 
with its 1993 Form 8610. Agency retains a copy of the binding 
agreement, election statement, and carryover allocation 
document. After the building is placed in service in 1994, 
Agency issues to X a copy of the Form 8609 reflecting the 1993 
carryover allocation of $100,000 and files the original of 
that form with its 1994 Form 8610. Agency also files the 
original of the 1994 Form 8609 reflecting the $50,000 
allocation with its 1994 Form 8610 and issues to X a copy of 
the 1994 Form 8609. Agency retains copies of the Forms 8609 
that are issued to X. 



Example 2. 

(i) In September 1993, X and Agency enter into 
an agreement that Agency will allocate $70,000 of housing 
credit dollar amount for rehabilitation expenditures that X is 
incurring and that X will treat as a new low-income housing 
building under section 42(e)(1). The agreement is binding and 
meets all the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section. The agreement is a reservation of credit, not an 
allocation, and therefore, has no effect on Agency's state 
housing credit ceiling. On or before October 5, 1993, X signs 
and has notarized a written election statement that meets the 
requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The 
applicable percentage for the building is the appropriate 
percentage for the month of September 1993. Agency makes a 
carryover allocation of $70,000 of housing credit dollar 
amount for the building on November 15, 1993. The carryover 
allocation reduces by $70,000 Agency's state housing credit 
ceiling for 1993. 

(ii) In October 1994, X and Agency enter into another 
binding agreement meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section. Under the agreement, Agency will allocate 
$50,000 of housing credit dollar amount for additional 
rehabilitation expenditures by X that qualify as a second 
separate new building under section 42(e)(1). On or before 
November 5, 1994, X signs and has notarized a written election 
statement meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section. On December 1, 1994, X receives a carryover 
allocation under section 42(h)(1)(E) for $50,000. The 
carryover allocation reduces by $50,000 Agency's state housing 
credit ceiling for 1994. The applicable percentage for the 
rehabilitation expenditures treated as the second separate new 
building is the appropriate percentage for the month of 
October 1994, not September 1993. The appropriate percentage 
for the month of September 1993 still applies to the allocation of $70,000 for the rehabilitation expenditures 
treated as the first separate new building. Because 
allocations were made for the building in two separate 
calendar years, Agency must issue two Forms 8609 to X. One 
Form 8609 must reflect the $70,000 allocation made in 1993, 
and the other Form 8609 must reflect the $50,000 allocation 
made in 1994. 

(iii) X gives the first original notarized statement to 
Agency on or before October 5, 1993, and retains a copy of the 
first binding agreement, election statement, and carryover 
allocation document issued in 1993. X gives the second 
original notarized statement to Agency on or before November 
5, 1994, and retains a copy of the second binding agreement, 
election statement, and carryover allocation document issued 
in 1994. X files a copy of the binding agreements, election 
statements, and carryover allocation documents with X's Forms 
8609 for the first taxable year in which X claims credit for 
the buildings. 

(iv) Agency retains a copy of the binding agreements, 
election statements, and carryover allocation documents. 
Agency files the original of the first binding agreement, 
election statement, and 1993 carryover allocation document 
with its 1993 Form 8610. Agency files the original of the 
second binding agreement, election statement, and 1994 
carryover allocation document with its 1994 Form 8610. After 
X notifies Agency of the date each building is placed in 
service, the Agency will issue copies of the respective Forms 
8609 to X, and file the originals of those forms with the 
Agency's Form 8610 that reflects the year each form is issued. 
The Agency also retains copies of the Forms 8609.

(b) 

Election under section 42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II) to use the 
appropriate percentage for the month tax-exempt bonds are 
issued

_(1) 

Time and manner of making election. 

In the case 
of any building to which section 42(h)(4)(B) applies, an 
election under section 42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II) to use the 
appropriate percentage for the month tax-exempt bonds are 
issued must_ 

(i) Be in writing; 
(ii) Reference section 42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II); 
(iii) Specify the percentage of the aggregate basis of the 
building and the land on which the building is located that is 
financed with the proceeds of obligations described in section 
42(h)(4)(A) (tax-exempt bonds); 

(iv) State the month in which the tax-exempt bonds are 
issued; 
(v) State that the month in which the tax-exempt bonds are 
issued is the month elected for the appropriate percentage to 
be used for the building; 
(vi) Be signed by the taxpayer; and 
(vii) Be notarized by the 5th day following the end of the 
month in which the bonds are issued. 

(2) 

Bonds issued in more than one month. 

If a building 
described in section 42(h)(4)(B) (substantially bond-financed 
building) is financed with tax-exempt bonds issued in more 
than one month, the taxpayer may elect the appropriate 
percentage for any month in which the bonds are issued. Once 
the election is made, the appropriate percentage elected 
applies for the building even if all bonds are not issued in 
that month. The requirements of this paragraph (b), including 
the time limitation contained in paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this 
section, must also be met. 

(3) 

Limitations on appropriate percentage. 

Under section 
42(m)(2)(D), the credit allowable for a substantially bond- 
financed building is limited to the amount necessary to assure 
the project's feasibility. Accordingly, in making the 
determination under section 42(m)(2), an Agency may use an 
applicable percentage that is less, but not greater than, the 
appropriate percentage for the month the building is placed in 
service, or the month elected by the taxpayer under section 
42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II). 

(4) 

Procedures

_(i) 

Taxpayer. 

The taxpayer must provide 
the original notarized election statement to the Agency before 
the close of the 5th calendar day following the end of the 
month in which the bonds are issued. If an authority other 
than the Agency issues the tax-exempt bonds, the taxpayer must 
also give the Agency a signed statement from the issuing 
authority that certifies the information described in 
paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section. The taxpayer 
must file a copy of the election statement with the taxpayer's 
Form 8609 for the first taxable year in which credit is 
claimed for the building. The taxpayer must also retain a 
copy of the election statement.

(ii) 

Agency. 

The Agency must file with the Internal 
Revenue Service the original of the election statement and the 
corresponding Form 8609 for the building with the Agency's 
Form 8610 that reflects the year the Form 8609 is issued. The 
Agency must also retain a copy of the election statement and 
the Form 8609. 


 1.42-9 

For use by the general public. 


(a) 

General rule. 

If a residential rental unit in a 
building is not for use by the general public, the unit is not 
eligible for a section 42 credit. A residential rental unit 
is for use by the general public if the unit is rented in a 
manner consistent with housing policy governing non-
discrimination, as evidenced by rules or regulations of the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (24 CFR subtitle A and chapters I through XX). See HUD 
Handbook 4350.3 (or its successor). A copy of HUD Handbook 4350.3 may be requested by writing to: HUD, Directives Distribution
Section, room B-100, 451 7th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. 
(b) 

Limitations. 

Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this 
section, if a residential rental unit is provided only for a 
member of a social organization or provided by an employer for 
its employees, the unit is not for use by the general public 
and is not eligible for credit under section 42. In addition, any residential rental unit that is part of a hospital,

nursing home, sanitarium, lifecare facility, trailer park, or 
intermediate care facility for the mentally and physically 
handicapped is not for use by the general public and is not 
eligible for credit under section 42. 
(c) 

Treatment of units not for use by the general public. 


The costs attributable to a residential rental unit that is 
not for use by the general public are not excludable from 
eligible basis by reason of the unit's ineligibility for the 
credit under this section. However, in calculating the 
applicable fraction, the unit is treated as a residential 
rental unit that is not a low-income unit. 


 1.42-10 

Utility allowances. 


(a) 

Inclusion of utility allowances in gross rent. 

If the 
cost of any utilities (other than telephone) for a residential 
rental unit are paid directly by the tenant(s), the gross rent 
for that unit includes the applicable utility allowance 
determined under this section. This section only applies for 
purposes of determining gross rent under section 
42(g)(2)(B)(ii) as to rent-restricted units. 
(b) 

Applicable utility allowances

_(1) 

FmHA-assisted 
buildings. 

If a building receives assistance from the Farmers 
Home Administration (FmHA-assisted building), the applicable 
utility allowance for all rent-restricted units in the 
building is the utility allowance determined under the method 
prescribed by the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) for the 
building. For example, if a building receives assistance 
under FmHA's section 515 program (whether or not the building 
or its tenants also receive other state or federal 
assistance), the applicable utility allowance for all rent-
restricted units in the building is determined using Exhibit A-6 of 7 CFR part 1944, subpart E (or a successor
method of determining utility allowances). 
(2) 

Buildings with FmHA assisted tenants. 

If any tenant in 
a building receives FmHA rental assistance payments (FmHA 
tenant assistance), the applicable utility allowance for all 
rent-restricted units in the building (including any units 
occupied by tenants receiving HUD rental assistance payments) 
is the applicable FmHA utility allowance. 
(3) 

HUD-regulated buildings. 

If neither a building nor any 
tenant in the building receives FmHA housing assistance, and 
the rents and utility allowances of the building are reviewed 
by HUD on an annual basis (HUD-regulated building), the 
applicable utility allowance for all rent-restricted units in 
the building is the applicable HUD utility allowance. 
(4) 

Other buildings. 

If a building is neither an FmHA-
assisted nor a HUD-regulated building, and no tenant in the 
building receives FmHA tenant assistance, the applicable 
utility allowance for rent-restricted units in the building is 
determined under the following methods. 
(i) 

Tenants receiving HUD rental assistance. 

The 
applicable utility allowance for any rent-restricted units 
occupied by tenants receiving HUD rental assistance payments 
(HUD tenant assistance) is the applicable Public Housing Authority (PHA) utility allowance established for the

Section 8 Existing Housing Program.

(ii) 

Other tenants_

(A) 

General rule. 

If none of the rules 
of paragraphs (b)(1), (2), (3), and (4)(i) of this section 
apply to any rent-restricted units in a building, the 
appropriate utility allowance for the units is the applicable 
PHA utility allowance. However, if a local utility company 
estimate is obtained for any unit in the building in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, that 
estimate becomes the appropriate utility allowance for all 
rent-restricted units of similar size and construction in the 
building. This local utility company estimate procedure is 
not available for and does not apply to units to which the 
rules of paragraphs (b) (1), (2), (3), or (4)(i) of this section 
apply. 
(B) 

Utility company estimate. 

Any interested party 
(including a low-income tenant, a building owner, or an 
Agency) may obtain a local utility company estimate for a 
unit. The estimate is obtained when the interested party 
receives, in writing, information from a local utility company 
providing the estimated cost of that utility for a unit of 
similar size and construction for the geographic area in which 
the building containing the unit is located. The local 
utility company estimate may be obtained by an interested 
party at any time during the building's extended use period 
(see section 42(h)(6)(D)) or, if the building does not have an 
extended use period, during the building's compliance period 
(see section 42(i)(1)). Unless the parties agree otherwise, 
costs incurred in obtaining the estimate are borne by the 
initiating party. The interested party that obtains the local 
utility company estimate (the initiating party) must retain 
the original of the utility company estimate and must furnish 
a copy of the local utility company estimate to the owner of 
the building (where the initiating party is not the owner), 
and the Agency that allocated credit to the building (where 
the initiating party is not the Agency). The owner of the 
building must make available copies of the utility company 
estimate to the tenants in the building. 
(c) 

Changes in applicable utility allowance. 

If at any 
time during the building's extended use period (or, if the 
building does not have an extended use period, the building's 
compliance period), the applicable utility allowance for a 
unit changes, the new utility allowance must be used to 
compute gross rents of rent-restricted units due 90 days after 
the change. For example, if rent must be lowered because a 
local utility company estimate is obtained that shows a higher 
utility cost than the otherwise applicable PHA utility 
allowance, the lower rent must be in effect for rent due more 
than 90 days after the date of the local utility company 
estimate. 


 1.42-11 


Provision of services. 


(a) 

General rule. 

The furnishing to tenants of services 
other than housing (whether or not the services are 
significant) does not prevent the units occupied by the tenants from qualifying as residential rental property 
eligible for credit under section 42. However, any charges to 
low-income tenants for services that are not optional 
generally must be included in gross rent for purposes of 
section 42(g). 
(b) 

Services that are optional_

(1) 

General rule. 

A 
service is optional if payment for the service is not required 
as a condition of occupancy. For example, for a qualified 
low-income building with a common dining facility, the cost of 
meals is not included in gross rent for purposes of section 
42(g)(2)(A) if payment for the meals in the facility is not 
required as a condition of occupancy and a practical 
alternative exists for tenants to obtain meals other than from 
the dining facility. 
(2) 

Continual or frequent services. 

If continual or 
frequent nursing, medical, or psychiatric services are 
provided, it is presumed that the services are not optional 
and the building is ineligible for the credit, as is the case 
with a hospital, nursing home, sanitarium, lifecare facility, 
or intermediate care facility for the mentally and physically 
handicapped. See also  1.42-9(b). 
(3) 

Required services_

(i) 

General rule. 

The cost of 
services that are required as a condition of occupancy must be 
included in gross rent even if federal or state law requires 
that the services be offered to tenants by building owners.

(ii) 

Exceptions_

(A) 

Supportive services. 

Section 
42(g)(2)(B)(iii) provides an exception for certain fees paid 
for supportive services. For purposes of section 
42(g)(2)(B)(iii), a supportive service is any service provided 
under a planned program of services designed to enable 
residents of a residential rental property to remain 
independent and avoid placement in a hospital, nursing home, 
or intermediate care facility for the mentally or physically 
handicapped. For a building described in section 
42(i)(3)(B)(iii) (relating to transitional housing for the 
homeless), a supportive service includes any service provided 
to assist tenants in locating and retaining permanent housing. 
(B) 

Specific project exception. 

Gross rent does not 
include the cost of mandatory meals in any federally-assisted 
project for the elderly and handicapped (in existence on or 
before January 9, 1989) that is authorized by 24 CFR 278 to 
provide a mandatory meals program. 


 1.42-12 


Effective dates and transitional rules. 


(a) 

Effective date. 

The rules set forth in   1.42-6 and 
1.42-8 through 1.42-12 are effective May 2, 1994. However, binding agreements, election statements,
and 
carryover allocation documents entered into before May 2, 1994 that follow the guidance set forth in Notice 89-1,
1989-1 C.B. 620 (see 
 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

through 1.42-12. 
(b) 

Prior periods. 

Notice 89-1, 1989-1 C.B. 620 and Notice 
89-6, 1989-1 C.B. 625 (see  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

Clarification of Period During Which Interest 
Is Allowed With Respect to Certain Overpayments 



<AGENCY>

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulations. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends  301.6611-1 on Procedure and 
Administration. The amendments clarify the period during which 
interest is allowed on overpayments credited against a taxpayer's 
liability for interest and certain additions to the tax. The 
amendments are necessary as a result of changes to the law made by 
the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 and the 
Deficit Reduction Act of 1984. The amendments affect all taxpayers 
that have overpayments credited against underpayments. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 



This document amends the regulations on Procedure and 
Administration (26 CFR part 301) under section 6611 of the Internal 
Revenue Code (Code) to clarify the period during which interest is 
allowed on overpayments that are credited against a taxpayer's 
liability for interest and certain additions to the tax. These 
amendments conform the regulations to section 344 of the Tax Equity 
and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) (Pub. L. 97-248, 96 
Stat. 635), and section 158 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 
(DEFRA) (Pub. L. 98-369, 98 Stat. 696). 

On August 25, 1992, the IRS published in the 

Federal Register

 
a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (57 FR 38457). The IRS did not 
receive any comment letters in response to that notice nor was a 
public hearing requested. The proposed regulations are adopted in 
this Treasury decision. 



Explanation of Provisions 



Interest on Overpayments That Are Credited Against Interest on 
Underpayments 



Section 6611(a) of the Code provides that interest shall be 
allowed and paid on any overpayment in respect of any internal 
revenue tax at the overpayment rate established under section 6621. 
Under section 6402(a), the Secretary may credit any overpayment 
(including any interest allowed thereon) against any liability 
imposed under the Code on the taxpayer. Under section 6611(b)(1), 
interest is allowed on an overpayment that is so credited from the 
date of the overpayment to the due date of the taxpayer's liability 
against which the overpayment is credited. For purposes of this 
interest computation, specific due dates are provided in 
 301.6611-1(h). 

Generally, section 6601(f) provides that once an overpayment 
is credited to satisfy a taxpayer's liability, interest no longer 
accrues on that liability. Section 344 of TEFRA added section 6622 
of the Code, which requires interest imposed by the Code to be 
compounded daily. The effect of section 6601(f) on the compounding 
requirement of section 6622 is that once an overpayment is credited 
to satisfy the taxpayer's liability for interest, that credit cuts 
off any further compounding of that interest (i.e., interest no 
longer accrues on the taxpayer's interest liability against which 
the credit has been made). 

Similarly, it is appropriate that no interest liability to the 
taxpayer accrues on the overpayment once the overpayment is 
credited to satisfy the taxpayer's liability for interest. Thus, 
 301.6611-1(h)(2)(v) is amended to clarify that interest does not 
continue to accrue on any portion of an overpayment that is 
credited against the taxpayer's liability for interest. 



Interest on Overpayments That Are Credited Against Certain 
Additions to the Tax

Prior to DEFRA, interest only accrued on additions to the tax from the date of notice and demand, and then only if not
paid within 10 days from the date of notice and demand. In section 158 of DEFRA, Congress added section 6601(e)(2)(B)
to the Code, which requires taxpayers to pay interest on certain additions to tax from the due date of the relevant return
(including any extensions) until the addition to the tax is paid. The number of additions to the tax that bear interest
from the due date of the return was increased by Congress in 1988 and again in 1989. Thus,  301.6611-1(h)(2)(vi)
is amended to clarify that no interest is allowed on any portion of an overpayment that is credited against certain
additions to the tax for any period after the due date of the return (including extensions) to which the addition to
the tax relates. 



Prior Regulations Obsolete 



These regulations are effective for credits made on or after August 25, 1992. It should be noted that, since the enactment
of section 6622 of the Code in TEFRA, the IRS has treated  301.6611-1(h)(2)(v) of the prior regulations
as obsolete. Likewise, the Service has treated  301.6611-1(h)(2)(vi) of the prior regulations as obsolete
with respect to certain additions to the tax since the enactment of section 6601(e)(2)(B) in DEFRA. Thus, the IRS has
computed and is currently computing interest in a fashion consistent with these amendments. 



Effect on Other Documents



On October 9, 1984, the IRS published in the 

Federal Register

 (49 FR 39566 [LR-280-82, 1984-2 C.B. 860]) proposed amendments to  301.6611-1 and  301.6601-1
on Procedure and Administration. The proposed amendments revised  301.6611-1 to reflect section 346
of TEFRA and section 714(n) of DEFRA, eliminated certain deadwood provisions, and reorganized  301.6611-1.
The proposed amendments did not, however, include revisions to take into account section 344 of TEFRA or section 158
of DEFRA because those sections were beyond the scope of that regulation project. The proposed amendments have not
been adopted as final regulations. If the proposed amendments are adopted as final regulations, their rules (and,
to the extent necessary, their effective dates) will be modified to be consistent with these regulations. 



Special Analyses 



It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business. 



Drafting Information



The principal author of these regulations is Forest Boone of the Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Income Tax &
Accounting). However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.

Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Lake Washington, WA 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT. 


 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule. 


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is reinstating the temporary regulations governing the operation of the Evergreen Point Bridge (State
Route 520) across Lake Washington between Seattle and Bellevue, Washington. This rule will be in effect through June
30, 1994. The amended regulations will provide for the reasonable needs of navigation and allow the bridge owner to
provide openings only during periods of reduced vehicular traffic if 12 hours notice is furnished. The purpose of
this measure is to avoid risking failure of the drawspan in the open position during commuter hours as has previously
occurred. The hours of limited operation insure sufficient time for the owner to restore the retractable span to the
closed position before road traffic becomes heavy. During the period that this rule is in effect malfunctions of the
draw mechanism will be analyzed and repaired. 


 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Drafting Information 



The drafters of these regulations are Austin Pratt, project officer, and Lieutenant Laticia J. Argenti, project
attorney. 



Regulatory History 



This same regulation was put into effect on September 21, 1992. It has since expired. On November 2, 1993, the Coast
Guard published a proposed rule (58 FR 58518) to consider the reinstatement of the temporary regulations. The Commander,
Thirteenth Coast Guard District, also published a public notice on November 19, 1993. Both articles solicited comments
from interested parties until December 17, 1993. No objections to the temporary regulations were received. A public
hearing was not requested and was not held. 



Background and Purpose 



The temporary regulations allow the bridge owner to limit openings for the passage of vessels to late at night. These
restricted hours of operation enable the owner to restore the bridge to the closed position in the event of a malfunction
prior to the daylight hours of heavy commuter traffic. Openings during the day are excluded. With 12 hours notice,
the bridge will be opened from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. Sunday night through Friday morning and from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. Friday night
through Sunday morning. The hours for opening on weeknights are more restricted to give greater time to restore the
drawspan in the event of a failure prior to the start of heavy commuter traffic.

Discussions of Comments and Changes



No comments were received in opposition to the proposed rulemaking.



Regulatory Evaluation



This temporary final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not
significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,
1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impacts of this rule to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.
We base our decision on the light and infrequent commercial traffic on the subject waterways during the hours affected
by this rule.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.) the U.S. Coast Guard must consider whether rules will
have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act. Because this final rule imposes no new requirements on small
businesses and will result in partial relief from a regulatory burden on the owner or operator of these bridges, the
Coast Guard does not expect this rule to have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This rulemaking contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 et seq.).



Federalism



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.g.(5) of
Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, promulgation of operating requirements or procedures for drawbridges is categorically
excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination has been prepared and
placed in the rulemaking docket.

Safety Zone Regulations; North Miami Beach, FL


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Coast Guard, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Temporary final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone in the Intracoastal Waterway at Bakers Haulover Inlet Florida. This
safety zone is needed to protect vessels from a safety hazard associated with severe shoaling in the channel between
Biscayne Bay daybeacon 6 (light list number 41185) and Biscayne Bay light 9 (light list number 41210). Entry into this
safety zone by tugs towing or pushing barges with drafts exceeding four feet, beams exceeding 16 feet, and all barges
carrying oil, or hazardous material is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Miami, Florida or
his designated representative.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause
exists for making it effective in less than 30 days after 

Federal Register

 publication. Publishing a NPRM and delaying its effective date would be contrary to public safety interests since
immediate action is needed to prevent potential damage to the public.


Drafting Information


The drafters of this regulation are Chief Boatswains Mate Robert F. Chason, Project Officer for the Captain of the
Port, Miami, Florida, and Lieutenant J. Losego, Project Attorney, Seventh Coast Guard District Legal Office.


Discussion of Regulations


This safety zone is needed to protect vessels from a safety hazard associated with severe shoaling in the channel between
Biscayne Bay daybeacon 6, (light list number 41185) and Biscayne Bay light 9 (light list number 41210). There have
been several recent tug and barge groundings caused by the current channel conditions, and the potential for a severe
marine casualty is great if unrestricted commercial vessel traffic is allowed to continue. This area of the channel
is scheduled to be dredged to its published depth between February 7, 1994 and April 11, 1994. Until the channel is dredged,
entry into this safety zone by tugs towing or pushing barges with drafts exceeding four feet, beams exceeding 16 feet,
and all barges carrying oil, or hazardous material is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Miami,
Florida or his designated representative.

Federalism




This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and
it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Environmental Assessment



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal consistent with Section 2.B.2.C. of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, and actions to protect public safety have been determined to be categorically excluded from
further environmental documentation.



Economic Assessment and Certification



This proposal is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant
under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). The economic
impact of this proposal is expected to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. The safety zone
will only be in effect 5 hours of one day, February 11, 1994. 

Since the impact of this proposal is expected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies that, if adopted, it will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains corrections to a final rule which was published on April 8, 1981 relating to approval of a Minnesota
State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision consisting of a sulfur dioxide control plan and emission limitations contained
in revised operating permits for the Rochester and Twin Cities nonattainment area. This technical amendment corrects
an error of codification in the CFR and prevents further confusion in citing the Minnesota SIP revision.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
On April 8, 1981, (46 FR 20996), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) approved a Minnesota State
Implementation Plan (SIP) revision consisting of a sulfur dioxide control plan and emission limitations contained
in revised operating permits for the Rochester and Twin Cities nonattainment area. USEPA erroneously codified its
approval at 
40 CFR 52.1220(c)(16). Paragraph (c)(16) had already been utilized to codify USEPA's March 4, 1981 (46 FR 15138) approval
of a revision to provide for modification of the Minnesota air quality surveillance network. 



This revision is related to items incorporated by reference into the Minnesota State Implementation Plan which is
designated as 40 CFR 52.1220, Identification of plan, subpart Y_Minnesota.


Need for Correction 


Duplicate paragraphs 52.1220(c)(16) make citations to these paragraphs confusing and unclear. For this reason,
USEPA is publishing this technical amendment to avoid further confusion.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice amends the NASA FAR Supplement to provide for selection/down-selection between phases of a Major System
Acquisition utilizing a streamlined approach that eliminates the previous NASA requirement to provide a new, formal
solicitation for each phase of the acquisition.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background



On November 4, 1993, an interim rule to amend the NASA FAR Supplement to streamline the major system acquisition process
was published in the 

Federal Register

 for comment (58 FR 58791-58798). In addition to pointing out errata and inconsistencies that are corrected
in the final rule, the public comments on the interim rule addressed several substantive issues and suggested NASA
consider revising its policy to address them.

The first of these issues is that the NASA interim rule, by prohibiting the establishment of contractual requirements
for subsequent phase proposals, may not provide a mechanism to ensure that the contractors in the initial phase of
the procurement complete their efforts and submit proposals for the subsequent phase in a timely and responsive manner.
The comment suggests that, absent the appropriate leverage, contractors could ``game'' the system to gain a competitive
advantage in the down-selection by delaying proposal submission until their designs matured. The comment recommends
that NASA revise its interim rule to ensure the integrity of the process in this area.

Although the comment correctly cites the NASA prohibition against establishing a contract requirement for subsequent
phase proposals, it apparently misunderstands the NASA policy relative to requesting these proposals and ensuring
their timely submittal. As stated in the interim rule, NASA will request proposals for the subsequent phase of the
procurement from the preceding phase contractors (and any outside source that wishes to submit one) at a defined point
during initial phase performance. This request will advise offerors that proposals will be required by a date certain
and that FAR 52.215-10, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Proposals, applies. This clause
states that any proposal received after the required submission date will not be considered unless one of the specified
exceptions applies. Consequently, if an initial phase contractor does not submit a proposal by the due date and one
of the exceptions in FAR 52.215-10 does not apply, they forfeit the opportunity to continue in the competition,
and the procurement will proceed without them. NASA believes that this procedure best suits our goals. We are not interested
in requiring a contractor to submit a proposal if that offeror believes its design approach is not competitive. To
do so would be to force a contractor to expend its resources in pursuit of a contract it has no reasonable expectation
of winning, and the resultant ``competition'' could fairly be labeled a sham. Moreover, we expect contractors in
progressive competition procurements to be committed to satisfying our requirements, and to work diligently toward
providing, at the times specified, the products required for the Government's down-selection decisions. It is not
in their interests to do otherwise. The hypothetical instance described in the public comment of a contractor attempting
to ``game'' the system is effectively precluded by the proposal request procedures described above that would eliminate
them from consideration for subsequent phase awards. No revision to our policy is necessary in this area.

A second public comment requested clarification of the interim rule to address the issue of proposals submitted for
subsequent phases by sources other than the preceding phase contractors and how they would be treated. By way of example,
the comment questioned whether such outside offerors have the right to protest and debriefing.

NASA's progressive competitions are full and open competitions throughout the process. All proposals received,
whether from preceding phase contractors or from outside sources, are considered to be solicited and are given full,
unbiased evaluation under NASA SEB procedures. Since outside offerors enjoy the same standing as the preceding phase
contractors, they have the full rights of any offeror on a NASA procurement, including protest and debriefing. To
accord a diminished set of rights to outside offerors would compromise both the commitment to full and open competition
and the agency's source selection process. Even-handed treatment of all offerors is inherent in both our SEB procedures
and the progressive competition policy, and no revision to our policy is necessary to address the public comment.

<TEXT>
 

A third public comment requested further definition of the proposal preparation information that will be provided
to offerors who are not preceding phase contractors. 

The NASA interim rule specifies that such information includes the ``previously issued solicitation; the preceding
phase contracts; the preceding phase system performance and design requirements; all proposal preparation instructions;
and evaluation factors, subfactors and elements''. NASA considers this list to be adequately inclusive for a policy
that must address a wide range of programs. Individual programs will have unique information that will be provided
to outside offerors, but these requirements cannot be anticipated at this time. No revision to our policy is necessary
in this area. 

The last substantive public comment recommended clarification of the procedure in 1834.005-1(d)(7) by which
subsequent phase offerors other than initial phase contractors are eliminated from the competition if their proposals
do not demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to that of the preceding phase contracts. The comment suggested that
this process be explicitly linked to the competitive range standard in FAR 15.609(b). 

Elimination of an offeror is technically a competitive range determination. Accordingly, we believe that explicit
linkage of 1834.005-1(d)(7) and FAR 15.609(b) is unnecessary. Furthermore, NASA source selection procedures
in 1815.613-71(b) already discuss elimination of offerors with more precision than a cross reference to the
FAR would provide. Under these procedures, offerors may be eliminated at several points during the selection process,
the first of which is through an initial identification of unacceptable proposals. This process occurs during initial
review, before the proposal is formally scored or evaluated against the evaluation factors. At this time, if a proposal's
deficiencies are clearly of such a magnitude that it warrants discontinuance of the evaluation, NASA eliminates
that proposals from further consideration. The procedures of 1834.005-1(d)(7) cited in the public comment
relate to this process. For those proposals still under consideration, NASA performs a full evaluation against the
evaluation factors and makes a competitive range determination based on that evaluation. These long-standing procedures
provide a clear description of the NASA evaluation process. Adoption of the public comment recommendation would
only cloud this description, and no change is made to the interim rule in this area. 

NASA is adopting as a final rule the text set out in the interim rule with minor changes that have no significant effect
on the substance of the interim rule. First, the interim rule did not specify dates for the two clauses added to the NASA
FAR Supplement, 1852.234-70 and 1852.234-71. These clauses are dated November 1993 in this final rule.
Second, the interim rule included a number of references to NASA Management Instruction (NMI) 7102.4, ``Management
of Major System Programs and Projects.'' Several of these references should also have cited the NMI's companion NASA
Handbook (NHB) 7120.5, ``Management of Major System Programs and Projects Handbook''. These NHB references are
included in this final rule. Third, a number of editorial changes are made to correct errata and inconsistencies in
the publishes interim rule. 



Impact



NASA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 

et seq.

). This rule does not impose any reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act.

<DOCTITLE>Applicability of NASA Formal Source Evaluation Board (SEB) Procedures</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Procurement, Procurement Policy Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NASA has amended the NASA FAR Supplement part 1815 to make editorial corrections and administrative changes to clarify
when formal SEB procedures are to be used.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Background


NASA formal SEB procedures apply to all competitive negotiated procurements of $25 million or more, except for specific
categories of procurements (e.g., NASA Research Announcements) that require their own unique procedures. For actions
under $25 million, the formal procedures are optional. Existing agency regulations on this issue are not clear, and
the NASA FAR Supplement is revised to clarify the applicability of formal SEB procedures. These revisions affect
internal procedures only and have no direct impact on external entities. The revisions are issued as a final rule to
ensure immediate implementation.


Availability of NASA FAR Supplement


The NASA FAR Supplement, of which this proposed coverage will become a part, is codified in 48 CFR, chapter 18, and is
available in its entirety on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office,
Washington, DC 20402. Cite GPO Subscription Stock Number 933-003-00000-1. It is not distributed
to the public, either in whole or in part, directly by NASA.


Impact


NASA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 

et seq.

). This rule does not impose any reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act.

PART 1815_CONTRACTING BY NEGOTIATION



2. Section 1815.610 is revised to read as follows:



1815.610

 Written or oral discussion.



(FAR) 48 CFR 15.610(c)(2) is not applicable to NASA competitive negotiated procurements. The limited discussion
procedures described in (FAR) 48 CFR 15.613 and 48 CFR 1815.613 shall be used instead.

3. Section 1815.613-70 is revised to read as follows:



1815.613-70

 General.



The source selection procedures in (FAR) 48 CFR 15.610, as modified by (FAR) 48 CFR 15.613 and 48 CFR 1815.613 to limit
discussions with offerors, apply to all NASA competitive negotiated procurements except those conducted under
the following procedures:

(a) Announcements of Opportunity (see 1870.103, App. I).

(b) NASA Research Announcements (see 1835.016-70 and 1870.203, App. I).

(c) The Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program and the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) pilot
program under the authority of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638).

(d) Architect and Engineering (A&E) services (see (FAR) 48 CFR 36.6 and 48 CFR 1836.6).

4. In section 1815.613-71, paragraph (a) is revised to read as follows:



1815.613-71

 Evaluation and negotiation of procurements conducted in accordance with source evaluation board (SEB) procedures.



(a) 

Applicability.

 Unless one of the exceptions in 1815.613-70 (a) through (d) applies, the formal SEB procedures of 1870.303,
App. I, shall be followed in all competitive negotiated procurements of $25 million or more (including the value of
multiple awards, options, and later phases of the same project). The formal SEB procedures may be used in lesser valued
procurements at the discretion of the Procurement Officer.

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is closing the directed fishery for aggregate species in the rock sole/``other flatfish'' fishery category
by vessels using trawl gear in Bycatch Limitation Zone 1 (Zone 1) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management
Area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the prohibited species bycatch allowance of red king crab
to the trawl rock sole/``other flatfish'' fishery category in Zone 1. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI 
exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce 
according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish 
Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP) 
prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under 
authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations 
implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. 



The 1994 prohibited species bycatch allowance of red king 
crab in Zone 1 for the trawl rock sole/``other flatfish'' fishery 
category, which is defined at  675.21(b)(1)(iii)(B)(2), was 
established as 110,000 crabs by the final 1994 initial specifications (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994). 

The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with  675.21(c)(1)(i), that the prohibited
species bycatch allowance of red king crab for the trawl rock sole/``other flatfish'' fishery in Zone 1 has been reached.
Therefore, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for aggregate species in the rock sole/``other flatfish'' fishery
category by vessels using trawl gear in Zone 1 of the BSAI from 12 noon, A.l.t., February 28, 1994, through 12 midnight,
A.l.t., December 31, 1994. 

Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be 
found in the regulations at  675.20(h).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is closing the directed fishery for pollock by 
vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component 
in the Aleutian Islands subarea (AI) of the Bering Sea and 
Aleutian Islands (BSAI) management area. This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the pollock total allowable
catch (TAC) for the offshore component in this area. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI 
exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce 
according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish 
Fishery of the BSAI Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific 
Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson 
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels 
is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 
620 and 675. 



In accordance with  675.20(a)(7)(ii), the TAC of pollock for vessels catching pollock for processing by the
offshore component in the AI was established by the final 1994 initial groundfish specifications (59 FR 7656, February
16, 1994), as 31,272 metric tons (mt). 

The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), 
has determined, in accordance with  675.20(a)(8), that the 
pollock TAC for the offshore component in the AI soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional Director has established
a directed fishing allowance of 27,772 mt after determining that 3,500 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed
fishing for other species in the AI. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock by operators
of vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component in the AI, effective from 12 noon A.l.t., March
1, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. 

Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at  675.20(h).
