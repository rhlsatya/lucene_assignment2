ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations to establish the method used to add cost-of-living
adjustments (COLA's) to recomputed annuities of former Members of Congress who perform additional service after
retirement as Members and the method for determining that cap on COLA's as it affects these former Members and under
the Civil Service Retirement System. These regulations interpret section 8340 of title 5, United States Code, as
it affects these computations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On November 10, 1993, we published (at 58 FR 59658) proposed regulations to establish the method used to add cost-of-living
adjustments (COLA's) to recomputed annuities of former Members of Congress who perform additional service after
retirement as Members and the method for determining the cap on COLA's as it affects these former Members under the
Civil Service Retirement System. We received no comments on the proposed regulations.






E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation




I have determined that is not a major rule as defined under section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.




Regulatory Flexibility Act



I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because the regulation will only affect former Members of Congress who are reemployed by the Government and their
survivors.

Notification of Spent Fuel Management and Funding Plans by Licensees of Prematurely Shut Down Power Reactors 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations to clarify the timing of notification to the
NRC of spent fuel management and funding plans by licensees of those nuclear power reactors that have been shut down
before the expected end of their operating lives. The final rule requires that a licensee submit such notification
either within 2 years after permanently ceasing operation of its licensed power reactor or no later than 5 years before
the reactor operating license expires, whichever event occurs first. Licensees of nuclear power reactors that have
already permanently ceased operation by the effective date of this rule are required to submit such notification
within 2 years after the effective date of this rule. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On June 30, 1993, the NRC published in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of proposed rulemaking to clarify the timing of notification to the NRC of spent fuel management and funding
plans by licensees of those nuclear power reactors that have been shut down prematurely (58 FR 34947). 



1. Comments Received 



The NRC received four comments on the proposed rule. Three of the four comments came from licensees or their representatives
and supported the rule as proposed. These commenters agreed with the NRC assessment that the proposed rule is administrative
in nature and would produce consistency with the decommissioning rule. However, each of the three recommended that
the rule amendments should apply only prospectively; that is, the rule should not apply to licensees whose power reactors
have already permanently ceased operating. The commenters requested that the NRC allow licensees of these plants
to submit spent fuel management funding plans on a case-by-case schedule. One commenter recommended that the NRC
add a statement to this effect to the final rule. 

A fourth commenter supported the concept of requiring the submittal of spent fuel management and funding plans soon
after permanent shutdown, but recommended that licensees be required to submit these plans within 60 days after permanent
shutdown. 

The three commenters representing licensees also supported the NRC intent to initiate rulemaking on including spent
fuel costs as part of decommissioning costs only after careful consideration of the database that the NRC is developing
in this area. In a related area, one of these commenters noted that the NRC currently has regulations in place in 10 CFR
part 72 to ensure a licensee's financial qualifications for the safe construction, operation, and decommissioning
of an independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI). The fourth commenter supported rulemaking on funding
assurance for spent fuel storage costs that would be similar to, but separate from, decommissioning costs. 



2. NRC Response to Comments 



The NRC responds as follows to the issues raised by the commenters:

<DOCNO> FR940304-0-00004 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940304-0-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) 

The rule should only apply prospectively. 

NRC response:

 The NRC disagrees that this rule should not apply to licensees of plants that have already permanently ceased operating.
This rule should be consistent with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.82(a), which requires all power plant licensees to
submit decommissioning plans no later than 2 years after permanently ceasing operations regardless of how long the
plant operated. The NRC recently amended 10 CFR 50.82(a) to allow the collection period of any shortfall of decommissioning
funds to be determined on a case-by-case basis for plants that had been shut down prematurely (57 FR 30383, July 9, 1992).
However, even licensees of these plants must submit their decommissioning plans within the 2-year time frame, notwithstanding
the collection period ultimately adopted. 

To maintain consistency, the NRC believes that the 2-year limit should be applied to plants already shut down. However,
to assure that the NRC does not impose unnecessary burdens on these licensees, the final rule has been modified to allow
these licensees 2 years from the effective date of the rule to submit their spent fuel management and funding plans.

1

 





(2) 

Submittal of spent fuel management and funding plans should be required within 60 days of permanent shutdown of the
facility, rather than within 2 years. 

NRC Response:

 The NRC disagrees with this comment. Sixty days is too short a period in which to develop a meaningful spent fuel management
and funding plan. Because licensees will normally develop these plans in conjunction with their decommissioning
plans, the NRC should maintain consistency by requiring the same 2-year limit for both spent fuel management and funding
plans and the overall decommissioning plan, which includes decommissioning funding. 

(3) 

Costs associated with the construction, operation, and decommissioning of ISFSIs are already assured by provisions
in 10 CFR Part 72. 

NRC Response: 

The NRC agrees that part 72 contains provisions to ensure that licensees have adequate funds to construct, operate,
and decommission ISFSIs. Spent fuel management and funding plans submitted in compliance with the amended  50.54(bb)
need not cover spent fuel while it is being stored in an ISFSI in compliance with part 72. The NRC will consider whether
these provisions are adequate when it evaluates whether it is necessary to include spent fuel management and funding
as part of decommissioning costs. 



Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability 



This final rule clarifies the timing of the submittal of plans for managing and providing funding for managing all
irradiated fuel for those licensees whose power reactors are shut down prematurely. This action is required to coordinate
the submittal of spent fuel management and funding plans with the submittal of decommissioning plans for prematurely
shut down reactors. Because management and funding of spent fuel can have a significant impact on the method and timing
of decommissioning, licensees should submit their plans for spent fuel management and funding to be consistent with
the timing provisions for decommissioning plans in  50.82(a) (i.e., no later than 2 years after permanent shutdown).

Neither this action nor the alternative of maintaining the existing rule would significantly affect the environment.
Changes in the timing of the submittal of spent fuel management and funding for prematurely shut down power reactors
would not alter the effect on the environment of the licensed activities considered in either the final spent fuel
disposition rule 
(49 FR 34689; August 31, 1984) or the final decommissioning rule (53 FR 24018; June 27, 1988) as analyzed in the Final
Generic Environmental Impact Statement on Decommissioning of Nuclear Facilities (NUREG-0586, August 1988).
The alternative to this action would not significantly affect the environment. Therefore, the Commission has determined,
under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in subpart A of
10 CFR part 51, that this rule will not be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment
and, therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required. No other agencies or persons were contacted for
this action, and no other documents related to the environmental impact of this action exist. The foregoing constitutes
the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact for this final rule. 


Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 


This final rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval
number [3150-0011]. 


Regulatory Analysis 


On August 31, 1984, the NRC published a final rule, ``Requirements for Licensee Actions Regarding the Disposition
of Spent Fuel Upon Expiration of Reactor Operating Licensees.'' (49 FR 34689). As part of this rule, the NRC required
power reactor licensees to submit for NRC review and approval, no later than 5 years before expiration of the reactor
operating license, their plans for managing spent fuel at their site until title to the spent fuel is transferred to
the Department of Energy (DOE). These plans are to include plans for funding of spent fuel management before transfer
to DOE. 
On June 27, 1988, the Commission promulgated its final decommissioning rule (53 FR 24019). Section 50.82 of this rule
provides that licensees of all power reactors that permanently cease operation after July 27, 1988, including those
that shut down prematurely, must apply to the NRC to decommission their facilities within 2 years following permanent
cessation of operations. Section 50.82(b)(1)(iii) further provides that the proposed decommissioning plan submitted
by the licensee should consider such factors as the ``unavailability of waste disposal capacity and other site-specific
factors affecting the licensee's capability to carry out decommissioning safely * * *.'' The Commission
requires licensees to submit decommissioning plans in a timely manner after they permanently cease operations at
their facilities. The NRC's regulations recognize that a licensee's ability to plan properly and safely for decommissioning
depends on a licensee's ability to manage and dispose of its spent fuel. Thus, the timing of requirements for submittal
of plans for spent fuel management and storage should be consistent with the timing for submittal of decommissioning
plans, including those for power reactors that have been shut down prematurely. Therefore, the NRC is amending 10
CFR 50.54(bb) to require each power reactor licensee to notify the NRC of its program to manage and provide funding
for management of the irradiated fuel at its reactor either within 2 years after the licensee permanently ceases operation
of its reactor or no later than 5 years before its reactor operating license expires, whichever occurs first. Licensees
of nuclear power reactors that have already permanently ceased operations by the effective date of this rule are required
to submit such notification within 2 years after the effective date of this rule. 
Although the timing of preparation and submittal of plans for management and funding of spent fuel would be formally
advanced for licensees that shut down their power reactors prematurely, these licensees typically would have already
evaluated spent fuel management and funding issues before submitting decommissioning plans required under 10 CFR
50.82. This rule merely makes 10 CFR 50.54(bb) submittal schedular requirements consistent with 10 CFR 50.82. Thus,
there should be no substantive impact on power reactor licensees. 
This final rule would not create substantial costs for other licensees. This final rule also will not significantly
affect State and local governments and geographical regions, or the environment, or create substantial costs to
the NRC or other Federal agencies. The foregoing discussion constitutes the regulatory analysis for this final rule.



Regulatory Flexibility Certification 


As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies that this final rule
will not have a significant impact upon a substantial number of small entities. The rule will potentially affect approximately
115 nuclear power reactor operating licenses. Nuclear power plant licensees do not fall within the definition of
small businesses as defined in section 3 of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632, the Small Business Size Standards
of the Small Business Administrator (13 CFR part 121), or the Commission's Size Standards (56 FR 56671, November 6,
1991).

Backfit Analysis 


The NRC has determined that this final rule does not impose a backfit as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1). Therefore,
a backfit analysis is not required for this final rule.

(bb) For nuclear power reactors licensed by the NRC, the licensee shall, within 2 years following permanent cessation
of operation of the reactor or 5 years before expiration of the reactor operating license, whichever occurs first,
submit written notification to the Commission for its review and preliminary approval of the program by which the
licensee intends to manage and provide funding for the management of all irradiated fuel at the reactor following
permanent cessation of operation of the reactor until title to the irradiated fuel and possession of the fuel is transferred
to the Secretary of Energy for its ultimate disposal in a repository. Licensees of nuclear power reactors that have
permanently ceased operation by April 4, 1994 are required to submit such written notification by April 4, 1996. Final
Commission review will be undertaken as part of any proceeding for continued licensing under part 50 or part 72 of this
chapter. The licensee must demonstrate to NRC that the elected actions will be consistent with NRC requirements for
licensed possession of irradiated nuclear fuel and that the actions will be implemented on a timely basis. Where implementation
of such actions requires NRC authorizations, the licensee shall verify in the notification that submittals for such
actions have been or will be made to NRC and shall identify them. A copy of the notification shall be retained by the licensee
as a record until 
expiration of the reactor operating license. The licensee shall notify the NRC of any significant changes in the proposed
waste management program as described in the initial notification.

Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes, Excluding Model 747-400 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series
airplanes, that currently requires repetitive visual inspections of wire bundles to detect damage due to chafing,
and repair of damaged wires. This amendment revises the inspection and repair procedures, and provides a terminating
action, which, if accomplished, will eliminate the need for the currently required inspections. This amendment
is prompted by data that substantiates the need for new inspection and repair procedures. The actions specified by
this AD are intended to prevent smoke and fire in the cockpit emanating from wire bundles and loss of essential cockpit
instruments necessary for continued safe flight and landing of the airplane. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations by superseding AD 92-27-12, Amendment
39-8447 (57 FR 61255, December 24, 1992), which is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes,
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 3, 1993 (58 FR 31481). The action proposed to supersede AD 92-27-12 to require revised repetitive
visual inspections of wire bundles to detect damage due to chafing, and repair or replacement of damaged wires; and
to clarify the location of the affected wire bundles above the P6 panel. That action also would provide an optional
terminating action for the repetitive visual inspections. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
One commenter supports the proposed rule. 
The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of one of its 
members, requests an extension of the compliance time for the proposed initial repetitive inspection of 120 days
to 4,000 flight hours for Model 747-100 series airplanes, since its airplanes were not manufactured with BMS
13-51 type wire (Kapton insulated). The member points out that the description of the wire bundle failure which
prompted issuance of AD 92-27-12 is typical for aromatic polyimid (Kapton insulated) type wire bundles.
The member notes the similarity between that incident and the incident involving a Lockheed Model L-1011 series
airplane that prompted the FAA to issue AD 84-04-01, 
Amendment 39-4815 (49 FR 6705, February 23, 1984). The member asserts that neither AD 92-27-12 nor
this proposal compare the different failure modes and effects of aromatic polyimide (Kapton insulated) type wiring
with other types of wire insulation. Finally, the member notes that the service history of Boeing Model 747-100
series airplanes indicates that there have been no reported wire bundle chafing problems in the area of concern. 
The FAA does not concur on the basis of the following reasons: 
The proposed AD addresses a potentially hazardous condition involving the 
manner in which certain wire bundles were installed in the affected airplanes. The type of insulation used on the wires
is not directly relevant to the hazardous condition. It is the position of the FAA that the short circuit hazard will
eventually occur on any Model 747-100, -200, or -300 series airplane with improperly installed
wire bundles, regardless of the type of wire insulation. The intent of the proposed AD is to prevent the occurrence
of a short circuit, not to alter the failure mode and/or effects of such a failure. The relevance of the type of wire insulation
is limited to the amount of time required for the short circuit to occur, once chafing has begun. Types of wire utilizing
harder, more abrasion resistant insulation will endure chafing for longer periods of time before occurrence of a
short circuit. In this respect, Polyimide insulated wire could possibly be superior to softer types of wire insulation,
such as Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) insulated types of wire. 
Further, the FAA points out that the Model L-1011 incident that prompted the issuance of AD 84-04-01
was not the direct result of the use of polyimide insulated wire. That incident was apparently due to ``* * * mechanical
damage to wire insulation due to continuing chafing * * *'' This information was published with that
AD in the 

Federal Register

 (49 FR 6705, February 23, 1984).

<PARENT> FR940304-0-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Additionally, the FAA has determined that the 120-day compliance time for the proposed initial repetitive inspection
is justified when an additional hazard is considered, which was not present in the Model L-1011 incident. The
Model L-1011 incident resulted in a smoke and fire hazard, due to an electrical fault of a window heat wire bundle.
The loss of the window heat function will not, in itself, result in an immediate safety of flight hazard. In the case
of the Model 747 incident that prompted issuance of AD 92-27-12, the electrical fault resulted in the loss
of numerous essential cockpit instruments necessary for continued safe flight and landing, in addition to the smoke
and fire hazard. 
Finally, the FAA disagrees that service experience should be used to justify a reduction of the frequency of the repetitive
inspection intervals for Model 747-100 series airplanes. While the FAA does not dispute the commenter's claim
regarding lack of in-service chafing incidents on the Model 747-100, the FAA points out that the wire bundles
above the P6 panel are installed on all Model 747-100, -200, and -300 series airplanes in accordance
with the same type design data. As a result, the FAA cannot establish that the wire bundle installation on Model 747-100
series airplanes has specific design features that preclude these airplanes from the potential hazardous condition.
The FAA does recognize, however, that some of the airplanes affected by the proposed AD may not exhibit the wire bundle
chafing problem. For this reason, paragraph (b)(2)(i) of the proposed AD provides for termination of the repetitive
inspections on airplanes that successfully pass a wire bundle clearance inspection and measurement procedure.

ATA, on behalf of one of its members, requests that proposed paragraph (c) only cite the original issue of Boeing Service
Bulletin 747-24A2186, dated January 14, 1993, since Revision 1, dated May 20, 1993, contains several typographical
errors. The FAA partially concurs. The FAA clarifies that Revision 1 erroneously refers to military specification
MIL-I-42852 and MIL-I-46853 insulating tapes in several paragraphs. MIL-I-46852
tape is the correct military specification number and should be inserted wherever MIL-I-42852 or MIL-I-46853
is identified. The FAA points out that Revision 1 of the service bulletin contains descriptive information not found
in the original release of the service bulletin, which may assist operators in performing the optional wire bundle
modification. The FAA has included a statement in paragraph (c) of this AD to clarify that MIL-I-46852
tape shall be utilized wherever MIL-I-42852 tape or MIL-I-46853 tape is specified, for those
operators that incorporate Revision 1 of the service bulletin. Therefore, with this information included in the
AD, the FAA considers that the service bulletin references are appropriate in paragraph (c) of this AD. 
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined
that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
There are approximately 700 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 184 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 1.5 work hours per airplane
to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the
total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $15,180, or $83 per airplane. This total cost figure
assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the requirements of this AD. 
Should an operator elect to accomplish the optional terminating action that would be provided by this AD action, the
number of work hours required to accomplish it would be approximately 1 per airplane, and the cost of required parts
would be approximately $32 per airplane. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not

Airworthiness Directives; Canadair Model Turboprop CL-215-6B11 Series Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Canadair Model CL-215-6B11
series airplanes, that requires inspections to detect cracking in the rear engine mount struts, and replacement
of struts with new struts, if necessary; and the eventual replacement of all struts with new struts. This amendment
is prompted by reports of failures of these rear engine mount struts due to cracking that was caused by rosette welds
on the shank of the struts not achieving full weld penetration during manufacture. The actions specified by this AD
are intended to prevent failure of the rear engine mount struts, which could subsequently result in reduced structural
integrity of the nacelle and engine support structure.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain Canadair Model CL-215-6B11 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 13, 1993 (58 FR 52931). That action proposed to require repetitive visual inspections to detect cracking
in the rear engine mount struts, and replacement of struts with new struts, if necessary. That action also proposed
to require the eventual replacement of all struts with new struts; such replacement would constitute terminating
action for the visual inspections.



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 

Currently, there are no Canadair Model CL-215-6B11 series airplanes on the U.S. Register. However, should
an affected airplane be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, it would take approximately 10 work
hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the AD will be $550 per airplane. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 


For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 series airplanes, that requires modification or 
replacement of designated passenger cabin floor panels. This amendment is prompted by a 
report that, during manufacture, the inserts that attach the floor panels to the seat tracks 
and floor beams were installed using sealant rather than required adhesive. The actions 
specified by this AD are intended to prevent loss of the passenger cabin floor capability to 
support the airplane interior inertia loads under emergency landing conditions.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to 
certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal 
Register 

on August 19, 1993 (58 FR 44150). That action proposed to require 
modification or replacement of designated passenger cabin floor panels. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 
Two commenters support the proposed rule. 
The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of several of its 
members, requests that the FAA withdraw the proposed rule. The commenter states that 
all U.S. operators and all but one non-U.S. operator have accomplished the modification 
or replacement specified in McDonnell Douglas MD-11 Service Bulletin 53-31, which is 
cited in the proposed rule, thereby ensuring that 9g crash certification requirements are 
satisfied. The commenter adds that McDonnell Douglas MD-11 Service Bulletins 53-32 
and 53-33, which are also cited in the proposal, were only included in the manufacturer's 
service program to ensure commonality between operators, but were not included in that 
program to return the aircraft to its original design intent. The commenter concludes that, 
since all U.S. operators have accomplished the actions described in McDonnell Douglas 
MD-11 Service Bulletin 53-31, there is no need for an AD. Further, the commenter 
believes that issuance of the AD would contradict the principles of Presidential Executive 
Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review), and would cause an unjustifiable expense 
to operators. 

The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request to withdraw the proposed 
rule. As explained in the preamble to the proposal, the FAA has determined that 
accomplishment of the modification or replacement described in McDonnell Douglas 
MD-11 Service Bulletin 53-31 is necessary to correct an unsafe condition described as 
loss of the passenger cabin floor capability to support the airplane interior inertia loads 
under emergency landing conditions. Under existing bilateral airworthiness agreements, 
the FAA is obligated, through the AD process, to advise foreign airworthiness authorities 
of unsafe conditions relating to products produced in the United States, and to provide 
instructions determined necessary to correct the unsafe condition addressed. The 
appropriate vehicle for mandating such action to correct an unsafe condition is the 
airworthiness directive. 
However, upon consideration of data submitted by the manufacturer since issuance 
of the proposal, the FAA has determined that accomplishment of the modification or 
replacement specified in McDonnell Douglas MD-11 Service Bulletin 53-31 adequately 
addresses the unsafe condition, and that the actions described in McDonnell Douglas 
MD-11 Service Bulletins 53-32 and 53-33 are not necessary to address that unsafe 
condition. The FAA's original concern was that interchanging the floor panels could result 
in an unsafe condition under emergency landing conditions. However, based on the data 
received from the manufacturer, the FAA finds that its concern regarding floor panel 
interchangeability is addressed by part number controls; original panels are not 
interchangeable with reworked panels or new panels. In light of this, the FAA has 
removed paragraphs (b) and (c) from the final rule. In addition, references to McDonnell 
Douglas MD-11 Service Bulletins 53-32 and 53-33 have been removed from the 
applicability of the AD. The FAA also has revised the economic impact paragraph, below, 
to reflect the fact that all U.S. airplanes have accomplished the requirements of this AD.

One commenter requests that paragraph (a) of the proposed rule be revised to clarify that each individual panel may
be reworked in accordance with Option I of McDonnell Douglas MD-11 Service Bulletin 53-31, or replaced
in accordance with Option II of that service bulletin, rather than implying that all panels must be either reworked
or replaced. The commenter also requests that the proposal be revised to indicate that installation of operator-manufactured
panels with properly installed inserts are acceptable in lieu of production panels. 
The FAA concurs. Paragraph (a) of this AD has been revised to indicate that the requirements of that paragraph may be
accomplished by either reworking an individual panel in accordance with Option I of the service bulletin, or replacing
an individual panel in accordance with Option II of the service bulletin. Paragraph (a) of the final rule also has been
revised to specify that new panels that meet the original type design or FAA-approved equivalent panels are considered
acceptable replacement panels. 
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
There are approximately 32 Model MD-11 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA
estimates that 20 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. The FAA has been advised that the requirements
of this AD have been accomplished on all 20 airplanes of U.S. registry. 
However, should an affected airplane be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, the FAA has been advised
that the manufacturer plans to provide required parts and to accomplish the required modification at no expense to
operators. Therefore, there is no future economic cost impact of this rule on U.S. operators. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation
has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket

Airworthiness Directives; Lockheed Model L-1011-385 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Lockheed Model L-1011
series airplanes, that currently requires certain structural modifications and inspections. This amendment revises
certain inspections required by the existing AD, and requires additional inspections and structural modifications.
This amendment is prompted by reports of recent incidents involving fatigue cracking and corrosion in transport
category airplanes that are approaching or have exceeded their economic design goal. The actions specified by this
AD are intended to prevent degradation of the structural capabilities of the affected airplanes. This action also
reflects the FAA's determination that long term continued operational safety should be assured by actual modification
of the airframe rather than repetitive inspections.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations by superseding AD 91-05-05, Amendment
39-6878 
(56 FR 6556, February 19, 1991), which is applicable to certain Lockheed Model L-1011-385 series airplanes,
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 4, 1992 (57 FR 57392). The action proposed to require certain structural modifications and inspections.



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
One commenter supports the proposed rule. 
One commenter suggests that any new requirements or changes to AD's that address ``collector'' service bulletins
(CSB) should be issued as new AD's, rather than supersedures of ``old'' AD's. The commenter suggests further that
a ``collector'' AD should be issued annually to address any changes or additions to CSB's. The commenter believes
that this proposed procedure would ease administrative and financial burdens to operators, particularly in the
case of AD's that address CSB's, such as the proposed rule. 
The FAA does not concur. The FAA's normal policy is to supersede an ``old'' AD by removing it from the system and adding
a new AD in a case where substantive requirements must be added to the ``old'' AD. The FAA has determined that the changes
made to the original issue of the CSB addressed in this AD are substantive, since changes have been made to certain accomplishment
procedures and some new requirements have been added. The FAA finds that issuance of a supersedure is appropriate
in this case to include those new or revised requirements. 
The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of one of its members, requests that the FAA conduct a thorough
review of AD 
91-05-05 and this proposed rule to eliminate any references to service bulletins that are addressed in
other existing AD's. The commenter contends that there is no justification for requiring operators to perform duplicate
inspections and that such requirements are confusing to operators. 
The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request to eliminate references to service bulletins addressed in this
AD that are also addressed in other existing AD's. The FAA recognizes that certain service bulletins addressed in
this AD have also been the subject of other existing AD's. However, the FAA has included references to such service
bulletins in this AD only to require that operators accomplish those actions that will terminate the repetitive inspections
required by other existing AD's. The FAA has also been informed by Lockheed of the necessity to revise Lockheed Service
Bulletin 093-51-035 (referred to in this AD as the Collector Service Bulletin (CSB)) to fully address
the required terminating actions for all affected airplanes. Subsequently, the FAA may consider further rulemaking
to require that action be taken in accordance with that revised CSB; any duplicate requirements would then be eliminated
by rescinding any existing AD's that address those duplicate requirements. 
Two commenters suggest that the contents of the second ``NOTE'' in paragraph (d) of the proposal should appear in the
final rule as two separate paragraphs, one to exclude the first three service bulletins cited and a second to exclude
the fourth service bulletin. One of the commenters asks if a ``NOTE'' has legal status in an AD. Another commenter states
that the actions described in the first three service bulletins should have been excluded from this AD, since such
an exclusion appeared in AD 91-05-05.

The FAA concurs with the commenters' request to exclude the actions described in the service bulletins specified
in the second ``NOTE'' in paragraph (d) of the proposal, since this was the intent of that ``NOTE.'' The FAA clarifies
that the material that appears in a ``NOTE'' is simply explanatory or informational. The FAA has removed the ``NOTE''
from the final rule and has revised paragraphs (a) and (d) to provide an exclusion of the actions described in the first
three service bulletins referenced from the requirements of this AD. In addition, the actions specified in the fourth
service bulletin referenced in the ``NOTE'' are addressed in another existing AD; this information has been specified
in paragraph (d) of the final rule. 
Two commenters request that paragraphs (a) and (b) of the proposal be revised to reference Table II of Lockheed Service
Bulletin 
093-51-035, in addition to Table I, since Table II contains interim inspection requirements. The FAA
concurs, as its intent was to include these interim inspection requirements in the AD. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of the
final rule have been revised accordingly. 
Two commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to permit repairs to be accomplished ``in accordance with
FAA-approved repair procedures'' and that paragraph (g) of the proposal be revised to explain the Designated Engineering
Representative's (DER) authority, including any limitations, to approve minor changes to repairs done in accordance
with the proposal. One commenter states that obtaining approval from the FAA often requires extended down time and
unnecessary interruptions of scheduled service. The commenter believes that operators with in-house resources
for obtaining FAA approval of repairs (i.e., DER's or organizations that hold a Special Federal Aviation Regulation
(SFAR) 36 authorization) should be allowed to use those sources of FAA approval to return aircraft to service in an
expeditious manner, particularly when repetitive inspections are being accomplished. The second commenter indicates
that the CSB references approval of deviations to repairs and modifications by normal non-AD approval procedures.

The FAA does not concur. While DER's and SFAR 36-authorized organizations are authorized to determine whether a design
or repair method complies with a specific requirement, they are not authorized currently to make the discretionary
determination as to what the applicable requirement is. Further, where repair data do not exist, it is essential that
the FAA have feedback as to the type of repairs being made. The FAA has determined that the Manager of the Atlanta Aircraft
Certification Office should approve any such deviations to the AD's requirements. Given that possible new relevant
issues might be revealed during this process, it is imperative that the FAA, at this level, have such feedback. Only
by reviewing deviation approvals can the FAA be assured of this feedback and of the adequacy of the repair methods.
However, the FAA is currently conducting a review of this policy and may consider revising it based upon the results
of that review. 
One commenter requests that the FAA revise paragraph (b) of the proposal to allow inspections to continue in accordance
with the service bulletin revision levels specified in the original issue of the CSB, except for those inspections
for which the procedures have been revised substantively in Revision 1 of the CSB. The commenter suggests that the
excepted inspections should be addressed in a separate paragraph of the proposal and should be phased in over a period
of time, rather than required as of the effective date of this AD. The commenter adds that any new inspection procedures
required by this AD should have been discussed with the Airworthiness Assurance Working Group (AAWG) for these airplanes.

The FAA concurs partially. The intent of paragraph (b) is to require that, after the effective date of this AD, inspections
be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin revision levels listed in Revision 1 of the CSB. The AAWG endorsed
that revision of the CSB at a conference held in November 1991. However, upon reconsideration, the FAA has determined
that an acceptable level of safety can be maintained if operators are allowed a ``phase-in'' period to change over
from accomplishing inspection procedures in accordance with the original issue of the CSB to accomplishing the updated
inspection procedures specified in Revision 1 of the CSB. Therefore, the FAA has revised paragraph (b) of the final
rule to allow a phase-in period of 12 months for operators with airplanes that are being inspected as of the effective
date of this AD to make this change. 
One commenter requests that the modification requirement specified in Lockheed Service Bulletin 093-53-237
be specifically excluded from the requirements of this AD, as recommended by the AAWG. The FAA concurs. Paragraphs
(b) and (d) of the final rule have been revised to reference L-1011 Service Bulletin Change Notification 093-51-035,
R1-CN1, dated October 27, 1992, which eliminates the modification specified in Lockheed Service Bulletin
093-53-237.

Two commenters request that the proposal be revised to allow credit for modifications accomplished previously in
accordance with the original issue of the CSB. One of the commenters points out that the only revised listing that appears
in Table II of Revision 1 of the CSB is Lockheed Service Bulletin 093-53-233, which describes additional
inspections to be conducted after accomplishing the modification specified in the service bulletin. This commenter
states further that it was not the intent of the AAWG to mandate that modifications be accomplished in accordance with
the latest issues of the service bulletins. 
The FAA concurs. After accomplishing the modification described in Lockheed Service Bulletin 093-53-233,
certain inspections are required. Those inspections are described in Lockheed Service Bulletin 093-53-238,
which is listed in Table II of the revised CSB and required by paragraph (c)(1) of the final rule. The scope of the required
inspections is dependent upon which version of Lockheed Service Bulletin 093-53-233 an operator accomplished;
this issue is addressed under Lockheed Service Bulletin 093-53-233 in the ``Remarks'' section of Table
II of the revised CSB. 
The FAA finds that accomplishment of modifications in accordance with Table II of the original issue of the CSB may
continue. Accordingly, paragraph (e) of the proposal, which would have required certain structural modifications
in accordance with the service bulletins listed in Table II of the CSB, has been removed from the final rule. The contents
of the first sentence of the second ``NOTE'' that appeared in paragraph (e) of the proposal, which indicated that Lockheed
Service Bulletins 093-57-184, Revision 6; 093-57-196, Revision 5; and 093-57-203,
Revision 3; are addressed in paragraph (f) of the proposal, are specified in ``NOTE 3'' under paragraph (d) of the final
rule. 
In addition, paragraph (d) of the final rule has been revised to specify that modifications accomplished in accordance
with Table II of either the original issue or Revision 1 of the CSB are acceptable for compliance with the requirements
of that paragraph. Further, paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of the final rule have been revised to specify that modification
in accordance with paragraph (d) or (e) of this AD or in accordance with the applicable service bulletin listed within
the inspection portion of either the original issue or Revision 1 of the CSB constitutes terminating action for the
individual inspection requirements of the applicable service bulletin. 
One commenter asks that the number of Model L-1011 series airplanes of the affected airplanes in the worldwide
fleet be revised, since the actual number is larger than that reflected in the economic impact information specified
in the proposal. The FAA concurs. The FAA has verified that the correct number of affected airplanes in the worldwide
fleet is 241 and has revised the economic impact information, below, accordingly. 
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
There are approximately 241 Model L-1011 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The
FAA estimates that 112 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. The actions required previously by AD
91-05-05 necessitate 1,200 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $40 per work
hour. The cost for parts required by that AD is $52,000 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost of AD 91-05-05
to affected U.S. operators over an initial 5-year time period was estimated to be approximately $11,200,000, or $100,000
per airplane. 
The actions required by this AD will require an additional 549 work hours per airplane to accomplish at an average labor
rate of $55 per work hour. (Note that, in order to account for various inflationary costs in the airline industry, the
FAA has increased the labor rate used in calculating the economic impact of this AD activity from $40 per work hour to
$55 per work hour.) Required parts will cost approximately $21,000 per airplane. Based on these figures, the additional
costs to U.S. operators with regard to the actions required by this AD is estimated to be $5,733,840, or $51,195 per
airplane. 
Based on the figures discussed above, the total cost impact of this AD action on U.S. operators is estimated to be $16,933,840,
or $151,195 per airplane. The total cost impact figure(s) discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator
has yet accomplished any of the requirements of either this new AD action or the previous AD, and that no operator would
accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive.
Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would
not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft
in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD
is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the
required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD. 
A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft
must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA
makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting and maintaining
those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial.
When the FAA, as in this AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that this cost-beneficial level of safety
is no longer being achieved and that the required actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this
level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this AD would
be redundant and unnecessary.

Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC-9-10 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; correction.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document corrects information in an existing airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell
Douglas Model DC-9-10 series airplanes. Among other things, the existing AD currently requires a modification
of the wing leading edge bleed air anti-ice system so that it can operate on the ground to prevent ice reformation after
deicing procedures have been accomplished, and a related revision to the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM). The actions
specified in that AD are intended to prevent degradation of lift due to ice accumulation on the wing leading edge. This
amendment corrects the instructional language in the required AFM revision related to operation of the system on
the ground. This action is prompted by apparent confusion that this language has created among affected operators
in attempting to comply with the rule.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On May 26, 1993, the FAA issued AD 
93-11-01, Amendment 39-8593 (58 FR 33898, June 22, 1993), that is applicable to certain McDonnell
Douglas Model DC-9-10 series airplanes. That AD superseded an existing AD that had required a revision
to the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to specify that takeoff must not be initiated unless the flight crew
verifies that a visual and physical check of the leading edge and upper wing surfaces have been accomplished and that
the wing is clear of all ice, frost, and snow accumulation. AD 93-11-01 added a requirement to modify the
wing leading edge bleed air anti-ice system so that it can operate on the ground to prevent ice from reforming after
deicing procedures have been accomplished. The actions specified in that AD are intended to prevent degradation
of lift due to ice accumulation on the wing leading edge. 


Recently, the FAA has become aware of the fact that certain language contained in the required AFM limitation, relative
to operation of the wing leading edge bleed air anti-ice system, has created confusion among affected operators when
attempting to comply with the rule. 
Specifically, paragraph (d)(2) of AD 93-11-01 requires that the Limitations Section of the AFM be revised
to require that ``the bleed air anti-ice system must be on whenever conditions exist or are anticipated, including
on-ground operation.'' This phrase apparently has been interpreted to mean that operators must have the system on
during the brief period during takeoff from aircraft rotation to about 100 feet above ground level where the extraction
of engine bleed air for the anti-ice system penalizes second-segment climb performance. Such a performance penalty
could be as much as 4,000 pounds, which is roughly equivalent to off-loading 20 passengers. One operator contends
that a penalty of this magnitude cannot be absorbed by operators and makes operation of Model DC-9-10/-15
aircraft ``economically not viable.'' 
The purpose of the required AFM limitation was meant to ensure that the anti-ice system modification is used to provide
the on-ground protection for which it is intended; the manner in which the system is normally operated during flight
was not meant to be changed. The FAA acknowledges that the language of the AFM limitation as it appears currently in
the AD could be interpreted to apply to both the ground and flight phases of airplane operation. Since this clearly
was not the FAA's intent, the FAA has determined that it is appropriate to take action to correct the wording of the AFM
limitation in AD 93-11-01 to specify that the bleed air anti-ice system must be on whenever icing conditions
exist or are apparent, when on the ground, until immediately prior to commencement of takeoff roll. 
This corrected wording will clearly indicate that the limitation applies only to operation of the system while the
airplane is on the ground until prior to takeoff. The selection of the anti-ice system during takeoff has always been
the pilot's decision, and the FAA intends that it continue to be so. 
Additionally, another item that appeared in the preamble to AD 93-11-01 has apparently created some confusion.
In that preamble, the FAA stated the following in its description of the unsafe condition:

 

``The FAA notes that the description of the addressed unsafe condition, as discussed in the proposal, implied that
the condition is a result of icing effects on both the wing upper surface and the wing leading edge. That language was
inaccurate; the unsafe condition is likely to occur as the result of icing effects on the wing leading edge, not the
wing upper surface.''

 

The FAA has reconsidered this statement and finds that, while the modification of the wing leading edge bleed air anti-ice
system required by AD 93-11-01 is effective only on ice forming on the wing leading edge, it would be misleading
to state the unsafe condition addressed by that AD results only from that phenomenon. The unsafe condition addressed
is that which is caused by ice contamination on the wing leading edge and upper surface; this condition can result in
the degradation of wing lift, and can result in the airplane stalling at lower than normal angles-of-attack during
takeoff. Therefore, the FAA hereby clarifies this point by replacing the previously used language with the following:

 

``The modification to the wing leading edge bleed air de-icing system, which is required by this AD, prevents ice/frost/snow
from reforming on the wing leading edge only, after the airplane has been deiced. The wing leading edge area is the most
critical from a loss of lift standpoint. However, because contamination on the upper surface of the wing can also impact
lift and stall speeds, assurance that ice/frost/snow is not present on the wing leading edge and upper surface requires
operation in accordance with the comprehensive requirements of Section 121.629(c) (Amendment 121-231) of
the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), or the accomplishment of visual and physical (hands-on) inspections of
both the leading edge and the wing upper surface as required by this AD.'' 



Additionally, the address for obtaining copies of the referenced service material 
from the McDonnell Douglas Corporation has been corrected.

Action is taken herein to correct these errors and to correctly add the AD as an amendment to  39.13 of the FAR (14
CFR part 39). The effective date of the rule remains July 22, 1993. 
The final rule is being reprinted in its entirety for the convenience of affected operators. 
Since this action only corrects wording in an existing rule, it has no adverse economic impact and imposes no additional
burden on any person. Therefore, notice and public procedures hereon are unnecessary. 


List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 


Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Correction.
Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration
amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: 


PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 


1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:

 



Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. 


 39.13

[Amended] 


2. Section 39.13 is amended by correctly adding the following airworthiness directive (AD):

 



93-11-01 McDonnell Douglas: 

Amendment 39-8593. Docket 92-NM-48-AD. 
Supersedes AD 92-03-01, Amendment 39-8155.

 



Applicability: 

Model DC-9-11, -12, -13, -14, -15, and -15F series airplanes, certificated
in any category. 


Compliance: 

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
To prevent degradation of lift due to ice accumulation on the wing leading edge, accomplish the following: 
(a) Except as provided by paragraph (b) of this AD, within 10 days after January 17, 1992 (the effective date of AD 92-03-01,
Amendment 39-8155), revise the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to include
the following. This may be accomplished by inserting a copy of this AD in the AFM. 


``Wing De-icing Prior to Takeoff 


Caution 


The Model DC-9-10 series airplane has a wing design with no leading edge high lift devices, such as slats.
Wings without leading edge devices are particularly susceptible to loss of lift due to wing icing. Minute amounts
of ice or other contamination (equivalent to medium grit sandpaper) on the leading edges or wing upper surfaces can
cause a significant reduction in the stall angle-of-attack. This can increase the stall speed up to 30 knots. The increased
stall speed can be well above the stall warning (stick shaker) activation speed.



[End of Cautionary Note]

 

The leading edge and upper wing surfaces must be physically checked for 
ice/frost when the airplane has been exposed to conditions conducive to 
ice/frost formation. Takeoff may not be initiated unless the flight crew 
verifies that a visual check and a physical (hands-on) check of the leading 
edge and upper wing surfaces have been accomplished, and that the wing is 
clear of ice/frost/snow accumulation. Icing/frost/snow conditions exist 
when the Outside Air Temperature (OAT) is below 6 degrees C (42 degrees F); and either the difference between the dew
point temperature and OAT is less than 3 degrees C (5 degrees F), or visible moisture (rain, drizzle, sleet, snow, fog,
etc.) is present. 


Note 


This limitation does not relieve the requirement that aircraft 
surfaces are free of ice, frost, and snow accumulation as 
required by Federal Aviation Regulations Sections 91.527 
and 121.629.



[End of Note]''



(b) Paragraph (a) of this AD does not apply to any airplane that is both operated in accordance with Federal Aviation
Regulation (FAR) 121.629(c), Amendment 121-231, and modified in accordance with either paragraph (c)(1)
or (c)(2) of this AD. 
(c) Within 9 months after the effective date of this amendment, accomplish the procedures specified in either paragraph
(c)(1) or (c)(2) of this AD: 
(1) Modify the bleed air anti-ice system so that it can operate on the ground to prevent ice reformation on the wing leading
edges after ground equipment has been utilized to properly deice the airplane, and to minimize the effect of undetected
ice/frost/snow contamination. Accomplish the modification in accordance with a method approved by the Manager,
Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Or 
(2) Install a supplemental on-ground wing leading edge ice protection system in accordance with McDonnell Douglas
DC-9 Service Bulletin 30-65, dated October 8, 1992. 
(d) Upon the accomplishment of the modification required by paragraph (c) of this AD, revise the AFM in accordance
with either paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this AD:

increase the stall speed up to 30 knots. The increased stall 
speed can be well above the stall warning (stick shaker) 
activation speed. 





[End Of Cautionary Note]

 


The bleed air anti-ice system must be on whenever icing conditions exist or are anticipated, when on the ground, until
immediately prior to commencement of takeoff roll.'' 
(e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane
Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector,
who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Los Angeles ACO.

 




Note:

 Commodity Futures Trading Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Order.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'') is authorizing option contracts on the 3-month Canadian
Bankers' Acceptance Futures Contract traded on the Montreal Exchange to be offered or sold to persons located in the
United States. This Order is issued pursuant to: (1) Commission rule 30.3(a), 17 CFR 30.3(a) (1993), which makes it
unlawful for any person to engage in the offer or sale of a foreign option product until the Commission, by order, authorizes
such foreign option to be offered or sold in the United States; and (2) the Commission's Order issued on July 20, 1988,
53 FR 28840 (July 29, 1988), authorizing certain option products traded on the Montreal Exchange to be offered or sold
in the United States.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Commission has issued the following Order: 



Order Under Commission Rule 30.3(a) Permitting Option Contracts on the 3-month Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Futures
Contract Traded on the Montreal Exchange to be Offered or Sold in the United States Thirty Days after Publication of
this Notice in the 

Federal Register

.




By Order issued on July 20, 1988 (``Initial Order''), the Commission authorized, pursuant to Commission rule 30.3(a),
 certain option products traded on the Montreal Exchange to be offered or sold in the United States. 53 FR 28840 (July
29, 1988). Among other conditions, the Initial Order specified that:








Except as otherwise permitted under the Commodity Exchange Act and regulations thereunder, * * *
no offer or sale of any Montreal Exchange option product in the United States shall be made until thirty days after publication
in the 

Federal Register

 of notice specifying the particular option(s) to be offered or sold pursuant to this Order.




By letter dated February 9, 1994 the Montreal Exchange represented that it would be introducing an option contract
based on the 3-month Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Futures Contract. The Montreal Exchange has requested that the
Commission supplement its Initial Order and subsequent Order
 authorizing Options on the Government of Canada Bond Futures by also authorizing the Montreal Exchange's Option
Contract on the 3-month Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Futures Contract to be offered or sold to persons in the United
States. Upon due consideration, and for the reasons previously discussed in the Initial Order, the Commission believes
that the request for authorization to offer or sell an option contract on the 3-month Canadian Bankers' Acceptance
Futures Contract should be granted.





Accordingly, pursuant to Commission rule 30.3(a) and the Commission's Initial Order issued on July 20, 1988, and
subject to the terms and conditions specified therein, the Commission hereby authorizes the Montreal Exchange's
Option Contract on the 3-month Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Futures Contract to be offered or sold to persons located
in the United States thirty days after publication of this Order in the 

Federal Register

.

Contract Specifications

Options on 3-Month Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Futures



Underlying Interest



One (1) 3-month Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Futures (BAX) contract representing C$1,000,000 principal of 3-month
Canadian Bankers' Acceptances.



Description



A buyer of one option on 3-month Bankers' Acceptance Futures may exercise the option to assume a position in one 3-month
Bankers' Acceptance Futures (BAX) contract (long position if the option is a call and short position if the option
is a put) of a specified contract month at a specified strike price.

The seller of one option on 3-month Bankers' Acceptance Futures has the obligation of assuming, if the option is exercised
by the buyer, a position in one 3-month Bankers' Acceptance Futures (BAX) contract (short position if the option is
a call and long position if the option is a put) of a specified contract month at a specified strike price.



Price Quotation



Quoted in points where each .01 of a point (1 basis point) represents C$25. For example, a quote of 0.46 represents a
total option premium of C$1,150 (i.e. 46 basis points x C$25).



Minimum Price Increment (Tick Size and Value)



0.01 point (also known as one tick)=C$25 per contract (same as for underlying futures).



Strike Prices



Strike prices are set at maximum 0.50 point intervals.

*

 Two (2) in-the-money and two (2) out-of-the-money strike prices will generally be available (for example, if a specific
BAX futures settlement price is 90, option strike prices may be set at 89, 89.50, 90, 90.50, 91).






*

Strike prices of the nearest contract month may be set at .25 point interval.



Contract Months



Options available on the four nearest months in the BAX futures quarterly cycle, i.e. March, June, September and December.

Last Trading Day



Options trading shall terminate at the same date and time as the underlying futures contract, i.e. at 10:00 a.m. (EST/EDT)
on the second London (U.K.) business day prior to the third Wednesday of the contract month.



Exercise



American style, i.e. buyers of futures options may exercise their options on any business day up to and including the
expiration date (prior to the daily cut-off time). The Clearing Corporation assigns exercise notices to sellers
of options according to a random selection process. In-the-money options are automatically exercised by the Clearing
Corporation at expiry (unless otherwise instructed). The final settlement price of the underlying futures contract
will be used as a reference to determine which options may be exercised automatically at expiry.



Expiration



The last trading day.



Minimum Margin Requirements



The minimum margin is subject to periodic changes.



Buyers of Options



 Premium must be paid in full when the option is bought.



Uncovered Writers of Options



 Market value of the option plus the margin required for the underlying futures contract less half of the amount
that the option is out-of-the-money. Minimum: market value of the option plus 50% of the margin required on the underlying
futures contract (futures speculator or hedger rate, as the case may be).

 Special rules apply to calculate margin requirements for other combinations.



Position Limits



The maximum number of options and underlying futures contract net on the same side of the market in all contract month
combined which a person may own or control shall be as follows:

(a) For speculators: 5,000 futures equivalent contracts.

(b) For hedgers: The greater of 7,000 futures equivalent contracts or of such a limit to be established and published
on a monthly basis by the Exchange based on 20% of the average daily open interest for all Canadian Bankers' Acceptance
futures contract during the preceding three calendar months or such other position limits as may be determined by
the Exchange.

For the purpose of calculating these limits, positions in the options contracts are aggregated with positions in
the underlying futures contract. For aggregation purposes, the futures-equivalent of one in-the-money options
contract is one futures contract and the futures-equivalent of one at-the-money option or out-of-the-money contract
is half a futures contract.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; correction.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document corrects certain editorial errors that appeared in a final rule document published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 21, 1993, regarding reporting requirements for vessels, vehicles, and individuals.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
On December 21, 1993, Customs published a document in the 

Federal Register

 (T.D. 93-96, 58 FR 67312), that amended the Customs Regulations to implement certain provisions of the Customs
Enforcement Act of 1986, a part of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, designed to strengthen Federal efforts to improve
the enforcement of Federal drug laws and enhance the interdiction of illegal drug shipments. The regulatory changes
pertained to the arrival, entry, and departure reporting requirements applicable to vessels, vehicles, and individuals,
and informed the public regarding applicable penalty, seizure and forfeiture provisions for violation of the provisions.




The document removed considerable footnote material in part 4 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR part 4). However,
although the footnote material at the bottom of pages was removed, the superscript footnote-referencing designation
in the regulatory text was not. This document corrects that error. This document also removes two other footnotes
in Part 4_footnotes 92 and 118_that should have been removed, along with their superscript footnote-referencing
designations, because the material they reference has been changed or deleted. 

Further, one of the amendments in this document was to part 123, which required a revision to the then last sentence
of 
 123.0. Before T.D. 93-96 was published, however, another document, pertaining to the user fees Customs
collects for certain services, was published on October 21, 1993 (T.D. 93-85, 58 FR 54271) that also amended
part 123 by adding a new sentence at the end of  123.0. This circumstance of another document (T.D. 93-85)
adding a new last sentence to the same section being revised by T.D. 93-96, requires that the instruction in 
T.D. 93-96 be corrected to read that the next to the last sentence in  123.0 be revised to read as indicated.




Correction of Publication 



Accordingly, the publication on December 31, 1993 of the final regulations (T.D. 93-96), which were the subject
of FR Doc 93-30908, is corrected as follows: 

1. On page 67315, in the second column, the second instruction is corrected to read: 

``Part 4 is amended by removing and reserving footnotes 4, 5, 7, 8, 8a, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16a, 16b, 19, 20, 23, 65, 72,
79, 91, 92, 95, 98, and 118; and removing the superscript footnote-referencing designations 4, 5, 7, 8, 8a, 9, 10, 11,
13, 14, 15, 16a, 16b, 19, 20, 23, 65, 72, 79, 91, 92, 95, 98, and 118 from the text.'' 

2. On page 67317, in the second column, in  123.0, the second instruction is corrected to read ``Section 123.0
is amended by revising the next to the last sentence to read as follows:''.

Medical Devices; Reclassification and Codification of the Daily Wear Soft and Daily Wear Nonhydrophilic Plastic
Contact Lenses 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is codifying the reclassification of daily wear soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic
plastic contact lenses from class III (premarket approval) into class II (special controls). Elsewhere in this issue
of the 

Federal Register

 FDA has issued an order of reclassification as required by the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (the SMDA). This reclassification
only applies to daily wear soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic contact lenses. Lenses intended for extended wear will
remain in class III, as will contact lens accessories. The SMDA also requires FDA to put into place any regulatory safeguards
that are necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the reclassified lenses. Thus,
elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, in conjunction with the order reclassifying the devices, FDA is announcing the availability of a guidance document
describing those safeguards in the form of evidence needed to demonstrate the substantial equivalence of new daily
wear soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic contact lenses to lenses already marketed.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (Pub. L. 94-295), Congress classified all transitional devices
(i.e., those devices previously regulated as drugs), including daily wear soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic
contact lenses, into class III (premarket approval). The SMDA (Pub. L. 101-629), reflecting congressional
concern that many transitional devices were being over regulated in class III, directed FDA to collect certain safety
and effectiveness information from the manufacturers of transitional devices and review the classifications of
those still remaining in class III to determine if the devices could be down classified into class II (special controls)
or class I (general controls). The SMDA made further provision with respect to the reclassification of daily wear
soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lenses. Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the SMDA provided that, notwithstanding
the provisions for reclassification of other transitional devices, daily wear soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic
plastic contact lenses would not be retained in class III unless FDA determined that the devices meet the statutory
criteria for a class III device. Further, if FDA did not determine that these contact lenses must remain in class III
and publish such determination by November 28, 1993, in the 

Federal Register

, then, under section 4(b)(3)(D) of the SMDA, FDA ``shall issue an order placing the lenses in class II.'' 



Both the language and legislative history of the SMDA make it clear that the reclassification of daily wear soft and
daily wear nonhydrophilic contact lenses would occur as a matter of law unless FDA published a finding that the devices
should remain in class III. FDA has not made such a finding: FDA believes that the safety and effectiveness of daily
wear soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lenses can be ensured through specified special controls
as authorized by the SMDA. As required by section 4(b)(3)(D) of the SMDA, therefore, FDA has issued an order reclassifying
the devices from class III (premarket approval) into class II (special controls). This order appears elsewhere in
this issue of the 

Federal Register

. In conjunction with the order, FDA is also issuing a guidance document for premarket notifications for the reclassified
contact lenses, entitled ``Premarket Notification (510(k)) Guidance Document for Daily Wear Contact Lenses.''

Pending original and supplemental applications for premarket approval for daily wear soft or daily wear nonhydrophilic
plastic contact lenses currently filed with the agency must be examined to identify: (1) Those that are no longer subject
to premarket approval review and can be converted to 510(k)'s or withdrawn and resubmitted to FDA by the applicant
to be evaluated through the 510(k) process; and (2) those which can be withdrawn by the applicant and are not required
to be resubmitted and evaluated as a 510(k) prior to implementing the request. FDA review of affected premarket approval
applications (PMA's) will be suspended until the respective sponsor amends its application, setting forth the status
of the devices and the administrative actions requested to be taken regarding its application. Sponsors of PMA's
affected by the reclassification should refer to the order published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

 for information on actions necessary regarding any pending applications affected by the automatic reclassification.




Environmental Impact 



The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(e)(2) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required. 



Economic Impact 



FDA has carefully examined the costs and benefits of this action in accordance with the requirements of Executive
Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354). The agency concludes that the rule is not a significant
rule as defined in Executive Order 12866. Further, the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The reclassification
will reduce the regulatory costs to manufacturers of these lenses because the cost of complying with premarket notification
requirements is substantially less than the cost of complying with premarket approval requirements. 

Accordingly, the regulations at   886.5916 and 886.5925 (21 CFR 886.5916 and 886.5925) are amended as
set forth below. 



List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 886 



Medical devices, Ophthalmic goods and services. 




Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food
and Drugs, 21 CFR part 886 is amended as follows: 



PART 886_OPHTHALMIC DEVICES 



1. The authority section for 21 CFR part 886 continues to read as follows:

371).

 


2. Section 886.5916 is amended by revising paragraphs (b) and (c) to read as follows:

Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of Title V, Section 507, Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental
Compliance Assistance Program for the State of Montana



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Direct final rulemaking.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA is approving the State Implementation Plan revision submitted by the Governor of Montana on October 19, 1992
for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance
Program to satisfy the Federal mandate of the Clean Air Act to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical
assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply with the Act. Since this is a voluntary program that does
not impose any new regulatory burdens on small businesses, the EPA is proceeding with a direct final approval of this
SIP revision. The rationale for this approval follows.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background of Revision


Implementation of the provisions of the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small
businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the
emission of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary
to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the
impact of these requirements on small businesses, the Act requires that States adopt a Small Business Stationary
Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision
to the federally approved State Implementation Plan (SIP). In addition, the Act directs the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) to oversee these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation.
The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of Title V of the Act. In February 1992, the EPA
issued 

Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments

, in order to delineate the Federal and State roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further
guidance to the States on submitting acceptable SIP revisions.
The State of Montana has submitted a SIP revision to the EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507. In order
to gain full approval, the State submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: (1) The establishment
of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses;
(2) the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory
process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness
of the SBAP. 


II. Summary of Submittal


The State of Montana has met all of the requirements of section 507 by submitting a SIP revision that implements all
required PROGRAM elements. House Bill (HB) 318 signed into law on April 23, 1993, provides authority for the Montana
Department of Health and Environmental Sciences to establish a PROGRAM. The Montana Board of Health and Environmental
Sciences held a public hearing on September 25, 1992 to consider and approve the PROGRAM, which will amend the Montana
SIP to add Chapter 10 of Volume I. The Montana PROGRAM was submitted to the EPA by the Governor of Montana on October 19,
1992 as an addition to the Montana SIP. It was initially reviewed for administrative and technical completeness,
and was deemed complete on April 19, 1993. The submittal was then reviewed for approveability by EPA Region VIII and
EPA headquarters. One of the EPA headquarters reviewers, the Office of the Small Business and Asbestos Ombudsman
(OSBO) did not concur on the Montana PROGRAM for the following reasons: (1) Insufficient designation of Small Business
Ombudsman position in the Montana Department of Commerce (DOC) to make an effective decision; (2) No designated role
for the SBAP to act as secretariat to the CAP and Ombudsman; (3) Manpower resources appear inadequate to support the
SBAP, and there are no quantitative or qualitative or other support for the SBAP from the DOC or others; and (4) It is
advantageous for the Ombudsman and the SBAP to both have a toll-free hotline to serve the public. The State addressed
these issues in a letter dated January 3, 1994, and subsequently received the concurrence of the OSBO.


A. Small Business Assistance Program


The State has met the first PROGRAM element, the establishment of a SBAP to provide technical and compliance assistance
to small businesses, by committing in its SIP revision Chapter 10.2.3 to establish a SBAP in the Montana Department
of Health and Environmental Sciences, Air Quality Bureau. It will be administered by an environmental specialist.
Chapter 10.2.3 describes the details of the SBAP, which meet the six requirements set forth in section 507(a), including
such activities as: (1) ``Provide information to small business stationary sources on compliance methods and technologies;''
(2) ``Provide information to small business stationary sources on ... pollution prevention and accidental release
detection and prevention;'' (3) ``Assist small business stationary sources in determining applicable requirements
under this chapter and in receiving permits in a timely and efficient manner;'' (4) ``Provide small business stationary
sources timely notice of both their rights and obligations under this chapter;'' (5) ``Provide information ... regarding
the availability of audits services which are useful for determining compliance status with the requirements of
this chapter;'' and (6) Consider `` ... requests from small business stationary sources for modifications of work
practices or technological methods of compliance.''


B. Ombudsman


The State has met the second PROGRAM element, the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the
interests of small businesses in the regulatory process, by locating the office of the Ombudsman in the Montana DOC
as stated in Chapter 10.2.2 of its SIP revision.


C. Compliance Advisory Panel


The third PROGRAM element is the creation of a CAP to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP.
The CAP must include two members selected by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses;
four members selected by the State legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member
selected by the head of the agency in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. The Act also delineates four responsibilities
of the Panel:



(1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered and the degree
and severity of enforcement actions; 
(2) To periodically report to the EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction
Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act
; 




(3) To review and assure that information for small businesses is easily understandable; and 
(4) To develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP. 
The State has met these requirements by committing in Chapter 10.2.4 of its SIP revision to appoint the members of the
CAP as stated above, and to designate to the CAP the four responsibilities listed in the Act.


D. Eligibility


Section 507(c)(1) of the Act defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that:

 

(A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; 
(B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; 
(C) Is not a major stationary source; 
(D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and 
(E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. 
The State of Montana has established a mechanism for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance
under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the
Act. This mechanism is contained in the State's Title V enabling legislation, HB 318, Section 1, which is Chapter 10.2.1
of the State's SIP revision.
The State of Montana has provided for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources that do not meet
the provisions of sections 507(c)(1)(C), (D), and (E) of the Act but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all pollutants.
This provision is contained in Chapter 10.2.1 of the State's SIP revision.
The State of Montana has provided for exclusion from the small business stationary source definition, after consultation
with the EPA and the Small Business Administration Administrator and after providing notice and opportunity for
public comment, of any category or subcategory of sources that the State determines to have sufficient technical
and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the Act. This provision in contained in Chapter 10.2.1 of the
State's SIP revision. 


III. Final Action


In this action, the EPA is approving the SIP revision submitted by the State of Montana. This SIP revision implements
each of the PROGRAM elements required by section 507 of the Act. Chapter 10.3 of the revision contains a schedule for
implementation of the PROGRAM by November 15, 1994. The EPA is therefore approving this submittal.
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On
January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements
of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and
Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request
continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
By this action, the EPA is approving a State program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved does not impose any new regulatory
burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance
provided by the State. Because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements
on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected.

Definitions and Interpretations; Sorghum




<AGENCY>

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends 40 CFR 180.1(h) by adding definitions of the commodity terms ``sorghum grain'' and ``sorghum
fodder and forage.'' The amendment to 40 CFR 180.1(h) is based, in part, on recommendations of the Interregional Research
Project No. 4 (IR-4).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 180.1(h) (40 CFR 180.1(h)) provides a listing of general commodity terms and listing of EPA's interpretation
of those terms as they apply to tolerances and exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance for pesticide chemicals
under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a. General commodities are listed in column
A of 40 CFR 180.1(h), and the corresponding specific commodities, for which tolerances and exemptions from the requirement
of a tolerance established for the general commodity apply, are listed in column B. As noted in the proposal published
in the 

Federal Register

 of November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62074), the Interregional Research Project No. 4 (IR-4), New Jersey Agricultural Experiment
Station, P.O. Box 231, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, requested that 40 CFR 180.1(h) be amended as follows:
(1) To add the commodity term ``sorghum (grain)'' to the general category of commodities in column A and to add the corresponding
specific commodities ``

Sorghum

 spp. [sorghum (grain), sundangrass (seed crop), and hybrids of these grown for its seed]'' to column B; and (2) to add
the commodity term ``sorghum (fodder, forage)'' to the general category of commodities in column A and to add the corresponding
specific commodities ``

Sorghum

 spp. [sorghum (fodder, forage), sudangrass, and hybrids of these grown for fodder and/or forage]'' to column B. 


There were no comments received in response to the proposed rule. 
The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that it is appropriate to add definitions for the
commodity terms ``sorghum grain'' and ``sorghum fodder and forage'' in 40 CFR 180.1(h). Therefore, the added definitions
are established as set forth below.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
Although this regulation does not establish or raise a tolerance level or establish an exemption from the requirement
of a tolerance, the impact of the regulation would be the same as establishing new tolerances or exemptions from the
requirement of a tolerance. Therefore, the Administrator concludes that this rule would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document establishes a tolerance for residues of the insecticide chlorpyrifos [

O,O

-diethyl 

O

-(3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl)phosphorothioate] in or on the raw agricultural commodity sugarcane. This regulation
to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of the insecticide in or on the commodity was requested in a petition
submitted by the Interregional Research Project No. 4 (IR-4).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67759), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that the Interregional Research Project
No. 4 (IR-4), New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, P.O. Box 231, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903,
had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 3E4192 to EPA on behalf of the Agricultural Experiment Stations of Florida
and Hawaii. The petition requested that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a(e)), propose the establishment of a tolerance for residues of chlorpyrifos in or
on the raw agricultural commodity sugarcane at 0.01 part per million (ppm).



There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance will protect the public
health. Therefore, the tolerance is established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Polyethylene Glycol-Polyisobutenyl Anhydride-Tall Oil Fatty Acid Copolymer; Tolerance Exemption




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of polyethylene glycol-polyisobutenyl
anhydride-tall oil fatty acid copolymer when used as an inert ingredient (surfactant, dispersing agent, suspending
agent, or related adjuvant) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops or to raw agricultural commodities
after harvest. This regulation was requested by ICI Americas, Inc.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of December 29, 1993 (58 FR 68827), EPA issued a proposed rule to exempt from the requirement of a tolerance residues
of polyethylene-glycol-polyisobutenyl anhydride-tall oil fatty acid copolymer when used as an inert ingredient
(surfactant, dispersing agent, suspending agent, or related adjuvant) in pesticide formulations applied to growing
crops or to raw agricultural commodities after harvest.


Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyetheylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active.
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemption will protect
the public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemption is established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially

altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


Medical services are furnished to Medicare beneficiaries by providers, suppliers, physicians, and other specified
practitioners. Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (the Act) defines the term physician. Under section 1861(r)
of the Act, the term physician, subject to limitations concerning the scope of practice by each State and other provisions
of title XVIII of the Act, means a doctor of_(1) Medicine or osteopathy; (2) Dental surgery or dental medicine; (3)
Podiatry; (4) Optometry; or (5) Chiropractic. 
Under provisions of section 1848(g)(4) of the Act, as added by section 6102(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 100-239), effective for services furnished on or after September 1, 1990, each physician
must submit a standard claim form (HCFA-1500) directly to the Medicare carrier on behalf of the beneficiary,
regardless of whether the physician provided the services on an assignment-related basis. (Under Medicare Part
B, a physician may bill the patient directly for the physician's services, thus requiring the beneficiary to seek
reimbursement from Medicare. Alternatively, under section 1842(b)(3)(B) of the Act, when a physician furnishes
services on an assignment-related basis, the physician bills Medicare directly in exchange for the physician's
agreement to accept the Medicare approved amount as payment in full. (Rules concerning assignment of claims are found
at   424.55, 424.56 and 424.70 

et seq.

) The HCFA-1500, which is also used by most third-party payers, including Medicaid and other Federal government
health insurance programs, is, in effect, an itemized bill. 
Before September 1, 1990, if a physician was not paid directly by Medicare for physician services, the physician either
billed the Medicare beneficiary directly or billed another third-party payer. The beneficiary then sought payment
from Medicare for expenses incurred in obtaining covered physician's services by submitting a Patient's Request
for Medicare Payment (HCFA-1490 S) to the carrier. This form directs the beneficiary to attach itemized bills
from his or her physician to the form. In limited cases, as provided under section 1842(b)(6)(B) of the Act and 42 CFR
part 424 when a third party made payment to the physician, the third party sought reimbursement from Medicare for this
payment by submitting a Request for Medicare Payment by Organizations which Qualify to Receive Payment for Paid Bills
(HCFA-1490 U). We required the physician to fill out Part II of this form, which was similar to an itemized bill.

Previously, each bill or request for payment for physician services furnished to a Medicare beneficiary had to include,
among other information, a narrative description of the diagnosis or the nature of the illness or injury for which
the beneficiary received care. Although prior to April 1, 1989 there was no requirement for diagnostic coding (that
is, a description of the diagnosis or the nature of the illness or injury in a numeric code), many physicians routinely
provided this information. In addition, all physicians provided a narrative description of procedures, medical
services, and supplies that were furnished to a beneficiary. 


II. Legislation Requiring Diagnostic Coding 


Section 202(g) of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-360), enacted July 1, 1988, added
paragraph (p) to section 1842 of the Act. Under the provisions of section 1842(p)(1) of the Act, each bill or request
for payment for physician services under Medicare Part B must include the appropriate diagnostic code ``as established
by the Secretary'' for each item or service for which the Medicare beneficiary received treatment.

The conference report that accompanied Public Law 100-360 explained clearly the purpose of the requirement
for physician diagnostic coding. After rejecting a Senate provision that would have required the use of diagnosis
codes on all prescriptions, because they felt that the requirement would have been ``unduly burdensome,'' the conferees
agreed to require diagnostic coding for physician services under Part B. They explained their reasons for this requirement
as follows: ``This information would be available for immediate use for utilization review of physician services
and could be used in the future to facilitate drug utilization review by merging Part B with drug claims data.'' H.R.
Conf. Rep. No. 661, 100th Cong., 2nd Sess. 191 (1988). 
Section 1842(p)(2) of the Act authorizes a denial of payment for a bill submitted by a physician on an assignment-related
basis if it does not include the appropriate diagnostic coding. 
Section 1842(p)(3) of the Act directs the Secretary to impose penalties if a physician who is not paid on an assignment-related
basis fails to provide the appropriate diagnostic coding on the bill to the Medicare beneficiary. That is, section
1842(p)(3)(A) of the Act provides for a civil money penalty not to exceed $2,000 if the physician knowingly and willfully
fails to provide the appropriate diagnostic coding. Section 1842(p)(3)(B) of the Act provides for a sanction under
1842(j)(2)(A) of the Act if the physician ``knowingly, willfully, and in repeated cases fails, after being notified
by the Secretary of the obligations and requirements of this subsection,'' to furnish appropriate diagnostic coding.
Section 1842(p)(3) of the Act does not prohibit the payment of an unassigned claim solely because the physician did
not provide diagnosis codes. As explained in section I of the preamble, effective for services furnished on or after
September 1, 1990, regardless of whether they provide services on an assignment related basis, physicians submit
claim forms directly to the Medicare carrier. The provisions of section 1848 of the Act, as added by 6102(a) of Public
Law 101-239, do not affect the penalties set forth in this rule for failure to include diagnostic coding on physician
bills. This final rule implements the provisions of section 1842 (p)(1) and (p)(2) of the Act. 


III. Provisions of the Proposed Rule 


On July 21, 1989 we published a proposed rule 
(54 FR 30558) to implement the provisions of section 1842(p)(1) of the Act. We proposed that each bill or request for
payment for physician services under Part B would have to include appropriate diagnostic coding ``as established
by the Secretary,'' relating to the nature of the illness or injury for which the Medicare beneficiary received care.

As noted above, generally, physician services furnished directly to a beneficiary are paid under Medicare Part B.
In addition, under the regulations set forth at subpart D of 42 CFR part 405, we make payments to hospitals under Part
A for physician services related to the supervision and teaching of interns and residents who participate in the care
of hospital inpatients. Also, the proposed rule did not apply to suppliers or other providers whose services are covered
under Part B. 
We proposed that a physician would be required to furnish diagnosis codes instead of the narrative description that
was previously required. We proposed to deny payment for a bill or request for payment for physician services furnished
on an assignment-related basis if the bill or request for payment does not contain the appropriate diagnostic coding.
This would not be true for a claim for physician services not furnished on an assignment-related basis. In other words,
if the beneficiary seeks Medicare reimbursement for payment for physician services, we proposed not to deny payment
solely because the claim does not contain diagnosis codes. If enough information were provided to enable a carrier
to process the claim, it would be processed without the diagnosis codes. As explained in section II of the preamble,
section 1842(p)(3)(B) of the Act provides for a sanction under section 1842(j)(2)(A) of the Act if the physician ``knowingly,
willfully, and in repeated cases fails, after being notified by the Secretary of the obligations and requirements
of this subsection,'' to furnish appropriate diagnostic coding.

We proposed to use the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)
as the most appropriate diagnostic coding system. 
The ICD is a classification system developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for recording morbidity and mortality
information for statistical purposes, for indexing hospital records by diseases, and for storing and retrieving
data. Effective with the Twentieth World Assembly of WHO, nomenclature regulations were adopted on May 22, 1967.
Article 21(b)(2) of these regulations specifies that ``members compiling mortality and morbidity statistics shall
do so in accordance with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries
and Causes of Death as adapted from time to time by the World Health Assembly. This Classification may be cited as the
`International Classification of Diseases'.'' The United States is signatory to the WHO's agreements, which include
the above nomenclature regulations binding the United States to the use of the ICD system for official government
health statistical purposes. The nomenclature regulations became effective on January 1, 1968. 
The clinical modification of the ninth revision to ICD (that is, ICD-9-CM) is a coding system for reporting
diagnostic information and procedures performed on patients in hospitals or other types of health care delivery
systems. 
ICD-9-CM was developed under the guidance of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to adapt
the ninth revision of the ICD classification system to the needs of hospitals in the United States. The modifications
were intended to provide a mechanism to present a clinical picture of the patient. Thus, ICD-9-CM codes
are more precise than those included in ICD-9 since greater detail is needed to describe the clinical picture
of a patient than for statistical groupings and trend analysis. 
Effective January 1979, after nearly two years of development by numerous national experts on clinical technical
matters, the ICD-9-CM became the single classification system intended for use by hospitals in the United
States. This system replaced several earlier related but somewhat dissimilar classification systems. Once the
ICD-9-CM classification system was in place, several errors and omissions were noted. Consequently,
in September 1980 a second edition of ICD-9-CM was published. The preface to the second edition noted that
the continuous maintenance of ICD-9-CM is the responsibility of the Federal government. The preface
also stated that no future modifications to 
ICD-9-CM would be made by the Federal government without considering the opinions of representatives
of major users of the classification system. 
In September 1985, the ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee (the Committee) was formed.
This is a Federal interdepartmental committee that maintains and updates the ICD-9-CM. This includes
approving new coding changes, developing errata, addenda, and other modifications to the ICD-9-CM to
reflect newly developed procedures and technologies and newly identified diseases. The Committee is also responsible
for promoting the use of Federal and non-Federal educational programs and other communication techniques with a
view toward standardizing coding applications and upgrading the quality of the classification system.

The Committee is co-chaired by NCHS and HCFA. NCHS has primary responsibility for the ICD-9-CM diagnosis
codes included in Volume 1_Diseases: Tabular List, and 
Volume 2_Diseases: Alphabetic Index. HCFA has primary responsibility for the ICD-9-CM procedure codes
included in Volume 3_Procedures: Tabular List and Alphabetic Index. 
The Committee encourages participation in the development of diagnosis and procedure codes by health-related organizations,
organizations in the coding field, and other members of the public. During each Federal fiscal year (FY), the Committee
holds three public meetings during which coding changes are discussed. Taking into account the public comments made
at each meeting and the public correspondence received after each meeting, the Committee formulates recommendations,
which must be approved by the co-chair agency heads, the Administrator of HCFA and the Director of NCHS, before adoption
for general use. Coding changes approved by the Committee and agency heads are published annually in the 

Federal Register

. 
Only official volumes and addenda of ICD-9-CM are to be considered in the assignment of diagnosis codes
for Medicare patients. HCFA is not responsible for mistakes made by businesses in the replication of these official
volumes and addenda, which are then sold to the public. Official addenda have become effective on May 1, 1986, and subsequently
on October 1 of each year from 1986 through the present. Another addendum, containing the Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV) Infection Codes, became effective for Medicare patients discharged on or after July 1, 1988. 
Before publication of the proposed rule on 
July 21, 1989, the GPO exhausted its supply of previously published addenda and announced that it had no plans to reprint
more copies. However, the private sector continues to publish changes to the ICD-9-CM coding system annually
by October 1st. The GPO also announced that it would no longer provide addenda except to subscription purchasers of
the third edition. ICD-9-CM, third edition, was published in March 1989; automatic addenda updates expired
in 1991. The third edition incorporates all addenda that were previously published. We stated in the July 21, 1989
proposed rule that if a physician had not yet obtained ICD-9-CM, second edition, and had not updated the
set with the addenda, he or she should obtain the recently updated Volumes 1 and 2 (that include all the addenda) (54
FR 30560). The American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA), previously known as the American Medical
Records Association (AMRA), the national professional association of medical records practitioners, and the American
Hospital Association (AHA) have indicated that they intend to reprint these future addenda and make them available
for sale. 
The price for Volumes 1 and 2 of ICD-9-CM, fourth edition, is $65.00 for delivery within the United States
and $81.25 for delivery outside of the United States. A purchaser must furnish an address other than a post office box
because the volumes will be delivered only to a place of business or a residence. When ordering, the purchaser should
enclose a check, money order, or Visa or Mastercard account name, number, and expiration date. Checks should be made
out to the Superintendent of Documents. 
Updated volumes 1 and 2 may be purchased by writing to the following address: ICD-9-CM, Fourth Edition,
Volumes 1 and 2, P.O. Box 371954, Pittsburgh, PA 15250-7954. (Telephone orders may be placed through the GPO
order desk at (202) 783-3238.) 
Section 424.32 sets forth the basic requirements for all claims. (The term ``claim'' is used when referring to the
regulatory language instead of the term ``bill or request for payment''.) In  424.32(a), all claims (including
those filed directly with Medicare by physicians, beneficiaries or other persons or entities for physician services
furnished to Medicare beneficiaries) must be filed in accordance with HCFA instructions. Section 424.34 provides
additional requirements for claims filed with Medicare by beneficiaries. Under  424.34(b)(4), the itemized
bill must include a listing of services in sufficient detail to permit determination of reasonable charges. We proposed
to make the following changes to the regulations text:

 Revise  424.32(a) to state specifically that a claim for physician services must include appropriate
diagnostic coding using ICD-9-CM. 
 Revise  424.34(b)(4) to state specifically that an itemized bill furnished by a physician to a beneficiary
for physician services must include appropriate diagnostic coding using ICD-9-CM. 
 Add to  424.3 the definition of ICD-9-CM, which means the International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. 
Coding and reporting requirements and instructions for diagnostic coding were developed in order to take into account
circumstances unique to care furnished by physicians. These coding and reporting requirements and instructions
for completing bills and requests for payment were developed before publication of the proposed rule and were distributed
to the carriers on March 3, 1989. The carriers then mailed this information, in the form of a Medicare Bulletin, to the
physicians whom they service. During preparation of these procedures and instructions, we consulted with the American
Medical Association (AMA) and provided the AMA an opportunity to comment on the material. 
In the proposed rule, we proposed a limited grace period during which payments would not be denied and sanctions would
not be imposed for failure to use diagnosis codes. We provided for a 6-month grace period until October 1, 1989 to allow
physicians and their office staff to obtain training and purchase books. On 
August 8, 1989, we notified carriers of the extension of the grace period through a memorandum from the HCFA Bureau
of Program Operations. For the convenience of the reader, we published the coding and reporting requirements as an
appendix to the proposed rule. 
AHIMA offered nationwide training classes and training materials for physician office staff for ICD-9-CM
diagnostic coding, as did the AMA. 
Suggestions concerning modification of the ICD-9-CM codes, or additions to the existing codes, may be
submitted in writing to the following address: 
National Center for Health Statistics, 
6525 Belcrest Road,
room 9-58, Hyattsville, MD 20782. 
In this final rule, we are adopting the requirements as stated in the proposed rule without modification. 


IV. Discussion of Public Comments 


In response to the proposed rule, we received 35 timely items of correspondence. Comments were received from physicians,
professional health-related organizations, universities and colleges, medical facilities, state governments,
laboratories, durable medical equipment suppliers and pharmaceutical companies. 


Although the majority of commenters were not opposed to the diagnostic coding requirement in general, they were concerned
with certain aspects of the proposed rule. 


A. Coding Issues 




Comment:

 One commenter inquired about the possibility of an indefinite delay of the ICD-9-CM diagnostic coding
requirement. Another commenter asserted that the diagnostic coding requirement should not be implemented until
final regulations are published, which should allow for a training period of 60 days before any adverse actions. 


Response:

 The original implementation date of April 1, 1989 was extended by a 60-day grace period to allow physicians and their
office staffs to purchase coding books and to obtain coding training. This grace period was further extended until
October 1, 1989, at which time we required all physicians to use ICD-9-CM codes on bills or requests for
payment. On August 8, 1989, we notified carriers of the extension through a memorandum from the HCFA Bureau of Program
Operations. In total, we allowed a 6-month grace period. We believe we provided a reasonable time period for physicians
and their staffs to prepare for the new coding requirements. 


Comment:

 The American Psychiatric Association disagreed with HCFA that the ICD-9-CM is the only classification
system acceptable for Medicare claims. They urged HCFA to allow the use of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised (DSM-III-R) coding system for mental disorders. The American
Medical Association also supports the DSM-III-R coding system for use by psychiatrists. 


Response:

 DSM-III-R was designed to be compatible with ICD-9-CM, but the two systems are not identical.
Systems such as DSM-III-R address only certain types of diagnoses, and cannot be used universally by all
types of practitioners to code all types of diagnoses on claims submitted to Medicare. In fact, ICD-9-CM
provides for greater specificity in coding mental disorders that DSM-III-R. Within the ``mental disorders''
range (codes 290-319) there are an additional 218 specific codes available in ICD 9-CM that are not in DSM-III-R.
Thus, we continue to believe that the ICD-9-CM system is the only comprehensive diagnostic coding system
that is suitable for Medicare claims. 


Comment:

 The College of American Pathologists stated that the ICD-9-CM coding system is limited in its description
of disease states. The commenter asserted that the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED), which it publishes,
is more specific. 


Response:

 The SNOMED is an excellent coding system. However, as stated above, the Department of Health and Human Services is
signatory to the WHO's nomenclature regulations binding the United States to use of the ICD for official government
purposes. Even though ICD-9-CM has recognized limitations, it can be updated as the need arises via the
ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee. 


Comment:

 One laboratory recommended that the burden of furnishing the proper diagnosis codes be placed on the physician ordering
a test rather than the supplier of the service. The commenter expressed a concern that the laboratory performing the
test should not be held responsible for performing a test that Medicare later determines to be not medically necessary.

<PARENT> FR940304-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response: 

The proposed rule and this final rule address the requirement for diagnostic coding of only physicians' bills. This
new coding requirement does not apply to bills from laboratories (except for physician laboratory services_see
 405.556). 


Comment:

 One commenter suggested that referring physicians provide a reason for the biopsy or referral. It requested that
this practice be encouraged and emphasized through carrier communication with the physicians. 


Response:

 We have always encouraged that the referring physician communicate the reason for the referral or specimen so the
proper medical interpretation is made or test is performed. We will continue to encourage carrier to convey this message
to the physician community. 


Comment:

 Three commenters were concerned that providing for only four diagnostic codes on the form HCFA-1500 is insufficient
in many cases to adequately describe a patient's condition. 


Response:

 Since the implementation of the diagnostic coding requirement, we have received few complaints concerning the form
HCFA-1500. Thus, we believe that four diagnosis codes are sufficient in most instances. We note that this regulation
is not intended to change the structure of the form HCFA-1500. Moreover, our contractors' claims processing
systems, as currently constructed, would not be able to accommodate more than four diagnosis codes on a single claim.


The use of codes instead of a narrative description should enhance the physician's ability to describe the patient's
condition with greater precision. If there are cases where the use of four codes is not sufficient, we suspect that
they would arise when more than one procedure has been performed (for example, psychological counseling provided
to a trauma patient). In such cases, the physician could submit one claim for the procedure that relates to four or fewer
diagnoses, and submit another claim for the other procedures with their attendant diagnoses. 


Comment:

 The American Ambulance Association requested that the final rule specify that the coding requirements do not apply
to ambulance services. 


Response:

 This final rule provides only that each bill or request for payment for physician services must include diagnostic
coding. These provisions do not apply to ambulance services. 


Comment:

 One commenter interpreted the proposed rule to imply that physicians must now submit claims for services that they
would not have normally billed under the previous guidelines. The commenter requested that HCFA clarify this point
in the final rule. 


Response:

 Although the ICD-9-CM coding system permits classification of many services for which specific codes
could be used, the mere presence of an ICD-9-CM code does not, of itself, mean that a bill or request for payment
must include the code for that service. If a physician generally would not have submitted a bill or request for payment
for a particular service prior to the physician diagnostic coding requirement, the physician may not be required
to submit a bill for that service under the new rules. For instance, HCFA did not mean to imply, under an example in the
guidelines published in the proposed rule (54 FR 30564), that a bill should be submitted for a service for X.3, attention
to surgical dressings and sutures, if this service is included in the surgeon's global charge. However, if this service
is performed by another physician, unrelated to the surgeon, it might be appropriate for the second surgeon to use
this code to describe the reason for the encounter. 


Comment:

 One commenter suggested that HCFA clarify in the final rule whether the new regulations supersede or supplement individual
carrier coding policies since there are conflicts between the new and old coding practices.

<TEXT>
 



Response:

 The requirements in this final rule supersede any individual carrier coding policies. Those carrier coding policies
have been changed to comply with the requirements of this final rule. 


Comment:

 Both the AMA and the American Society of Internal Medicine stated that supplying codes for signs and symptoms without
also supplying codes indicating diagnoses that the physician has ruled out will not accurately describe the patient's
conditions and explain the reasons for the care provided. Another commenter recommended that we allow the use of ``suspected''
and ``rule out'' codes. 


Response:

 The coding guidelines state that each visit must be coded to describe the specific reason that the patient sought care
or treatment. The guidelines also state: ``Do not code diagnosis documented as ``suspected,'' ``rule out,'' ``probable,''
or ``questionable'' as if they are established. Rather, code the condition to the highest degree of certainty for
that encounter/visit to reflect symptoms, signs, abnormal test results, or other reasons for the visit.'' To require
coding of ``probable,'' ``suspected,'' ``questionable,'' or ``rule out'' conditions as if the conditions existed
would lead to significant overcounting of conditions. This inaccurate recording would distort data and would artificially
distort disease statistics. Therefore, physicians should report diagnosis codes for symptoms and signs but should
exclude codes for diagnoses that the physician either suspects or rules out. 


Comment:

 Several commenters asked how they should code for situations in which a patient presents disabling symptoms but no
diagnosis exists for the patient. They recommended that the diagnosis codes include codes for symptoms. 


Response:

 Diagnosis codes should reflect the diagnosis, condition, problem, or other reason for the encounter or visit shown
in the medical record to be chiefly responsible for the services provided. However, the carrier will also accept codes
for symptoms when no other more definite code can be given to describe the reason for the visit of the patient. This is
explained further in guideline number four of the Appendix_Claims Review and Adjudication Procedures, published
with the proposed rule (54 FR 30564, 
July 21, 1989). 


Comment:

 Two commenters suggested that correlating the ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes and the CPT-4 procedures
codes is a redundant effort since a procedure may be performed as the result of several conditions. They urged that
the requirement be deleted.

<PARENT> FR940304-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response:

 Correlating the narrative diagnosis and the CPT-4 procedure code is a requirement of the Medicare carrier,
and has been a standard requirement for years. It has only been modified by the new physician diagnostic coding requirements.
Physicians must now correlate the ICD-9-CM code, instead of the narrative, to the CPT-4 code. 



Comment:

 One commenter stated that suppliers cannot be required to include diagnostic coding on Part B bills even though they
often provide the diagnostic codes identified by the physician on bills for equipment and supplies. 



Response:

 We have never required suppliers to include diagnostic coding on their Part B bills. Section 1842(p)(1) of the Act
requires physicians, as defined in section 1861(r) of the Act, and subject to limitations concerning the scope of
practice by each State and other provisions of title XVIII of the Act, to furnish diagnostic coding. That is, only doctors
of medicine or osteopathy, dental surgery or dental medicine, podiatry, optometry, or chiropractic must furnish
diagnostic coding. Durable medical equipment suppliers are not included in this requirement. 



Comment:

 One commenter inquired why his or her carrier included messages in the explanation of the Medicare benefit worksheet
regarding both diagnostic coding requirements (ICD-9-CM) and procedural coding requirements (CPT-4)
since the proposed rule (54 FR 30559, July 21, 1989) stated that there is no current requirement for diagnostic coding.




Response:

 The statement on page 54 FR 30559 referred to the policy before implementation of section 1842(p)(1) of the Act that
requires physician diagnostic coding instead of the written narrative that was previously required. We are now conforming
the regulations to the previously issued administrative instructions. 

The CPT-4 coding (part of the HCFA Common Procedural Coding System) describes physician services and supplies,
not diagnoses. If either fields 23 or 24c on the form HCFA-1500 are blank, the carrier will communicate with the
physician via the explanation of the Medicare benefit worksheet requesting completion of this information. 



Comment:

 A commenter asserted that as an incentive all bills or requests for payment without ICD-9-CM codes should
be rejected and that properly coded bills and requests for payment should be expedited. 



Response:

 The Act specifically provides for denial of payment for a bill submitted by a physician on an assignment-related basis
if it does not include the appropriate diagnostic code. For a claim for an item or service not submitted on an assignment-related
basis, the Act authorizes the Secretary to impose a civil money penalty, not to exceed $2,000, against a physician
seeking payment who knowingly and willfully fails to promptly provide the appropriate diagnostic coding on the bill
to the Medicare beneficiary upon the request of the Secretary or a carrier. If the physician knowingly, willfully,
and in repeated cases fails, after being notified by the Secretary of the statutorily prescribed obligations, to
include the requisite diagnostic codes, the physician may also be subject to administrative sanctions. However,
the payment of an unassigned claim may not be prohibited solely because the physician has not furnished the diagnosis
codes. 

We considered, but rejected, the idea of expediting properly coded bills and requests for payment since we do not handle
properly coded bills for Part A services in a special manner. Properly coding bills is a standard requirement to receive
payment for services. However, payment would occur more quickly for properly coded bills because there would be no
need for resubmission because of errors in coding. 



Comment:

 A clinical laboratory stated that bills and requests for payment with diagnostic coding can be processed electronically
at a much lower cost to Medicare than we projected in the proposed rule.

Response:

 The cost projections in the proposed rule for electronically processed claims are the expected costs for physicians
to comply with the requirement for diagnostic coding on all bills and requests for payment rather than the costs of
the carriers in processing the bills and requests for payment. 



Comment:

 One association asked the implied meaning of the statement ``* * * (diagnostic coding) could be used
for prepayment screens'' (54 FR 30559, July 21, 1989). The commenter asked where the ICD-9-CM and CPT-4
information is being collected and what future plans are being implemented for the use of the information. The association
was informed by its carrier that the carrier does not believe the ICD-9-CM and CPT-4 codes will eventually
be used for a prospective payment system for physicians. 



Response:

 Billing information is compiled by each carrier and then electronically transmitted to HCFA's Bureau of Data Management
and Strategy in Baltimore, Maryland. This Bureau is largely responsible for performing HCFA's mathematical and
statistical programming and for managing HCFA's statistical data bases to support program decisions by various
HCFA components. Current and possible applications for the ICD-9-CM and CPT-4 coding information
include answering research queries from private sources, development of quality assurance monitoring mechanisms,
assessment of the impact of proposals that affect health care financing programs, or special research and evaluation
studies. The Bureau uses diagnostic coding information to design and develop periodic statistical tabulations
to assess the characteristics of beneficiaries and the utilization and cost of program benefits. The CPT-4
codes also are now used for payment purposes under the fee schedule for physician services. 



Comment:

 One commenter was concerned about the increased costs for manpower and the reformatting of her billing system associated
with implementation of the diagnostic coding requirement. 



Response:

 We cannot predict the increased costs or manpower that an individual office would incur as a result of the diagnostic
coding requirement. However, in the impact analysis to this final rule, we discuss our estimate of the aggregate costs
associated with coding training and ICD-9-CM coding books. Also, as discussed in the impact analysis,
we now estimate that about 90 percent of physicians included diagnostic coding on bills before it was required by section
1842(p) of the Act. These physicians may not have experienced as significant an increase in costs as physicians who
did not code before the requirement was established. 



Comment:

 One commenter stated that since general practitioners care for the whole patient, it is sometimes difficult to find
an applicable diagnosis even after looking through 2,000 pages of codes. The physician recommended that we allow
three digit codes to be used for procedures for which physicians routinely charge less than $200. 



Response:

 We are aware that general practitioners are responsible for coding a wide range of diagnoses. To determine the correct
code, Volume 2, Index, must be consulted first. After the correct code has been determined, Volume 1 is then referenced
to determine if there are other coding conventions that apply, such as ``Includes'' or ``Excludes'' notes. 

We cannot accept the recommendation to allow the use of three digit codes in any circumstance where an applicable four
or five digit code exists. Codes must be used to their highest level of specificity; this may include some three digit
codes. If diagnoses are coded to the highest level, using the same data base for all bills and requests for payment will
permit meaningful trend analysis and data comparisons. 



Comment:

 Several commenters stated that the estimate of 1 minute to code a bill or request for payment is too short. The estimate
does not consider the time a physician spends with office staff to select the correct diagnosis code.

Response: 

The estimate of 1 minute to code a bill or request for payment was made by AHIMA based on their professional coding experience
and expertise. We believe that this is a realistic figure for several reasons. First, there are many physicians who
are specialists, and who will use only a small portion of the coding manuals during their normal course of business.
We anticipate that these physicians and their office staffs will quickly identify those parts of the coding books
that apply to their practice. Additionally, many offices have developed reference lists pertaining to the codes
frequently used in their particular practices. Once this list has been developed, very little physician involvement
is required for the coding process. 

The amount of time necessary for the physician to work with his or her clerical staff in the selection of the correct
diagnosis code(s) was not factored into the estimate of 1 minute. That estimate reflected the use of the code book or
reference list and the documentation process, whether manual or key entry. We anticipate that the diagnosis code(s)
will become as familiar to the office staffs as the recording of the narrative diagnostic language, and that completion
of the billing form will proceed as smoothly as it did prior to the implementation of this diagnostic coding requirement.




B. Patient Information and Confidentiality 





Comment: 

The American Psychiatric Association (APA) stated that there may be instances when the diagnosis information provided
to the patient (particularly in non-assigned claims) could have an adverse impact on the patient and course of treatment.
The APA suggests that HCFA have an exceptions process that allows the physician to determine whether diagnosis information
should be directly provided to the patient. 



Response: 

We agree, and note that there is already an established procedure for such situations. The physician should file the
form HCFA-1500 on behalf of the beneficiary as required by section 1848(g)(4) of the Act. The form should include
the appropriate diagnostic codes and should be forwarded to the Medicare carrier. If a physician determines that
diagnostic information should not be released directly to a patient, the physician may furnish bills to the patient
without diagnostic information. In addition to psychiatric diagnoses, physicians also may choose to use this procedure
for terminal illnesses or other conditions of a sensitive nature. 



Comment: 

The APA expressed a concern that HCFA should have a mechanism in place to assure that diagnostic information is kept
confidential and not released to third parties except when permitted by law. It recommended that the regulations
be amended to include privacy protection. 



Response: 

We share the APA's concerns about the confidentiality of patient information. To assure that the beneficiary is protected,
when we release medical data, the data do not include any patient-specific identifiers. Patient-specific medical
data in the custody of HCFA and its intermediaries and carriers are fully protected by the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a).




C. Utilization Review 





Comment: 

A pharmaceutical company is concerned that utilization review of physician services and future drug utilization
review may be less effective because of the limitation of four diagnostic codes on the bill or request for payment.




Response: 

Utilization review of physician services will be enhanced by the diagnostic coding requirement since the information
can be categorized by code and made available for immediate use. At this time, we have no plans to implement a drug utilization
review program using the diagnostic coding information on the form HCFA-1500. We will consider the effect of
the four diagnostic code limitations if we propose a drug utilization review program. 



Comment: 

One commenter questioned the possibility of the physician diagnostic coding requirement eventually becoming a
tool to standardize physician practice patterns nationwide without physician input.

Response: 

The information obtained from the ICD-9-CM codes will be used for compiling statistical information.
Any new requirements or procedures would not be implemented without physician input and, if appropriate, a notice
of proposed rulemaking. 



Comment: 

One commenter asserted that the ICD-9-CM coding system is a bulky, unreliable system for gathering data.




Response: 

The ICD-9-CM coding system was developed under the guidance of the National Center for Health Statistics
for greater specificity in reporting illnesses and injuries in the United States. The ICD-9-CM coding
system is the best system available for recording the diagnoses of Medicare beneficiaries. The system is not considered
unreliable by most users; however, errors do occur as a result of physicians' incorrect application of the codes.


To help make the coding system meet the needs of all users, we welcome input from interested physicians, organizations
and the public through the ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee meetings. 



Comment: 

One commenter asked for the name of an agency that can give advice and answer questions concerning coding issues. 



Response: 

The AHA is the official clearinghouse for questions concerning the ICD-9-CM system. They accept written
questions and will provide a written reply. The AMA is also providing ICD-9-CM coding advice to its members
through their CPT Clearing House Hotline (312) 464-4737. In addition, each carrier has designated a contact
person to answer the concerns raised by the physicians they service. We encourage close communication between a physician
and the carrier to avoid coding problems. 



Comment: 

Several commenters expressed concern that requiring coding to the fifth digit is burdensome and will require a more
skilled person to properly code the diagnoses. One commenter stated that prior to the new physician diagnostic coding
requirement, coding by physicians was generally limited to three digits.



Response: 

We did not anticipate a significant burden upon physicians as a result of coding to the fifth digit level when the proposed
rule was published, and have not had complaints from the physician community since that time. We continue to believe
that most physicians or their office staff create reference lists of diagnoses encountered most often. Since 1979,
the ICD-9-CM coding system has been in use and has contained five digit codes. Thus, we do not agree that
coding by physicians previously was limited to three digits. 



Comment: 

One commenter asserted that it would be advantageous if the format requirements for submitting bills or requests
for payment are published with the proposed rule. 



Response: 

The Medicare Carriers Manual explains how to fill out bills and requests for payment. Basically, the only format requirement
for the diagnostic coding is to put each appropriate code in the space that is provided for those codes under the heading
``Nature of Illness or Injury.'' 

The form HCFA-1500 and accompanying sections of the Carriers Manual are already subject to public comment,
pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. In accordance with that Act, OMB reviews the form HCFA-1500
and its instructions at least once every 3 years. The Department publishes a notice in the 

Federal Register

 that informs the public of OMB's review and solicits comments for OMB's consideration in the course of its review.




Comment: 

The AMA stated that pathologists have expressed a concern that failure to list a second diagnosis after V72.6, Laboratory
examination, may lead to medical necessity review problems. The AMA requested that we inform the carriers that V72.6
code meets the Medicare coding requirements. 



Response: 

We agree that in many instances one code (V72.6) will explain the reason for the patient's encounter. Carriers should
identify a way of determining the proper coverage policy issue through the use of a screen. We recommend that all laboratory
claims begin with the code V72.6, Laboratory examination. However, by supplying a second code to describe the reason
for the referral, the bill or request for payment can clearly be identified as referrals to evaluate symptoms, signs,
or diagnoses, instead of being part of a routine physical examination that is not covered by Medicare. 



Comment: 

One commenter inquired about how the ``V'' codes should be sequenced for diagnostic services on the bill or request
for payment.

<DOCNO> FR940304-0-00044 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940304-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response:

 Ancillary diagnostic services, which are coded beginning with a ``V,'' are provided in laboratories and radiology
offices if the patient's main reason for the visit is to get an x-ray, (V72.5, Radiological examination, not elsewhere
classified), or to have a test conducted (V72.6, Laboratory examination.) The condition for which the patient sought
treatment will be reflected in the additional diagnoses. In coding ancillary diagnostic services, it may be helpful
to question the reason for the encounter. The reason for the encounter is that the patient visited the laboratory or
radiology office to have either an analysis performed or an x-ray taken. 



D. Training 





Comment:

 One commenter stated that HCFA's estimate that 70 percent of physicians and office staff will need ICD-9-CM
coding training is a gross underestimate. 



Response:

 We do not believe that our estimate of 70 percent of physicians and office staff in need of coding training was too low.
In fact, we believe that most physicians and office staff did not require coding training. Immediately after implementation
of the diagnostic coding requirement, medical review at the intermediary level did not reveal significant coding
problems. Since that time, the majority of physician bills using ICD-9-CM coding have passed intermediary
edits for accuracy. In addition, many physicians did not need training since they submitted ICD-9-CM
codes prior to April 1989 due to the requirements of third party payers for non-Medicare patients. We believe that
the lack of coding problems indicates that, if anything, we may have overestimated the proportion of physicians and
office staff that needed training. 



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that HCFA require the Medicare carriers to provide ICD-9-CM training and technical
assistance to physicians and providers. 



Response:

 The Medicare carriers were required by HCFA to provide initial ICD-9-CM coding training prior to the April
1, 1989 implementation date. A National Carriers Training program was held in February 1989 in preparation for the
training done in each State by each carrier. The National Carriers Training was conducted by AHIMA, with input on the
program from the AMA. Subsequently, each carrier was responsible for conducting its own training program on a state-by-state
basis. In many cases, carriers worked with the State medical societies in conducting the training. Diagnostic coding
training for physicians and physician office staffs has been ongoing since the implementation of this requirement,
especially through courses and sessions sponsored by the private sector. For further information concerning coding
training, physicians can contact their State medical society, the AMA, AHIMA, their State component of the medical
record or medical health information association, or their carrier. 



E. Sanctions Process and Civil Money Penalties 





Comment:

 One commenter indicated that the sanction provisions for noncompliance with the coding requirements are illogical
since coding bills or requesting payment with ICD-9-CM codes is essentially a clerical function. The
civil monetary penalties and sanction actions by the Office of Inspector General are perceived as excessive since
clerical errors of omission and inaccurately coded diagnoses will be inevitable. Another commenter recommended
that the sanctions process should not apply to the ICD-9-CM coding requirement. 



Response:

 Coding is a task routinely delegated by physicians to billing clerks or staff. However, this delegation does not relieve
the physician of the responsibility to submit bills or requests for payment that meet the requirements of the law.




Comment:

 One medical association questioned whether the carrier considers the remarks on the explanation of the Medicare
benefit (EOMB) form an advisement of a violation (for not including diagnostic coding on a bill or request for payment)
that will be referred to the OIG for investigation and possible sanctions. The commenter asked why the carrier includes
a remark in the EOMB stating that they will process this claim but will not process future claims. The association suggests
that the message on the EOMB should contain a more complete and accurate statement. 



Response:

 Messages that appear on the EOMB have been revised and are more clear and explanatory. It is not our intent to put the
beneficiary at risk by not paying a bill or request for payment lacking an ICD-9-CM code. For claims submitted
by physicians who do not accept assignment, the carrier will process the bill or request for payment as usual, substituting
a ``dummy'' code for the ICD-9-CM coding. 

The carrier will collect physician-specific information about the quantity of the dummy codes generated per physician.
When a threshold of ten bills or requests for payment is reached, the carrier is instructed to contact the physician
in order to explain the necessity of providing diagnostic coding and to help with training. If the physician subsequently
knowingly, willfully, and in repeated cases fails to supply the requested codes, the Office of the Inspector General
may invoke a civil money penalty.

F. Availability of the ICD-9-CM 





Comment:

 Two commenters expressed concern that the Government Printing Office (GPO) does not stock a sufficient supply of
the ICD-9-CM coding books, which results in a 4-to-8 week delay in receiving the books. 



Response:

 ICD-9-CM books are in stock at the special address mentioned elsewhere in this preamble. We are aware of
the potential demand and have an adequate supply. All orders are sent by priority mail. 



V. Impact Analysis 



Unless the Secretary certifies that a final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) . For purposes of the RFA, all physicians are considered to be small
entities. 

The statutory requirement that physicians use diagnostic coding has been in effect since April, 1989, and we believe
that the vast majority of physicians were already using ICD-9-CM coding even before that time. Thus, the
economic impact of this final rule on the physician community should be minimal. 

In the proposed rule, we prepared a voluntary impact analysis and voluntary regulatory flexibility analysis because
of our inability to quantify with any degree of precision the estimated costs of these provisions and the large number
of physicians who were affected by the provisions of section 1842(p) of the Act. These provisions require that each
bill or request for payment for a service furnished by a physician include appropriate diagnostic coding related
to the illness or injury for which the Medicare beneficiary received treatment. Under section 1842(p) of the Act,
a physician who is to be paid on an assignment-related basis will not be paid if he or she fails to include appropriate
diagnostic coding on the bill. In this final rule we have revised the impact analysis based on public comment. 

With one exception, any effects of this final rule will be a direct result of the legislative provisions in section
1842(p) of the Act. The exception is a result of the discretion that section 1842(p)(1) of the Act provides the Secretary
in the choice of which system to use to code diagnoses. We chose to use ICD-9-CM because it is the only comprehensive
coding system that includes all possible diagnoses for Medicare beneficiaries. For that reason, it is already widely
used by physicians. Furthermore, we are already using ICD-9-CM in the Medicare program for classifying
DRGs for payment under the inpatient hospital prospective payment system. Therefore, we believe that it is the easiest
coding system for physician use. 

Before April 1, 1989, physicians were not required to provide ICD-9-CM or any other type of diagnostic
codes on their Medicare bills or requests for payment. Therefore, we believe that physicians who were not coding before
the provisions of section 1842(p) of the Act were affected through increased paperwork, the cost of training themselves
and their staff, and the probable need to purchase Volumes 1 and 2 of the ICD-9-CM, fourth edition. 

As of December 31, 1986, there were 569,160 physicians practicing in the United States (Physician Characteristics
and Distribution in the U.S., 1986. Department of Data Release Services, Division of Survey and Data Resources, American
Medical Association, 1987). In the proposed rule, we estimated that at least 30 percent of physicians used ICD-9-CM
codes before the requirements of section 1842(p) were established, presumably because of requirements of other
third party payers that ICD-9-CM diagnosis or procedure codes be used on their claims. Thus, we estimated
that up to 70 percent of practicing physicians did not report codes before the requirement was established (that is,
approximately 398,000 physicians).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940304-0-00046 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940304-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In this final rule, we have revised our estimate of the number of physicians who reported ICD-9-CM codes
before the requirements of section 1842(p) of the Act were established. As stated in section III of this preamble,
we provided for a 6-month grace period following the statutory implementation date of April 1, 1989, during which
no claims would be denied for lack of coding. The grace period ended on October 1, 1989. It has been our experience that,
when grace periods are established, providers usually do not comply with the required provisions until the end of
the grace period, presumably because of lack of training or need for a preparation period. In this case, however, approximately
90 percent of the claims were coded using ICD-9-CM during the first month of the grace period, and the compliance
rate remained at approximately 90 percent for the duration of the grace period. Moreover, intermediary review of
these claims revealed no significant coding problems. Since the number of physicians that complied with the coding
requirement remained stable throughout the grace period, we believe that the number of physicians who reported codes
during the grace period is indicative of the number of physicians who were reporting codes before the requirement
was established. Therefore, we now estimate that approximately 90 percent of physicians reported ICD-9-CM
codes before April, 1989 (that is, approximately, 512,000 physicians). The discussion below reflects this revised
estimate. 
If all the physicians who did not report ICD-9-CM codes before April 1989 needed new coding books, ICD-9-CM
Volumes 1 and 2 at a cost of $65.00 per set, the total cost would have been approximately $3,700,000. In practice, however,
we believe that not all of these physicians needed to purchase new coding books. For example, some physicians belonged
to group practices, some worked for hospitals and do not have their own patients, and some already owned coding books.
For purposes of this impact analysis, however, we assume that all physicians who did not code before April, 1989 purchased
new coding books. 
In the proposed rule, in calculating costs of training and coding for physicians who did not code before April 1989,
we estimated the average wages of a physician's office staff person at $4.50 an hour. In response to the July 21, 1989
proposed rule, we received several comments stating that we had underestimated the average hourly wages for a physician's
office staff member. We agree that our estimate of $4.50 per hour was too low. In this final rule, we are revising our
estimate of the hourly rate based on comments received on the proposed rule and our examination of the hourly wages
of physicians' office staff in the monthly publication ``Employment and Earnings'' (U.S. Department of Labor Bureau
of Labor Statistics, ``Employment and Earnings'' Vol. 37, No. 4, April 1990, p. 131 (Washington, DC)). Our revised
estimate of the typical wage for a staff person at the time the requirement was established is $9.65 per hour. 
Based on claims data, we believe there were approximately 320.1 million physician claims processed for the period
from April 1, 1989 to March 31, 1990. We estimated that the clerical cost of coding each claim was $0.16 for a total of
$51,216,000 for the first year that the requirement was in effect. We arrived at the $0.16 figure by assuming an hourly
rate of the typical physician's office staff person to be $9.65 per hour, as explained above. We believe that it takes
1 minute to code a claim, therefore $9.65 divided by 60 minutes results in a $0.16 cost per claim. However, we believe
that 90 percent of the claims were being coded prior to April 1, 1989. Thus, 10 percent of the cost of coding claims (approximately
$5,120,000) can be attributed to the provision of section 1842(p) of the Act.

We anticipated that each physician that did not report ICD-9-CM codes before April 1, 1989 would either
send one or more persons for training, or may have determined that formal training was not needed. Some of those physicians
may not have sent any staff since they are in a group practice, (in which case, one staff member may represent several
physicians), or because they work for hospitals (in which case they would not submit Part B claims.) 
Below, in two examples, we are providing the extremes of estimated training costs using the same methodology as set
forth in the impact analysis of the proposed rule. In the first example, we assume that all physicians who did not code
prior to April 1989 sent, on average, one of their office staff to attend a half-day session sponsored by a national
firm. We anticipated that the cost of such a training session could have been as high as $100.00. Thus, for this estimate,
we are assuming a cost of $100.00. Furthermore, we assume the physicians paid an hourly rate of $9.65 per hour to their
employees while they attended the coding session. Given these assumptions, we estimated training costs as follows:

(All estimates are rounded to the nearest $10,000.) 





 

In the second example, we assume that physicians who did not code before the requirement was established in April 1989
sent, on average, one of their office staff to coding sessions sponsored by carriers or insurance companies at no cost.
Assuming that the office employee was paid $9.65 an hour, we estimated the total training costs as follows: 



 

Below, we show the total estimated first year costs for the two examples. 
 For the first example, the total estimated first year costs consisted of:

 For the second example, the total estimated first year costs consisted of:

 


 

Therefore, we estimate that first year training costs were between $11 million and $16 million. The cost of updated
books will be an ongoing expense. Training costs will be recurring to the extent that staff turnover will occur. Coding
costs will be ongoing. However, we believe that coding time and costs will probably be reduced with experience. 
Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final rule will have
a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis must conform
to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital
as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. 
We are not preparing a rural impact statement since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final
rule will not have an impact on a significant number of small rural hospitals.

This final rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 


V. Paperwork Reduction Act 


Regulations at  424.32(a) and  424.34(b) contain information collection and recordkeeping requirements
that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.
3501 through 3511). These regulations and the information collection and record keeping requirements apply to the
requirement that a physician provide appropriate diagnostic coding on each bill or request for payment for a physician
service furnished under Medicare Part B. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated
to average one minute per submitted Part B claim. This includes time spent reviewing instructions, searching existing
data sources, gathering and maintaining needed data, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.
The information and record keeping requirements associated with this final rule have been approved by the Office
of Management and Budget in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (approval number 0938-0008).

Aid to Families With Dependent Children Increase in Stepparent Income Disregard



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Administration for Children and Families (ACF), HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

 Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule implements the change in the stepparent earned income disregards for the Aid to Families with Dependent
Children (AFDC) program as provided under section 13742 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1993.
This provision increases the stepparent earned income disregard from $75 to $90.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




Discussion of Rule Provision



Pursuant to section 402(a)(31) of the Social Security Act (the Act) the income of an AFDC dependent child's stepparent
who lives in the same home as the child is counted in the monthly determination of eligibility and the amount of assistance.
This provision is applied in States that do not have laws of general applicability holding a stepparent legally responsible
to the same extent as a natural or adoptive parent. Section 402(a)(31) also provides for the disregard of certain portions
of the stepparent's income in determining the amount to be counted, including the first $75 of the stepparent's monthly
earned income.

Effective October 1, 1989, Public Law 100-485 amended section 402(a)(8)(ii) of the Act by increasing the standard
work expense disregard for AFDC applicants and recipients from $75 to $90. However, it did not increase the comparable
$75 earned income disregard for stepparents.

Thus, to be consistent, section 13742 of Public Law 103-66, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of
1993, amended section 402(a)(31)(A) of the Act by increasing the earned income disregard for stepparents from $75
to $90 per month. We have amended  233.20(a)(3)(xiv)(A) to reflect this statutory change.



Regulatory Procedures 



Justification for Dispensing With Notice of Proposed Rulemaking



The amendment to this regulation is being published as a final rule. The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B),
provides that, if the Department for good cause finds the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is unnecessary, impractical
or contrary to the public interest, it may dispense with such notice if it incorporates a brief statement of the reasons
for doing so in the rules issued.

The Department finds that there is good cause to dispense with a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking with respect to this
change. Publication of this rule in proposed form would be unnecessary as the change simply implements the statutory
provision and does not involve administrative discretion.



Executive Order 12866



Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities
and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department has determined that this rule is consistent with these
priorities and principles. This rule has no costs and merely conforms the codified regulation to the statute.

Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not require any information collection activities and therefore no approval is necessary under the
Paperwork Reduction Act.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354) requires the Federal Government to anticipate and reduce the
impact of regulations and paperwork requirements on small businesses. The primary impact of this final rule is on
State governments and individuals. Therefore, we certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities because it affects benefits to individuals and payments to States. Thus,
a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.

Transport Rate Structure and Pricing



<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This order modifies certain features of the price cap regulatory system applicable to local exchange carriers (LECs)
to complement the FCC's recent restructure of the LECs' local transport rates. Specifically, the order moves transport
services, including all the transmission-related elements, the tandem switching charge, and the interconnection
charge, out of the price cap basket for traffic sensitive services, and places them into a combined ``trunking'' basket
containing transport and special access services. The order realigns the service categories and subcategories
within the trunking basket, and adapts the pricing bands applicable to these categories and subcategories, to reflect
the similarities between certain special access and flat-rated transport services, and to accommodate the new density
zone pricing system that the Commission adopted for both special access and transport. These rule changes encourage
the LECs to align their transport rates to reflect more closely how costs are incurred, thus promoting more efficient
usage and deployment of the country's telecommunications networks, advancing competition in both the long-distance
and local access markets, and ultimately reducing access charges and long-distance rates and stimulating the economy
by increasing demand for these services.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a synopsis of the Commission's Second Report and Order in CC Docket No. 91-213, adopted on January 19,
1994 and released on January 31, 1994. The complete text of this Second Report and Order is available for inspection
and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center, 1919 M St. NW., room 230, Washington, DC 20554.



Synopsis of Second Report and Order



1. The Commission adopts its proposal to remove the transport service categories from the traffic sensitive basket
and place them into a combined basket that also contains special access services. The Commission renames this merged
basket the ``trunking basket.'' The Commission is placing the tandem switching charge in the newly formed trunking
basket, and keeping it in the same service category as tandem-switched transport. The Commission is placing the interconnection
charge service category in the trunking basket.

2. The Commission is adopting a modified version of its proposal in the Further Notice in this proceeding, 57 FR 54205
(Nov. 17, 1992), on the arrangement of service categories within the newly formed trunking basket. The Commission
concludes that flat-rated transport (entrance facilities, direct-trunked transport, and dedicated signalling
transport) should be incorporated into the corresponding special access service categories. Thus, demand for voice
grade flat-rated transport will be assigned to the existing voice grade-WATS-metallic-telegraph service category
in the current special access basket for the purposes of computing the service band index (SBI) and pricing bands for
that category. Demand for DS1 and DS3 flat-rated transport will be assigned, respectively, to the DS1 and DS3 subcategories
of the high capacity-DDS service category in the current special access basket for purposes of computing the SBIs
and bands for those subcategories. Tandem-switched transport (including the tandem switching element) and the
interconnection charge will be separate service categories in the trunking basket.

3. The Commission concludes that the density pricing zone subcategories within the flat-rated transport service
category should be incorporated into the existing zone subcategories within the existing DS3 and DS1 special access
subcategories, with one exception. In some cases, a LEC might implement density zone pricing for transport in a different
tariff year than it implemented density zone pricing for special access. In such circumstances, the Commission will
require LECs to retain separate zone bands for special access and flat-rated transport services until the end of the
tariff year following the tariff year in which density pricing was implemented for the later service. After that time,
the zone bands for special access and transport can be consolidated.

4. The Commission is not modifying the pricing bands applicable to the transport or special access service categories
at this time. The service category bands constrain the LECs' ability to offset rate reductions in some categories
with rate increases in other categories.

5. The Commission is setting forth the details of establishing the indexes and banding limits for the new trunking
basket and the realigned service categories within that basket. First, the 2% upper and 5% lower bands for tandem-switched
transport and the 0% upper band for the interconnection charge apply to changes from the initial rates for these services
as of the transport rate restructure, regardless of whether the LECs raised or lowered their local transport rates
prior to the rate restructure. (``Initial rates'' refers to the rates that became effective as a result of the September
1, 1993 initial restructured transport tariff filing, or rates that subsequently go into effect as the result of the
mid-course correction.) Thus, the LECs should set their initial bands and SBIs for the tandem-switched transport
and interconnection charge service categories using the baseline of the initial restructured rate levels.

6. Because 47 CFR part 61 does not explicitly address the manner in which service categories are to be merged, the Commission
adopts transition rules governing how the initial banding limits and indexes should be set for the new trunking basket
and the realigned service categories within that basket. The initial degree of pricing flexibility for the trunking
basket will be set by taking into account both the pricing flexibility currently available in the special access basket
and the pricing flexibility available in the traffic sensitive basket (which currently includes transport). Thus,
while the pre-existing actual price index (API) for the special access basket will be used as the initial API for the
trunking basket, the PCI for the trunking basket should be set as follows. LECs should calculate the ratio between
the pre-existing PCI for the special access basket and the API for that basket, and the ratio between the pre-existing
PCI for the traffic sensitive basket and the API for that basket. A weighted average of these ratios should be derived
using the base period revenue weights of the special access and transport services included in the trunking basket,
respectively. This weighted average should be multiplied by the pre-existing API for the special access basket to
derive the PCI for the trunking basket. (Base period demand for flat-rated transport elements (i.e., demand for the
1992 base year) should correspond with the historical demand used in computing the initial interconnection charge.
The rates used in this formula should be the rates effective on the date that the transport rate restructure became
effective, or rates that subsequently go into effect as the result of the mid-course correction.)

7. Similarly, adjustments to the upper and lower pricing bands applicable to the existing voice grade and high capacity/DDS
service categories and the DS1 and DS3 subcategories are necessary to reflect the incorporation of comparable flat-rated
transport rate elements. While the SBIs for these categories are to remain the same, the upper and lower bands should
reflect a weighted average of the pre-existing upper and lower bands for the special access services and the 5% upper
and lower bands for the flat-rated transport services. This weighted average should be calculated using the base
period revenue weights of the special access and transport services included in each service category and subcategory.
A comparable procedure will be used to incorporate transport services into a density pricing zone category that has
already been established for special access services (or vice versa).

8. The changes adopted in the order necessitate adjustments to the price cap indexes. Accordingly, the Commission
directs all LECs subject to the price cap rules to recalculate their price cap indexes pursuant to the decisions in
the order. The LECs should file such recalculated indexes with the Commission in a special filing not accompanied
by rate changes. The Commission delegates authority to the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, to specify the format and
timing of this filing. In addition, such recalculated indexes should be used as the basis of any price cap filing that
changes rates of services in the trunking or traffic sensitive baskets.

9. Finally, the Commission clarifies some miscellaneous implementation matters. First, the Commission clarifies
that its decision in the Second Reconsideration Order, 58 FR 45266 (Aug. 27, 1993) (requiring use of historical demand
for all components of the formula for computing the inter-connection charge) applies only to price cap LECs. Rate-of-return
LECs continue to be subject to 47 CFR 61.38 and 61.39, and should continue to use projected demand to set transport rates.
Consistent with the First Reconsideration Order, 58 FR 41184 (Aug. 3, 1993), however, these projections should only
forecast demand growth, and should 

not 

attempt to forecast IXCs' reconfigurations in response to the transport rate restructure. Second, due to the difficulty
of applying non-premium charges to flat-rate transport elements, the Commission modifies its rules to clarify that
non-premium charges must be established only for the interconnection charge, and not for the facility-based transport
elements. Third, the Commission modifies the rules to clarify that the LECs must waive certain non-recurring charges
for a six-month period following the effective date of their restructured transport tariffs. Finally, the Commission
is making limited technical changes to 47 CFR part 69.

10. In the Further Notice in this proceeding, 57 FR 54205 (Nov. 17, 1992), the Commission certified that the proposed
rule changes would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities, as defined
by section 601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Neither the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business
Administration nor any commenting party disagreed with that analysis. The Secretary shall send a copy of this Report
and Order, including the certification, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in
accordance with section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Public Law No. 69-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C.

 (1981).



Ordering Clauses




11. Accordingly, 

it is ordered

 that pursuant to authority contained in sections 1, 4(i) and (j), 201-205, 220, and 403 of the Communications
Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.   151, 154(i) and (j), 201-205, 220, and 403, parts 61 and 69 of the
Commission's rules are Amended as set forth below.


12. 

It is further ordered

 that the policies and rules adopted herein 

shall be effective

 upon publication in the 

Federal Register

. Because the initial restructured transport rates went into effect on December 30, 1993, thus allowing LECs subject
to price cap regulation to propose rate changes that do not comply with the policies adopted herein in the absence of
these rule changes, good cause exists to make these rules effective less than 30 days from publication in the 

Federal Register

.


13. 

It is further ordered 

that the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau is delegated the authority specified herein.

(i) The upper pricing band for the tandem-switched transport service category shall limit the upward pricing flexibility
for this service category, as reflected in its SBI, to two percent, measured from the initial restructured rates for
tandem-switched transport. The lower pricing band for the tandem-switched transport service category shall limit
the downward pricing flexibility for this service category, as reflected in its SBI, to five percent, measured from
the initial restructured rates for tandem-switched transport.

(ii) The upper pricing band for the interconnection charge service category shall limit the upward pricing flexibility
for this service category, as reflected in its SBI, to zero percent, measured from the initial restructured rate for
the interconnection charge.

Earlier date

 is the earlier of the special access zone date and the transport zone date.


Earlier service

 is special access if the special access zone date precedes the transport zone date, and is transport if the transport
zone date precedes the special access zone date.


Later date

 is the later of the special access zone date and the transport zone date.


Later service

 is transport if the special access zone date precedes the transport zone date, and is special access if the transport
zone date precedes the special access zone date.


Revenue weight

 of a given group of services included in a zone category is the ratio of base period demand for the given service rate
elements included in the category priced at existing rates, to the base period demand for the entire group of rate elements
comprising the category priced at existing rates.


Special access zone date

 is the date on which a local exchange carrier tariff establishing divergent special access rates in different zones,
as described in  69.123(c) of this chapter, becomes effective.



Transport zone date

 is the date on which a local exchange carrier tariff establishing divergent switched transport rates in different
zones, as described in  69.123(d) of this chapter, becomes effective.
(2) 

Simultaneous Introduction of Special Access and Transport Zones.

 Local exchange carriers subject to price cap regulation that have established density pricing zones pursuant to
 69.123 of this chapter, and whose special access zone date and transport zone date occur on the same date, shall
initially establish density pricing zone SBIs and bands pursuant to the methodology in  61.47(h).
(3) 

Sequential Introduction of Zones in the Same Tariff Year.

 Notwithstanding  61.47(h), local exchange carriers subject to price cap regulation that have established
density pricing zones pursuant to  69.123 of this chapter, and whose special access zone date and transport
zone date occur on different dates during the same tariff year, shall, on the earlier date, establish density pricing
zone SBIs and pricing bands using the methodology described in  61.47(h), but applicable to the earlier service
only. On the later date, such carriers shall recalculate the SBIs and pricing bands to limit the pricing flexibility
of the services included in each density pricing zone category, as reflected in its SBI, as follows:
(i) The upper pricing band shall be a weighted average of the following:
(A) The upper pricing band that applied to the earlier services included in the zone category on the day preceding the
later date, weighted by the revenue weight of the earlier services included in the zone category; and
(B) 1.05 times the SBI value for the services included in the zone category on the day preceding the later date, weighted
by the revenue weight of the later services included in the zone category.

(ii) The lower pricing band shall be a weighted average of the following:
(A) The lower pricing band that applied to the earlier services included in the zone category on the day preceding the
later date, weighted by the revenue weight of the earlier services included in the zone category; and
(B) 0.90 times the SBI value for the services included in the zone category on the day preceding the later date, weighted
by the revenue weight of the later services included in the zone category.

(iii) On the later date, the SBI value for the zone category shall be equal to the SBI value for the category on the day
preceding the later date.
(4) 

Introduction of Zones in Different Tariff Years.

 Notwithstanding  61.47(h), those local exchange carriers subject to price cap regulation that have established
density pricing zones pursuant to  69.123 of this chapter, and whose special access zone date and transport
zone date do not occur within the same tariff year, shall, on the earlier date, establish density pricing zone SBIs
and pricing bands using the methodology described in  61.47(h), but applicable to the earlier service only.

(i) On the later date, such carriers shall use the methodology set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of  61.47
to calculate separate SBIs in each zone for each of the following groups of services:

(A) DS1 special access services;

(B) DS3 special access services;

(C) DS1 entrance facilities, DS1 direct-trunked transport, and DS1 dedicated signalling transport;

(D) DS3 entrance facilities, DS3 direct-trunked transport, and DS3 dedicated signalling transport;

(E) Voice grade entrance facilities, voice grade direct-trunked transport, and voice grade dedicated signalling
transport;

(F) Tandem-switched transport; and

(G) Such other special access services as the Commission may designate by order.

(ii) From the later date through the end of the following tariff year, the annual pricing flexibility for each of the
subindexes specified in paragraph (i)(4)(i) of this section shall be limited to an annual increase of five percent
or an annual decrease of ten percent, relative to the percentage change in the PCI for the trunking basket, measured
from the levels in effect on the last day of the tariff year preceding the tariff year in which the later date occurs.

(iii) On the first day of the second tariff year following the tariff year during which the later date occurs, the local
exchange carriers to which this paragraph applies shall establish the separate subindexes provided in  61.47(h)(1),
and shall set the initial SBIs for those density pricing zone categories that are combined (specified in paragraphs
(i)(4)(i)(A) and (i)(4)(i)(C), (i)(4)(i)(B) and (i)(4)(i)(D), and (i)(4)(i)(E) and (i)(4)(i)(G) of this section)
by computing the weighted averages of the SBIs that applied to the formerly separate zone categories, weighted by
the revenue weights of the respective services included in the zone categories.

<USDEPT>INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION</USDEPT>










Filing of Tariff Adoption Publications 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Interstate Commerce Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission adopts a regulation which establishes a 60-day deadline for the filing of adoption publications.
The regulation is intended to remove any possible ambiguity with regard to the existing regulation, which requires
that such publications be filed ``promptly''.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 By decision served December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64717, December 9, 1993), the Commission requested public comments on the
desirability of amending  1312.20(h) (49 CFR 1312.20(h)) to require that adoption publications be filed not
more than 60 days after consummation of the event giving rise to their filing. The existing regulation specifies that
adoption publications should be filed prior to consummation, if possible; and that, if for some reason filing cannot
be accomplished prior to consummation, they should be filed as soon as possible thereafter, 

i.e.

 ``promptly''. The new regulation will replace ``promptly'' with the more specific requirement that adoption publications
be filed no later than 60 days after consummation of the transaction. 



The regulation is not controversial. The National Bus Traffic Association, Inc. filed the only response to our notice
of proposed rulemaking, and it supported the regulation. 

Timely filing of adoption publications is important. Absent a new carrier's filing of its own tariffs or adoption
of the former carrier's tariffs, any operations conducted by the new carrier violate 49 U.S.C. 10761(a), which prohibits
service by a carrier unless ``the rate for transportation or service is contained in a tariff that is in effect * * *''.
Thus, the failure to timely file either new tariffs or adoption publications can result in a violation of the statute.
Additionally, users and potential users of transportation services have no way of determining from the tariff system
the rates for the new carrier's services unless adoption publications or new tariffs have been filed. We will adopt
the regulation as proposed. 

As indicated in the notice of proposed rulemaking, the 60-day deadline is intended only as the maximum allowable time;
it should not be viewed as an opportunity to delay filings beyond the consummation date. As stated in both the old and
new regulations, adoption publications should be filed prior to the consummation date whenever possible. 



Environmental and Energy Considerations 



This rule revision will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation
of energy resources. 



Regulatory Flexibility Analyses 



Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), we conclude that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The action merely clarifies the timing of a one-time filing requirement already required
by the Commission's regulations. Thus, no new substantive requirements are being imposed. 



List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 1312

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines 
endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as 
amended (Act), for 20 plants: 

Clermontia lindseyana

 ('oha wai), 


Clermontia peleana

 ('oha wai), 

Clermontia pyrularia

 ('oha wai), 


Colubrina oppositifolia

 (kauila), 

Cyanea copelandii

Cyanea stictophylla

 (haha), 

Cyrtandra giffardii

 (ha'iwale), 

Cyrtandra tintinnabula

 (ha'iwale), 

Ischaemum byrone

 (Hilo ischaemum), 

Isodendrion pyrifolium

 (wahine noho kula), 

Mariscus fauriei

 (no common name (NCN)), 

Nothocestrum breviflorum

 ('aiea), 

Ochrosia kilaueaensis

 (holei), 

Plantago hawaiensis

 (laukahi kuahiwi), 

Portulaca sclerocarpa

 (po'e), 

Pritchardia affinis

 (loulu), 

Tetramolopium arenarium

 (NCN), and 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense

 (a'e). The Service also determines threatened status for one plant, 

Silene hawaiiensis

 (NCN). All but eight of the taxa are endemic to the island of Hawaii, Hawaiian Islands; the exceptions were from the

islands of Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, and/or Maui as well 
as Hawaii. The 21 plant taxa and their habitats have been variously 
affected or are currently threatened by competition, predation or 
habitat degradation from introduced species, habitat loss from 
development and other human activities, natural disasters and 
stochastic events. This rule implements the Federal protection 
provisions provided by the Act for these plants. One taxon, 


Hesperocnide sandwicensis

, which had been proposed for listing with 
the above species, has been withdrawn from consideration as a result 
of additional information received indicating the species is more 
abundant than previously believed. A notice withdrawing the proposal 
is published in the 

Federal Register

 concurrently with this final 
rule.

 are endemic to or have the majority of their populations on the island of Hawaii, Hawaiian islands. Thirteen of these
taxa are endemic to the Island of Hawaii; four additional taxa are now found only on Hawaii. One of these taxa is now or
was previously also known from Niihau, one from Kauai, two from Oahu, four from Molokai, four from Lanai, and six from
Maui. 

The island of Hawaii is the southernmost, farthest east, and the youngest of the eight major Hawaiian Islands. This
largest island of the Hawaiian archipelago comprises 4,038 square miles (mi) (10,458 square kilometers (km)), or
two-thirds of the land area of the State of Hawaii, giving rise to its common name, the ``Big Island.'' The Hawaiian
Islands are volcanic islands formed over a ``hot spot,'' a fixed area of pressurized molten rock deep within the Earth.
As the Pacific Plate, a section of the Earth's surface many miles thick, has moved to the northwest, the islands of the
chain have separated. Currently, this hot spot is centered under the southeast part of the island of Hawaii, which
is one of the most active volcanic areas on Earth. Five large shield volcanoes make up the island of Hawaii: Mauna Kea
at 13,796 feet (ft) (4,205 meters (m)) and Kohala at 5,480 ft (1,670 m), both extinct; Hualalai, at 8,271 ft (2,521 m),
which is dormant and will probably erupt again; and Mauna Loa, at 13,677 ft (4,169 m) and Kilauea, at 4,093 ft (1,248
m), both of which are currently active and adding land area to the island. Compared to Kauai, which is the oldest of the
main islands and was formed about 5.6 million years ago, Hawaii is very young, with fresh lava and land up to 0.5 million
years old (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Culliney 1988, Department of Geography 1983, Macdonald 

et al

. 1983). 

Because of the large size and range of elevation of the island, Hawaii has a great diversity of climates. Windward (northeastern)
slopes of Mauna Loa have rainfall up to 300 inches (in) (118 centimeters (cm)) per year in some areas. The leeward coast,
shielded by the mountains from rain brought by trade winds, has areas classified as desert and receiving as little
as 7.9 in (20 cm) of rain annually. The summits of Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea experience snowfall each year, and Mauna Kea
was glaciated during the last Ice Age (Culliney 1988, Department of Geography 1983, Macdonald 

et al. 

1983, Wagner 

et al

. 1990). 

Plant communities on Hawaii include those in various stages of primary succession on the slopes of active and dormant
volcanoes, some in stages of secondary succession following disturbance, and relatively stable climax communities.
On Hawaii, vegetation is found in all classifications: Coastal, dryland, montane, subalpine, and alpine; dry, mesic,
and wet; and herblands, grasslands, shrublands, forests, and mixed communities. The vegetation and land of the island
of Hawaii have undergone much change through the island's history. Since it is an area of frequent volcanic activity,
vegetated areas are periodically replaced with bare lava. Polynesian immigrants, first settling on Hawaii by 750
A.D., made extensive alterations in lowland areas for agriculture and habitation. European contact with Hawaii
brought intentional and inadvertent introductions of alien plant and animal species. By 1960, 65 percent of the total
land area of the island of Hawaii was used for grazing, and much land has also been converted to modern cropland (Cuddihy
and Stone 1990, Gagne and Cuddihy 1990). 

The 21 taxa included in this rule occur between sea level and 8,600 ft (0 and 2,260 m) in elevation in various portions
of the island of Hawaii. A number of the taxa are also found in central Kauai (one taxon), in the Waianae Mountains of
Oahu (one taxon), on eastern Molokai (three taxa), in central and southern Lanai (two taxa), and on east Maui (three
taxa). Most of the species in this rule exist as remnant plants persisting in grazed areas or in higher elevations which
have only recently been heavily invaded by alien plant and animal species. The taxa in this rule grow in a variety of
vegetation communities (herbland, shrublands, and forests), elevational zones (coastal, lowland, montane, and
subalpine), and moisture regimes (dry, mesic, and wet). One taxon is found in each of two coastal habitats: Dry shrubland
and mesic forest. In lowland habitats, five taxa are found in dry forest, four in mesic forest, and two in wet forest.
In montane habitats, one taxon is found in wet herbland, three taxa in dry shrubland, three in dry forest, four in mesic
forest, and five in wet forest. In the subalpine area, one taxon is found in dry shrubland and two taxa in dry forest.

The land on which these 21 plant taxa are found is owned by 
various private parties, the State of Hawaii (including conservation 
district lands, forest reserves, natural area reserves, State parks, 
and the State seabird sanctuary), or is owned or managed by the 
Federal government (including a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
refuge, a U.S. Army military reservation and a military training 
area, a National Park, and a U.S. Coast Guard lighthouse area). 


Discussion of the 21 Taxa Included in This Rule and the One Taxon 
Withdrawn From Consideration for Listing 


Rock (1957) named 

Clermontia hawaiiensis

 var. 

grandis

 on the 
basis of sterile specimens collected on the island of Hawaii in the 
1950s. Later, after examining fertile material, he named the taxon 


C. lindseyana

 and also described a variety, var. 

livida

 (Rock 1962). 
The specific epithet commemorates Thomas Lindsey, a naturalist who 
brought the species to Rock's attention. St. John (1987a) described 
two other species, 

C. albimontis

 and 

C. viridis,

 but the author of 
the current treatment of the genus (Lammers 1990, 1991) considers St. 
John's species to fall within the range of 

C. lindseyana

 and 
recognizes no subspecific taxa. 


Clermontia lindseyana

 of the bellflower family (Campanulaceae) is 
a terrestrial or epiphytic (not rooted in the soil) branched shrub or 
tree 8.2 to 20 ft (2.5 to 6 m) tall. The alternate, stalked, toothed 
leaves are 5 to 9 in (13 to 24 cm) long and 1.5 to 2.6 in (3.8 to 6.5 
cm) wide. Two flowers, each with a stalk 0.4 to 1 in (1 to 2.5 cm) 
long, are positioned at the end of a main flower stalk 1 to 1.6 in 
(2.5 to 4 cm) long. The calyx (fused sepals) and corolla (fused 
petals) are similar in size and appearance, and each forms a slightly 
curved, five-lobed tube 2.2 to 2.6 in (5.5 to 6.5 cm) long and 0.4 to 
0.7 in (0.9 to 1.8 cm) wide which is greenish white or purplish on 
the outside and white or cream-colored on the inside. The berries 
are orange and 1 to 1.6 in (2.5 to 4 cm) in diameter. This species 
is distinguished from others in this endemic Hawaiian genus by larger 
leaves and flowers, similar sepals and petals, and spreading floral 
lobes (Cuddihy et al. 1983, Lammers 1990, 1991). 
Historically, 

Clermontia lindseyana

 was known from the island of 
Maui on the southern slope of Haleakala and from the island of Hawaii 
on the eastern slope of Mauna Kea and the eastern, southeastern, and 
southwestern slopes of Mauna Loa. One population of the species is 
known to be extant on State-owned land on Maui. This population 
extends from Wailaulau Gulch to Manawainui Gulch and contains between 
100 and 150 plants (Robert Hobdy, Department of Land and Natural 
Resources, 

in litt

., 1993). The 14 known populations on the island 
of Hawaii extend over a distance of about 53 by 13 mi (85 by 21 km). 
Populations are found near Laupahoehoe, in Piha, in Makahanaloa, near 
Puaakala, near Puu Oo, near Kulani Correctional Facility, near 
Kapapala, in Waiea Tract, near Kaapuna Lava Flow, and near Kahuku on 
privately and State-owned land. Approximately 125 to 175 individuals 
exist (Hawaii Heritage Program (HHP) 1991a1 to 1991a13). This 
species typically grows in 

Acacia koa

 (koa)- and 

Metrosideros 
polymorpha

 ('ohi'a)-dominated Montane Mesic Forests, often 
epiphytically, at elevations between 4,000 and 7,050 ft (1,220 and 
2,150 m) (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990, HHP 1991a1 to 1991a13, Hawaii Plant 
Conservation Center (HPCC) 1991a, Lammers 1990, 1991). Associated 
species include 

Coprosma 

sp. (pilo), 

Ilex anomala

 (kawa'u), and 


Myrsine

 sp. (kolea) (HHP 1991a2, 1991a5, HPCC 1991a; Fern Duvall, 
Olinda Endangered Species Propagation Facility, pers. comm., 1992). 
The major threats to 

Clermontia lindseyana

 are competition from alien 
plant species such as 

Passiflora mollissima

 (banana poka) and 


Pennisetum clandestinum

 (Kikuyu grass), grazing and trampling by 
cattle (

Bos taurus

) and goats (

Capra hircus

), and habitat disturbance 
by feral pigs (

Sus scrofa

) (Cuddihy 

et al.

 1983, HPCC 1991a, Pratt 
and Cuddihy 1991; F. Duvall and Arthur Medeiros, Haleakala National 
Park, pers. comms., 1992).

Clermontia peleana

 was first collected by John Lydgate at 
Hamakua, island of Hawaii, and listed as an unnamed variety of 

C. 
gaudichaudii

 by Hillebrand (1888). Rock later collected a specimen 
of the taxon near Kilauea, the volcano home of the Hawaiian goddess 
Pele, after whom he named the species (Rock 1913). Other names by 
which the species has been known include: 

Clermontia gaudichaudii

 
var. 

singuliflora

 (Rock 1919b), 

C. singuliflora

 (Rock 1919b), 

C. gaudichaudii

 var. 

barbata

 (Rock 1919b), 

C. clermontioides

 var. 


singuliflora

 (Hochreutiner 1934); 

C. clermontioides

 var. 

mauiensis,

 a 
superfluous name (Hochreutiner 1934); and 

C. clermontioides

 var. 


barbata

 (St. John 1973). In the most recent treatment of the species 
(Lammers 1991), two subspecies of 

C. peleana,

 ssp. 

singuliflora

 and 
ssp. 

peleana,

 are recognized. 


Clermontia peleana

 of the bellflower family is an epiphytic shrub 
or tree 5 to 20 ft (1.5 to 6 m) tall which grows on 'ohi'a, koa, 


Cheirodendron trigynum

 ('olapa), and 

Sadleria

 spp. (ama'u). The 
alternate, stalked, oblong or oval, toothed leaves reach a length of 
3 to 8 in (8 to 20 cm) and a width of 1.2 to 2 in (3 to 5 cm). 
Flowers are single or paired, each on a stalk 1.2 to 1.8 in (3 to 4.5 
cm) long with a main stalk 0.3 to 0.7 in (0.8 to 1.7 cm) long. Five 
small green calyx lobes top the hypanthium (basal portion of the 
flower). The blackish-purple (ssp. 

peleana

) or greenish-white (ssp. 


singuliflora

) petals, 2 to 2.8 in (5 to 7 cm) long and 0.3 to 0.5 in 
(0.8 to 1.3 cm) wide, are fused into a one-lipped, arching tube with 
five down-curved lobes. Berries of ssp. 

peleana

 are orange and 1 to 
1.2 in (2.5 to 3 cm) in diameter; berries of ssp. 

singuliflora

 are 
unknown. This species is distinguished from others of the genus by 
its epiphytic growth habit; its small green calyx lobes; and its one- 
lipped, blackish-purple or greenish-white corolla (Lammers 1990, 
1991). 
Historically, 

Clermontia peleana

 ssp. 

peleana

 has been found only 
on the island of Hawaii on the eastern slope of Mauna Loa and the 
northeastern and southeastern slopes of Mauna Kea. Today, the taxon 
is found near Waiakaumalo Stream, by the Wailuku River, near Saddle 
Road, and between the towns of Glenwood and Volcano. The six known 
populations, which extend over a distance of about 12 by 5 mi (19 by 
8 km), are located on State- and federally-owned land and contain a 
total of approximately eight known individuals (HHP 1991b1 to 
1991b7). 

Clermontia peleana

 ssp. 

singuliflora

 was formerly found on 
the island of Hawaii on the northern slope of Mauna Kea and on East 
Maui on the northwestern slope of Haleakala, but the taxon has not 
been seen in either place since early in the century and is believed 
to be extinct (HHP 1991c1 to 1991c3, Wagner 

et al.

 1990). This 
species typically grows epiphytically in Montane Wet Forests 
dominated by koa, 'ohi'a, and 

Cibotium

 spp. and/or 

Sadleria

 spp. 
(tree ferns) at elevations between 1,740 and 3,800 ft (530 and 1,160 
m) (HHP 1991b1 to 1991b4, 1991b6, 1991b7, Lammers 1990, 1991). 
Associated species include 'olapa, 

Melicope clusiifolia

 (kolokolo 
mokihana), and 

Scaevola chamissoniana

 (naupaka kuahiwi) (HHP 1991b1; 
Warren L. Wagner, Smithsonian Institution, pers. comm., 1992). The 
major threats to 

Clermontia peleana

 are habitat disturbance caused by 
feral pigs and illegal cultivation of 

Cannabis sativa

 (marijuana), 
roof or black rat (

Rattus rattus

) damage, flooding, and stochastic 
extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number 
of existing individuals (Bruegmann 1990, Center for Plant 
Conservation (CPC) 1990). 
A sterile specimen of 

Clermontia pyrularia

 was first collected on 
Mauna Kea, island of Hawaii, during the United States Exploring 
Expedition of 1840 and 1841 and was named 

Delissea obtusa

 var. 

mollis

 
by Gray (1861b). Later, Hillebrand (1888) collected fertile 
specimens of the taxon and named it 

C. pyrularia,

 referring in the 
specific epithet to the fruits, which are sometimes shaped like those 
of 

Pyrus

 (pear). 


Clermontia pyrularia

 of the bellflower family, a terrestrial tree 
10 to 13 ft (3 to 4 m) tall, has alternate toothed leaves 5.9 to 11 
in (15 to 28 cm) long and 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5 cm) wide with winged 
petioles. A cluster of two, three, or sometimes up to five flowers 
has a main stalk 1.1 to 2.4 in (2.8 to 6 cm) long; each flower has a 
stalk 0.3 to 0.8 in (0.8 to 2 cm) long. Five small green calyx lobes 
top the hypanthium. The white or greenish-white petals are covered 
with fine hairs, measure 1.6 to 1.8 in (4 to 4.5 cm) long, and are 
fused into a curved two-lipped tube 0.2 to 0.3 in (5 to 8 mm) wide 
with five spreading lobes. The orange berry is inversely ovoid or 
inversely pear-shaped. This species is distinguished from others of 
the genus by its winged petioles; its small, green calyx lobes; its 
two-lipped flowers with white or greenish-white petals; and the shape 
of its berry (Lammers 1990, 1991).

Historically, 

Clermontia pyrularia

 has been found only on the island of Hawaii on the northeastern slope of Mauna Kea, the western slope of Mauna Loa, and
the saddle area between the two mountains. Today, the species is found near the Humuula-Laupahoehoe boundary, near
Hakalau Gulch, near Kealakekua, and near Kaawaloa. The five extant populations, which extend over a distance of about
47 by 6 mi (76 by 10 km), are located on privately, State and federally owned land. Although the exact number of individuals
is not known, it is likely that not more than five individuals exist (HHP 1991d1 to 1991d6). This species typically
grows in koa- and/or 'ohi'a-dominated Montane Wet Forests and Subalpine Dry Forests at elevations between 3,000
and 7,000 ft (910 and 2,130 m) (HHP 1991d2 to 1991d5, Lammers 1990, 1991). Associated species include pilo, 

Lythrum maritimum

 (pukamole), and 

Rubus hawaiensis

 ('akala) (HHP 1991d2, 1991y). The major threat to 

Clermontia pyrularia

 is competition from alien grasses and shrubs in the forest understory and banana poka as well as stochastic extinction
and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing populations and individuals (HHP 1991d2).




Colubrina oppositifolia

 was first collected by Remy in the 1850s and was named in 1867 by Adolphe Theodore Brongniart (Mann 1867). The specific
epithet describes the plant's opposite leaf arrangement. St. John (1979) called Oahu plants 

C. oppositifolia

 var. 

obatae,

 but no subspecific taxa are recognized in the current treatment of the genus (Wagner 

et al

. 1990). 



Colubrina oppositifolia

 of the buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae), a tree 16 to 43 ft (5 to 13 m) tall, has opposite, stalked, oval, thin, pinnately
veined, toothless leaves with glands on the lower surface. Leaves measure 2.4 to 4.7 in (6 to 12 cm) long and 1.2 to 2.8
in (3 to 7 cm) wide in mature plants and are larger in seedlings. Ten to 12 bisexual flowers are clustered at the end of
a main stalk 0.1 to 0.3 in (3 to 8 millimeters (mm)) long; each flower has a stalk about 0.07 to 0.1 in (2 to 3 mm) long which
elongates in fruit. The five triangular sepals measure about 0.06 to 0.08 in (1.5 to 2 mm) long, and the five greenish-yellow
or white petals are about 0.06 in (1.5 mm) long. The somewhat spherical fruit, 0.3 to 0.4 in (8 to 11 mm) long, is similar
to a capsule and opens explosively when mature. This species can be distinguished from the one other species of the
genus in Hawaii by its growth habit and the arrangement, texture, venation, and margins of its leaves (Wagner 

et al.

 1990). 

Historically, 

Colubrina oppositifolia

 was found on the island of Oahu in the central and southern Waianae Mountains and on the island of Hawaii in the following
areas: The Kohala Mountains; the northern slope of Hualalai; and the western, southwestern, and southern slopes
of Mauna Loa. Today, the species is known on Oahu in eastern Makaleha Valley, Mokuleia Forest Reserve, and Makua Valley;
on Mt. Kaala; and near Honouliuli Contour Trail on privately and State-owned and federally managed land. The 6 extant
populations on Oahu, which extend over a distance of about 9 by 4 mi (14 by 6 km), contain approximately 94 known individuals
(HHP 1991e1, 1991e2, 1991e5, 1991e9 to 1991e12). On the island of Hawaii, there are 7 extant populations which extend
over a distance of about 16 by 4 mi (26 by 6 km), are located on privately and State-owned land, and contain about 185 to
205 known individuals. The species occurs along the Mamalahoa Highway on the northern slope of Hualalai as well as
in Kapua and Puueo in the southernmost portion of the island (HHP 1991e3, 1991e4, 1991e6 to 1991e8, 1991e13 to 1991e16).
This species typically grows in 

Diospyros sandwicensis

 (lama)-dominated Lowland Dry and Mesic Forests, often on aa lava, at elevations between 800 and 3,000 ft (240 and 910
m). Associated species include 

Canthium odoratum

 (alahe'e) and 

Reynoldsia sandwicensis

 ('ohe) (HHP 1991e3, 1991e8, 1991e9, 1991e15, 1991e16, HPCC 1991b). The major threats to 

Colubrina oppositifolia

 are competition from alien plant species such as 

Lantana camara

 (lantana), 

Pennisetum setaceum

 (fountain grass), and 

Schinus terebinthifolius

 (Christmas berry); habitat disturbance by feral pigs; plant damage and death from black twig borer (

Xylosandrus compactus

); fire; damage and disturbance from military exercises; and limited regeneration (HHP 1991e4, 1991e8, 1991e9,
1991e15, 1991e16; Joel Q. Lau, The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii, pers. comm., 1992). 

Rock (1917) named 

Cyanea copelandii

 to honor his collecting companion, M.L. Copeland, with whom he first collected the species in 1914 on the island of
Hawaii (Rock 1917). St. John (1987b, St. John and Takeuchi 1987), believing there to be no generic distinction between


Cyanea

 and 

Delissea,

 transferred the species to the genus 

Delissea,

 the older of the two generic names, creating 

D. copelandii.

 The current treatment of the family (Lammers 1990), however, maintains the separation of the two genera, and plants
found on the island of Hawaii are considered to be 

C. copelandii

 ssp. 

copelandii.

 Subspecies 

haleakalaensis, 

found on Maui, is not as rare.


Cyanea copelandii 

ssp. 

copelandii 

of the bellflower family is a shrub with a habit similar to that of a woody vine. The alternate, stalked, toothed leaves
are 7.9 to 10.6 in (20 to 27 cm) long and 1.4 to 3.3 in (3.5 to 8.5 cm) wide and have fine hairs on the lower surface. Five to
12 flowers are clustered on the end of a main stalk 0.8 to 1.8 in (2 to 4.5 cm) long; each flower has a stalk 0.2 to 0.6 in (0.4
to 1.6 cm) long. The slightly hairy hypanthium is topped by five small, triangular calyx lobes. Petals, which are yellowish
but appear rose-colored because of a covering of dark red hairs, are fused into a curved tube with five spreading lobes;
the corolla is 1.5 to 1.7 in (3.7 to 4.2 cm) long and about 0.2 in (4 to 5 mm) wide. Berries are dark orange and measure 0.3
to 0.6 in (0.7 to 1.5 cm) long. This subspecies is distinguished from ssp. 

haleakalaensis

, the only other subspecies of 

Cyanea copelandii

, by its narrower leaves. The species differs from others in this endemic Hawaiian genus by its growth habit and the
size, shape, and dark red pubescence of its corolla (Lammers 1990).

Cyanea copelandii

 ssp. 

copelandii

, which has been collected only twice on the southeastern slope of Mauna Loa near Glenwood, was last seen in 1957. It
is difficult to adequately survey the area because of vegetation density and the terrain. This population, located
on State-owned land, was sighted recently enough that it is still considered extant and contains an unknown number
of individuals (HHP 1991f; Thomas Lammers, Field Museum, pers. comm., 1992). This taxon often grows epiphytically
and is typically found in Montane Wet Forests at elevations between 2,200 and 2,900 ft (660 and 880 m) (Lammers 1990).
Associated species include tree ferns (HHP 1991f). The major known threat to 

Cyanea copelandii

 ssp. 

copelandii

 is stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the single known population.

Using sterile type material, Rock (1957) named 

Cyanea carlsonii

 to honor Norman K. Carlson, who first saw the taxon (Degener 

et al.

 1969). Carlson cultivated a plant of the taxon in his garden, from which Rock later described the flowers and fruit
(Rock 1962). Recently, St. John (1987b, St. John and Takeuchi 1987) placed the genus 

Cyanea

 in synonymy with 

Delissea

, resulting in the new combination 

Delissea carlsonii

, but Lammers (1990) retains both genera in the currently accepted treatment of the family. He also considers the taxon
to be a subspecies of another species, resulting in the name 

C. hamatiflora

 ssp. 

carlsonii

 (Lammers 1988).



Cyanea hamatiflora

 ssp. 

carlsonii

 of the bellflower family, a palm-like tree, grows 9.8 to 26 ft (3 to 8 m) tall and has alternate stalkless leaves 20 to
31 in (50 to 80 cm) long and 3 to 5.5 in (8 to 14 cm) wide. Clusters of 5 to 10 flowers have a main stalk 0.6 to 1.2 in (1.5 to 3
cm) long; each flower has a stalk 0.2 to 0.5 in (0.5 to 1.2 cm) long. The hypanthium is topped with five small narrow calyx
lobes. The magenta petals are fused into a one-lipped tube 2.3 to 3.1 in (6 to 8 cm) long and 0.2 to 0.4 in (0.6 to 1.1 cm)
wide with five down-curved lobes. The purplish-red berries are topped by the persistent calyx lobes. This subspecies
is distinguished from ssp. 

hamatiflora

, the only other subspecies, by its long flower stalks and larger calyx lobes. The species differs from others in the
genus by its growth habit, its stalkless leaves, the number of flowers in each cluster, and the size and shape of the
corolla and calyx (Lammers 1990).



Cyanea hamatiflora

 ssp. 

carlsonii

 is only known to have occurred at two sites on the island of Hawaii, on the western slope of Hualalai and the southwestern
slope of Mauna Loa. These two extant populations, located on privately and State-owned land at Honuaulu Forest Reserve
and Keokea, are about 28 mi (45 km) apart and contain approximately 19 individuals (HHP 1991g1, 1991g2, HPCC 1991c1
to 1991c3). This taxon typically grows in 'ohi'a-dominated Montane Wet Forests at elevations between 4,000 and 5,700
ft (1,220 and 1,740 m) (HHP 1991g1, 1991g2, Lammers 1990). Associated species include kawa'u, pilo, and 

Myoporum sandwicense

 (naio) (HHP 1991g1). The major threats to 

Cyanea hamatiflora

 ssp. 

carlsonii

 are competition from alien plant species such as banana poka, grazing and trampling by cattle, and stochastic extinction
and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing populations and individuals (HHP 1991g2; Carolyn
Corn, Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (Hawaii DLNR), 

in litt

., 1991).

Based on sterile specimens collected on the island of Hawaii during the United States Exploring Expedition of 1840
and 1841, Gray (1861b) noted 

Cyanea grimesiana

 var. ? 

citrullifolia

. Rock collected the plant in 1955 in the company of Herbert Shipman, after whom he named it as a species, resulting in


Cyanea shipmanii

 (Rock 1957). St. John (1987b, St. John and Takeuchi 1987) placed the genus 

Cyanea

 in synonomy with 

Delissea

, resulting in 

Delissea shipmanii

, but Lammers (1990) retains the species in the genus 

Cyanea

.

Cyanea shipmanii

 of the bellflower family is an unbranched or few-branched shrub 8 to 13 ft (2.5 to 4 m) tall with small sharp projections,
especially in young plants. The alternate, stalked leaves are 6.7 to 12 in (17 to 30 cm) long, 2.8 to 5.5 in (7 to 14 cm)
wide, and deeply cut into 20 to 30 lobes per leaf. Flowers are covered with fine hairs and are clustered in groups of 10
to 15, the main stalk 0.4 to 1.2 in (1 to 3 cm) long and each flower stalk 0.4 to 0.6 in (1 to 1.5 cm) long. The hypanthium is
topped with five small calyx lobes. The pale greenish-white petals, 1.2 to 1.4 in (3 to 3.6 cm) long, are fused into a
curved five-lobed tube 0.1 to 0.2 in (3 to 4 mm) wide. The fruit is an ellipsoid berry. This species differs from others
in the genus by its slender stems; stalked, pinnately lobed leaves; and smaller flowers (Lammers 1990). 



Cyanea shipmanii 

has been known from only one population, located on the island of Hawaii on the eastern slope of Mauna Kea on privately
owned land. When originally discovered, only 1 mature plant was found, with a total population size of fewer than 50
individuals (HHP 1991h). This species typically grows in koa- and 'ohi'a-dominated Montane Mesic Forests at elevations
between 5,400 and 6,200 ft (1,650 and 1,900 m) (HHP 1991h, Lammers 1990). Associated species include kawa'u and kolea
(HHP 1991h). The major threat to 

Cyanea shipmanii

 is stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the single existing population and the small number
of known individuals. 

Based on a specimen he collected in 1912 on Mauna Loa, island of Hawaii, Rock (1913) described 

Cyanea stictophylla,

 choosing the specific epithet to refer to the long and narrow leaves. Other names by which the taxon has been known include:


Cyanea palakea

 (Forbes 1916), 

C. quercifolia

 var. 

atropurpurea

 (Wimmer 1953), 

C. stictophylla

 var. 

inermis

 (Rock 1957), and 

C. nelsonii

 (St. John 1976). St. John (St. John and Takeuchi 1987), believing there to be no generic distinction between 

Cyanea

 and 

Delissea,

 transferred the species to the genus 

Delissea,

 the older of the two generic names, creating 

D. nelsonii

, 

D. palakea

, 

D. quercifolia

 var. 

atropurpurea

, 


D. stictophylla

, and 

D. stictophylla

 var. 

inermis

 (St. John 1987b). The separation of the two genera is maintained in the current 
treatment of the family (Lammers 1990), and all the above listed taxa are considered to fall within the range of variation
of 

C. stictophylla.

 



Cyanea stictophylla

 of the bellflower family is a shrub or tree 2 to 20 ft (0.6 to 6 m) tall, sometimes covered with small, sharp projections.
The alternate, stalked, oblong, shallowly lobed, toothed leaves are 7.8 to 15 in (20 to 38 cm) long and 1.6 to 3.1 in (4
to 8 cm) wide. Clusters of five or six flowers have main flowering stalks 0.4 to 1.6 in (1 to 4 cm) long; each flower has
a stalk 0.3 to 0.9 in (0.7 to 2.2 cm) long. The hypanthium is topped 
with five calyx lobes 0.1 to 0.2 in (2 to 4 mm) long and 0.04 to 0.1 in (1 to 2 mm) wide. The yellowish-white or purple petals,
1.4 to 2 in (3.5 to 5 cm) long, are fused into an arched, five-lobed tube about 0.2 in (5 to 6 mm) wide. The spherical berries
are orange. This species differs from others in the genus by its lobed, toothed leaves and its larger flowers with small
calyx lobes and deeply lobed corollas (Lammers 1990). 

Historically, 

Cyanea stictophylla

 was known only from the island of Hawaii on the western, southern, southeastern, and eastern slopes of Mauna Loa. Today,
the species is known to be extant near Keauhou and in South Kona on privately owned land. The 3 known populations, which
extend over a distance of about 38 by 10 mi (61 by 16 km), contain a total of approximately 15 individuals (HHP 1991i1
to 1991i3). This species, sometimes growing epiphytically, is found in koaand 'ohi'a-dominated Lowland Mesic and
Wet Forests at elevations between 3,500 and 6,400 ft (1,070 and 1,950 m) (HHP 1991i1 to 1991i3, Lammers 1990). Associated
species include tree ferns, 

Melicope volcanica

 (alani), and 

Urera glabra

 (opuhe) (HHP 1991i1 to 1991i3). The major threat to 

Cyanea stictophylla

 is grazing and trampling by feral cattle as well as stochastic extinction and/or reduced 
reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing populations and individuals (F. Duvall, pers. comm., 1992).




Cyrtandra giffardii

 was first collected in 1911 on the island of 
Hawaii by Rock, who named the species to honor Walter M. Giffard, who 
collected a flowering specimen in 1918 (Rock 1919a).

Cyrtandra giffardii

 of the African violet family (Gesneriaceae) 
is a shrubby tree usually 10 to 20 ft (3 to 6 m) tall. The opposite, stalked, papery-textured, toothed leaves are usually
2.4 to 4.7 in (6 to 12 cm) long and 1 to 1.8 in (2.5 to 4.6 cm) wide and have a few tiny, coarse hairs on the upper surface. Clusters
of three to five flowers have a moderate amount of short brown hairs throughout the cluster, a main stalk 1 to 1.4 in (2.5
to 3.5 cm) long, two linear bracts about 0.25 in (6 to 7 mm) long, and individual flower stalks 0.6 to 1.2 in (1.5 to 3 cm)
long. The calyx, 0.1 to 0.4 in (3 to 9 mm) long, has an outer covering of short, soft brown hairs and is divided into five
narrowly triangular lobes. The corolla consists of five fused white petals about 0.5 in (12 mm) long, with lobes about
0.08 to 0.1 in (2 to 3 mm) long. Only immature berries have been observed, and they were white and about 0.4 in (1 cm) long.
Both this species and 

Cyrtandra tintinnabula

 are distinguished from others of the genus and others on the island of Hawaii by a combination of the following characteristics:
The opposite, more or less elliptic, papery leaves; the presence of some hairs on the leaves and more on 
the inflorescences; the presence of three to six flowers per inflorescence; and the size and shape of the flowers and
flower parts (Wagner 

et al.

 1990). 

Historically, 

Cyrtandra giffardii

 was found on the island of Hawaii on the northeastern slope of Mauna Kea near Kilau Stream and south to the eastern slope
of Mauna Loa near Kilauea Crater. The 3 extant populations on State-owned land are located near Kilau Stream, Stainback
Highway, and Puu Makaala, extending over a distance of approximately 31 by 3 mi (50 by 5 km) and containing a total of
about 14 to 20 plants (HHP 1991j1 to 1991j5; W. Wagner, pers. comm., 1992). This species typically grows in shady koa-,
'ohi'a-, and tree fern-dominated Montane Wet Forests at elevations between 2,400 and 4,900 ft (720 and 1,500 m) (HHP
1991j1 to 1991j3, HPCC 1991d1, 1991d2, Wagner 

et al.

 1990). Associated species include other taxa of 


Cyrtandra

 (ha'iwale), 

Hedyotis

 spp., and 

Perrottetia sandwicensis

 (olomea) (HHP 1991j1 to 1991j3, HPCC 1991d1; W. Wagner, pers. comm., 1992). The major threats to 

Cyrtandra giffardii

 are habitat 
disturbance and plant damage by feral pigs as well as stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due
to the small number of existing populations (Stone 1985; W. Wagner, pers. comm., 1992). 

Based on a plant he collected in 1909 on Mauna Kea, island of Hawaii, Rock named 

Cyrtandra tintinnabula.

 The specific epithet describes the bell-shaped calyx of the plant (Rock 1919a). 



Cyrtandra tintinnabula

 of the African violet family is a shrub 3.3 to 6.6 ft (1 to 2 m) tall with opposite, stalked, elliptical or oval, papery-textured
leaves 5 to 10 in (13 to 26 cm) long and 2 to 4.8 in (5 to 12.3 cm) wide. Leaves, especially the lower surfaces, have yellowish-brown
hairs. Flower clusters, densely covered with long soft hairs, comprise three to six flowers, a main stalk 0.4 to 0.7
in (1 to 1.8 cm) long, individual flower stalks 0.2 to 0.6 in (0.5 to 1.5 cm) long, and leaflike bracts. The green bell-shaped
calyx is about 0.4 in (9 to 10 mm) long and has triangular lobes. 
The hairy white corolla, about 0.5 in (12 mm) long and about 0.2 in (5 mm) in diameter, is divided into five lobes, each
about 0.1 in (3 mm) long. Fruit and seeds have not been observed. This species differs from 

Cyrtandra giffardii

 by its habit, its larger leaves, and its shorter flower stalks (Wagner 

et al.

 1990).

Historically, 

Cyrtandra tintinnabula

 was found only on the island of Hawaii on the northern to the eastern slopes of Mauna Kea. Today, 3 populations of the
species are known to occur on State-owned land extending over approximately 6 by 1 mi (10 by 3 km) from Kilau Stream to
Honohina Gulch and containing approximately 18 known individuals (HHP 1991k1 to 1991k6). This species typically
grows in dense koa-, 'ohi'a-, and tree fern-dominated Lowland Wet Forests at elevations between 2,100 and 3,400 ft
(650 and 1,040 m) (HHP 1991k3, 1991k4, 1991k6, Wagner 

et al

. 1990). Associated species include other kinds of ha'iwale and 

Hedyotis

 sp. The major threats to 

Cyrtandra tintinnabula

 are habitat disturbance and plant damage by feral pigs and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor
due to the small number of existing populations and individuals. 

Based on a specimen collected on Mauna Loa by James Macrae in 1825, Weddell (1856 to 1857) described 

Urtica sandwicensis

, choosing the specific epithet to refer to the Sandwich Islands, an older name for the Hawaiian Islands. Later (1869),
he transferred the species to another genus, resulting in 

Hesperocnide sandwicensis

. 



Hesperocnide sandwicensis

 of the nettle family (Urticaceae) is an erect annual herb 8 to 24 in (20 to 60 cm) tall covered with coarse stinging hairs
as well as shorter non-stinging hairs. The opposite, stalked, thin, toothed leaves are 0.6 to 3 in (1.5 to 7 cm) long
and 0.4 to 1 in (0.9 to 2.5 cm) wide. Most of the small petalless flowers are male, but they are mixed with some female flowers
in clusters 0.08 to 0.2 in (2 to 5 mm) long which originate in the leaf axils. Sepals of male flowers are fused into a four-lobed
calyx about 0.02 in (0.5 mm) long which encloses four stamens. The calyx of the female flower, about 0.04 in (1 mm) long
and enclosing an unstalked stigma, swells slightly in fruit and encloses a flattened achene (dry, one-celled, unopened
fruit) about 0.04 in (1.1 mm) long. The only Hawaiian member of the genus, 

Hesperocnid sandwicensis

 is distinguished from other native Hawaiian genera of its family by its annual herbaceous habit and its stinging hairs.
It is distinguished from the alien, naturalized species 

Urtica urens

 (dwarf nettle) by the lack of calyx lobes (Wagner 

et al

. 1990). 

Historically, 

Hesperocnide sandwicensis

 occurred on the island of Hawaii on the eastern and western slopes of Mauna Kea, the northern to western slopes of Mauna
Loa, the Humuula Saddle between Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, and the southeastern slope of Hualalai. Twelve extant localities
are known, extending over a distance of approximately 38 by 15 mi (61 by 24 km) in much of the historic range of the species.
It has not been seen on Hualalai for some time and is presumed extirpated there. Known populations now occur on or near
the following areas: Puu Kanakaleonui, Puu Laau, Ahumoa Cone, Pohakuloa Training Area (PTA), and Sulphur Cone. Because
the species is an annual plant, the total number of individuals varies with the time of year and amount of rainfall.
At the time the proposed rule was written, several hundred to a thousand individuals were known from PTA, a State- and
federally owned area of land which is managed by the U.S. Army. Other, smaller populations totalling approximately
80 to 130 plants were located on privately and State-owned land (HHP 1991l1 to 1991l7, HPCC 1991e; Robert Shaw, Colorado
State University, pers. comm., 1992). Extensive surveys in 1992 and 1993 indicate the presence of tens of thousands
of 

Hesperocnide sandwicensis

 in many populations on and near PTA (R. Shaw, 

in litt.

, 1993). This species is clearly much more abundant than previously thought. This species typically grows in open


Sophora chrysophylla

 (mamane)- and naio- dominated Subalpine Dry Forests at elevations between 5,840 and 8,600 ft (1,780 and 2,620 m) (Gagne
and Cuddihy 1990, HHP 1991l1 to 1991l3, 1991l6, HPCC 1991e, Wagner 

et al

. 1990). Associated species include 

Asplenium fragile, Santalum paniculatum

 ('iliahi), and the naturalized 

Urtica urens

 (HHP 1991l1, 1991l6; R. Shaw, pers. comm., 1992). Individual 

Hesperocnide sandwicensis

 plants and populations of plants are threatened by competition from alien grasses such as 

Anthoxanthum odoratum

 (sweet vernalgrass) and 

Holcus lanatus

 (common velvet grass); grazing by feral pigs, goats, and sheep (

Ovis aries

); habitat disturbance and damage to plants as a result of military exercises; and fire (HHP 1991l6, HPCC 1991e; Ken
Nagata, U.S. Department of Agriculture, pers. comm., 1992). However, 

Hesperocnide sandwicensis

 is maintaining large, reproductive populations throughout PTA in areas that are relatively secure from these threats.
The thousands of plants found in and along lava flows are particularly unlikely to be threatened by feral herbivores,
military activities, or competition from alien grasses (Loyal A. Mehrhoff, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers.
observation, 1993). It is also unlikely that either natural or man-caused fires could destroy a significant percentage
of the total populations. 

Hesperocnide sandwicensis

 fails to meet the definition of either an endangered or threatened species. Therefore, the Service has withdrawn


Hesperocnide sandwicensis

 from consideration for endangered or threatened status (see notice of withdrawal of proposed rule published concurrently
with this final rule).

Ischaemum byrone

 was first collected by James Macrae during the 
expedition of the 

Blonde

 in 1825 and named 

Spodiopogon byronis

 by 
Trinius in 1832. The specific epithet refers to Byron's Bay, now 
called Hilo Bay, where this specimen was collected. Steudel (1855) 
transferred the species to the genus 

Andropogon

, and in 1889, Hackel 
redescribed the species, naming it 

Ischaemum lutescens

, a superfluous 
name. In 1922, Hitchcock published 

Ischaemum byrone

, the currently 
accepted name (O'Connor 1990). 



Ischaemum byrone

 of the grass family (Poaceae) is a perennial 
plant with creeping stems and erect stems 16 to 31 in (40 to 80 cm) 
tall. The uppermost sheaths (portions of leaves surrounding the 
stems) are often inflated and sometimes partially enclose the yellow 
to yellowish-brown racemes (flowering clusters). The hairless leaf 
blade (the flat extended part of the leaf) is 2.8 to 7.9 in (7 to 20 
cm) long and 1.2 to 2 in (3 to 5 cm) wide; the uppermost blades are 
much smaller in size. Flowers, arranged in two or sometimes three 
digitate (originating from one point), elongate racemes 1.6 to 3.9 in 
(4 to 10 cm) long, consist of two types of two-flowered awned (having 
bristles) spikelets (subclusters of flowers). The fruit is a 
caryopsis (grain) about 0.1 in (3 mm) long. The only species of the 
genus found in Hawaii, 

Ischaemum byrone

 differs from other grasses in 
the State by its C

4

 photosynthetic pathway; its digitate racemes; and 
its two-flowered, awned spikelets (O'Connor 1990). 

Historically, 

Ischaemum byrone

 was found on Oahu at an 
unspecified location, on the northeastern coasts of Molokai and east 
Maui, and along the central portion of the eastern coast of the 
island of Hawaii. Extant populations still occur on Molokai, Maui, 
and Hawaii. Two populations on east Molokai are located about 2 mi 
(3 km) apart at the head of Wailau Valley and on Kikipua Point on 
privately owned land. Six populations on east Maui are found along 
approximately 16 mi (26 km) of coast on privately, State-, and 
federally owned land on Pauwalu Point, on Kalahu Point, near Hana, on 
Kauiki Head, and on the following offshore islets: Keopuka Islet, 
Mokuhuki Islet, and Puukii Islet. On Hawaii, the species is still 
found in two populations at Auwae and Kamoamoa on privately and 
federally owned land. The total distribution of the species includes 
10 populations on 3 islands with approximately 1,200 to 2,200 
individuals (HHP 1991m1 to 1991m10, 1991m12 to 1991m14), though the 
total number may be in the range of 5,000 individuals (R. Hobdy, 

in 
litt

., 1993). Because this species occupies lowland habitat, it is 
at high risk from development, alien weeds, and in the past, from 
alien ungulates. This species typically grows in Coastal Dry 
Shrublands among rocks or on basalt cliffs at elevations between sea 
level and 250 ft (0 and 75 m) (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990, O'Connor 
1990). Associated species include 

Bidens

 spp. (ko'oko'olau), 


Fimbristylis cymosa

, and 

Scaevola sericea

 (naupaka kahakai) (HHP 
1991m5, 1991m7, 1991m9, 1991m11, HPCC 1991f). The major threats to 


Ischaemum byrone

 are competition from alien species such as 

Digitaria ciliaris

 (Henry's crabgrass) and habitat change from volcanic 
activity (HHP 1991m3, HPCC 1991f; Charles H. Lamoureux, Lyon 
Arboretum, pers. comm., 1992). 



Isodendrion pyrifolium

 was first collected on Oahu during the 
United States Exploring Expedition in 1841 and was named by Gray in 
1852. The specific epithet refers to the resemblance of the leaves 
of this species to those of 

Pyrus

 (pear). In his monograph of the 
genus, St. John (1952) named the following species, all of which are 
considered in the current treatment of the genus (Wagner 

et al

. 1990) 
to be synonymous with 

I

. 

pyrifolium

: 

I

. 

hawaiiense

, 

I

. 

hillebrandii

, 

I

. 

lanaiense

, 

I

. 

molokaiense

, and 

I

. 

remyi

. 



Isodendrion pyrifolium

 of the violet family (Violaceae), a shrub 
about 2.6 to 6.6 ft (0.8 to 2 m) tall, has persistent stipules 
(leaflike appendages on leaves) and alternate, stalked, elliptic or 
sometimes lance-shaped, papery leaves which measure 1 to 2.6 in (2.5 
to 6.5 cm) long and 0.3 to 1.3 in (0.8 to 3.2 cm) wide. The 
solitary, bilaterally symmetrical, fragrant flowers have five lance-shaped sepals 0.1 to 0.2 in (3.5 to 5 mm) long
with membranous edges 
fringed with white hairs and three types of clawed (with a narrow 
petiole-like base) greenish-yellow petals 0.4 to 0.6 in (10 to 15 mm) 
long with lobes about 0.2 in (4 to 5 mm) long. The three-lobed, 0.5 
in (12 mm) long capsule opens to release olive-green seeds about 0.1 
in (3 mm) long and about 0.08 in (2 mm) in diameter. This species 
differs from others in this endemic Hawaiian genus by its slightly 
smaller, greenish-yellow flowers and by the presence of hairs on the 
stipule midribs and leaf veins (Wagner 

et al

. 1990).

Historically, 

Isodendrion pyrifolium 

was found at unspecified 
localities on Niihau, Molokai, and Lanai, as well as on Oahu in the 
central portion of the Waianae Mountains, on Maui in the northeastern 
to southwestern regions of the West Maui mountains, and on the island 
of Hawaii at the western base of Hualalai (HHP 1991n1 to 1991n5, 
Wagner 

et al. 

1990). The species had not been collected since 1870 
and was presumed extinct. However, in 1991, four plants were found 
on Hawaii at Kealakehe near Kona on State-owned land being developed 
for residential housing and a golf course (C. Corn, 

in litt. 

1991; 
Francis Blanco, Hawaii Housing and Finance Development Corporation, 
and K. Nagata, pers. comms., 1992). In late 1992 and early 1993, 50 
to 60 additional plants were found at this site (Evangeline Funk, 
Botanical Consultants, pers. comm., 1993). This species typically 
grows on dry sites in Lowland Dry to Mesic Forests at low elevations 
(Gagne and Cuddihy 1990, Wagner 

et al. 

1990). Associated species 
include 'iliahi, mamane, and 

Waltheria indica 

('uhaloa) (Paul 
Weissich, Weissich and Associates, pers. comm., 1992). The major 
threats to 

Isodendrion pyrifolium 

are habitat conversion associated 
with residential and recreation development, competition from alien 
species such as fountain grass, fire, and stochastic extinction 
and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the single known population 
and the small number of existing individuals (C. Corn, K. Nagata, and 
P. Weissich, pers. comms., 1992). 

In 1920, Kuekenthal described 

Cyperus fauriei 

based on a specimen 
collected by Faurie on Molokai in 1910 (Wagner 

et al. 

1989). Koyama 
(1990), in the current treatment of the genus, transferred the 
species to 

Mariscus, 

resulting in 

M. fauriei.

 



Mariscus fauriei 

of the sedge family (Cyperaceae), a perennial 
plant with somewhat enlarged underground stems and three-angled, 
single or grouped aerial stems 4 to 20 in (10 to 50 cm) tall, has 
leaves shorter than or the same length as the stems and 0.04 to 0.1 
in (1 to 3.5 mm) wide. Three to 5 bracts, the lowest one 2.4 to 7.9 
in (6 to 20 cm) long, are located under each flower cluster, which 
measures 0.8 to 1.6 in (2 to 4 cm) long and 1.2 to 3.9 in (3 to 10 
cm) wide and is made up of 3 to 10 spikes (unbranched clusters of 
unstalked flowers). Each spike measures 0.3 to 1.2 in (0.8 to 3 cm) 
long and 0.3 to 0.4 in (8 to 10 mm) wide and is made up of compressed 
spreading spikelets, each comprising seven to nine flowers. Fruits 
are three-angled achenes about 0.05 in (1.2 mm) long and about 0.03 
in (0.7 mm) wide. This species differs from others in the genus in 
Hawaii by its smaller size and its narrower, flattened, and more 
spreading spikelets (Koyama 1990). 

Historically, 

Mariscus fauriei 

was found on east Molokai, in the 
northwestern and southwestern portions of Lanai, and on the island of 
Hawaii on the northern slope of Hualalai and the northwestern and 
southernmost slopes of Mauna Loa. A total of 3 extant populations 
and about 33 to 43 known individuals of the species are found on 
Molokai and Hawaii; the species is almost certainly extinct on Lanai 
now. One population of about 20 to 30 plants occurs on Molokai above 
Kamiloloa on State-owned land. Two populations located about 45 mi 
(72 km) apart are known on Hawaii on the Hualalai side of Mauna Loa 
and in the South Point area. The land is privately owned, and there 
are a total of about 13 known individuals on that island (HHP 1991o1 
to 1991o8, HPCC 1991g; R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 1992). This species 
typically grows in lama-dominated Lowland Dry Forests, often on aa 
substrate, at elevations between 880 and 6,000 ft (300 and 1,830 m) 
(HHP 1991o8, HPCC 1991g, Koyama 1990). Associated species include 
alahe'e, 

Peperomia 

sp. ('ala'ala wai nui), and 

Rauvolfia sandwicensis 


(hao) (HHP 1991o8, HPCC 1991g). The major threat to 

Mariscus fauriei 


on Molokai is grazing and trampling by feral goats and axis deer 
(

Axis axis

), and on Hawaii, competition from alien species such as 
Christmas berry and 

Oplismenus hirtellus 

(basketgrass). On both 
islands, the species is faced with stochastic extinction and/or 
reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing 
populations and individuals (HHP 1991o8, HPCC 1991g; R. Hobdy, pers. 
comm., 1992). 

First collected on the island of Hawaii by Charles Pickering 
during the United States Exploring Expedition of 1840 and 1841, 


Nothocestrum breviflorum 

was named by Gray in 1862. He chose the 
specific epithet to refer to the short corolla of the flower of this 
species. In 1888, Hillebrand named var. 

longipes, 

but in the current 
treatment of the genus (Symon 1990), no varieties of the species are 
recognized.

Nothocestrum breviflorum 

of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), a 
stout tree 33 to 39 ft (10 to 12 m) tall with a trunk up to 18 in (45 
cm) in diameter, has deciduous, alternate, stalked, oblong or 
elliptic-oblong, thick and papery-textured, toothless leaves which 
are 2 to 4.7 in (5 to 12 cm) long and 1.2 to 2.4 in (3 to 6 cm) wide. 
Numerous bisexual, radially symmetrical flowers are clustered at the 
ends of short spurs (branches with much shortened internodes) on 
individual stalks 0.2 to 0.4 in (4 to 10 mm) long. Each flower 
consists of a 0.2 to 0.4 in (6 to 11 mm) long, four-lobed tubular 
calyx split on one side and a greenish-yellow four-lobed corolla 
which barely projects beyond the calyx. The fruit, a somewhat 
spherical or oblong, orange-red berry about 0.2 to 0.3 in (6 to 8 mm) 
in diameter, is enclosed by the calyx. Seeds have not been observed. 
This species can be distinguished from others of this endemic 
Hawaiian genus by the leaf shape; the clusters of more than three 
flowers arranged on the ends of short branches; and the broad fruit 
enclosed by the calyx (Symon 1990). 
Historically, 

Nothocestrum breviflorum 

was found only on the 
island of Hawaii from the southern portion of the Kohala Mountains; 
the northern slope of Hualalai; and the eastern, southern, and 
western slopes of Mauna Loa. Today, extant populations have been 
found in much of the species' historic range, from near Waimea, near 
Kiholo, in Puu Waawaa, in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park (HVNP) in 
Kipuka Ki and near Holei Pali, and in the South Point area. These 9 
populations, which extend over a distance of about 63 by 41 mi (101 
by 66 km), are found on privately, State-, and federally owned land 
and contain an estimated 53 known individuals (HHP 1991p1 to 1991p12; 
J. Lau and W. Wagner, pers. comms., 1992). This species typically 
grows in koa- and 'ohi'a- or lama-dominated Lowland Dry Forests and 
Montane Dry or Mesic Forests, often on as substrate, at elevations 
between 590 and 6,000 ft (180 and 1,830 m) (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990, 
HHP 1991p1, 1991p2, 1991p5, 1991p7, 1991p12, HPCC 1991h, Symon 1990). 
Associated species include 'iliahi, 

Caesalpinia kavaiensis 

(uhiuhi), 
and 

Erythrina sandwicensis 

(wiliwili) (HHP 1991p1, 1991p3, 1991p4, 
1991p12, HPCC 1991h; W. Wagner, pers. comm., 1992). The major 
threats to 

Nothocestrum breviflorum 

are habitat conversion associated 
with residential and recreational development, competition from alien 
species such as Christmas berry, fountain grass, lantana, and 


Leucaena leucocephala 

(koa haole); browsing by cattle; fire; and 
stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the 
small number of existing individuals (HHP 1991p4, 1991p6, 1991p12, 
Lamb 1981; W. Wagner, pers. comm., 1992). 



Ochrosia kilaueaensis 

was first collected by Forbes in 1915 and 
was named by St. John in 1978. The specific epithet refers to 
Kilauea, the type locality of the plant on the island of Hawaii. 
Based on a specimen collected in 1909 by Rock, St. John (1978) named 


O. konaensis. 

In the current treatment of the genus (Wagner 

et al. 


1990), 

O. konaensis 

is considered synonymous with 

O. kilaueaensis.

 



Ochrosia kilaueaensis 

of the dogbane family (Apocynaceae) is a 
hairless tree 49 to 59 ft (15 to 18 m) tall with milky sap. The 
lance- or ellipse-shaped toothless leaves are arranged three or four 
per node, are 2.4 to 7.5 in (6 to 19 cm) long and 0.9 to 2.6 in (2.2 
to 6.5 cm) wide, and have veins arising at nearly right angles to the 
midrib. Open clusters of numerous flowers have main stalks 1.8 to 
2.5 in (4.5 to 6.3 cm) long, secondary branches 0.4 to 1 in (1.1 to 
2.5 cm) long, and individual flower stalks 0.2 to 0.3 in (5 to 7 mm) 
long. Each flower has a five-lobed calyx about 0.4 in (10 to 11 mm) 
long and a trumpet-shaped greenish-white corolla with a tube 0.3 to 
0.4 in (7 to 11 mm) long and lobes 0.5 to 0.6 in (12 to 15 mm) long. 
The fruit is a drupe (a fruit with a firm outer layer, a fleshy inner 
layer, and a stony inner layer surrounding a single seed) thought to 
be yellowish brown at maturity, 1.8 to 1.9 in (4.5 to 4.9 cm) long, 
and 0.9 to 1.1 in (2.4 to 2.9 cm) wide. This species is 
distinguished from other Hawaiian species of the genus by the greater 
height of mature trees, the open flower clusters, the longer flower 
stalks, and the larger calyx and lobes of the corolla (Wagner 

et al.

 
1990).

Historically, 

Ochrosia kilaueaensis

 has been collected on the northern slope of Hualalai and on the eastern slope of Mauna Loa. There is one known extant
population located at Puu Waawaa on State-owned land and consisting of an unknown number of individuals (HHP 1991q1,
1991q2). This species typically grows in koa- and 'ohi'a- or lama-dominated Montane Mesic Forests at elevations
between 2,200 and 4,000 ft (670 and 1,220 m) (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990, HHP 1991q1, 1991q2, Wagner 

et al.

 1990). Associated species include 'aiea, kauila, 

Gardenia brighamii

 (nanu), and 

Psychotria hawaiiensis

 (kopiko) (HHP 1991q1). The major threats to 

Ochrosia kilaueaensis

 are competition from alien species such as fountain grass, browsing by feral goats, fire, and stochastic extinction
and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the single existing known population (Bruegmann 1990, CPC 1990). 

Gray (1862) named 

Plantago pachyphylla

 var. 

hawaiiensis

 and 

P. pachyphylla

 var. 

hawaiiensis

 subvar. 

gracilis

 based on specimens collected on the island of Hawaii during the United States Exploring Expedition of 1840 and 1841
and by Remy in the 1850s, respectively. Leveille (1911) published 

P. gaudichaudiana

 based on another specimen from the island of Hawaii. In 1923, Pilger raised the taxon to specific rank, resulting in


P. hawaiensis,

 and also published a new variety, var. 

laxa

 (Pilger 1937). The specific epithet refers to the island where the plant grows. In the current treatment of the genus,
only 

P. hawaiensis 

is accepted (Wagner 

et al.

 1990). 



Plantago hawaiensis 

of the plantain family (Plantaginaceae), a perennial herb which grows from a stout short stem, has thick, leathery,
narrowly oval or oblong leaves located at the base of the plant which measure 3 to 8.7 in (7.5 to 22 cm) long and usually
0.6 to 1.3 in (1.5 to 3.2 cm) wide. The flowering stalk is 7.9 to 35 in (20 to 90 cm) long and is topped by a spike usually 5.9
to 9 in (15 to 23 cm) long. Each upward pointing flower, subtended by a single bract 0.08 to 0.1 in (2.1 to 2.6 mm) long,
has a four-lobed calyx 0.06 to 0.09 in (1.6 to 2.2 mm) long and a trumpet-shaped corolla about 0.04 in (1 mm) long. The
capsule, 0.1 to 0.2 in (2.6 to 4 mm) long and projecting from the calyx, opens to release four to six dull black seeds about
0.04 in (1 mm) long and winged on one end. This species is distinguished from other endemic and naturalized species
of the genus in Hawaii by its perennial herbaceous habit; its thick leathery leaves; its upward pointing flowers;
and its capsules which project from the calyx (Wagner 

et al.

 1990). 

Historically, 

Plantago hawaiensis

 was found only on the island of Hawaii on the southern slope of Mauna Kea; the northeastern, southeastern, and southern
slopes of Mauna Loa; and the western slope of Hualalai. Today, the species is known to occur on the Humuula Saddle, in
the Upper Waiakea Forest Reserve, and near the Keapohina Upland on privately and State-owned land. The four extant
populations extend over a distance of approximately 14 by 4 mi (23 by 6 km). There are no more than 10 known individuals
(HHP 1991r1 to 1991r6). This species typically grows in boggy conditions in Montane Wet Herblands or in Montane Dry
Shrublands dominated by koa or 'ohi'a trees of short stature, or sometimes in lava cracks, at elevations between 5,900
and 6,400 ft (1,800 and 1,950 m) (HHP 1991r1, 1991r2, 1991r4, 1991r6, Wagner 

et al.

 1990). The major threat to 

Plantago hawaiensis

 is stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing populations. 



Portulaca sclerocarpa

 was first collected during the United States Exploring Expedition of 1840 and 1841 and was named by Gray (1854). The
specific epithet refers to the hardened capsule.

Portulaca sclerocarpa 

of the purslane family (Portulacaceae), a perennial herb with a fleshy tuberous taproot which becomes woody, has
stems up to about 7.9 in (20 cm) long. The stalkless, succulent, grayish-green leaves are almost circular in cross-section,
0.3 to 0.8 in (8 to 21 mm) long, and about 0.06 to 0.1 in (1.5 to 2.5 mm) wide. Dense tufts of hairs are located in each leaf
axil and underneath the tight clusters of three to six stalkless flowers grouped at the ends of the stems. Sepals are
about 0.2 in (5 mm) long and have membranous edges. Petals are white, pink, or pink with a white base, about 0.4 in (10
mm) long, and surround about 30 stamens and an 8-branched style. The hardened capsules are about 0.2 in (4 to 4.5 mm)
long, have walls 0.01 to 0.02 in (0.18 to 0.5 mm) thick, open very late or not at all, and contain glossy, dark reddish-brown
seeds about 0.02 in (0.4 to 0.6 mm) long. This species differs from other native and naturalized species of the genus
in Hawaii by its woody taproot, its narrow leaves, and the colors of its petals and seeds. Its closest relative, 

Portulaca villosa, 

differs mainly in its thinner-walled, opening capsule (Wagner 

et al.

 1990). 

Historically, 

Portulaca sclerocarpa

 was found on an islet off the south coast of the island of Lanai and on the island of Hawaii in the Kohala Mountains, on
the northern slope of Hualalai, the northwestern slope of Mauna Loa, and near Kilauea Crater. There is one extant population
on Poopoo Islet off the coast of Lanai which contains about 10 plants (R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 1992). On Hawaii, 11 extant
populations extend over a distance of about 54 by 32 mi (87 by 51 km) and are located on 3 cinder cones in the Nohonaohae
area; at PTA near the Multi-Purpose Range Complex (MPRC); at Puu Anahulu; and near Puu Keanui and Puu Lehua on privately,
State-, and federally owned land. The 11 populations on the island of Hawaii contain a total of approximately 72 to
122 individuals (Cuddihy 

et al

. 1983, HHP 1991s1 to 1991s12; R. Shaw, pers. comm., 1992; R. Shaw, 

in litt

., 1993). This species typically grows in Montane Dry Shrublands, often on bare cinder and even near steam vents, at
elevations between 3,380 and 5,340 ft (1,030 and 1,630 m) (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990, Wagner 

et al.

 1990). Associated species include mamane and 'ohi'a (HHP 1991s1, 1991s8 to 1991s10, 1991s12, HPCC 1991i). The major
threats to 

Portulaca sclerocarpa

 are competition from alien grasses such as fountain grass and 

Andropogon virginicus

 (broomsedge); trampling and habitat disturbance by feral goats, pigs, and sheep; habitat disturbance and damage
to plants as a result of military exercises; and fire (HHP 1991s2, 1991s9, HPCC 1991i; R. Shaw, pers. comm., 1992).



Based on collections by Rock on the island of Hawaii, Beccari named 

Pritchardia affinis 

and three varieties: Var. 

halophila

 (misspelled as ``holaphila''), var. 

rhopalocarpa

, and var. 

gracilis

 (Beccari and Rock 1921). In the current treatment of the genus (Read and Hodel 1990), no subspecific taxa are recognized.





Pritchardia affinis

 of the palm family (Arecaceae) is a fan-leaved tree 33 to 82 ft (10 to 25 m) tall with pale or pinkish soft wool covering
the underside of the petiole and extending onto the leaf blade. The wedge-shaped leaf has a green and smooth upper surface
and a pale green lower surface with scattered yellowish scales. The branched, hairless flower clusters are located
among the leaves. Each flower comprises a cup-shaped, three-lobed calyx; three petals; six stamens; and a three-lobed
stigma. The spherical fruit is about 0.9 in (2.3 cm) in diameter. This species is distinguished from other species
of 

Pritchardia

 by the long, tangled, woolly hairs on the underside of the petiole and the base of the lower leaf blade; the stout hairless
flower clusters which do not extend beyond the wedge-shaped leaves; and the smaller, spherical fruit (Read and Hodel
1990).

Historically, 

Pritchardia affinis

 was found only on the island of Hawaii in the Kohala Mountains and along the western and southeastern coasts. Today,
scattered individuals of the species can be found throughout much of the historically known coastal range at Kiholo,
at Kukio, near Palani Road, on Alii Drive in Kailua, in Captain Cook, at Hookena, at Milolii, and at Punaluu. Most plants
grow within areas of human habitation or development, and the trees may have been cultivated by Hawaiians or others
rather than having occurred in these areas naturally. There are an estimated 50 to 65 known individuals at 8 or more
localities which extend along about 110 mi (180 km) along the coast on privately and State-owned land (HHP 1991t1 to
1991t6; Norman Bezona, Hawaii Cooperative Extension Service, Brien Meilleur, Amy Greenwell Ethnobotanical Garden,
and P. Weissich, pers. comms., 1992). This species typically grows in Coastal Mesic Forests at coastal sites or in
gulches further inland at elevations between sea level and 2,000 ft (0 and 610 m), possibly associated with brackish
water (HHP 1991t2, Read and Hodel 1990; C. Corn, pers. comm., 1992). Native associated species of this loulu are unknown,
since all trees are found in cultivated zones, which have long been cleared of their native cover (B. Meilleur, pers.
comm., 1992). The major threats to 

Pritchardia affinis

 are predation on seeds by roof rats, development of land where individuals grow, and stochastic extinction and/or
reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing individuals. In the past, the species' natural habitat
was cleared for agriculture and housing, and feral pigs destroyed seedlings of the species, preventing regeneration
(Beccari and Rock 1921, Hull 1980; C. Corn, pers. comm., 1992).

Gray (1854) mentioned an unnamed variety of 

Silene

 

struthioloides

, in reference to a specimen collected on the island of Hawaii during the United States Exploring Expedition of 1840
and 1841. Sherff named this taxon 

S. struthioloides

 var. 

gracilis

 in 1946 and later elevated it to specific rank, resulting in 

S. hawaiiensis

 (1949). He chose the specific epithet to refer to the island where the plant is found.



Silene hawaiiensis

 of the pink family (Caryophyllaceae), a sprawling shrub with slanting or climbing stems 6 to 16 in (15 to 40 cm) long
originating from an enlarged root, is covered with short, often sticky hairs. The stalkless narrow leaves are 0.2
to 0.6 in (6 to 15 mm) long and 0.02 to 0.03 in (0.5 to 0.8 mm) wide. Flowers are arranged in elongate clusters. Each flower
has a stalk 0.1 to 0.2 in (3 to 6 mm) long; a five-toothed purple or purple-tinged calyx 0.4 to 0.6 in (11 to 14 mm) long;
and five petals, greenish white above and maroon below, with a stalk-like base and a flat, two-lobed, expanded portion
about 0.2 in (4.5 to 5.5 mm) long. The fruit is a capsule about 0.3 in (6.5 to 8 mm) long which releases pale brown seeds
0.02 to 0.03 in (0.4 to 0.7 mm) long. This species differs from others of 

Silene

 in Hawaii by its growth habit; its covering of short, often sticky hairs; the shape of its leaves; the arrangement of
its flower clusters; and the color of its petals (Wagner 

et al

. 1990).

Historically, 

Silene hawaiiensis

 was found only on the island of Hawaii from the western slope of Mauna Kea; the summit of Hualalai; Humuula Saddle; the
northern, western, and northwestern slopes of Mauna Loa; and near Kilauea Crater. Today, over 50 populations are
found in Hamakua District; on Humuula Saddle; at PTA, including inside MPRC; north of Puu Keanui; and in HVNP on privately,
State-, and federally owned land. These populations extend over a distance of approximately 12 by 7 mi (19 by 11 km)
and contain over 3,000 individuals (HHP 1991u1 to 1991u10, HPCC 1991j; R. Shaw, pers. comm., 1992, R. Shaw, 

in litt

., 1993). This species typically grows in Montane or Subalpine Dry Shrublands in decomposed lava and ash, but can be
found on all ages of lava and cinder substrates, at elevations between 3,000 and 4,300 ft (900 and 1,300 m) and sometimes
up to 8,500 ft (2,575 m) (Wagner 

et al

. 1990; R. Shaw, 

in litt

., 1993). Associated species include 

Dodonaea viscosa

 ('a'ali'i), 

Styphelia

 

tameiameiae

 (pukiawe), and 

Vaccinium reticulatum

 ('ohelo) (HHP 1991u6, HPCC 1991j; R. Shaw, pers. comm., 1992). Many populations of 

Silene hawaiiensis

 are threatened by competition with alien plant species, particularly fountain grass; grazing, browsing, and trampling
by feral goats, pigs, and sheep; habitat disturbance and damage to plants as a result of military exercises; fire;
and volcanic activity (HPCC 1991j). While the existing populations of 

Silene hawaiiensis

 are not in immediate danger of extinction, if these threats are not curtailed, the species will become endangered
in the future.

Gray (1861a) named a plant collected on the island of Hawaii during the United States Exploring Expedition of 1840
and 1841 

Vittadenia arenaria

. Hillebrand (1888) transferred the species to the genus 

Tetramolopium

 and named a second variety, var. 

dentatum

. In the current treatment of the genus (Lowrey 1986, 1990), two subspecies, ssp. 

arenarium

 and ssp. 

laxum

, are recognized. Variety 

confertum

, described by Sherff in 1934, is recognized (Lowrey 1986, 1990) as a variety of ssp. 

arenarium

. Because of a recently recognized typification problem, ssp. 

laxum

 actually should be referred to as ssp. 

arenarium

, leaving what was called ssp. 

arenarium

 without a published name (Laven 

et al

. 1991).



Tetramolopium arenarium

 of the aster family (Asteraceae), an erect tufted shrub 2.6 to 4.3 ft (0.8 to 1.3 m) tall, is covered with tiny glands
and straight hairs. The alternate, toothless or shallowly toothed leaves are more or less lance-shaped, 0.6 to 1.5
in (15 to 37 mm) long, and 0.1 to 0.4 in (3 to 9 mm) wide. Five to 11 heads (dense flower clusters) are grouped at the end of
each stem. Each head comprises a bell-shaped structure of 20 to 34 bracts 0.1 to 0.2 in (2.5 to 5 mm) high and 0.2 to 0.4
in (4 to 9 mm) in diameter beneath the flowers; a single series of 22 to 45 white, male ray florets 0.05 to 0.09 in (1.3 to
2.2 mm) long; and 4 to 9 bisexual disk florets with maroon petals 0.12 to 0.17 in (3.1 to 4.4 mm) long. Fruits are compressed
achenes 0.06 to 0.1 in (1.5 to 3 mm) long and 0.02 to 0.03 in (0.5 to 0.8 mm) wide. This species is distinguished from others
of the genus by its erect habit; the presence and types of glands and hairs on the plant; the fewer heads per flower cluster;
the larger, male ray florets; the fewer, bisexual, maroon-petalled disk florets; and the wider achenes (Lowrey 1990).

Historically, 

Tetramolopium arenarium

 was found on the island of Maui on the western slope of Halakeala and on the island of Hawaii from the Kohala Mountains,
the northwestern slopes of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, and the slopes of Hualalai. Only one population is known today,
and it occurs on Hawaii in Kipuka Kalawamauna at PTA on federally managed land. At last count (January 1993), there
were 29 reproductive and 79 juvenile plants in a 660 by 200 ft (200 by 60 m) area (HHP 1991v1 to 1991v4, 1991w, HPCC 1990a,
Laven 

et al

. 1991; R. Shaw, pers. comm., 1992; R. Shaw, 

in litt

., 1993). This species typically grows in open 'a'ali'i-dominated Lowland or Montane Dry Forests at elevations between
2,600 and 4,900 ft (800 and 1,500 m) (Lowrey 1990). Associated species include 'a'ali'i, pukiawe, 

Chamaesyce olowaluana

 ('akoko), and 

Dubautia linearis

 (na'ena'e) (HPCC 1990a). The major threats to 

Tetramolopium arenarium

 are competition from alien plant species, particularly fountain grass; grazing, browsing, trampling, and habitat
disturbance by feral goats, pigs, and sheep; habitat disturbance and damage to plants as a result of military exercises;
fire; and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the single existing population (Douglas


et al

. 1989, HPCC 1990a, Herbst and Fay 1979). 


Hillebrand (1888) described 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense

 based on a specimen collected on the island of Hawaii and also indicated an unnamed variety for a specimen collected
on Lanai. Other names published for portions of this taxon include: 

Z. bluettianum

 (Rock 1913), 

Z. hawaiiense

 var. 

citriodora

 (Rock 1913), 

Z. hawaiiense

 var. 

velutinosum

 (Rock 1913), and 

Z. hawaiiense

 var. 

subacutum

 (St. John 1976). Some authors placed Hawaiian species in the genus 

Fagara

, resulting in 

F. hawaiiensis

 (Engler 1896) and 

F. bluettiana 

(Engler 1931). Sherff (1958) named 

F. hawaiiensis

 var. 

citriodora

, 

F. hawaiiensis

 var. 

subacutata

, and 

F. hawaiiensis

 var. 

velutinosa

, all of which are considered within the range of variation of 

Z. hawaiiense

 in the current treatment of the Hawaiian species (Stone 

et al

. 1990). 




Zanthoxylum hawaiiense

 of the rue family (Rutaceae), a thornless tree usually 10 to 26 ft (3 to 8 m) tall with a trunk up to 10 in (25 cm) in diameter,
has alternate leaves comprising three leathery, triangular-oval or lance-shaped, gland-dotted, lemon-scented,
toothed leaflets usually 1.3 to 3.9 in (3.4 to 10 cm) long and 0.6 to 2 in (1.5 to 5 cm) wide. The stalk of each of the two side
leaflets has one joint, and the stalk of the terminal leaflet has two joints. Flowers are usually either male or female,
and usually only one sex is found on a single tree. Clusters of 15 to 20 flowers 1.6 to 3.1 in (4 to 8 cm) long have a main flower
stalk 0.8 to 2 in (20 to 50 mm) long and individual flower stalks 0.08 to 0.2 in (2 to 4 mm) long. Each flower has four narrowly
triangular sepals about 0.04 in (1 mm) long and four hairless petals (possibly absent in male flowers) of an unknown
color. The fruit is a sickle-shaped follicle (dry fruit that opens along one side) 0.3 to 0.4 in (8 to 10 mm) long, containing
one black seed about 0.3 in (7 to 8 mm) in diameter. This species is distinguished from other Hawaiian species of the
genus by its leaves, which are always made up of three leaflets of similar size; the presence of only one joint on some
of the leaflet stalks; and the shorter follicle with a rounded tip (Stone 

et al

. 1990). 


Historically, 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense

 was known to occur in the central portion of the island of Kauai; on east Molokai; in the central part of the island of
Lanai; on east Maui on the southwestern and southern slopes of Haleakala; and on the island of Hawaii in the Kohala Mountains,
on the northern slope of Hualalai, and on the northwestern slope of Mauna Loa. There is now one living individual known
on Kauai in Kawaiiki Valley on State-owned land. On Molokai, three extant populations of the species occur on privately
and State-owned and federally managed land in Kalaupapa National Historical Park (NHP), in Pelekunu Valley, and
near Puu Kolekole. The Molokai populations extend over a distance of about 3 by 2 mi (5 by 3 km). Although the number of
plants at one of the sites is uncertain, it is estimated that the three populations contain five plants. On Lanai, one
population with an unknown number of individuals has been reported on privately owned property in Kaiholena Gulch.
On east Maui, extant populations of 

Z. hawaiiense

 have been found in Kahikinui, above Lualailua, above Kanaio, and in Auwahi. These four populations extend over a distance
of approximately 5 by 3 mi (8 by 5 km) and contain a total of fewer than ten plants. On the island of Hawaii, individuals
are found at Puu Waawaa and at PTA on State-owned and federally managed land. These extant populations are located
about 13 mi (21 km) apart and contain a total of about 150 plants (R. Shaw, pers. comm., 1993; R. Shaw 

in litt

., 1993). In summary, 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense

 is currently located on 5 islands and consists of 11 populations and about 166 individuals (HHP 1991x1 to 1991x16;
R. Shaw, pers. comms., 1991, 1993; R. Shaw, 

in litt

., 1993).

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense 

typically grows in 'ohi'a-dominated 
Lowland Dry or Mesic Forests, and Montane Dry Forests, often on aa 
lava, at elevations between 1,800 and 5,710 ft (550 and 1,740 m) 
(Gagne and Cuddihy 1990, Stone 

et al. 

1990). Associated species 
include 

Antidesma platyphyllum 

(hame) on Kauai, 

Pleomele auwahiensis 


(hala pepe) on Molokai, 

Streblus pendulinus 

(a'ia'i) on Maui, and 
mamane and naio on the island of Hawaii (HHP 1991x1, 1991x5, 1991x9, 
1991x11, HPCC 1990b; R. Shaw, pers. comm., 1992). A threat to 

Z. 
hawaiiense 

on Kauai is competition from alien plant species such as 
lantana and 

Melia azedarach 

(Chinaberry) (HHP 1991x11). On Molokai, 
competition with alien plant species, grazing, browsing, trampling, 
and habitat disturbance by feral goats are threats (HHP 1991x5; Lyman 
Perry, The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii, 

in litt., 

1993). On Maui, 
competition with Kikuyu grass, which forms a continuous mat in many 
areas, and grazing, browsing, trampling, and habitat disturbance by 
cattle and goats are threats (A. Medeiros, pers. comm., 1992; A. 
Medeiros and Lloyd Loope, Haleakala National Park, 

in litt., 

1993). 
The major threats to the species on the island of Hawaii are 
competition from alien plant species such as fountain grass; grazing, 
browsing, trampling, and habitat disturbance by feral goats and 
sheep; habitat disturbance and damage to plants as a result of 
military exercises; and fire (CPC 1990, HHP 1991x10, HPCC 1990b). In 
addition, the species is threatened by stochastic extinction and/or 
reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing 
individuals. 


Previous Federal Action 


Federal action on these plants began as a result of section 12 of 
the Act, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution 
to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered, 
threatened, or extinct in the United States. This report, designated 
as House Document No. 94-51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 
1975. In that document, 

Clermontia lindseyana, Clermontia peleana, 
Colubrina oppositifolia, Cyanea hamatiflora 

ssp. 

carlsonii 

(as 

C. 
carlsonii

), 

Cyanea shipmanii, Hesperocnide sandwicensis, Ischaemum 
byrone, Nothocestrum breviflorum 

(as 

N. 

breviflorum var. 


breviflorum

), 

Portulaca sclerocarpa, 

and 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense 

(as 

Z. hawaiiense 

var. 

citriodora

) were considered to be endangered. 

Cyrtandra giffardii, Silene hawaiiensis 

(as 

S. hawaiiensis 

var. 

hawaiiensis

), and 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense 

(as 

Z. hawaiiense 

var. 

hawaiiense 

and 

Z. hawaiiense 

var. 

velutinosum

) were considered to be threatened. 

Clermontia pyrularia, Isodendrion pyrifolium, Nothocestrum breviflorum 

(as 

N. breviflorum 

var. 

longipes

), and 

Tetramolopium arenarium 

(as 

T. arenarium 

var. 

arenarium, T. arenarium 

var. 

confertum, 

and 

T. arenarium 

var. 

dentatum

) were considered to be extinct. On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonian report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section
4(b)(3)) of the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. As a result
of that review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule 
in the 

Federal Register

 (41 FR 24523) to determine endangered status 
pursuant to section 4 of the Act for approximately 1,700 vascular 
plant species, including all of the above taxa considered to be 
endangered or thought to be extinct. The list of 1,700 plant taxa 
was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the 
Smithsonian Institution and the Service in response to House Document 
No. 94-51 and the July 1, 1975, 

Federal Register

 publication.

General comments received in response to the 1976 proposal are 
summarized in an April 26, 1978, 

Federal Register

 publication (43 FR 
17909). In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals 
over 2 years old be withdrawn. A 1-year grace period was given to 
proposals already over 2 years old. On December 10, 1979, the 
Service published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (44 FR 70796) 
withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not 
been made final, along with four other proposals that had expired. 
The Service published updated notices of review for plants on 
December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82480), September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39526), 
and February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6184). In these notices, 10 of the taxa 
(including synonymous taxa) that had been proposed as endangered in 
the June 16, 1976, proposed rule were treated as Category 1 
candidates for Federal listing. Category 1 taxa are those for which 
the Service has on file substantial information on biological 
vulnerability and threats to support preparation of listing 
proposals. 

Clermontia lindseyana, Clermontia pyrularia, Colubrina 
oppositifolia, Cyanea shipmanii, Hesperocnide sandwicensis, Ischaemum 
byrone, Nothocestrum breviflorum, Portulaca sclerocarpa, 

and 


Zanthoxylum hawaiiense, 

which were proposed as endangered in the June 
16, 1976, proposed rule, were considered Category 1 candidates on all 
three notices of review; 

Cyanea hamatiflora 

ssp. 

carlsonii 

was 
considered a Category 1 taxon as 

Cyanea carlsonii 

in the 1980 and 
1985 notices and as 

Cyanea hamatiflora 

ssp. 

carlsonii 

in the 1990 
notice. 

Cyanea stictophylla 

and 

Silene hawaiiensis 

were considered 
Category 1 species in all three notices. In the 1980 and 1985 
notices, 

Isodendrion pyrifolium 

and 

Tetramolopium arenarium 

were 
considered Category 1* species. In the 1990 notice, these two 
species were accorded Category 3A status, but because new information 
regarding their existence has become available, they were proposed in 
1992 for listing. Category 1* taxa are those which are possibly 
extinct, and Category 3A taxa are those for which the Service has 
persuasive evidence of extinction. 

Cyrtandra giffardii 

appeared as 
a Category 2 species and 

Clermontia peleana 

as a Category 3C species 
in the 1980 and 1985 notices. 

Ochrosia kilaueaensis 

first appeared 
as a Category 2 species in the 1985 notice. Category 2 taxa are 
those for which there is some evidence of vulnerability, but for 
which there are not enough data to support listing proposals at the 
time. Category 3C taxa are those which are more abundant than 
previously believed, and/or those that are not subject to any 
identifiable threat. Because new information provided support for 
listing, the above three species were conferred Category 1 status in 
the 1990 notice. The Service recognized 

Cyanea copelandii 

ssp. 


copelandii, Cyrtandra tintinnabula, Mariscus fauriei, Plantago 
hawaiensis, 

and 

Pritchardia affinis 

as Category 1 taxa for the first 
time in the 1990 notice. 
Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make 
findings on petitions that present substantial information indicating 
that the petitioned action may be warranted within 12 months of their 
receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires all 
petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been 
newly submitted on that date. On October 13, 1983, the Service found 
that the petitioned listing of these taxa was warranted, but 
precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with 
section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act; notification of this finding was 
published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires 
the Service to consider the petition as having been resubmitted, 
pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was 
reviewed in October of 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 
1991. Publication of the proposed rule constituted the final 1-year 
finding for these taxa.

On December 17, 1992, the Service published in the 

Federal 
Register 

(57 FR 59951) a proposal to list 22 plant taxa from the 
island of Hawaii as endangered. This proposal was based primarily on 
information supplied by the Hawaii Heritage Program, the Hawaii Plant 
Conservation Center, and observations of botanists and naturalists. 
The Service now determines 20 taxa primarily from the island of 
Hawaii to be endangered and 1 taxon from the island of Hawaii to be 
threatened, with the publication of this rule. One additional taxon 
has been withdrawn from consideration for listing. 


Summary of Comments and Recommendations 


In the December 17, 1992, proposed rule and associated 
notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit 
factual reports or information that might contribute to the 
development of a final decision on the proposal. The public comment 
period ended on February 16, 1993. Appropriate State agencies, 
county and city governments, Federal agencies, scientific 
organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and 
requested to comment. Newspaper notices inviting general public 
comments were published in the Honolulu Advertiser on January 4, 1993 
and in the Hawaii Tribune Herald on January 6, 1993. Nine letters of 
comment were received. No requests for public hearings were 
received. Additional biological information contained in these 
comments has been incorporated into the final rule. Three letters 
provided only biological information and did not provide any comments 
on the proposed listing. Three letters provided both additional 
information and supported the listing of all 22 species as endangered 
species. One letter provided additional biological information and 
specifically recommended that three of the species not be listed as 
endangered or threatened. One letter suggested that it would be 
better to promote the horticultural use of a particular taxon rather 
than list it as endangered. These issues and the Service's response 
are discussed below: 


Issue 1: 

Status of 

Hesperocnide sandwicensis: 

One respondent 
stated that this species should not be listed as an endangered or 
threatened plant, because there are a large number of individuals 
(possibly over 1 million), the taxon is widespread, the species is 
adapted to disturbance, there is an abundance of protected habitat, 
and there are few serious threats to its survival. 


Service Response: 

At the time the proposed rule was written, the 
number of 

Hesperocnide sandwicensis 

was thought to range from several 
hundred to approximately 1,300 individuals. Extensive surveys in 
1992 and early 1993 have documented tens of thousands of plants on 
lava flows between Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea (R. Shaw, 

in litt., 

1993). 
The Service has carefully considered the respondent's comments and 
concurs with his evaluation. Due to the location and large number of 
new populations and individuals now known, the Service is not 
including 

Hesperocnide sandwicensis 

in the final rule. This species 
is placed in category 3C of the Service's plant notice of review and 
is removed from the list of candidate species, although the Service 
will continue to monitor threats to the populations. 


Issue 2: 

Status of 

Pritchardia affinis: 

One respondent 
suggested that an alternative to listing the species as endangered 
would be to promote the use of 

Pritchardia affinis 

for use as a 
culturally significant landscape plant. 


Service Response: 

Designating 

Pritchardia affinis 

as an 
endangered species affords this taxon significant legal protection. 
While the use of species such as 

Pritchardia affinis 

for landscaping 
purposes may have important educational or cultural benefits, such 
plantings would not ensure the protection of the few remaining 
individuals in the wild. 


Issue 3: 

Status of 

Silene hawaiiensis: 

One respondent stated 
that this species should not be listed as an endangered or threatened 
species, because the taxon is relatively common throughout its range 
(over 3,000 plants), the taxon is widely distributed, many 
populations are in protected areas, there are few serious threats to 
its survival, and there are significant taxonomic uncertainties 
regarding its status as a species.

Service Response:

 At the time the proposed rule was written, the number of 

Silene hawaiiensis

 was thought to be between 2,600 and 2,700 individuals in 17 populations. Despite extensive surveys in the area of PTA,
the total number of known plants is still fewer than 4,000 individuals (R. Shaw, 

in litt.,

 1993). While small populations of this taxon are found throughout the area between Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea, most populations
are still threatened by fire, grazing, and disturbances. Fewer than 1,000 plants are known from well protected areas
(Hawaii Volcanoes National Park). The most authoritative taxonomic treatment of Hawaiian 

Silene

 maintains this taxon as a valid species (Wagner 

et al.

 1990). No published taxonomic studies since then have questioned the validity of 

Silene hawaiiensis.

 Based on the above information, the Service determines that 

Silene hawaiiensis

 is not now in danger of extinction, but that 

Silene hawaiiensis

 is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future if the threats posed by fire, competition from alien plant
species, and feral goats, pigs, and sheep are not curbed. Thus, this taxon is designated a threatened species.



Issue 4:

 Status of 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense:

 One respondent questioned if it was possible to list this taxon as endangered only on the islands of Kauai, Molokai,
Lanai, and Maui and not list it on the island of Hawaii because it is more common on Hawaii (possibly between 750 and 3,750
plants). 

Service Response:

 The Act does not allow for the listing of plants in only a portion of their ranges. Consequently, a plant species is listed
as endangered if it is in danger of extinction over all or a significant portion of its range. At the time the proposed
rule was written, the number of 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense

 was thought to be fewer than 75 individuals. Extensive surveys in the area of PTA have located approximately 150 individuals
(R. Shaw, pers. comm., 1993). The respondent's figures of between 750 and 3,750 plants is based upon an extrapolation
of plant densities on PTA to lower elevation areas which, in general, have been more affected by cattle grazing, goats,
pigs, and fires. This type of extrapolation is not warranted, given the potential differences between the two areas.
However, even if these estimates were correct, the species would still be in danger of extinction due to the presence,
throughout its entire range, of uncontrolled threats such as fire; competition from alien plant species; and susceptibility
to grazing, browsing, trampling, and habitat disturbance by feral goats and sheep. For these reasons, 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense

 is determined to be an endangered species.



Summary of Factors Affecting the Species



After thorough review and consideration of all information available, the Service has determined that 20 plant taxa
from the island of Hawaii should be classified as endangered species and 1 taxon from the island of Hawaii should be
classified as threatened. One taxon has been withdrawn from consideration.

Procedures found at section 4 of the Endangered Species Act and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement
the listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species
due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). The threats facing these 21 taxa are summarized
in Tables 1 and 2.

A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or 
Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range


The habitat of the plants included in this rule has undergone extreme alteration because of past and present land management
practices, including deliberate alien animal and plant introductions; agricultural, commercial, and urban development;
and military and recreational use. Natural disturbances such as flooding, landslides, and volcanic activity also
destroy habitat and can have a significant effect on small populations of plants. Competition with alien plants as
well as destruction of plants and modification of habitat by 
introduced animals are the primary threats facing 18 of the 21 taxa included in this rule (See Table 1). 
Beginning with Captain James Cook in 1792, early European explorers introduced livestock, which became feral, increased
in number and 
range, and caused significant changes to the natural environment of Hawaii. 
The 1848 provision for land sales to individuals allowed large-scale 
agricultural and ranching ventures to begin. So much land was cleared for 
these enterprises that climatic conditions began to change, and the amount 
and distribution of rainfall were altered (Wenkam 1969). Plantation owners 
supported reforestation programs which resulted in many alien trees being 
introduced in the hope that the watershed could be conserved. 
Past and present activities of introduced alien mammals are the 
primary factor in altering and degrading vegetation and habitats on the 
island of Hawaii as well as on Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, and Maui, where some 
populations of these species occur. Feral ungulates trample and eat native 
vegetation and disturb and open areas. This causes erosion and allows the 
entry of alien plant species (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Wagner 

et al. 

1990). 
Fourteen taxa in this rule are directly threatened by habitat degradation 
resulting from introduced ungulates: 4 taxa are threatened by cattle, 1 
taxon by deer, 7 taxa by goats, 8 by pigs, and 4 by sheep.

Axis deer (

Axis axis

), native to Sri Lanka and India, were first 
introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in 1868 as a game animal on Molokai, 
later to Oahu and Lanai, and finally to east Maui in 1960. Hunting of axis 
deer is allowed only on Molokai and Lanai during 2 months of the year 
(Hawaii DLNR 1985, Tomich 1986). The animal constitutes a threat to 


Mariscus fauriei

 on Molokai and a potential threat to 

Ischaemum byrone

 and 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense

 on Molokai and Maui (HHP 1991x5, HPCC 1990b, Medeiros 

et al

. 1986; R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 1992). 


Cattle (

Bos taurus

), the wild progenitor of which was native to 
Europe, northern Africa, and southwestern Asia, were introduced to the 
Hawaiian Islands in 1793. Large feral herds developed as a result of 
restrictions on killing cattle decreed by King Kamehameha I. While small 
cattle ranches were developed on Kauai, Oahu, and west Maui, very large 
ranches of tens of thousands of acres were created on east Maui and Hawaii. 
Much of the land used in these private enterprises was leased from the 
State or was privately owned and considered Forest Reserve and/or 
Conservation District land. On Kauai, both sides of Waimea Canyon were 
supporting large cattle ranching operations by the 1870s (Ryan and Chang 
1985). Feral cattle roamed Oahu, but most were removed by the early 1960s; 
today only a few can be found in the northwestern part of the island (J. 
Lau, pers. comm., 1990). Feral cattle were formerly found on Molokai and 
Maui and damaged the forests there. Feral cattle can presently be found on 
the island of Hawaii, and ranching is still a major commercial activity 
there. Hunting of feral cattle is no longer allowed in Hawaii (Hawaii DLNR 
1985). Cattle eat native vegetation, trample roots and seedlings, cause 
erosion, create disturbed areas into which alien plants invade, and spread 
seeds of alien plants in their feces and on their bodies. The forest in 
areas grazed by cattle becomes degraded to grassland pasture, and plant 
cover is reduced for many years following removal of cattle from an area. 
Several alien grasses and legumes purposely introduced for cattle forage 
have become noxious weeds (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Tomich 1986). 


The habitats of many of the plants in this rule were degraded in 
the past by feral cattle, and this has had effects which still persist. 
Some taxa in this rule are still being directly affected by cattle. These 
include: 

Clermontia lindseyana

, 

Cyanea hamatiflora

 ssp. 

carlsonii

, 

Cyanea

 

stictophylla

, and 

Nothocestrum breviflorum

 (HHP 1991a1, 1991p4, 1991p5, HPCC 1990b, 1991a, 1991h; F. Duvall and A. Medeiros, pers. comms., 1992). 


Goats (

Capra hircus

), a species originally native to the Middle 
East and India, were successfully introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in 
1792, and currently there are populations on Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, 
and Hawaii. On Kauai, feral goats have been present in drier, more rugged 
areas since 1820; they still occur in Waimea Canyon. Goats have been on 
Oahu since about 1820, and they currently occur in the northern Waianae 
Mountains. On Molokai, goats degrade dry forests at low elevations. On 
Maui, goats have been widespread for 100 to 150 years and are common 
throughout the south slope of Haleakala (Medeiros 

et al

. 1986). On Hawaii, goats damage low-elevation dry forest, montane parkland, subalpine 
woodlands, and alpine grasslands. Goats are managed in Hawaii as a game 
animal, but many herds populate inaccessible areas where hunting has little 
effect on their numbers. Goat hunting is allowed year-round or during 
certain months, depending on the area (Hawaii DLNR n.d., 1985). Goats 
browse on introduced grasses and native plants, especially in drier and 
more open ecosystems. They also trample roots and seedlings, cause 
erosion, and promote the invasion of alien plants. They are able to forage 
in extremely rugged terrain and have a high reproductive capacity (Cuddihy 
and Stone 1990, Culliney 1988, Tomich 1986). 

Clermontia lindseyana

, 


Mariscus fauriei

, 

Ochrosia kilaueaensis

, 

Portulaca sclerocarpa

, 

Silene hawaiiensis

, 

Tetramolopium arenarium

, and 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense

 are currently threatened by goats (Bruegmann 1990, CPC 1990, HHP 1991s5, 1991x5, HPCC 1990b; R. Hobdy, A. Medeiros,
and R. Shaw, pers. comms., 1992), and 

Ischaemum byrone

 is potentially threatened by the animal (HHP 1991m11; R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 1992). 


Sheep (

Ovis aries

) have become firmly established on the island of 
Hawaii (Tomich 1986) since their introduction almost 200 years ago (Cuddihy 
and Stone 1990). Like feral goats, sheep roam the upper elevation dry 
forests of Mauna Kea (above 3,300 ft (1,000 m)), including PTA, causing 
damage similar to that of goats (Stone 1985). Sheep have decimated vast 
areas of native forest and shrubland on Mauna Kea and continue to do so as 
a managed game species. Sheep threaten the habitat of at least two 
previously listed endangered species as well as the following plant species 
included in this rule: 

Portulaca sclerocarpa

, 

Silene hawaiiensis

, 


Tetramolopium arenarium

, and 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense

 (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, HHP 1991s4, HPCC 1990a, 1990b, Shaw 

et al

. 1990, Stone 1985; K. Nagata and R. Shaw, pers. comms., 1992).

Pigs (

Sus scrofa

) are originally native to Europe, northern 
Africa, Asia Minor, and Asia. European pigs, introduced to Hawaii by 
Captain James Cook in 1778, became feral and invaded forested areas, 
especially wet and mesic forests and dry areas at high elevations. They 
are currently present on Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii and inhabit 
rain forests and grasslands. Pig hunting is allowed on all islands either 
year-round or during certain months, depending on the area (Hawaii DLNR 
n.d., 1985). While rooting in the ground in search of the invertebrates 
and plant material they eat, feral pigs disturb and destroy vegetative 
cover, trample plants and seedlings, and threaten forest regeneration by 
damaging seeds and seedlings. They disturb soil substrates and cause 
erosion, especially on slopes. Alien plant seeds are dispersed in their 
hooves and coats as well as through their digestive tracts, and the 
disturbed soil is fertilized by their feces, helping these plants to 
establish (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Medeiros 

et al

. 1986, Smith 1985, Stone 1985, Tomich 1986, Wagner 

et al. 

1990). Feral pigs pose an immediate 
threat to one or more populations of the following taxa in this rule: 


Clermontia lindseyana

, 

Clermontia peleana

, 

Colubrina oppositifolia

, 

Cyrtandra giffardii

, 

Cyrtandra tintinnabula

, 

Portulaca sclerocarpa

, 

Silene hawaiiensis

, and 

Tetramolopium arenarium

 (Bruegmann 1990, CPC 1990, HPCC 1990a, 1991a, 1991d1, 1991d2; J. Lau, A. Medeiros, John Obata, Hawaii Plant Conservation
Center, and W. Wagner, pers. comms., 1992). 


Land development for housing and commercial activities threatens 


Pritchardia affinis

, 

Isodendrion pyrifolium

, and 

Nothocestrum breviflorum

 (C. Corn, K. Nagata, and P. Weissich, pers. comms., 1992). These threats range from specific, previously approved
projects to more general development pressures affecting much of the leeward portion of the island of Hawaii. A State-sponsored
housing development at the site of the only known population of 

Isodendrion pyrifolium

 is currently being modified to reduce its impact on this taxa. However, this modification is not 
finalized, and the development could still pose a significant threat to the 
long-term survival of the species. 


Illegal cultivation of 

Cannabis sativa

 (marijuana) occurs in 
isolated portions of public and private lands in the Hawaiian Islands. 
This agricultural practice opens areas in native forest into which alien 
plants invade after the patches are abandoned (Medeiros 

et al

. 1988). 
Marijuana cultivation is considered a threat to the integrity of the 
habitat of 

Clermontia peleana

 (Bruegmann 1990, CPC 1990). 



B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes



Unrestricted collecting for scientific or horticultural purposes and excessive visits by individuals interested
in seeing rare plants could result from increased publicity. This is a potential threat to all of the taxa in this rule,
but especially to 

Cyanea copelandii

 ssp. 

copelandii

 and 

Ochrosia kilaueaensis

, each of which has only 1 or 2 populations and a total of 10 or fewer known individuals. Any collection of whole plants
or reproductive parts of any of these two species could cause an adverse impact on the gene pool and threaten the survival
of the species. 




C. Disease or Predation



Axis deer, cattle, goats, or sheep have been reported in areas where populations of most of the taxa occur. As the taxa
are not known to be unpalatable to these ungulates, predation is a probable threat where those animals have been reported,
potentially affecting the following taxa: 

Clermontia lindseyana

, 

Cyanea hamatiflora

 ssp. 

carlsonii

, 

Cyanea stictophylla

, 

Ischaemum byrone

, 

Mariscus fauriei

, 


Nothocestrum breviflorum

, 

Ochrosia kilaueaensis

, 

Portulaca sclerocarpa

, 

Silene hawaiiensis

, 

Tetramolopium arenarium

, and 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense

. The lack of seedlings of several of the taxa and the occurrence of some populations or taxa only in areas inaccessible
to ungulates seem to indicate the effect that browsing mammals, especially cattle and goats, have had in restricting
the distribution of these plants.

Of the four species of rodents that have been introduced to the Hawaiian Islands, the species with the greatest impact
on the native flora and fauna is probably roof or black rat (

Rattus rattus

), which now occurs on all the main Hawaiian Islands around human habitations, in cultivated fields, and in dry to wet
forests. Roof rats, and to a lesser extent house mouse (

Mus musculus

), Polynesian rat (

R. exulans

), and Norway rat (

R. norvegicus

) eat the fruits of some native plants, especially those with large, fleshy fruits. Many native Hawaiian plants produce
their fruit over an extended period of time, and this produces a prolonged food supply which supports rodent populations.
Rodents damage fruit of 

Pritchardia affinis

 (Beccari and Rock 1921). It is probable that rats damage the fruit of 

Ochrosia kilaueaensis

, which has fleshy fruits and occurs in areas where rats are found. Rats feed on 

Clermontia peleana

, and, since rats are found in remote areas of most islands in Hawaii, it is likely that predation occurs on the other
taxa of 

Clermontia

 and 

Cyanea

, potentially affecting 

Clermontia lindseyana, Clermontia pyrularia, Cyanea copelandii

 ssp. 

copelandii, Cyanea hamatiflora

 ssp. 

carlsonii, Cyanea shipmanii,

 and 

Cyanea stictophylla

 (HPCC 1990a; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1990).

Black twig borer (

Xylosandrus compactus

) is a small beetle about 0.06 in (1.6 mm) in length which burrows into branches, introduces a pathogenic fungus as food
for its larvae, and lays its eggs. Twigs, branches, and even the entire plant can be killed from such an infestation.
Black twig borer is known to attack 

Colubrina oppositifolia

 and is a threat to this species (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, HHP 1991e9, 1991e16).



Pritchardia affinis

 is known to be susceptible to lethal yellows, which is a bacteria-like organism producing disease in many palms. This
disease is not yet in Hawaii, but if it ever is accidentally introduced on plant material brought into the State, it
is a potential threat to this species. Cultivated loulu specimens in areas outside Hawaii may be affected by the disease
(Hull 1980).



D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms 



Hawaii's Endangered Species Act states, ``Any species of aquatic life, wildlife, or land plant that has been determined
to be an endangered species pursuant to the [Federal] Endangered Species Act shall be deemed to be an endangered species
under the provisions of this chapter * * *'' (HRS, sect. 195D-4(a)). Federal listing
would automatically invoke listing under Hawaii State law, which prohibits taking of endangered plants in the State
and encourages conservation by State agencies (HRS, sect. 195D-4).

None of the 21 taxa in this rule are presently listed as an endangered species by the State of Hawaii. Fifteen of the 21
taxa in this rule have populations located on privately owned land. Two taxa, 

Cyanea shipmanii

 and 

Cyanea stictophylla,

 are found exclusively on private land. At least one population of each taxon except 

Cyanea shipmanii, Cyanea stictophylla, Silene hawaiiensis,

 and 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense

 occurs on State land. 

Colubrina oppositifolia, Cyanea copelandii 

ssp. 

copelandii, Cyrtandra giffardii, Cyrtandra tintinnabula, 

and 

Ischaemum byrone

 each have one or more populations located in State parks, Natural Area Reserves, or the State seabird sanctuary, which
have rules and regulations for the protection of resources (Hawaii DLNR 1981; HRS, sects. 183D-4, 184-5,
195-5, and 195-8). However, the regulations are difficult to enforce because of limited personnel. One
or more populations of at least 18 of the 21 taxa included in this rule are located on land classified within conservation
districts and owned by the State of Hawaii or private companies or individuals. Regardless of the owner, lands in these
districts, among other purposes, are regarded as necessary for the protection of endemic biological resources and
the maintenance or enhancement of the conservation of natural resources. Activities permitted in conservation
districts are chosen by considering how best to make multiple use of the land (HRS, sect. 205-2). Some uses, such
as maintaining animals for hunting, are based on policy decisions, while others, such as preservation of endangered
species, are mandated by both Federal and State laws. Requests for amendments to district boundaries or variances
within existing classifications can be made by government agencies and private landowners (HRS, sect. 205-4).
Before decisions about these requests are made, the impact of the proposed reclassification on ``preservation or
maintenance of important natural systems or habitat'' (HRS, sects. 205-4, 205-17) as well as the maintenance
of natural resources is required to be taken into account (HRS, sects. 205-2, 205-4). For any proposed
land use change that will occur on county or State land, will be funded in part or whole by county or State funds, or will
occur within land classified as conservation district, an environmental assessment is required to determine whether
or not the environment will be significantly affected (HRS, chapt. 343). If it is found that an action will have a significant
effect, preparation of a full Environmental Impact Statement is required. Hawaii environmental policy, and thus
approval of land use, is required by law to safeguard ``* * * the State's unique natural environmental
characteristics * * *'' (HRS, sect. 344-3(1)) and includes guidelines to ``Protect
endangered species of individual plants and animals * * *'' (HRS, sect. 344-4(3)(A)).
Federal listing, because it automatically invokes State listing, would also trigger these other State regulations
protecting the plants.

State laws relating to the conservation of biological resources 
allow for the acquisition of land as well as the development and 
implementation of programs concerning the conservation of biological 
resources (HRS, sect. 195D-5(a)). The State also may enter into agreements 
with Federal agencies to administer and manage any area required for the 
conservation, management, enhancement, or protection of endangered species 
(HRS, sect. 195D-5(c)). If listing were to occur, funds for these 
activities could be made available under section 6 of the Federal Act 
(State Cooperative Agreements). The Hawaii DLNR is mandated to initiate 
changes in conservation district boundaries to include ``the habitat of rare 
native species of flora and fauna within the conservation district'' (HRS, 
sect. 195D-5.1). State and Federal agencies have programs to locate, 
eradicate, and deter marijuana cultivation, which is a threat to one of the 
taxa in this rule (CPC 1990). Despite the existence of various State laws 
and regulations which give protection to Hawaii's native plants, their 
enforcement is difficult due to limited funding and personnel. These State 
laws and regulations are therefore inadequate to protect the taxa that 
occur on State land. Listing of these 21 plant taxa would reinforce and 
supplement the protection available under the State Act and other laws. 
The Federal Endangered Species Act would offer additional protection to 
these 21 taxa because, if they were to be listed as endangered or 
threatened, it would be a violation of the Act for any person to remove, 
cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such plant in an area not under Federal 
jurisdiction in knowing violation of State law or regulation or in the 
course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. 



E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued 
Existence 



The small numbers of populations and individuals of most of 
these taxa increase the potential for extinction from stochastic events. 
The limited gene pool may depress reproductive vigor, or a single human-caused or natural environmental disturbance
could destroy a significant 
percentage of the individuals or the only known extant population. This 
constitutes a major threat to 15 of the 21 taxa included in this rule (See 
Table 1). Five of the taxa, 

Cyanea copelandii 

ssp. 

copelandii, Cyanea 
shipmanii, Isodendrion pyrifolium, Ochrosia kilaueaensis, 

and 

Tetramolopium 
arenarium, 

are known from a single population. Seven other taxa are known 
from only two to five populations. Fourteen of the taxa are estimated to 
number no more than 100 known individuals. Five of these taxa, 

Clermontia 
peleana, Clermontia pyrularia, Cyanea copelandii 

ssp. 

copelandii, Ochrosia kilaueaensis, 

and 

Plantago hawaiensis, 

number no more than ten known 
individuals. 

One or more species of 12 introduced plants threaten 12 of the 
taxa in this rule. The original native flora of Hawaii consisted of about 
1,000 species, 89 percent of which were endemic. Of the total native and 
naturalized Hawaiian flora of 1,817 species, 47 percent were introduced 
from other parts of the world and nearly 100 species have become pests 
(Smith 1985, Wagner 

et al. 

1990). Naturalized, introduced species degrade the Hawaiian landscape and compete with native plants for space,
light, water, and nutrients (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Some of these species were 
brought to Hawaii by various groups of people, including the Polynesian 
immigrants, for food or cultural reasons. Plantation owners, alarmed at 
the reduction of water resources for their crops caused by the destruction 
of native forest cover by grazing feral animals, supported the introduction 
of alien tree species for reforestation. Ranchers intentionally introduced 
pasture grasses and other species for agriculture, and sometimes they 
inadvertently introduced weed seeds as well. Other plants were brought to 
Hawaii for their potential horticultural value (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, 
Wenkam 1969). 


Lantana camara 

(lantana), brought to Hawaii as an ornamental 
plant, is an aggressive, thicket-forming shrub which can now be found on 
all of the main islands in mesic forests, dry shrublands, and other dry, 
disturbed habitats (Wagner 

et al.

 1990). One or more populations of each 
of the following taxa are threatened by lantana: 

Colubrina oppositifolia, 
Nothocestrum breviflorum, 

and 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense 

(HHP 1991e4, 1991e8, 
1991e15, 1991e16, 1991p4, 1991p12, 1991x11, HPCC 1991b, 1991h). 

Leucaena 
leucocephala 

(koa haole), a naturalized shrub which is sometimes the 
dominant species in low elevation, dry, disturbed areas on all of the main 
Hawaiian islands, threatens 

Nothocestrum breviflorum 

(Geesnick 

et al.

 1990, 
HHP 1991p12, HPCC 1991h). 

Melia azedarach 

(Chinaberry), a small tree 
widely cultivated and naturalized on most of the main Hawaiian Islands, 
threatens 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense 

on Kauai (HHP 1991x11, Wagner 

et al.

 
1990). 

Passiflora mollissima 

(banana poka), a woody vine, poses a serious 
problem to mesic forests on Kauai and Hawaii by covering trees, reducing 
the amount of light which reaches trees as well as understory, and causing 
damage and death to trees by the weight of the vines. Animals, especially 
feral pigs, eat the fruit and distribute the seeds (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, 
Escobar 1990). Banana poka threatens 

Clermontia lindseyana, Clermontia 
pyrularia,

 and 

Cyanea hamatiflora

 ssp. 

carlsonii 

(HHP 1991a3, 1991y, HPCC 
1991c1 to 1991c3). After escaping from cultivation, 

Schinus 
terebinthifolius 

(Christmas berry) became naturalized on most of the main 
Hawaiian Islands (Wagner 

et al.

 1990). It threatens 

Colubrina 
oppositifolia, Mariscus fauriei,

 and 

Nothocestrum breviflorum 

(HHP 1991e8, 
1991e15, 1991e16, 1991o8, 1991p12, HPCC 1991b, 1991g).

Several hundred species of grasses have been introduced to the 
Hawaiian Islands, many for animal forage. Of the approximately 100 grass 
species which have become naturalized, 6 species threaten 11 of the 21 taxa 
in this rule. 

Andropogon virginicus 

(broomsedge) is a perennial, tufted 
grass which is naturalized on Oahu and Hawaii along roadsides and in 
disturbed dry to mesic forest and shrubland. This is a fire-adapted grass 
which threatens 

Portulaca sclerocarpa 

(Cuddihy and Stone 1990, HPCC 1991i, 
O'Connor 1990). 

Digitaria ciliaris 

(Henry's crabgrass) is an annual grass 
which forms thick mats. It has naturalized on all the main Hawaiian 
islands in lawns and pastures and threatens 

Ischaemum byrone 

(HPCC 1991f, 
O'Connor 1990). 

Oplismenus hirtellus 

(basketgrass) is a perennial grass 
which is naturalized in shaded mesic valleys and forests and sometimes in 
wet forests on most of the main Hawaiian Islands. 

Mariscus fauriei 

is 
threatened by basketgrass (HPCC 1991g, O'Connor 1990). 

Pennisetum 
clandestinum 

(Kikuyu grass), an aggressive, perennial grass introduced to 
Hawaii as a pasture grass, withstands trampling and grazing and has 
naturalized on four Hawaiian Islands in dry to mesic forest. It produces 
thick mats which choke out other plants and prevent their seedlings from 
establishing and has been declared a noxious weed by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (7 CFR 360) (Medeiros 

et al.

 1986, O'Connor 1990, Smith 1985). 
Kikuyu grass is a threat to 

Clermontia lindseyana,

 and 

Zanthoxylum 
hawaiiense 

(HPCC 1991a; A. Medeiros, pers. comm., 1992). 

Pennisetum 
setaceum 

(fountain grass) is a fire-adapted bunch grass that has spread 
rapidly over bare lava flows and open areas on the island of Hawaii since 
its introduction in the early 1900s. Fountain grass is particularly 
detrimental to Hawaii's dry forests because it is able to invade areas once 
dominated by native plants, where it interferes with plant regeneration, 
carries fires into areas not usually prone to fires, and increases the 
likelihood of fires (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, O'Connor 1990, Smith 1985). 
Fountain grass threatens one or more populations of the following taxa: 


Colubrina oppositifolia, Isodendrion pyrifolium, Nothocestrum breviflorum, 
Ochrosia kilaueaensis, Portulaca sclerocarpa, Silene hawaiiensis, 
Tetramolopium arenarium, 

and 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense

 (HHP 1991p5, HPCC 
1990a, 1991h; J. Lau and P. Weissich, pers. comms., 1992). 

Because Hawaiian plants were subjected to fire during their 
evolution only in areas of volcanic activity and from occasional lightning 
strikes, they are not adapted to recurring fire regimes and are unable to 
recover well following a fire. Alien plants are often better adapted to 
fire than native plant species, and some fire-adapted grasses have become 
widespread in Hawaii; native shrubland can thus be converted to land 
dominated by alien grasses. The presence of such species in Hawaiian 
ecosystems greatly increases the intensity, extent, and frequency of fire, 
especially during drier months or drought. Fire-adapted alien species can 
re-establish in a burned area, resulting in a reduction in the amount of 
native vegetation after each fire. Fire can destroy dormant seeds as well 
as plants, even in steep or inaccessible areas. Fires may result from 
natural causes, or they may be accidentally or purposely set by hunters, or 
military ordnance or personnel. Vegetation within PTA on the northwestern 
slope of Mauna Loa is particularly vulnerable to fire, as this is an area 
managed for recreational hunting and used for military training. The only 
known population of 

Tetramolopium arenarium 

occurs in Kipuka Kalawamauna, 
and to protect this area from fires, the U.S. Army has installed firebreaks 
and now redirects ordnance firing away from that kipuka. Planned military 
maneuvers are now being re-evaluated in light of several Category 1 and 
listed endangered species within the boundaries of PTA, and an 
Environmental Impact Statement is being prepared for the area in response 
to a court decision (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
1979; R. Shaw, pers. comm., 1992). Fire is a threat to one or more 
populations of the following taxa in this rule: C

olubrina oppositifolia, 
Isodendrion pyrifolium, Nothocestrum breviflorum, Ochrosia kilaueaensis, 
Portulaca sclerocarpa, Silene hawaiiensis, Tetramolopium arenarium, 

and 


Zanthoxylum hawaiiense 

(HHP 1991e15, 1991p5, HPCC 1990a, 1990b, 1991b, 
1991h; J. Lau and K. Nagata, pers. comms., 1992).

Natural changes to habitat and substrate can result in the death 
of individual plants as well as the destruction of their habitat. This 
especially affects the continued existence of taxa or populations with 
limited numbers and/or narrow ranges and is often exacerbated by human 
disturbance and land use practices (See Factor A). Landslides produced by 
burrowing seabirds in an offshore islet population of 

Ischaemum byrone

 are 
a potential threat to that species (HHP 1991m10; R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 
1992). Flooding is a threat to 

Clermontia peleana

, which often grows in a 
riparian habitat (Bruegmann 1990, CPC 1990). A population of 

Ischaemum 
byrone

 is presumed to have been destroyed by volcanic activity, and another 
population is affected by drifting black sand (HHP 1991m3; C. Lamoureux, 
pers. comm., 1992). Some populations of 

Silene hawaiiensis

 are also 
considered to be threatened by volcanic activity (HPCC 1991j). 

People are more likely to come into contact with taxa that have 
populations near trails or roads or in recreational areas. Alien plants 
may be introduced into such areas as seeds on footwear, or people may cause 
erosion, trample plants, or start fires (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). The 
following taxa have populations in recreational areas or close to roads or 
trails and are immediately or potentially threatened by human disturbance: 


Clermontia peleana

, 

Clermontia pyrularia

, 

Colubrina oppositifolia

, 

Cyrtandra giffardii

, 

Ischaemum byrone

, 

Nothocestrum breviflorum

, 

Portulaca sclerocarpa

, 

Silene hawaiiensis

, 

Tetramolopium arenarium

, and 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense

.

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and 
commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future 
threats faced by these taxa in determining to issue this final rule. Based 
on this evaluation, this rulemaking will list these 20 plant taxa as 
endangered: 

Clermontia lindseyana

, 

Clermontia peleana

, 

Clermontia pyrularia

, 

Colubrina oppositifolia

, 

Cyanea copelandii

 ssp. 

copelandii

, 

Cyanea hamatiflora

 ssp. 

carlsonii

, 

Cyanea shipmanii

, 

Cyanea stictophylla

, 

Cyrtandra giffardii

, 

Cyrtandra tintinnabula

, 

Ischaemum byrone

, 

Isodendrion pyrifolium

, 

Mariscus fauriei

, 

Nothocestrum breviflorum

, 

Ochrosia kilaueaensis

, 

Plantago hawaiensis

, 

Portulaca sclerocarpa

, 

Pritchardia affinis

, 

Tetramolopium arenarium

, and 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense

. One taxon is listed as threatened, 

Silene hawaiiensis

. Fourteen of the taxa determined to be endangered number no more than about 100 individuals and/or are known from 5
or fewer populations. The 20 taxa are threatened by 1 or more of the following: habitat degradation and/or predation
by axis deer, cattle, goats, insects, pigs, rats, and sheep; competition from alien plants; fire and natural disasters;
human and military impacts; and lack of legal protection or difficulty in enforcing laws which are already in effect.
Small population size and limited distribution make these taxa particularly vulnerable to extinction and/or reduced
reproductive vigor from stochastic events. Because these 20 taxa are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant
portion of their ranges, they fit the definition of endangered as defined in the Act. 

Although all populations of 

Silene hawaiiensis

 are threatened to 
some degree by fire, competition with alien plant species, predation by 
feral animals, and/or human activities, the widespread distribution of 
populations, rocky habitat, presence of population regeneration, and total 
numbers of plants reduces the danger that this species will become extinct 
in the near future. For these reasons, this species is not now in 
immediate danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of 
its range. However, 

Silene hawaiiensis

 is likely to become endangered in 
the foreseeable future if the threats are not curbed. As a result, 

Silene hawaiiensis

 fits the definition of a threatened species as defined in the 
Act. 



Hesperocnide sandwicensis

 has been reassessed with regard to the 
five factors addressed above and the new information about the species' 
abundance and location. Although individual plants and populations of 
plants are threatened by competition from alien grasses, grazing by feral 
pigs, goats, and sheep, habitat disturbance and damage to plants as a 
result of military exercises, and fire, large reproductive populations 
located throughout PTA are relatively secure from these threats. The 
Service now finds that 

Hesperocnide sandwicensis

 fails to meet the 
definition of either an endangered or threatened species, and has withdrawn 
it from consideration for endangered or threatened status (see notice of 
withdrawal published concurrently in this 

Federal Register

). 

Critical habitat is not being designated for the 21 taxa included 
in this rule, for reasons discussed in the 

Critical Habitat 

section of 
this rule. 



Critical Habitat

Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the 
maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical 
habitat at the time the species is determined to be endangered. The 
Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent 
for these taxa. As discussed under Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors 
Affecting the Species,'' the taxa face numerous anthropogenic threats. The 
publication of precise maps and descriptions of critical habitat in the 


Federal Register

, as required in a designation of critical habitat, would increase the degree of threat to these plants from take or
vandalism and, therefore, could contribute to their decline. The listing of these taxa as endangered publicizes
the rarity of the plants and, thus, can make these 
plants attractive to researchers, curiosity seekers, or collectors of rare 
plants. All involved parties and the major landowners have been notified 
of the general location and importance of protecting the habitat of these 
taxa. Protection of the habitat of the taxa will be addressed through the 
recovery process and through the section 7 consultation process. 
Designation of critical habitat for these taxa is not prudent at this time 
because such a designation would increase the potential for vandalism, 
collecting, or other human activities and is unlikely to aid in the 
conservation of these taxa. 



Available Conservation Measures 



Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or 
threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery 
actions, requirements for Federal recognition, and prohibitions against 
certain activities. Recognition through listing encourages and results in 
conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and 
individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land 
acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that recovery 
actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of 
Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving 
 listed plants are discussed, in part, below. 

Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to 
evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or 
listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical 
habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this 
interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 
402. Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to insure that 
activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize 
the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify 
its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or 
its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal 
consultation with the Service. One or more populations of 10 of the taxa 
are located on federally owned and/or managed land: Four taxa are located 
in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the island of Hawaii and one taxon in 
Kalaupapa NHP on Molokai; six taxa are located on military lands, including 
one species on Makua Military Reservation on Oahu and five taxa on PTA on 
the island of Hawaii; two taxa are found in Hakalau Forest National 
Wildlife Refuge on the island of Hawaii; and a population of one taxon 
occurs at a U.S. Coast Guard lighthouse on Maui. Federal agencies that 
would become involved if any of their activities may affect these 21 taxa 
include the National Park Service, Department of Defense, Environmental 
Protection Agency, Fish and Wildlife Service, and the U.S. Coast Guard. 

The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 
17.62, 17.63, 17.71 and 17.72 for endangered and threatened plants set 
forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all 
endangered or threatened plant species. With respect to the 20 plant taxa 
in this rule listed as endangered, all of the prohibitions of section 
9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, apply. With respect to 
the taxon listed as threatened, the provisions of 50 CFR 17.71, apply. 
These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal with respect to any endangered 
or theatened plant for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States to import or export; transport in interstate or foreign commerce in 
the course of a commercial activity; sell or offer for sale in interstate 
or foreign commerce; remove and reduce to possession any such species from 
areas under Federal jurisdiction. For plants listed as endangered, the Act 
prohibits the malicious damage or destruction of any such species on any 
area under Federal jurisdiction; or to remove, cut, dig up, damage, or 
destroy any such species on any other area in knowing violation of any 
State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State 
criminal trespass law. Section 4(d) of the Act allows for the provision of 
such protection to threatened species through regulation. This protection 
may apply to this species in the future if regulations are promulgated. 
Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation 
agencies. Seeds from cultivated specimens of threatened plant species are 
exempt from these prohibitions provided that a statement ``of cultivated 
origin'' appears on their containers.

The Act and 50 CFR 17.62, 17.63 and 17.72 also provide for the 
issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving 
endangered or threatened plant species under certain circumstances. It is 
anticipated that few permits would ever be sought or issued. The taxa are 
not common in cultivation or in the wild, and only one taxon, 

Pritchardia 
affinis

, is known to be in an active program of cultivation. 

Requests for copies of the regulations concerning listed plants 
and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits may be addressed to the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Permits Branch, 911

National Environmental Policy Act 




The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental 
Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement, as defined under the 
authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be 
prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of 
the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the 
Service's reasons for this determination was published in the 

Federal 
Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Final Rule amends the offering circulars for United States savings bonds and savings notes; the regulations
governing savings bonds and notes; and the regulations governing activities of financial institutions and organizations
serving as savings bond issuing and paying agents, to reflect the designation of five Federal Reserve Offices as savings
bond processing sites. The changes are made to improve the efficiency of the processing of savings bond transactions.
The regulations are further amended to reflect the fact that EZ CLEAR has become the only means by which savings bond
paying agents may transmit and receive settlement for redeemed savings bonds and notes.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 As fiscal agents of the United States, Federal Reserve Banks and Branches perform a number of activities in support
of the savings bond program, including issuing, redeeming, and reissuing savings bonds and notes. In recent years,
both the Bureau of the Public Debt and Federal Reserve Offices have recognized that there would be benefits associated
with consolidating certain savings bond activities. Since 1986, several activities have been consolidated, 

e.g., 

issuing savings bonds for payroll savings plans based upon a master file data base, and maintaining savings bonds
for employee thrift plans in book-entry accounts.


The Bureau and the Federal Reserve recognized that further consolidation would reduce operating costs, improve
program management, and provide opportunities for more efficient use of technology, without any reduction in the
level of service to bondowners and financial institutions serving as savings bond agents. Therefore, a Savings Bond
Processing Study Team, composed of staff from both Public Debt and Reserve Offices, was formed to determine the optimum
number of Reserve Office sites at which savings bond processing should be performed. The Team's recommendations
formed the basis of the Bureau's decision to approve the changes in sites where consolidated savings bond processing
would be performed. A listing of the consolidated processing sites is added to each of the following sections: 31 CFR
315.1, 316.12, 330.8, 332.12, 342.9, 352.13, and 353.1, the offering circulars and governing regulations for savings
bonds and notes, and 31 CFR 317.9 and 321.25, the regulations governing the issue and redemption of savings bonds.
Federal Reserve Offices, other than those newly listed, may continue to provide some savings bond services, but their
activities will be phased out over the period prior to March 1, 1996.
Also, the regulations in 31 CFR part 317, also referred to as Department of the Treasury Circular, Public Debt Series
No. 4-67, are being further amended to indicate that issuing agents are subject to the provisions of the Privacy
Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a).

Finally, the regulations in 31 CFR part 321, also referred to as Department of the Treasury Circular No. 750, Fourth
Revision, are being further amended to reflect the fact that submission of redeemed savings securities via EZ CLEAR
has become the only means of transmitting and receiving settlement for such paid securities. The EZ CLEAR method of
paid bond processing permits savings bond paying agents to transmit and receive settlement for redeemed securities
in the same manner as for checks and other cash items. The reduction in separate processing has increased efficiency
and reduced costs for the savings bond program.


Procedural Requirements


This Final Rule does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' pursuant to Executive Order No.
12866. The regulatory review procedures, therefore, do not apply.
Because this Final Rule relates to public contracts and procedures for United States securities, the notice, public
comment, and delayed effective date provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act are inapplicable, pursuant
to 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2). As no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

) do not apply.
There are no collections of information required by this Final Rule, and, therefore, the Paperwork Reduction Act
does not apply.

securities for its own account to a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or to a Regional Check Processing Center. At the paying

or arrange to have this service performed by another financial institution. If the agent transmits securities in
mixed cash letters, it must also MICR-encode the routing/transit number assigned to the Bureau of the Public Debt's
savings bond activity in the ``R/T'' field on the face of all pre-October 1957 paper securities and those punch card
securities on which it does not already appear. The Bureau's routing/transit number is 000090007. Care should be

be transmitted in separately sorted or mixed cash letters to the Check Department of a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch,
or to a Regional Check Processing Center, either directly, or via a parent office or correspondent institution. An
agent shall transmit redeemed securities under cover of the appropriate transmittal document. Securities redeemed
in exchange for Series HH bonds must be transmitted for settlement via EZ CLEAR at the same time as the exchange application
(PD F 3253) and any additional cash needed to complete the transaction are forwarded to the Fiscal Agency Department
of the servicing Federal Reserve Bank referred to in  321.25. Securities redeemed on exchange may be commingled
with cash redemptions in mixed or separately sorted cash letters.''

Audit and adjustment

 [ 321.14] The Bureau of the Public Debt will audit all redemption data received from the Central Site as promptly
as possible. Each presenting institution will, in due course, be notified by the Bank of any adjustments required.
The Bank will adjust via a charge or credit to the presenting institution's Reserve or clearing account any amounts
previously credited to that account. 

(3) 

Requests for Adjustments. 

Depositors who discover errors in their EZ CLEAR cash letters subsequent to deposit should allow sixty (60) calendar
days from the date of their EZ CLEAR cash letter before requesting adjustments for the cash letter. This will allow
sufficient time for the Treasury to classify the savings bonds, forward adjustments to the Central Site and for the
Central Site to research and function adjustments to the depositor. 

(4) 

Separately Sorting Depositors 

should submit adjustment requests directly to the Central Site Adjustments Department in correspondence. However,
all requests for adjustments due to incorrect cash letter crediting should be directed to the servicing Federal Reserve
Bank. 

(5) 

Mixed Depositors 

should submit adjustment requests to their servicing Federal Reserve Bank. 



* * * * *



I. Paragraph 18 is revised to read as follows: 



* * * * *



18. 

Record of securities paid. 

[  321.14 and 321.24] A record of the serial number and the amount paid for each redeemed security must
be retained by the agent for one year so that settlement can be made if the security is lost in transit, and so that the
agent can process any subsequent adjustment as described in paragraph 17(e)(2) above. For that purpose, agents are
authorized to microfilm the face and back of each security they redeem. Such film records shall be kept confidential
and prints therefrom may be made only with the permission of the Bureau of the Public Debt or an appropriate Federal
Reserve Bank. 



* * * * * 



J. Paragraph 24 is amended as follows: 

A. Paragraph (a) is removed. 

B. The title and designation ``(b) EZ CLEAR transmittals. [ 321.23]'' are removed from current paragraph (b);
the beginning of the sentence is amended by removing ``by the Federal Reserve Bank'' after ``Fees will be paid''; and,
the second sentence is amended by adding ``Federal Reserve'' after ``No fees will be paid for securities received
by the''. 


K. Paragraph 25 is revised to read as follows: 



* * * * *


25. 

Claims on account of lost securities 

[ 321.24] If a security redeemed by an agent is lost, stolen, or destroyed while in the custody of the agent, or
in transit prior to settlement or audit, relief will be considered, provided the security can be identified by serial
number. [See paragraph 18 of this appendix regarding the maintenance of records of redeemed securities]. The presenting
institution should resubmit a photocopy of the security to obtain settlement in accordance with established procedures.
Questions concerning the established procedures should be referred to the servicing Federal Reserve Bank.

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On September 10, 1992, EPA exempted used oil inserted into crude oil pipelines from the part 279 used oil management
standards. EPA is today clarifying the existing pipeline exemption and expanding the exemption to other petroleum
refinery applications. Today's document clarifies that the exemption from the used oil management standards did
not intend to exclude used oil mixed with crude oil or natural gas liquids (hereinafter referred to as ``crude oil'')
in pre-pipeline units (e.g., stock tanks, production separators) prior to being introduced into the crude oil pipeline.
In addition, today's rule expands the used oil exemption to include transportation and/or storage of mixtures of
small amounts of used oil (i.e., less than 1%) and crude oil that are destined for insertion into a petroleum refining
facility process at a point prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking. 



Today's rule exempts from the part 279 standards, used oil that is inserted into the petroleum refining facility process
after distillation or catalytic cracking operations provided that the used oil meets the used oil specification
prior to insertion. 

Today's rule also exempts from the part 279 standards used oil that incidentally enters and is recovered from a refinery's
hydrocarbon recovery system or wastewater treatment system (i.e., process sewer, storm sewer, or wastewater treatment
units), if the recovered used oil is subsequently inserted into the petroleum refinery process. 

In addition, today's rule expands the definition of transfer facility to allow used oil to be held more than 24 hours
but less than 35 days prior to specified activities. 

Finally, EPA is today amending the used oil processor standards to clarify that a specific set of on-site maintenance,
filtering, and separation activities were not intended to be covered under the used oil processor standards. EPA
is also correcting errors in regulations that appeared in the May 3, 1993, 

Federal Register.

Authority



The regulations promulgated today are issued under the authority of sections 1004, 1006, 2002(a), 3014, and 7004
of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and as amended by the Used
Oil recycling Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6903, 6905, 6912(a), 6935, and 6974. 



II. Background 



A. Summary of Recent Regulatory Actions Pertaining to Used Oil 



1. Summary of May 20, 1992, 

Federal Register

 Notice 



On May 20, 1992, EPA published a final listing determination for used oils that are destined for disposal (see 57 FR
21524). The Agency determined that used oils destined for disposal did not have to be listed as a hazardous waste because
used oils do not typically and frequently meet the technical criteria for listing a waste as hazardous. EPA gave considerable
attention, in reaching its determination, to the current Federal regulations that govern the management of used
oils that are disposed, including the requirement for used oil that exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste
under subtitle C of RCRA.

The May 20, 1992, 

Federal Register

 notice also included a categorical exemption from the definition of hazardous waste in  261.4 for non-terne-plated
used oil filters that have been hot-drained to remove used oil. EPA based this exemption on data submitted to the Agency
indicating that these filters do not typically and frequently exhibit the toxicity characteristic.



2. Summary of September 10, 1992, 

Federal Register

 Notice



On September 10, 1992, EPA promulgated a final listing decision for used oils that are recycled and simultaneously
promulgated management standards for used oil, codified at 40 CFR part 279 (see 57 FR 41566). EPA determined that used
oil destined for recycling did not have to be listed as a hazardous waste because the used oil did not meet the technical
criteria for listing a waste as hazardous, particularly in light of the new management standards and other federal
requirements which control the risks posed by improper management of used oil. The standards cover used oil generators,
transporters, processors, re-refiners, off-specification burners and marketers. The standards included an exemption
from the management standards for used oil placed directly in a crude oil pipeline.



3. May 3, 1993, and June 17, 1993 Correction Notices



On May 3, 1993, EPA published technical amendments and corrections to the May 20, 1992 and September 10, 1992, 

Federal Register

 Notices (see 58 FR 26421). On June 17, 1993, EPA corrected several errors in the May 3, 1993, notice (see 58 FR 33341).



B. Summary of the 1985 Comments Regarding Used Oil Mixed With Crude Oil Destined for Refineries



On November 29, 1985, EPA proposed to list all used oil as a hazardous waste (50 FR 49248). Commenters responded that
used oil mixed with crude oil be exempt from such regulation because the small quantities of used oil mixed with crude
oil posed no threat to the environment when refined with crude oil.



C. Summary of 1991 Comments



On September 23, 1991, EPA proposed that the two exemptions from subtitle C requirements promulgated in 1985 (see
40 CFR 261.6(a)(3) (v)-(viii)) for oil-bearing hazardous waste and fuels derived from these wastes, also apply
to used oils. (56 FR 48026, 48042) EPA proposed exemptions from the used oil management requirements (whether or not
EPA ultimately listed used oil as a hazardous waste) for: (1) Used oils that are reinserted as feedstocks at primary
petroleum refineries; and (2) fuels derived from those used oils.

Commenters (mainly the primary petroleum refining industry) stated that if EPA chose to list used oil as hazardous
waste, the Agency should exempt used oil that is reintroduced into the refinery process from hazardous waste or used
oil management standards requirements. Commenters further stated that if EPA did not adopt this exemption, the entire
refinery process could be subject to hazardous waste management requirements, including permits. Commenters stated
that this would be unwarranted because the reintroduction of used oil into the refining process contributes only
insignificant concentrations of metals to the crude oil or finished petroleum product. Other commenters stated
that refiners that handle used oil should be subject to the same requirements for used oil management as are used oil
re-refiners.

Commenters from the primary petroleum refining industry also stated that EPA should not limit the exemption to those
instances where used oil is inserted before fluid catalytic cracking or distillation, since other conversion and
distillation processes in the refinery would also remove, alter or immobilize impurities in the oil. They asserted
that limiting the point of insertion could foreclose the future development of used oil recycling activities. These
commenters also stated that limiting the insertion point could preclude refineries from accepting DIY oil. Commenters
asserted that DIY oil might have to undergo certain pre-processing at refineries prior to its insertion into the refining
process. They also asserted that under the proposed exemption, this pre-processing would not be exempt and would
be a hazardous waste activity. Commenters stated that these activities are part of the refining process.

Commenters from the primary petroleum industry further stated that EPA should extend the exemption to apply to used
oil inserted into the pipeline at marketing, E&P and pipeline facilities for use in the refinery process. They
asserted that used oil recovered from oil and gas exploration and production is placed in pipelines and trucks and
returned to the refinery from other petroleum facilities. Commenters stated that the recovered oils are useful,
valuable raw materials that are reintroduced into the crude stream for their economic value.



III. Analysis of New Part 279 Provisions



On September 10, 1992, EPA promulgated a final listing decision for used oils that are recycled and simultaneously
promulgated standards in 40 CFR part 279 for the management of used oil under RCRA section 3014. Under  279.10(g)
of part 279, EPA granted an exemption for used oils introduced directly into crude oil pipelines from part 279 standards
at the point at which they are introduced. EPA did not address the proposed exemptions for used oil inserted into the
petroleum refining facility process either prior to or after crude distillation or catalytic cracking.

The American Petroleum Institute filed a petition for review of the September 10, 1992, rule, on December 8, 1992,
raising the issue that EPA had not addressed the proposed exemptions for petroleum refining, production, and transportation
in the September 10, 1992, final rule. Today's rule responds to comments and addresses outstanding issues related
to used oil and petroleum refining facility processes. 



A. Summary of Comments From Interested Parties 



Today's rule was distributed in draft form for comment to the litigants and intervenors concerning the 1992 rule,
and other concerned members of the regulated community, States, and environmental groups. The primary substantive
comments received on the draft and EPA's responses to those comments are summarized below. 

EPA received several comments from the petroleum industry on the exemption from part 279 for storage and transportation
of mixtures of used oil and crude oil that contain less than 1% used oil and are destined for insertion into petroleum
refining process. These commenters objected primarily to provisions in the draft final rule limiting the exemption
to mixtures that contain less than 1% used oil. The commenters also objected to limiting the amount of used oil that
can be directly inserted into the petroleum refining process to 1% of the crude oil process unit throughput at any given
time. EPA has retained the 1% limit in both cases in today's final rule for reasons discussed in section III.B.2 of this
preamble. 

EPA received comments from used oil re-refiners (i.e., ``secondary'' petroleum industry_a type of used oil processor)
regarding the regulatory status of petroleum refineries that receive used oil from off-site and store the used oil
on-site before mixing it with crude oil. The draft rule proposed to regulate petroleum refining facilities as used
oil transfer facilities in these circumstances. Commenters stated, however, that petroleum refiners that receive
used oil from off-site pose the same potential concerns from receipt of adulterated used oil and improper storage
of used oil as re-refiners and should therefore be subject to the requirements for used oil processor/re-refiners
prior to mixing. EPA agrees and has revised the draft rule accordingly. These changes are discussed in greater detail
below. 

EPA also received numerous comments on provisions clarifying what constitutes a used oil processor. Provisions
contained in the draft document would have prohibited both on- and off-site burning of used oil generated from specified
activities that EPA is today clarifying are not subject to the used oil processor standards. Commenters stated that
the used oil generated from these activities would be suitable for burning in accordance with the part 279, subpart
G standards and that burning should not be further restricted. In response to these comments, EPA has decided to allow
on-site burning of the used oil generated from these activities but has retained the prohibition against off-site
burning. The basis for this decision is discussed in section III.C of today's preamble. 



B. Section 279.1_Definition of Petroleum Refining Facility 



Today's rule establishes a regulatory definition for ``petroleum refining facility.'' EPA believes it is necessary
to define this term in order to provide a clear distinction between what the Agency considers to be and regulates as
primary petroleum refining facilities and facilities that EPA considers to be used oil re-refiners for regulatory
purposes. Under today's rule, ``petroleum refining facility'' is defined as follows:




``Petroleum refining facility'' means an establishment primarily engaged in producing gasoline, kerosine, distillate
fuel oils, residual fuel oils, and lubricants, through fractionation, straight distillation of crude oil, redistillation
of unfinished petroleum derivatives, cracking or other processes (i.e., facilities classified as SIC 2911). 




A used oil re-refiner, in contrast, is a facility that processes used oil to produce lube base stocks and greases, industrial
fuels, asphalt extenders, diesel like fuels, and other products. 

EPA is aware that petroleum refiners and used oil re-refiners employ similar production processes and produce similar
products. Consequently, the Agency has avoided defining these facilities in terms of the process steps employed
to produce a finished product or the type of products produced. As defined by today's rule, petroleum refining facilities
and used oil re-refining facilities differ primarily in the material that constitutes the primary initial feed to
the process. In order for a facility to be considered a petroleum refining facility, the material fed to the front end
of the refining process must be comprised primarily of crude oil. In order to be considered a used oil re-refiner, the
material entering the front end of the process must be comprised primarily of used oil.

C. Section 279.10(g)_Used Oil Introduced Into Crude Oil Pipelines or Petroleum Refining Facilities 



1. Section 279.10(g)(1)_Used Oil Introduced Into Crude Oil Pipelines 



The September 10, 1992, final used oil regulations provided an exemption at  279.10(g) from management standards
for used oil that is placed directly into a crude oil pipeline (see 57 FR 41613). Today's rule replaces  279.10(g)
with  279.10(g)(1) which clarifies the original intent of the pipeline exemption. Section 279.10(g) of the
September 10, 1992, final rule provided that ``Used oil that is placed directly into a crude oil, oil or natural gas
pipeline is subject to the management standards of [part 279] only prior to the point of introduction into the pipeline.
Once the used oil is introduced to the pipeline, the material is exempt from the requirements of [part 279].'' 

EPA is concerned that the phrase, ``placed directly into a crude oil or natural gas pipeline,'' can be literally interpreted
to apply more narrowly than the Agency had intended. EPA understands that it is standard practice to first mix small
amounts of used oil, typically less than 1%, with crude oil in stock tanks, production separators or other tank units
that are connected via pipeline to the petroleum refining facility (i.e., pre-pipeline units). It was not EPA's intent
to exclude used oil that is mixed with crude oil in these pre-pipeline units from the  279.10(g) pipeline exemption.
Rather, EPA intended to include this practice within the meaning of ``direct insertion.'' Because used oil is typically
inserted into the petroleum pipeline through these pre-pipeline units, to exclude these units from the pipeline
exemption would effectively render the exemption meaningless. Clearly this was not EPA's intent. Today's rule revises
the language of the exemption to clarify that used oil may be inserted into the pipeline via pre-pipeline units (which
contain crude oil) exempt from the requirements of part 279. It should be noted here that the  279.10(g)(1) pipeline
exemption established by today's rule is limited to pipelines that convey crude oil from off-site locations to the
petroleum refining facility. The exemption does not apply to pipelines that convey crude oil from one on-site location
within a petroleum refinery to another. If such on-site piping contains used oil, it is exempt only if it qualifies
under   279.10(g)(2)-(5) discussed below. Also, if processing of the used oil is performed prior
to mixing with crude oil in these pre-pipeline units, such processing remains subject to the part 279, subpart F standards
for used oil processors and re-refiners. Used oil that is generated and stored at the pipeline is subject to the used
oil generator standards prior to mixing with crude oil. Used oil that is transported to the pipeline and immediately
mixed with crude oil or stored for less than 24 hours prior to such mixing is subject to all Subpart E transporter standards
except for  279.45 which applies to transfer facilities. Used oil that is transported to and subsequently stored
at the pipeline for more than 24 hours and less than 35 days prior to mixing with crude oil is subject to all the part 279,
subpart E transporter/transfer facility requirements. 



2. Section 279.10(g)(2)_Storage and Transportation of Mixtures of Used Oil and Crude Oil 



Section 279.10(g)(2) of today's rule expands the used oil management standard exemption to include: (1) Mixtures
of used oil and crude oil containing less than 1% used oil that are being stored at the petroleum refining facility or
in discrete units remotely located from the pipeline, as long as the mixture is destined for the refinery and inserted
prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking; and (2) mixtures of used oil and crude oil containing less than
1% used oil that are being transported (via truck, rail, or vessel) to the petroleum refinery or the pipeline for insertion
into the petroleum refining process prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking. The former exemption provided
at  279.10(g) did not apply either to mixtures of used oil and crude oil that are stored at the petroleum refinery
or in remotely located units, or to the transportation of mixtures of used oil and crude oil. The previous, more narrow
exemption was based on the assumption that used oil was placed directly into the pipeline (or into units directly connected
to the pipeline as previously discussed). EPA assumed that the mixing of used oil and crude oil occurred at the point
at which used oil was inserted into the pipeline. EPA has since learned, however, that mixing frequently occurs at
exploration and production sites that are remotely located from the pipeline or the petroleum refinery.

For example, used oil generated during on- and off-shore drilling activities (e.g. from compressors, trucks and
other heavy equipment) is routinely mixed with crude oil in units (e.g. production separators, seagoing vessels,
stock tanks, etc.) located at the exploration and production site and then transported, as a mixture, to the pipeline
or petroleum refining facility. Depending on the location of the drilling activities, the mixture of used oil and
crude oil may need to be transported (by vessel, truck, rail, etc.) to a separate location for introduction into the
pipeline or the petroleum refining facility. In the case of off-shore drilling sites for example, conveyance of the
mixture may involve multiple modes of transportation (i.e., from the off-shore platform to land by vessel or pipeline
and then to the crude oil pipeline by land-based transport). Today's exemption covers all modes of transportation
of mixtures of used oil and crude or natural gas liquids, as long as the mixture contains less than 1% used oil and is destined
for insertion into a petroleum refining facility process at a point prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking.
In addition, today's exemption covers storage of mixtures of used oil and crude oil, provided that the mixture contains
less than 1% used oil and is inserted into a petroleum refining facility process prior to crude distillation or catalytic
cracking. 

Used oil that is generated at exploration and production sites continues to be subject to used oil generator standards
prior to being mixed with crude oil such that it is exempt under today's rule. Used oil that is generated off-site and
transported to or stored at an exploration and production site is subject to the transporter and transfer facility
standards, as applicable, up until the point at which the used oil is mixed with crude oil such that it is exempt under
 279.10(g)(2). 

EPA is exempting mixtures of used oil and crude oil held in discrete units at a refinery or at remote locations because
the Agency understands that the amount of used oil contained in these mixtures is extremely small relative to the large
quantities of crude oil. In developing today's rule, EPA held numerous discussions with petroleum refinery industry
representatives regarding the maximum amount of used oil contained in mixtures of used oil and crude oil that are destined
for insertion into a petroleum refining process prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking. Industry representatives
repeatedly informed the Agency that used oil constitutes less than 1% of these mixtures. In gathering information
for today's rule, EPA held conference calls with representatives from a number of petroleum refining companies (e.g.,
Mobil Oil Corporation and Phillips Petroleum Inc.,). The Agency also conducted several site visits, including visits
to an Amoco refinery in Whiting, Indiana and a Mobil Oil Corporation refinery in Paulsboro, New Jersey. In each case,
EPA was informed that used oil does not currently, and will not comprise greater than 1% of the crude oil/used oil mixture
because of the sheer volumes of crude oil that are continuously being produced and processed relative to the amount
of used oil that is generated at production sites or refineries. This recent information is consistent with comments
submitted in response to the 1985 Used Oil Proposed Rule in which Exxon Company, USA stated that the average percentage
of used oil in refinery feed stock streams is less than 0.02% and Texaco, Inc., indicated that used oil would constitute
no more than 0.01% of the refinery input. 

EPA does not believe it is necessary to apply the used oil management standards to the less than 1% fraction of used oil
that is being held temporarily in discrete units or transported from those units to the pipeline or the petroleum refinery
for recycling as part of a mixture that is composed overwhelmingly of crude oil. In essence, because of the high ratio
of crude oil to used oil, EPA considers the mixture to be equivalent to crude oil for regulatory purposes. EPA's part
279 standards were designed to control those particular risks associated with the management of used oil (e.g., uncontrolled
burning, improper storage practices by used oil handlers) pursuant to section 3014 of RCRA. 

The reason for EPA's imposition of a 1% limit on the amount of used oil contained in mixtures of used oil and crude oil
being stored or transported to a crude oil pipeline or petroleum refinery prior to insertion into the refining process
is that, while we have determined that the small amounts of used oil that are being added to crude oil under current practices
pose no incremental risk over normal crude oil, we have not evaluated whether larger amounts of used oil also pose no
incremental risk. Given the information provided to EPA by the petroleum refining industry regarding the inherent
limitations on the amount of used oil that is or should be contained in mixtures of used oil and crude oil (i.e., less
than 1%), and given that EPA has received no information, either recently, or in response to previous rulemakings
that provides basis for an alternative limit, the Agency sees no point in imposing a higher cap. Imposition of a higher
cap could have the effect of encouraging mixing of used oil with crude oil that would not otherwise occur during the
normal course of petroleum refining operations. Such an incentive might lead to increased incremental risk from
management of large amounts of used oil, exempt from the part 279 standards, at petroleum refineries. EPA also concluded
that a less precise limit (i.e., ``

de minimis

'' or ``small amounts''), as was suggested by some commenters from the petroleum refining industry, would needlessly
cause uncertainty, given that EPA was told repeatedly that amounts currently introduced are far less than 1%.

3. Section 279.10(g)(3)_Used Oil Inserted Into the Petroleum Refining Process Without Prior Mixing and Mixtures
of Greater Than One Percent Used Oil 



As previously stated, under today's rule, mixtures of used oil and crude oil containing less than 1% used oil that are
transported to or stored at a petroleum refinery, and are introduced prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking,
are exempt from part 279 standards under  279.10(g)(2). It is EPA's understanding, based on information received
from petroleum industry representatives, that used oil can potentially be inserted directly into the petroleum
refining process prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking without either: (1) Mixing the used oil with crude
oil feedstocks, or (2) pre-processing of the used oil to ensure that any contaminants in the used oil will not interfere
with the refining process (e.g., contaminants fouling a catalyst, etc.). Based on this understanding, today's exemption
also applies to used oil that is introduced directly into the petroleum refining process at a point prior to crude distillation
or catalytic cracking as long as the used oil comprises less than 1% of the crude oil feed to a petroleum refining facility
process unit at any given time. Again, because of the high ratio of crude oil to used oil, EPA considers these mixtures
to be equivalent to crude oil for regulatory purposes. Therefore, the Agency believes that this activity would pose
no significant increase in risk. 

Used oil that is inserted directly into the petroleum refining process (at a volume of less than 1% of the crude oil process
unit feed at any given time) is considered mixed, and therefore exempt from part 279, at the point at which it enters
the process. This exemption applies both to used oil generated at the petroleum refining facility where the used oil
is being inserted, and to used oil generated off-site that is collected and transported to the petroleum refining
facility for insertion into the refining process prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking. 

Used oil that is inserted into the petroleum refining process without first being mixed with crude oil feedstocks
(e.g. in crude oil stock tanks) is subject to part 279 standards prior to insertion. Used oil that is generated on-site
and then stored without prior mixing and used oil generated on-site that constitutes greater than 1% of a mixture of
used and crude oil continues to be subject to the part 279, subpart C standards for generators. With the exception of
used oil that is exempt from the part 279 standards because it constitutes less than 1% of a mixture of used oil and crude
oil, used oil that is generated off-site and then transported to or stored at a petroleum refining facility, continues
to be subject to the applicable part 279 requirements i.e., to the requirements for used oil transporters and transfer
facilities while being transported and to the requirements for used oil processors upon receipt at the petroleum
refining facility. Petroleum refining facilities that receive used oil from off-site for direct insertion into
the petroleum refining process are subject to the used oil processor standards from the point at which they receive
the used oil up until the point at which the used oil is inserted into the petroleum refining process. Finally, it is
important to reiterate that the exemptions provided under both   279.10(g)(2) and 279.10(g)(3) of today's
rule apply at the point of mixing and only to mixtures that contain less than 1% of used oil. 

Although petroleum industry representatives have raised concerns that a 1% limit on the amount of used oil that can
be inserted directly into the petroleum refining process may be technology limiting, EPA has not received any information
that would support this position, nor has the Agency received information to support an alternative level. The Agency
believes that by limiting the amount of used oil that can be introduced directly into the refining process exempt from
the used oil processing standards, it can better ensure against mixing only to avoid compliance with the part 279 processing
standards. If information becomes available that the 1% limit is inhibiting used oil recycling, the Agency will consider
whether any change to the rules is necessary. 

In the draft rule, EPA proposed to regulate petroleum refining facilities that receive used oil from off-site as used
oil transfer facilities prior to mixing. However, EPA agrees with comments on the draft rule that petroleum refining
facilities that receive used oil from off-site pose the same potential concerns associated with receipt of adulterated
used oil and improper storage of used oil as used oil re-refiners. Petroleum refining facilities that receive used
oil from off-site may not have adequate information to ensure that the used oil has not not been improperly mixed with
listed hazardous waste. Also, the volumes of used oil that may be managed require adequate planning for dealing with
emergency releases. EPA has therefore revised the final rule to provide that petroleum refining facilities that
receive and store used oil from off-site are subject to the used oil processor standards prior to mixing. The principal
effect of this change is that petroleum refiners that receive used oil from off-site must prepare a waste analysis
plan to ensure that the used oil has not been mixed with hazardous waste and must maintain an operating record to document
compliance with the waste analysis plan. In addition, such refineries will have to adopt or amend emergency contingency
plans to address used oil in accordance with  279.52 of the used oil management standards. 



4. Section 279.10(g)(4)_Used Oil Inserted Into the Petroleum Refining Process After Crude Distillation or Catalytic
Cracking

<DOC>

Under  279.10(g)(4) of today's rule, used oil that is inserted into the petroleum refining process after crude
distillation or catalytic cracking is exempt from the part 279 standards provided that the used oil meets the used
oil specification prior to insertion. Used oil remains subject to part 279 standards up until its actual insertion
into the petroleum refining process. As previously discussed, used oil generated on-site must be stored according
to part 279, subpart C standards for used oil generators. Used oil generated off-site must be transported according
to the part 279, subpart E standards for transporters and transfer facilities and stored according to the part 279,
subpart F standards for used oil processor/re-refiners. 

EPA's use of the terms ``before'' and ``after'' crude distillation or catalytic cracking is intended to distinguish
between the initial part of the petroleum refining process where crude oil is the primary feedstock and is refined
by undergoing crude distillation or catalytic cracking and the latter part of the petroleum refining process where
crude oil residuals constitute the primary feed, and coke and asphalt are the primary products. Refinery processes
that occur after crude distillation or catalytic cracking do not provide refining to the same extent as that which
occurs as a result of crude distillation or catalytic cracking. Crude distillation or catalytic cracking is expressly
designed to remove, alter, or otherwise immobilize contaminants in the normal course of the refining process. EPA
has insufficient information on post-crude distillation or catalytic cracking units identified by commenters
(e.g., asphalt towers, petroleum cokers), and is concerned about the possible environmental effects (e.g., air
emissions, transfer of inorganics to asphalt or petroleum coke) of placing large amounts of off-specification used
oil into the petroleum refining process without passing through the crude distillation or catalytic cracking units.
In contrast, on-specification used oil may be burned in the same manner as virgin petroleum fuel in other situations,
therefore it makes little sense to restrict its use as a feedstock to the petroleum coker (or in any other process ``after''
crude distillation or catalytic cracking). 

It should be noted that if off-specification used oil is inserted into petroleum refining processes after crude distillation
or catalytic cracking (e.g., a coker), the facility would be subject to the used oil processing requirements in part
279, subpart F. In addition, petroleum refining facilities that wish to insert on-specification used oil into the
refining process after crude distillation or catalytic cracking and that are the first to claim that the used oil is
on-specification (whether generated at the refinery, or at an off-site location), would be defined as marketers
subject to the requirements for used oil marketers found in part 279, subpart H.

5. Section 279.10(g)(5)_Used Oil Captured by the Refinery's Hydrocarbon Recovery System or Wastewater Treatment
System and Inserted Into Petroleum Refining Process 



Section 279.10(g)(5) of today's rule exempts from the part 279 standards used oil that incidentally enters and is
recovered from a petroleum refining facility's hydrocarbon recovery system or its wastewater treatment system
(e.g., process sewer, storm sewer, or wastewater treatment units), if the recovered used oil is subsequently inserted
into the petroleum refining process. Oil (that may contain small amounts of used oil) that has been recovered from
a refining facility's hydrocarbon recovery or wastewater treatment system is typically used as a feedstock in petroleum
refining to produce more petroleum products. EPA understands that used oil, generated from routine refinery process
operations and that incidentally enters a refinery's recovery or wastewater treatment system (e.g., drips, leaks,
and spills from compressors, valves, and pumps), represents a small portion of the total oil that enters (and is then
recovered from) the recovery or wastewater treatment system. Thus, the oil recovered from the system is more properly
characterized as crude feedstock than used oil. Provided the used oil is inserted into the petroleum refining process,
EPA believes that regulation under part 279 standards is unwarranted. This exemption from the part 279 standards
does not extend to used oil which is intentionally introduced into a petroleum refinery's recovery or wastewater
treatment system (e.g., pouring collected used oil into any part of the hydrocarbon recovery system, storm or process
sewer system or into wastewater treatment units). Used oil may not be introduced to the refinery's hydrocarbon recovery
or wastewater treatment system as a way to avoid meeting the conditions specified in  279.10(g)(4). 

For the purposes of the exemption in today's rule, the examples cited in the existing 

de minimis

 wastewater exclusion ( 279.10(f)) provide guidance on what types of releases to a refinery's hydrocarbon
recovery or wastewater treatment system would be considered ``routine'' or ``incidental''. The exemption is intended
to cover losses from drippage, minor spillage, etc., that cannot be reasonably avoided. For example, used oil that
has been collected from equipment or vehicle maintenance activities and intentionally introduced into a refinery's
wastewater treatment system would not be exempt under  279.1(g)(5) from the part 279 standards once recovered.
Similarly, used oil that is generated off-site and is brought to the refinery may not be added to any portion of the refinery's
wastewater treatment system (i.e., process sewer, storm sewer, or wastewater treatment units), and still be exempt
under  279.10(g)(5) once recovered; such oil is clearly not ``incidentally captured'' by the refinery's wastewater
treatment system. In fact, unless specifically exempted under  279.10(g)(2) or  279.10(g)(3) of today's
rule, this type of activity would meet the definition of used oil processing under the existing used oil management
standards (see 40 CFR 279.1). 

Today's rule does not preclude intentional introduction of used oil in to the facility's recovered oil tanks. EPA
is aware that used oil from both on- and off-site is often added directly to the petroleum refining facility's recovered
oil tanks. Mixtures of used oil and recovered oil that contain greater than 1% used oil are regulated as used oil. Mixtures
of used oil and recovered oil that contain less than 1% used oil and are inserted into the petroleum refining process
prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking are exempt from the part 279 used oil management standards under
 279.10(g)(2). Mixtures of used oil and recovered oil that contain less than 1% used oil and are inserted into
the petroleum refining process after crude distillation or catalytic cracking are exempt from the part 279 standards
(under  279.10(g)(4)) only if the used oil meets the used oil specification prior to mixing with recovered oil.




6. Section 279.10(g)(6)_Stock Tank Bottoms 



Section 279.10(g)(6) of today's rule exempts tank bottoms from stock tanks containing exempt mixtures of used oil
and crude oil from the part 279 standards. Like the actual mixtures of used oil and crude oil, the bottoms from these
mixtures are expected to contain insignificant amounts of used oil. Therefore, the Agency does not believe that the
bottoms from tanks (or other units) containing mixtures of used oil and crude oil should be subject to the used oil management
standards. The tank bottoms are subject to all other applicable requirements, i.e., the  262.11 requirement
to determine if they are hazardous waste. 



D. Used Oil Transportation 



Section 279.1_Definition of Transfer Facility 



Today's rule revises the definition of transfer facility to allow used oil to be held at a location (i.e., a transfer
facility) temporarily prior to activities that are not subject to the processor standards as a result of today's rulemaking.
In the September 10, 1992 final rule, a transfer facility was defined as a transportation-related facility where
shipments of used oil are held for more than 24 hours but less than 35 days during the normal course of transportation.
Today's rule expands that definition to allow used oil to be held for more than 24 hours but less than 35 days during the
normal course of transportation or prior to an activity performed pursuant to  279.20(b)(2). Under the amended
definition, as discussed below in section F of this preamble, a site to which used oil from oil-bearing electrical
transformers is transported for filtering prior to reuse would be considered a transfer facility under today's definition.

E. Section 279.20(b)(2)(ii)_Used Oil Processing by Generators and Transfer Facilities 



Since the promulgation of the September 10, 1992, Used Oil Management Standards, a number of parties have raised concerns
regarding the definition of used oil processor and the types of activities that are covered by that definition. The
commenters are concerned that a broad construction of the term processor inappropriately includes a number of very
basic on-site generator activities that the Agency did not intend to regulate under the used oil processor standards
(e.g. reconditioning/maintenance to extend the life of used oil, separation of used oil from wastewater discharge,
etc.). EPA agrees that activities such as these, when performed by the generator, were not intended to be covered under
the used oil processor standards because used oil processing is not their primary purpose, as explained below in greater
detail. In fact, too broad an interpretation of the processor definition may discourage environmentally beneficial
recycling and waste minimization activities by imposing an unwarranted regulatory burden on owners and operators
that EPA did not intend to regulate as used oil processors. 

Therefore, today's rule revises the used oil management regulations to clarify the Agency's intent regarding the
definition of a used oil processor by specifying those on-site maintenance, filtering, and separation activities
that are not, and were not intended to be subject to the used oil processing standards. Under today's rule, generators
 who only handle used oil in a manner specified under  279.20(b)(2)(ii) are not processors provided that the
used oil is generated on-site and is not being sent directly off-site to a burner of on- or off-specification used oil
fuel. (Section 279.20(b)(2)(ii) also applies to collection centers and aggregation points since these entities
are regulated as generators.)





Activities that EPA did not intend to include under the definition of used oil processor are described below. EPA does
not believe that the activities identified in  279.20(b)(2)(ii) should be subject to the used oil processor
standards because used oil processing is not the primary purpose of these activities i.e., the primary purpose of
these activities is not to produce from used oil or to make it more amenable for the production of used oil derived products,
and the Agency does not expect these limited activities will pose the same kinds of environmental problems that may
occur at processor facilities. Instead, in these cases, the act of mixing, filtering, separating, draining etc.,
used oil by the generator constitutes a basic step that is incidental or ancillary to a primary activity which is distinct
from used oil processing. It is important to note, however, that owners or operators who generate used oil as a result
of any of the activities specified in  279.20(b)(2)(ii) are considered used oil generators and are subject
to the generator standards in subpart C. 


EPA is allowing on-site but not off-site burning of used oil generated from designated on-site activities because
the Agency believes that this approach best enables EPA to strike a reasonable balance between encouraging beneficial
on-site reuse and recycling activities that should pose very limited risks, on one hand, and ensuring that activities
undertaken primarily to make used oil more amenable for burning (i.e., used oil processing) are adequately controlled
under the more stringent used oil processing standards. 

The definition of a used oil processor is based on the purpose for which used oil is being filtered, separated, or otherwise
reconditioned (i.e., whether the activity is designed to produce used oil derived products or to make used oil more
amenable for the production of used oil derived products). The Agency is concerned that in situations where used oil
is being filtered, separated or otherwise reconditioned and then sent to off-site burners, the purpose of the activity
may prove difficult to discern and that consequently,  279.20(b)(2)(ii) provisions may be used as a means to
avoid compliance with the used oil processor standards (i.e., by persons who claim not to be used oil processors under
the  279.20(b)(2)(ii) provisions but whose primary purpose is to make the used oil more suitable for burning).
Therefore, EPA believes it is necessary to adopt an objective measure of the purpose of the activity. The Agency believes
that a prohibition against sending used oil generated from specified on-site activities to off-site burners provides
the most practical and effective way to ensure that activities undertaken only to make used oil more amenable for burning
are subject to the used oil processor standards. 



1. Definition of Used Oil Processor 





(A) Reconditioning used oil before returning it for reuse by the generator. 

Under today's rule facility owners or operators who clean, separate, or otherwise recondition used oil generated
on-site and then reuse it are not considered used oil processors, provided that the reconditioned used oil is being
reused by the owner or operator who generated it. Examples of activities covered under this category include filtering
of metalworking fluids for reuse, and filtering and then replacing oil from oil-bearing transformers and turbines
during routine maintenance.

Most manufacturing facilities have in place central filtration systems designed to remove contaminants from and
extend the life of water-soluble metal working fluids (e.g., lubricants and coolants), used in machining, grinding,
and boring equipment. These filtration systems are on-site systems that filter chips, metal fines, dirt, water,
and other contaminants from cutting fluids, drawing lubricants and coolants used in machining operations. The filtration
of these extraneous materials is designed to extend the life of the reusable coolants and lubricants and is incidental
to the production process. Today's rule clarifies that this type of filtration activity is not subject to the used
oil processing standards when the generator reuses the filtered oil. 

Similarly, during regularly scheduled maintenance of oil-bearing transformers and turbines, the oil in the electrical
equipment is removed so that repairs/maintenance can be performed. In some instances, the oil is filtered prior to
replacement. The filtering of the used oil is done to extend the life of the used oil, not because the oil is no longer
useful, and is therefore ancillary to the equipment repair and maintenance. While, under today's rule, the owner
or operator would not be considered a processor in these cases, the draining of the used oil from the transformer constitutes
generation of used oil so that the facility would be considered a used oil generator. 


The Agency is aware that not all used transformer oil is drained and filtered in the field. Instead, the oil-bearing
electrical equipment may be transported to a central location where the oil is removed, filtered, and replaced. Or,
the used oil may be removed from the transformers or turbines in the field and then transported separately in a tanker
truck to a central location where it is filtered and put back into electrical equipment. Under today's rule, in cases
where electrical equipment containing used oil is transported to a central location, the transporter of the oil bearing
electrical equipment would not be considered a used oil transporter. However, the owner or operator would become
a generator at the point at which the used oil is drained from the equipment (i.e., at the site where the oil is drained
and filtered). 

In cases where the used oil is removed from the transformers or turbines in the field and then transported separately
in a tanker truck to a central location for filtering prior to replacement into electrical equipment, the owner or
operator would become a generator in the field (i.e., at the point at which the used oil is drained). The person who then
transports the used oil would also be considered a used oil transporter subject to the transporter standards. In these
cases, the location at which the used oil is filtered would be considered a used oil transfer facility subject to the
transfer facility standards in  279.45, provided that the used oil is stored at the site for more than 24 hours
and less than 35 days. If the used oil is filtered within 24 hours of being drained (i.e., during transport) only the
part 279 standards for used oil transporters would apply. This filtering activity should not raise the kind of environmental
concerns that would be present at used oil processors; essentially, the filtering is incidental to the transportation
and storage and should not change a facility's regulatory status. As discussed in more detail below, today's rule
provides that transporters of used oil that is removed from electrical transformers and turbines and filtered by
the transporter or at a transfer facility prior to being returned to the same use are not subject to the processor or
re-refiner requirements in subpart F. In accordance with  279.10(e), once the used oil has been reclaimed to
the point where it is ready for reuse without further processing, it is not subject to regulation as used oil. 


(B) 

Separating used oil from wastewater to make wastewater acceptable for discharge or reuse.

 Today's rule clarifies that oil/water separation activities designed to make wastewater acceptable for discharge
or reuse are not subject to the used oil processor standards. Facilities often use oil/water separators to remove
oil (which may contain used oil) from oil/water mixtures collected from the facility's storm sewer, process sewer,
sumps and other wastewater containment areas. These separation systems use chemical and physical methods to break
the oil/water emulsion and recover oil from the wastewater in order to make the wastewater or storm water acceptable
for discharge or reuse in compliance with local, state and federal regulations. 


This type of pretreatment of wastewater containing oil is designed primarily to ensure that the wastewater meets
established limits for water discharge to streams and POTWs, and not to produce used oil derived products or to make
used oil more amenable for the production of used oil derived products. This type of oil/water separation activity
is therefore not subject to the used oil processor standards as clarified under today's rule. It should be noted, however,
that any used oil recovered from separator units would be subject to the used oil generator standards. It is also important
to note that this provision applies only to used oil that is generated on-site. The provision would apply, for example,
to simple oil water separation activities conducted (for purposes of wastewater discharge) by a used oil processor
on wastewater which has been generated by that processor. However, persons who perform oil/water separation activities
on oily wastewater received from off-site would be considered used oil processors.

(C) Using oil mist collectors to remove droplets of used oil from in-plant air to make plant air suitable for continued
recirculation. 

As clarified under today's rule, the act of removing used oil from ambient air in the workplace is not subject to the
used oil processor standards. At manufacturing facilities, droplets of used oil from machining operations are often
dispersed into in-plant air. Oil mist collectors physically remove the small droplets of oil present in the ambient
air. This activity is not subject to the used oil processing standards because it is intended primarily to make plant
air suitable for continued recirculation and not to produce products from used oil or to make it more amenable for the
production of used oil derived products. However, the oil removed from oil mist collectors is subject to the used oil
generator standards. 




(D) Removing used oil from materials containing or otherwise contaminated with used oil in order to remove excessive
oil.

 
Under  279.10(c) of the used oil standards, materials containing or otherwise contaminated with used oil from
which the used oil has been properly drained or removed to the extent possible such that no visible signs of free-flowing
oil remain in or on the material are not used oil except when burned for energy recovery. Today's rule clarifies that
the Agency does not consider the removal of used oil from materials containing or contaminated with used oil in order
to remove excess oil in accordance with  279.10(c) to be used oil processing. The production of used oil derived
products is clearly not the primary reason for removing used oil from materials containing or contaminated with used
oil. Instead, the activity is conducted primarily to clean the materials (e.g., machine tools, scrap metal, etc.)
prior to reuse, recycling, or disposal and is therefore not subject to the used oil processing standards as clarified
by today's rule. However, in removing the used oil from the materials, the owner or operator becomes a used oil generator
subject to the Subpart C used oil generator standards. 




(E) Filtering, separating, or otherwise reconditioning used oil before burning it in a space heater.

 Under  279.23 of the used oil standards, used oil may be burned in a used oil-fired space heater under specified
conditions, and provided that the space heater burns only used oil that the owner or operator generates and/or used
oil obtained from household DIY oil changers. Prior to burning, the used oil must often be filtered to remove impurities.
Today's rule clarifies that filtering of used oil for the purpose of removing contaminants prior to burning the used
oil in a space heater is not considered processing of used oil.

EPA provided a regulatory exemption from the used oil burning standards for generators who burn used oil in on-site
space heaters (in accordance with  279.23) because the Agency believes that burning of small amounts of used
oil in space heaters poses insignificant risks due to the small volume of used oil burned (see 50 FR 49194, Nov. 29, 1985).
The Agency believes that, because of the small volumes of used oil involved, filtering, separating, or otherwise
reconditioning used oil that is generated on-site prior to burning it in a space heater would also not pose significant
risk. Therefore, although the purpose of the filtering activity in this case is to make the used oil more amenable for
burning, because of the small amounts of used oil being filtered for this purpose, the Agency does not believe that
imposition of the used oil processor standards is warranted. EPA is therefore adding a regulatory clarification
( 279.20(b)(2)(ii)(F)) that the used oil processor standards do not apply to filtering of used oil prior to
burning it in a space heater, provided that the used oil is generated on-site or obtained from households or ``do-it-yourself''
oil changes. 



F. Section 279.41_Restrictions on transporters who are not also processors or re-refiners and changes to the definition
of transfer facility. 

Today's rule amends  279.41 to provide that transporters of used oil that is removed from oil-bearing transformers
and turbines and filtered by a transporter or at a transfer facility before being returned to its original use are not
subject to the used oil processor and re-refiner requirements. As previously discussed, during routine maintenance
of oil-bearing transformers and turbines (or similar equipment), the oil in the electrical equipment is removed
so that repairs/ maintenance can be performed. In some cases, the used oil is removed from the transformers or turbines
in the field and then transported separately in a tanker truck (subject to the used oil transporter standards) to a
central location where it is filtered and put back into electrical equipment. As discussed above, under today's rule
the filtering of the used oil would not be considered used oil processing provided that the filtered oil is reused in
the same or similar manner. And, in these cases (i.e., where the used oil is removed from the equipment and transported
to a separate location for filtering), the location at which the oil is filtered would be considered a transfer facility
provided that the used oil is stored for more than 24 hours and less than 35 days. If, as sometimes occurs, the used oil
is filtered within 24 hours of being stored at the central location (i.e., during transport) the only applicable standards
would be the part 279 standards for used oil transporters (i.e., the  279.45 requirements for used oil storage
at transfer facilities would not apply). 


Section 279.41(c) of today's rule provides conforming changes to the used oil transportation standards to allow
transporters or transfer facilities to filter the used oil without being subject to the used oil processor standards.
It should be clearly noted, however, that if the used oil is stored at a site for more than 35 days, greater environmental
concerns may be present, so the site would no longer be considered a transfer facility and the processor standards
would apply. 

In addition, this rule expands the definition of transfer facility to allow used oil to be held at a location (i.e.,
a transfer facility) temporarily prior to activities that are exempt from or performed pursuant to the part 279 standards
as a result of today's rulemaking. Under today's revised definition, used oil can be held at a transfer facility for
more than 24 hours but less than 35 days prior to an activity and performed pursuant to  279.20(b)(2). As a result
of this change, a site where used oil that has been drained from oil-bearing transformers and turbines is held for more
than 24 hours and less than 35 days prior to being filtered for reuse would be considered a transfer facility. 

G. Section 279.46_Tracking

 Today's rule revises the  279.46 tracking requirements as they apply to rail transporters. Under amended  279.46,
a signature is not required on records of acceptance or records of delivery of used oil shipments that are exchanged
between rail transporters. The Agency is making this change in response to comments submitted by the railroad industry
regarding the impracticability of requiring signed receipts when used oil is transferred from one rail transporter
to another. EPA is aware that rail cars are typically transferred from one railroad company to another without the
face-to-face contact that occurs in, for example, the motor carrier industry. The Agency also recognizes that, unlike
non-rail transporters, railroads rely on sophisticated electronic tracking and information systems for recording
rail-to-rail transfer of cargo. Given these unique circumstances, and in light of the fact that 40 CFR 263.20(f) regulations
for hazardous waste transporters do not include signature requirements for intermediate rail carriers, EPA agrees
that the signature requirements are unduly burdensome and unnecessary when applied to intermediate used oil rail
transporters. EPA is therefore revising the used oil regulations to eliminate the  279.46 signature requirements
between intermediate rail carriers.

H. Corrections to the Regulatory Language 



1. Requirements for Enforcement Authority



The Agency published a correction notice on May 3, 1993, which amended several sections of the part 279 used oil management
standards that were originally promulgated on September 10, 1992. In the May 3, 1993, correction notice, EPA incorrectly
amended regulatory  271.16, that addressed the requirements for States to have adequate criminal enforcement
authority for hazardous waste. EPA amended the regulation to include enforcement authority for used oil handlers
that manage used oil incorrectly, but EPA inadvertently deleted from  271.16 enforcement authority for the
improper management of hazardous waste. Therefore, today's rule corrects this section to include enforcement authority
for the improper management of both hazardous waste and used oil. 



2. Rebuttable Presumption 



The final used oil regulations published on September 10, 1992, allow persons to rebut the presumption that used oil
containing more than 1,000 ppm total halogens is a hazardous waste by using an analytical method from SW-846,
Third Edition, to show that the used oil does not contain hazardous waste. In the regulations, the Agency provided
information on the cost of SW-846, Edition III and how to obtain it. However, the Agency misquoted the cost of
the document. The actual cost was $319.00 rather than $110.00 as quoted throughout the September 10, 1992, regulations.
To avoid having to amend the regulations as a result of future changes in the cost of the document, the Agency is deleting
reference to the cost of SW-846, Edition III from the used oil regulations. 



3. Characteristic Hazardous Waste 



Today's rule revises  279.10(b)(2)(iii) by deleting reference to the listing status (under part 261, subpart
D) of a hazardous waste that is mixed with used oil. This change is necessary to correct a contradiction in the regulations
regarding applicability of the used oil management standards to mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste that is listed
in subpart D solely because it exhibits one or more of the characteristics of hazardous waste identified in subpart
C. In technical corrections to the used oil management standards published on May 3, 1993, (57 FR 26420), EPA amended
 279.10(b)(2) to correct an error in the September 10, 1992, standards regarding how these mixtures are regulated.
At that time, conforming changes should have been, but were not made to  279.10(b)(2)(iii). As amended by today's
rule,  279.10(b)(2)(iii) correctly provides that mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste that solely exhibits
one or more hazardous waste characteristic and mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste that is listed in subpart D
solely because it exhibits one or more subpart C hazardous characteristics are regulated as used oil if the mixture
is of used oil and a waste which is hazardous solely because it exhibits the characteristic of ignitability and the
resultant mixture does not exhibit the characteristic of ignitability.

IV. State Authorization 



As explained in the preamble to the May 3, 1993, Technical Correction to the September 10, 1992, rule, EPA is treating
the majority of the final used oil management standards in the same manner as ``non-HSWA'' Subtitle C requirements.
The used oil management standards became effective on March 8, 1993, only in those States and Territories that do not
have RCRA base program authorization and on Indian lands. States are required to revise their Subtitle C base programs
to adopt the new used oil requirements (including those promulgated in today's rule) by July 1, 1994, or by July 1, 1995,
if a statutory change is necessary. See 58 FR 26420 and 57 FR 41605. 

Authorized States are only required to modify their programs when EPA promulgates Federal standards that are more
stringent or broader in scope than the existing Federal standards. Section 3009 of RCRA allows States to impose standards
more stringent than those in the Federal program. For those Federal program changes that are less stringent or reduce
the scope of the Federal program, States are not required to modify their programs. See 40 CFR 271.1(k). Except for
the amendments made to  279.20(b), the standards promulgated today are less stringent than or reduce the scope
of the existing Federal requirements. The amendments made to  279.20(b) merely provide clarification of the
existing used oil regulations and are therefore not considered to be less stringent than the current Federal program.
Therefore, with the exception of the provisions added at  279.20(b)(2)(i), authorized States would not be
required to modify their programs to adopt requirements equivalent to or substantially equivalent to the provision
listed above. 



V. Executive Order 12866 



Under Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the
economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;


(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipient thereof; or 

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the ``Executive Order.'' 

OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review. 



VI. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The reporting and recordkeeping requirements of part 279 have been approved by OMB and generally assigned the control
number 2050-0124 (See 58 FR 34374 (June 25, 1993)), which remains in effect. As today's rule does not impose any
new such requirements, a separate information collection request was not prepared. 



VII. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Today's rule does not impose any new regulatory requirements, and indeed, decreases the costs of compliance for a
number of facilities. I therefore certify that today's rule will not have a significant impact or a substantial number
of small entities. 



VIII. Administrative Procedures Act 



Today's rule takes final action on EPA's 1985 and 1991 proposals to exempt used oil inserted into primary refining
processes from the used oil management standards. EPA did not address these issues in its September 10, 1992, final
rule, and therefore those proposals remained outstanding until today's rule. Since these issues were fully addressed
in those proposals, further public comment on today's rule is unnecessary. The other changes being made in today's
rule either correct errors or clarify the language contained in the September 10, 1992 rule. No comment is necessary
on these provisions.
