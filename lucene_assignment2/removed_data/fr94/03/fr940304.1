Milk in the Middle Atlantic Marketing Area; Hearing on Proposed Amendments to Tentative Marketing Agreement and
Order



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of public hearing on proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This hearing is being held to consider proposals to amend the Middle Atlantic milk marketing order. The proposals
would amend provisions dealing with pooling qualifications for distributing plants and cooperative reserve processing
plants, producer milk diverted to nonpool plants, and the qualification of pool plants under more than one Federal
order. Two of the proposals would authorize the market administrator to adjust pool plant qualification standards
and producer milk diversion limits to reflect changes in marketing conditions.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This administrative action is governed by the provisions of Sections 556 and 557 of Title 5 of the United States Code
and, therefore, is excluded from the requirements of Executive Order 12866.



Notice is hereby given of a public hearing to be held at the Holiday Inn-Independence Mall, 400 Arch Street, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania 19106, telephone (215) 923-8660, beginning at 9 a.m. on May 3, 1994, with respect to proposed amendments
to the tentative marketing agreement and to the order regulating the handling of milk in the aforesaid marketing area.

The hearing is called pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7
U.S.C. 601-674), and the applicable rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing
agreements and marketing orders (7 CFR part 900).

The purpose of the hearing is to receive evidence with respect to the economic and marketing conditions which relate
to the proposed amendments, hereinafter set forth, and any appropriate modifications thereof, to the tentative
marketing agreement and to the order.

Actions under the Federal milk order program are subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354).
This Act seeks to ensure that, within the statutory authority of a program, the regulatory and information requirements
are tailored to the size and nature of small businesses. For the purpose of the Act, a dairy farm is a ``small business''
if it has an annual gross revenue of less than $500,000, and a dairy products manufacturer is a ``small business'' if
it has fewer than 500 employees. Most parties subject to a milk order are considered as a small business. Accordingly,
interested parties are invited to present evidence on the probable regulatory and informational impact of the hearing
proposals on small businesses. Also, parties may suggest modifications of these proposals for the purpose of tailoring
their applicability to small business.

The amendments to the rules proposed herein have been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform.
They are not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendments would not preempt any state
or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with these rules.

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under  608c(15)(A)
of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision
of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting
a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the
petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the
United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction
in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days
after date of the entry of the ruling.

Interested parties who wish to introduce exhibits should provide the Presiding Officer at the hearing with 6 copies
of such exhibits for the Official Record. Also, it would be helpful if additional copies are available for the use of
other participants at the hearing.

association from receipts used to calculate pool distributing plant qualification. 




Proposal No. 2




Delete  1004.7(a)(4), so that a plant changing from regulation under Order 4 to regulation under another Federal
order will not be exempt from the provisions of  1004.7(a)(3). 




Proposal No. 3




Delete  1004.7(f)(2) to leave the determination of which order should regulate a plant with route disposition

Proposal No. 4




Change from 30 percent to 25 percent the percentage of a cooperative association's member milk that must be transferred
from a cooperative-operated reserve processing plant to, or physically received from member producers at, pool
distributing plants if the reserve processing plant is to qualify as a pool plant. 




Proposal No. 5




Add a new paragraph  1004.7(g) to allow the market administrator to increase or decrease the required percentage
disposition or shipping requirements for pool qualification of distributing, supply or reserve processing plants
at the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested parties. 




Proposal No. 6




Amend  1004.12(d) to more clearly define the pooling requirements for producer deliveries to pool plants and
the status of producers whose marketing is interrupted by compliance with health regulations. 




Proposal No. 7




Amend  1004.12(d)(2)(i) to increase the permissible percentage of nonpool deliveries of member milk by a cooperative
or federation of cooperative associations from a maximum of 50 percent of total volume of member milk to a maximum percentage
of 55 percent. 




Proposal No. 8




Add a new paragraph  1004.12(g) to authorize the market administrator to increase or reduce the applicable
shipping percentages of  1004.12(d)(2) (i) and (ii). 




Proposed by Johanna Dairies Incorporated



Proposal No. 9




Amend  1004.12(d)(2)(ii) to increase the permissible percentage of nonpool deliveries for nonmember milk

From the time that a hearing notice is issued and until the issuance of a final decision in a proceeding, Department
employees involved in the decisional process are prohibited from discussing the merits of the hearing issues on an
ex parte basis with any person having an interest in the proceeding. For this particular proceeding, the prohibition

Post-Loan Policies and Procedures Common to Guaranteed and Insured Telephone Loans; Telecommunications System
Construction Policies and Procedures 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Rural Electrification Administration, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) proposes to amend its post-loan regulations for telephone borrowers
to ease borrower reporting requirements and further clarify existing REA policy. In addition, REA proposes to amend
the telecommunications system construction regulations to reflect minor technical changes such as moving the definitions
section from one subpart to another. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Executive Order 12866 



This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has
not been reviewed by OMB. 



Executive Order 12778 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If adopted, this proposed
rule will not: 

(1) Preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with
this rule; 

(2) Have any retroactive effect; and 

(3) Require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit challenging the provisions of this rule. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 



REA has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The REA telephone program provides loans to REA borrowers at interest rates and terms that are more favorable than
those generally available from the private sector. REA borrowers, as a result of obtaining federal financing, receive
economic benefits which exceed any direct economic costs associated with complying with REA regulations and requirements.
Moreover, this action liberalizes certain contract requirements by changing contract limits and allowing negotiation
of fee schedules which further offsets economic costs. 



Information Collection and Recordkeeping Requirements 



In compliance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations (5 CFR part 1320) which implement the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) and section 3504 of that Act, the information collection and recordkeeping
requirements contained in this proposed rule have been submitted to OMB for approval. Comments concerning these
requirements should be directed to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer
for USDA, room 3201, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. 



National Environmental Policy Act Certification 



REA has determined that this proposed rule will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment as defined
by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

). Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment. 



Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance 



The program described by this proposed rule is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under
10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees, and 10.852, Rural Telephone Bank Loans. This catalog is available
on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, the United States Government Printing Office, Washington,
DC 20402-9325. 



Executive Order 12372 



This proposed rule is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Consultation. A notice
of Final Rule entitled Department Programs and Activities Excluded from Executive Order 12372 (50 FR 47034) exempts
REA and RTB loans and loan guarantees to governmental and nongovernmental entities from coverage under this Order.

Background 



The proposed rules are primarily aimed at further clarifying and relaxing existing REA regulations concerning post-loan
and system construction policies and procedures. Further clarification of REA policy would ease borrower reporting
requirements by clearly defining certain post-loan construction procedures, such as contract construction and
closeout procedures. 

In part 1744, subpart B is revised to explain what REA means by ``in the interests of the Government''. Also, definitions
sections of subpart B and subpart C are combined into a single list of definitions, located in subpart B. 

In part 1753, subpart B is revised to delete definitions which merely repeat those in subpart A. Also, a monthly construction
progress reporting requirement is deleted because it contains information reported elsewhere. 

Subparts F and I are revised to increase the maximum allowable dollar amount of the Form 773 contract. This requires
miscellaneous revisions throughout part 1753. 

Minor and technical corrections are made throughout part 1753. 

Appendices A through F are revised to change the requirement to distribute certain documents to REA. 

Specifically, Appendix A is amended by adding to the table the distribution of Seismic Safety Certifications, required
by 7 CFR part 1792, to the contractor and REA. 

Appendix B is amended by removing from the table the distribution of the Switching Diagram and Set of Drawings to REA,
and to delete reference to REA Form 744 which has been replaced by REA Form 754. 

Appendix C is amended by removing from the table the distribution of Final Key Maps and Final Central Office Area and
Town Detail Maps to REA, and to reduce to one copy the number of other final documents required for REA. 

Appendix D is amended to comply with the revisions proposed to Appendix C. 

Appendix E is amended by removing from the table the distribution of Detail Maps and Key Maps to REA. 

Appendix F is amended by adding to the table the distribution of REA Form 213, Buy American Certificate to REA.

Nonmember and Public Unit Accounts

National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed amendments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Currently federally insured credit unions that wish to maintain public unit and nonmember accounts in excess of 20
percent of their total shares must have a waiver request approved by the Regional Director. The waiver request must
include a plan setting forth the intended sources and uses of the funds. The proposed amendments would change the amount
of nonmember and public unit accounts that a credit union may maintain, without a waiver, to 20 percent of total shares
or $1.5 million, whichever is greater. Credit unions accepting nonmember accounts in excess of 20 percent of total
shares but not greater than $1.5 million would, as under the current rule, be required to develop a written plan and
send it to the Regional Director. Prior NCUA approval, however, would no longer be required.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



A. Background



The NCUA Board, as part of its ongoing program of regulatory review, proposes to revise the regulation under which
federally insured credit unions maintain nonmember and public unit accounts. Federal credit unions (FCUs) are authorized
by section 107(6) of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1757(6)) to receive nonmember shares from other credit
unions, from certain governmental entities (``public units'') and, if the credit union has a ``low-income'' designation
from NCUA, from other outside sources. These nonmember shares, and equivalent accounts authorized for federally
insured state credit unions under the state law are defined by section 101(5) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1752(5)) as ``accounts''
and ``member accounts'' for purposes of the various provisions of the FCU Act, including those establishing insurance
coverage by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF).

NCUA's current regulation on nonmember accounts requires any federally-insured credit union that wishes to accept
nonmember accounts in excess of 20 percent of total shares to submit to NCUA a plan setting forth the intended use of
the funds and obtain NCUA approval. This rule was imposed in December 1988 (53 FR 50918, 12/19/88) in response to mismanagement
and misuse of nonmember accounts by some credit unions. Pursuant to  741.6 of NCUA's Regulations, federally-insured
state chartered credit unions must adhere to NCUA's requirements regarding nonmember accounts.



B. Discussion



In most credit unions, the only forms of nonmember accounts are public unit and credit union accounts. However, as
described above, credit unions with a low-income designation from NCUA are authorized to accept nonmember accounts
from any source.

When the current nonmember account rule was instituted, NCUA's concern with these accounts stemmed from abuses involving
large sums of money, often in excess of the $100,000 limit. In order to attract and retain these accounts, some credit
unions paid higher than market dividend rates. Large influxes of funds into credit unions caused asset/liability
management problems that were often not within management's expertise to control. In some cases, the total amount
of such account was far in excess of the amount necessary to meet the legitimate needs of the members and was used to fund
high risk loans and questionable investments.

The imposition of the 20 percent limitation has virtually eliminated problems involving nonmember funds. As discussed
more fully below, however, the process of requesting waivers, which has fallen almost entirely on low-income credit
unions, has proven burdensome for some credit unions. The purpose of this proposal is to reduce that burden without
significantly increasingly the risk to the credit union system and the NCUSIF.

As of June 1993, only 57 low-income credit unions out of 146 maintained nonmember accounts. The total dollar amount
of these accounts was approximately nineteen million, with the average dollar amount per low-income credit union
approximately $339,000. Surveys indicate that low-income credit unions maintaining nonmember accounts are currently
paying below market rates on the vast majority of these funds. It appears that most low-income credit unions, as most
other credit unions, use nonmember accounts prudently and do not maintain excessive amounts of these funds.

NCUA recognizes that nonmember accounts can be crucial to a low-income credit union in meeting the fundamental purpose
of a credit union: Promoting thrift and creating a source of credit for its members. Nonmember funds can be invested
to provide earnings that are paid out to members in the form of dividends, and they can provide a source of much needed
loan funds. Moreover, nonmember accounts can generate income that can be a source of badly needed capital.

Over the period from the adoption of the regulation in 1988 through June 1993, 50 of 59 waiver requests (85%) have been
approved. This suggests that most waiver requests have been justified and acceptable to the regional director. Although
a high percentage of the waivers have been approved, the procedure has proven burdensome for some credit unions. Given
the small asset size of most credit unions, the 20 percent limit frequently requires waivers for small amounts of funds
that pose very little risk to the credit union and the NCUSIF. Both credit unions and NCUA may be expending much more
time and paperwork on waiver requests than safety and soundness requires.

Although the NCUA Board remains concerned with the potential misuse of nonmember accounts, the Board believes that
a modification of the 20 percent limit may be justified. The Board is proposing the following changes to the rule.

It is proposed that a credit union be able to maintain permissible nonmember accounts up to 20 percent of total shares
or $1.5 million, whichever is greater, before a waiver by the regional director is required. This change recognizes
the benefit of a limitation on nonmember accounts but also allows a credit union to maintain a reasonable amount of
nonmember accounts, up to $1.5 million, without requesting one or more waivers from the regional director.

As under the current rule, all credit unions accepting nonmember accounts in excess of 20 percent of total shares would
be required to have a plan for the use of such deposits. Further, the plan would be submitted to the Regional Director
for information. Prior NCUA approval would be required, however, only for amounts in excess of both 20% and $1.5 million.

The plan would describe how nonmember accounts will be used to serve the credit union's membership, i.e., by providing
loanable funds to its members or through increased earnings. This requirement should ensure that federally-insured
credit unions have a reasonable plan in place for the use of the funds. As under the current rule, the plan would provide
for matching maturities of nonmember accounts with corresponding assets, or a justification for any mismatch; and
provide for an adequate income spread between public unit and nonmember shares and corresponding assets. The credit
union would submit the plan to the regional director, prior to receiving nonmember accounts in excess of 20 percent,
for NCUA's information and monitoring. NCUA approval would not be required before the credit union accepts additional
nonmember accounts, unless the aggregate amount exceeded both 20% of shares and $1.5 million.

The proposed amendments, if adopted, would allow small credit unions to receive significant amounts of nonmember
shares, in relation to their total shares, without the prior NCUA approval that has been required since 1988. The Board
is committed to working with these credit unions to ensure that nonmember funds are used in a safe and sound manner to
benefit their membership. In this connection, the Board requests comment on whether periodic reporting on the sources
and uses of nonmember shares, in excess of 20 percent of total shares, should be established. The Board may consider
a monthly or quarterly reporting requirement or alternatively, revisions to the NCUA Call Report (NCUA Form 5300),
to gather additional information on sources and uses of nonmember funds.



C. Request for Comments



The Board also requests comment on a related issue; the length of an approved waiver, in those cases where a waiver request
and approval are still required. The regulation currently states in  701.32(b)(2) that the waiver request
will normally be for a two-year period. Although the Board believes this language provides the regional director
with sufficient discretion to approve waivers for a shorter or longer period, the Board is requesting comment on whether
a nondiscretionary time period for the waiver should be stated, possibly three years, or whether the waiver should
be open-ended and only terminated upon action by the regional director or the credit union.



Paperwork Reduction Act



The proposed amendments do not change paperwork requirements.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires the NCUA to prepare an analysis to describe any significant economic impact
a proposed regulation may have on a substantial number of small credit unions (primarily those under $1 million in
assets). The revised rule is generally less restrictive than the current regulation. Overall, the NCUA Board expects
the change to benefit credit unions by permitting them to maintain a larger amount of nonmember accounts before requesting
a waiver from the Regional Director. Accordingly, the Board determines and certifies that this final rule does not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small credit unions and that a Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis is not required.



Executive Order 12612



Executive Order 12612 requires NCUA to consider the effect of its actions on state interests. The amendment applies
to federally-insured state-chartered credit unions that accept public unit and nonmember accounts. The proposed
rule would make it possible for a federally-insured credit union to accept a larger amount of nonmember deposits without
requesting an exemption.

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Boeing Model 747-400
series airplanes. This proposal would require various inspections and functional tests of the thrust reverser control
and indication system, and correction of any discrepancy found. This proposal is prompted by an investigation to
determine the controllability of Model 747 series airplanes following an 
in-flight thrust reverser deployment, which has revealed that, in the event of thrust reverser deployment during
high-speed climb or during cruise, these airplanes could experience control problems. The actions specified by
the proposed AD are intended to ensure the integrity of the fail safe features of the thrust reverser system by preventing
possible failure modes in the thrust reverser control system that can result in inadvertent deployment of a thrust
reverser during flight.

Discussion 




In May 1991, a Boeing Model 767 series airplane was involved in an accident in which a thrust reverser deployed inadvertently
during flight. While the investigation of the accident has not revealed the cause of that deployment, it has identified
a number of possible failure modes in the thrust reverser control system. Inadvertent deployment of a thrust reverser
during flight could result in reduced controllability of the airplane. 


The FAA and the aviation industry are conducting an in-depth investigation of the thrust reverser systems installed
on various types of large transport airplanes. In particular, this investigation has focused on airplane controllability
in the event of an in-flight deployment of a thrust reverser, and thrust reverser reliability in general. Based on
the data gathered from this ongoing investigation, the FAA has issued several airworthiness directives (AD) to require
periodic inspections and tests of the thrust reverser systems on certain Boeing Model 757 and 767 series airplanes
[for example, reference AD 91-20-09, Amendment 39-8043 (56 FR 46725, September 16, 1991) for certain
Model 757 series airplanes; and AD 92-24-03, Amendment 39-8408 (57 FR 53258, November 9, 1992) for
certain Model 767 series airplanes]. In addition, the FAA has issued or proposed several AD's to require an additional
locking device on thrust reversers that are installed on Model 737-300/-400/-500, 757, and 767
series airplanes. This action was taken to enhance the level of reliability on airplane models that were determined
to have unacceptable flight characteristics following an in-flight deployment of a thrust reverser.

Until now, the investigation of thrust reverser system reliability on Boeing Model 747 series airplanes has not been
given as high a priority as the other Boeing models because Model 747 series airplanes have never experienced control
problems as a result of an in-flight thrust reverser deployment. In fact, previously there had been at least 29 incidents
in which the thrust reverser installed on Model 747 series airplanes powered by Pratt & Whitney JT9D series engines
deployed during flight and the airplane was still controllable. Based on this long safety record and the available
evidence up to this time, it has been accepted generally that all Model 747 series airplanes would be shown to be controllable
throughout the flight envelope following an in-flight thrust reverser deployment. 



Recently, however, Boeing has responded to an FAA request for further 
investigation to determine the controllability of Model 747 series airplanes following an in-flight thrust reverser
deployment. The investigation results thus far indicate that Model 747-400 series airplanes could experience
certain control problems in the event of a thrust reverser deployment occurring during high speed climb or during
cruise. 
In light of this new information, the FAA has determined that certain inspections and functional tests of the thrust
reverser control and indication system on Model 747-400 series airplanes, similar to those required previously
for Model 757 and 767 series airplanes, are necessary as precautionary actions to provide an acceptable level of safety
for Model 747-400 series airplanes. Accomplishment of these inspections and functional tests is intended
to reduce the exposure of the airplane to potential undetected single failures in the thrust reverser control system.
The presence of an undetected failure in the thrust reverser control system, in some cases, can increase the likelihood
of an uncommanded thrust reverser deployment in the event of an additional thrust reverser control system failure.


The assessment of the thrust reverser system reliability of Model 747-100, -200, -300, SP, and SR
series airplanes is continuing. The FAA may consider rulemaking action for those airplanes based upon the results
of that assessment. 
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletins 747-78-2112, dated November 11, 1993 (for
Model 747-400 series airplanes powered by Pratt & Whitney PW4000 series engines); 747-78-2113,
dated November 11, 1993 (for Model 747-400 series airplanes powered by General Electric CF6-80C2 series
engines); and 747-78-2115, dated October 28, 1993 (for Model 747-400 series airplanes powered
by Rolls-Royce RB211-524G/H series engines). These service bulletins describe procedures for various inspections
and functional tests of the thrust reverser control and indication system, and correction of any discrepancy found.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require various inspections and functional tests of the thrust reverser control and
indication system, and correction of any discrepancy found. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance
with the service bulletins described previously. 
This proposed AD also would require that operators submit a report of initial inspection and test results to the FAA.

This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified for these airplanes, at which time the FAA
may consider further rulemaking. 
There are approximately 286 Model 747-400 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The
FAA estimates that 39 Model 747-400 series airplanes powered by Pratt & Whitney PW4000 series engines of
U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 48 work hours per airplane to
accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators of Model 747-400 series airplanes powered by Pratt & Whitney
PW4000 series engines is estimated to be $102,960, or $2,640 per airplane. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
Currently, there are no Model 747-400 series airplanes powered by General 
Electric CF6-80C2 series engines on the U.S. Register. However, should one of these airplanes be imported and
placed on the U.S. Register in the future, it would require approximately 60 work hours to accomplish the proposed
actions, at an average labor charge of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD would
be $3,300 per airplane. 
Additionally, there are no Model 747-400 series airplanes powered by Rolls-Royce RB211-524G/H series
engines on the U.S. Register at this time. However, should one of these airplanes be imported and placed on the U.S.
Register in the future, it would require approximately 30 hours to accomplish the proposed actions, at an average
labor charge of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD would be $1,650 per airplane.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

Discussion 



Recently, the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, manufacturer of Model 747 series airplanes, conducted a structural
reassessment of these airplanes. The FAA has reviewed the results of this reassessment and has determined that the
longitudinal lap joints of Stringer (S-)12 are critical to the structural integrity of these airplanes. 


The upper skin in the S-12 longitudinal lap joints are made of waffle doublers that are hot bonded to skin panels.
The S-12 longitudinal lap joints have three rows of countersunk fasteners. The depth of the countersink exceeds
the thickness of the skin panel. If the waffle doubler disbonds from the skin panel, the resultant sharp edges at the
longitudinal lap joint fasteners can cause fatigue cracking at the fastener holes. 

Skin cracking in the longitudinal lap joints of S-12L and S-12R, if not detected and corrected, could result
in rapid decompression of the airplane. 


The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 747-53-2366, dated August 6, 1992, that describes
procedures for repetitive high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections to detect cracking of the skin around the
fasteners in the upper row of the longitudinal lap joints of S-12L and S-12R from station 520 to station
741.1, and replacement of the countersunk fasteners in these longitudinal lap joints with protruding head fasteners.


Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require repetitive external HFEC inspections to detect cracking of the skin around
the fasteners in the upper row of the longitudinal lap joints of S-12L and S-12R from station 520 to station
741.1, and replacement of the countersunk fasteners in these longitudinal lap joints with protruding head fasteners.
The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. This
proposal also would require repair of all cracking in accordance with procedures specified in the 747 Structural
Repair Manual. 


This proposal is applicable only to airplanes having line numbers 201 through 230. Since the tolerance specifications
for the bonding process for airplanes manufactered after line number 230 were more stringent, those airplanes are
not subject to the unsafe condition addressed by this proposed AD. 

There are approximately 30 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 12 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 17 work hours
per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspections, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on
these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed inspections on U.S. operators is estimated to be $11,220, or $935
per airplane. 

The FAA estimates that it would take approximately 302 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed requirement
to replace fasteners, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would be nominal in cost.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed requirement to replace fasteners on U.S. operators is
estimated to be $199,320, or $16,610 per airplane. 

Based on the figures, above, the total cost impact of the proposed actions (cost of inspections added to the cost of
replacement of fasteners) on U.S. operators is estimated to be $210,540, or $17,545 per airplane. 


The FAA recognizes that the proposed replacement of fasteners would require a large number of work hours to accomplish.
However, the 4-year compliance time specified in paragraph (b) of this proposed AD should allow ample time for the
replacement of the fasteners to be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance
activities, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling.

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 


For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

Discussion 




Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, 
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Canadair Model 
CL-600-2B19 series airplanes. Transport Canada advises that the attitude and heading 
reference system (AHRS) could send conflicting input to the stall protection computer 
(SPC) on these airplanes. When the AHRS sends input to the SPC, the left- and right-
hand channels on the SPC receive and compare that input. The SPC has a built-in feature 
that compares lateral acceleration from these channels. When the SPC recognizes unequal 
lateral acceleration signals of 0.03g or higher, it will inhibit the stall horn, light, and stick 
push command, and an ``SPS FAILURE'' caution message will display on the primary 
flight display. Due to a build-up effect of AHRS tolerances, these unequal signals may be 
detected within the SPC at a roll rate within the normal flight envelope. This condition, if 
not corrected, could result in the loss of stall warning protection on the airplane. 

Bombardier, Inc., has issued Regional Jet Canadair Alert Service Bulletin 
S.B. A601R-34-028, Revision `A,' dated October 22, 1993, that describes procedures for 
modification of the stall protection system (SPS) input wiring. The modification involves 
removing the right channel input wires from the connection to the SPC, capping and 
stowing the removed wires, installing splices from the left-hand channel input to the right-
hand channel connection of the SPC, and installing a ground jumper wire. 
Accomplishment of these wiring changes will prevent a build-up effect of AHRS 
tolerances and unequal signals between the left- and right-hand SPC channels. Transport 
Canada Aviation classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Canadian 
Airworthiness Directive CF-93-27, dated October 26, 1993, in order to assure the 
continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada. 


This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for 
operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to 
this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA 
informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of 
Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD 
action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the 
United States. 


Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD 
would require modification of the SPS input wiring. The modification would be required 
to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. 


This proposed AD would also require revising the Normal Procedures section of 
the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to specify that a pre-flight check of the 
slip/skid indications must be conducted prior to engine start. Finally, this proposed AD 
would require modification of the AHRS to restore the dual AHRS inputs to the SPC. 
This modification would be required to be accomplished in accordance with a method 
approved by the FAA. 


It should be noted that Canadian AD CF-93-27 requires that the flight crew be 
advised of the possibility of an inadvertent inhibition of the stall horn, light, and stick push 
command at a roll rate within the normal flight envelope, and that an ``SPS FAILURE'' 
caution message will be displayed on the primary flight display. The Canadian AD 
requires that when such a message is displayed, appropriate abnormal procedures in the 
AFM should be followed. However, the FAA's position in this regard is that it is not 
necessary to include a requirement in this proposed AD to direct the flight crew to follow 
existing AFM procedures. 


The FAA estimates that 9 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this 
proposed AD, that it would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish 
the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. The cost for 
required parts would be minimal. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the 
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $990, or $110 per airplane. This total 
cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of 
this AD action. 


The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 


For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' 
under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); 
and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, 
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the 
Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document invites public comment on a proposed revision of the notice of proposed rulemaking published in the


Federal Register

 on August 10, 1992 (57 FR 35530), which would add special procedures and requirements to the Customs Regulations governing
the operations of crude petroleum refineries approved as foreign trade subzones. The proposed rule is necessary
to implement a section of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 which amended the Foreign Trade Zone
Act to make specific provision for petroleum refinery subzones. Customs has significantly revised the initial notice
of proposed rulemaking as a result of the extensive and varied input received from the oil refinery and foreign trade
zone communities, as well as from other interested parties, in response to the initial notice. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On August 10, 1992 (57 FR 35530), Customs published a document in the 

Federal Register

, proposing to amend the Customs Regulations to add special procedures and requirements governing the operations
of crude petroleum refineries approved as foreign trade subzones, in implementation of section 9002 of the Technical
and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, which amended the Foreign Trade Zones Act, 19 U.S.C. 81c(d), to make specific
provision for petroleum refinery subzones. 


Briefly, as stated in the August 10, 1992, notice of proposed rulemaking, the amendment obviates the need to determine
exactly when and where in the manufacturing process crude and other feedstocks become other products. In so doing,
it permits refiners as well as Customs to assess the relative value of such multiple products at the end of the manufacturing
period from which such products were produced, when the actual quantities of these products resulting from the refining
process can be measured with certainty. Also, the amendment permits the products refined in a subzone during a manufacturing
period to be attributed to given crude or other feedstocks introduced into production during the period, to the extent
that such products were producible (could have been produced) therefrom in the quantities removed from the subzone.



By a document published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 14, 1992 (57 FR 41896), Customs extended the public comment period for the proposed rule until December
8, 1992. Subsequently, by a document published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 24, 1992 (57 FR 55198), Customs further extended the public comment period until February 8, 1993, and
gave notice of a public meeting which was held on December 15 and 16, 1992, concerning the proposed amendments. 


As a result of the extensive and varied input received from the oil refinery and foreign trade zone communities, as
well as from other interested parties, in response to the initial notice of proposed rulemaking and the public meeting,
Customs has decided to significantly revise its initial notice, and is requesting additional public comment on the
revised proposed rule. 


The following discussion includes a summary of the various comments received in response to the August 10, 1992, notice
of proposed rulemaking, together with an explanation and analysis regarding the sections proposed to be added, eliminated
or further revised. The proposed rule as revised is thereafter set forth.

Discussion of Comments 





Comment:

 Most commenters favor deletion of proposed  146.92(a), involving the definition of ``Assay''. 



Response:

 Customs agrees. Laboratory analyses are sufficient to verify feedstock characteristics and provide API gravity.




Comment:

 Most commenters indicated that the cumulative entry activity report defined in proposed  146.92 (c) is only
required in the Houston District and, therefore, favor its deletion because the information is already contained
in the subzone activity report. 



Response:

 Upon further consideration, Customs has determined to delete proposed  146.92 (c), (d), (h) and (l), involving
the report in question, as well as certain related reports, specifically, the duty and user fee report, the inventory
disposition report, and the product shipment report, all of which were principally addressed in proposed  146.96
which, as a result, is also deleted from the proposed rule. 



Comment:

 Commenters indicated that the definition in proposed  146.92(e) concerning ``feedstock'' should be expanded
to include natural gas and other hydrocarbons to comply with EPA regulations. 



Response:

 Customs agrees and has so modified the wording of proposed  146.92(e) (now redesignated as  146.92(b)).




Comment:

 Many commenters noted that proposed  146.92(f) defining ``final product'' should also include products consumed
in the zone. 



Response:

 Customs agrees with this suggestion and has so changed proposed  146.92(f) (now redesignated as  146.92(d)).




Comment:

 Most commenters indicated that fungibility is already defined in  146.1(b), and that a definition for this
term is not needed in the proposed subpart if the assay requirement is deleted. 



Response:

 Customs agrees. Proposed  146.92(g) has been eliminated. 



Comment:

 A majority of commenters propose that the ``manufacturing period'' coincide with the normal accounting cycle. 



Response:

 After reviewing the comments, particularly those of the Congressional sponsors of the legislation, Customs is convinced
that a literal interpretation of the statutory language would not be appropriate. Therefore, proposed  146.92(i)
(now redesignated as  146.92(e)) dealing with this matter has been reworded. The definition allows an operator
to make the attribution of a final product either during the period in which the final product was produced (even if
not consumed or removed from the refinery subzone during that same period) or the period in which the final product
was consumed or removed from the zone (even if the final product was made in a prior period). The selection of the method
is at the operator's option, but once selected, the method must be used consistently. 



Comment:

 Most commenters suggested that they should be permitted to use standard product values, based on published prices.




Response:

 Customs agrees that standard product values, based on published prices, may be utilized, but that this must be done
on a consistent basis. Thus, proposed  146.92(j) (now redesignated as  146.92(g)), involving the price
of products in the subzone, has been reworded. 



Comment:

 Most commenters suggested rewording proposed  146.92(n) which defined the ``relative value'' of products
produced in the subzone. 



Response:

 The definition of ``relative value'' proposed by the commenters has been included in proposed  146.92(n) (now
redesignated as  146.92(i)) because it states the same information as the proposed regulation, albeit more
succinctly. 



Comment:

 Many commenters noted that, generally, the ``time of separation'' will coincide with the ``manufacturing period''.

Response: 

Customs agrees that the ``time of separation'' coincides with the ``manufacturing period''. Therefore, proposed
 146.92(p) (now redesignated as  146.92(k)) defining the time of separation has been modified accordingly.



Comment: 

Most commenters favor deletion of proposed  146.92(q) which defines the term ``unique identifier'' (UIN)
because this term is already defined in  146.1(b)(19). 



Response: 

Customs agrees and, therefore, this definition has been deleted. 


Comment: 

Most commenters proposed eliminating proposed  146.93(a)(1) regarding the use of the UIN (unique identifier)
because this matter is already covered elsewhere in part 146. 



Response: 

Customs agrees that existing  146.22 adequately addresses this matter, and, therefore, paragraphs (a), (a)(1)
and (a)(2) of proposed  146.93 have been eliminated. 



Comment: 

A number of commenters suggested that proposed  146.93(b)(1) be deleted because zone admittance is already
covered in subpart C of part 146. 


Response: 

Customs agrees. Proposed  146.93(b)(1) has been deleted. 


Comment: 

Most commenters suggest deletion of the requirement that domestic feedstock be assigned a UIN, as provided in proposed
 146.93(c)(1), because existing regulations do not require that a Customs Form (CF) 214 be filed on domestic
feedstocks. 



Response: 

Customs agrees that a CF 214 is not required, and, therefore, proposed  146.93(c)(1) has been deleted. Nevertheless,
it must be noted that a domestic feedstock must be assigned a UIN under existing regulations. 


Comment: 

A few commenters suggested that references to T.D. 66-16 concerning the attribution of final product to given
feedstock be eliminated from proposed  146.93(d)(1) because this is already discussed elsewhere in the proposed
regulations. 


Response: 

Customs agrees and, therefore, the proposed language has been duly modified and the section redesignated as proposed
 146.93(a)(1). Also, proposed  146.93(d)(2) (now redesignated as  146.93(a)(3)) dealing with
attribution using alternative inventory control has been revised to make reference to the use of FIFO; the use of FIFO
is illustrated in an Appendix which has been added to the revision of proposed subpart H. In addition, proposed  146.93(d)(3)
dealing with ``stock in process'' has been deleted, in concert with the deletion of this term from the definition section;
in its place, a new proposed  146.93(a)(2) makes reference to the use of actual production records in attributing
product to feedstock. 


Comment: 

Commenters suggested that products consumed within the zone should be included in proposed  146.93(e). 


Response: 

This suggestion has been incorporated in proposed  146.93(e) (now redesignated as  146.93(b)). 


Comment: 

Commenters objected to the language of proposed  146.94(a) regarding the introduction of feedstock into the
refining process because they believe it requires a direct identification system.



Response: 

The commenters have misread this section, the purpose of which is to establish the amount and identity of the feedstocks
available for attribution during each manufacturing period. The proposed language has been modified to eliminate
any such misunderstanding. 


Comment: 

Most commenters suggested deletion of the sentence, ``This date establishes the end of the manufacturing period.'',
in proposed 
 146.94(b). 


Response: 

Given the proposed definition of ``manufacturing period'' this suggested change has been adopted.

Comment: 

Commenters indicated that the language contained in proposed  146.94(c) regarding the removal of product
from a refinery subzone 
is specific to a calendar week. However, an accounting period may be greater than a week. 


Response: 

While a manufacturing or accounting period may be greater than a week, there is no authority to permit a consumption
entry covering products removed from a zone to exceed one week. Thus, the language of  146.94(c) remains in substance
as originally proposed. However, Customs will reevaluate the possibility of permitting monthly entries, in light
of the Customs modernization portion of the recently passed North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation
Act, particularly  637. 

Currently, a refiner who desires to make attributions on the basis of a monthly manufacturing or accounting period
must attribute and make any required relative value calculation by attributing current removals or consumptions
to final products that were produced in a prior manufacturing or accounting period. A refiner who reports removals
and consumption on a weekly basis and who elects to attribute a final product that is removed or consumed, in the same
week that it is produced, must make the appropriate attribution and relative value calculation for that week. 


Comment: 

Commenters noted that attribution is more appropriately dealt with in proposed  146.99 (now redesignated
as proposed  146.96), rather than in proposed  146.95 titled ``Feedstock inventories''. 


Response: 

Customs agrees with the comments that attribution can be dealt with more appropriately in proposed  146.99
(now redesignated as 
 146.96); therefore, proposed  146.95 concerning feedstock inventories has been deleted. Proposed
 146.97 titled ``producibility'' is now renumbered as  146.95. 


Comment: 

Commenters suggested deleting the last sentence and four reports listed in proposed  146.96 concerning a subzone
activity report. 


Response: 

As already stated above, this proposed section has been deleted in its entirety. 


Comment: 

Commenters noted that proposed  146.97(a) must provide for products consumed within the subzone. 


Response: 

Customs agrees with the comments that proposed  146.97(a) must provide for consumption within the zone. Therefore,
appropriate language has been included in proposed  146.97(a) (now redesignated as  146.95(a)). 


Comment: 

 Comments indicated that, as currently worded, proposed 
 146.98(a) is limited to operators using producibility. 



Response: 

Proposed  146.98(a) (now redesignated as  146.93(c)) has been modified to avoid any misunderstanding
in this respect. 



Comment: 

Commenters stated that attributions are binding except for adjustments needed upon reconciliation. 


Response: 

Proposed  146.99(a) (now redesignated as  146.96(a)) has been modified to address this concern. Reconciliation
is limited to changes in amounts, and mathematical and clerical errors, but does not include changes in the identity
of the feedstock. 


Comment: 

Commenters noted that other inventory control methods are already covered in proposed  146.93(d)(2), so there
is no need for proposed  146.99(c). 


Response: 

Customs has decided to essentially revise former proposed 
 146.99(c) and to make it the subject of a new  146.97 regarding the approval of other recordkeeping systems
for subzone oil refinery operations. As already noted above, proposed  146.93(d)(2) (now redesignated as
 146.93(a)(3)) has been revised to refer exclusively to the use of the FIFO method of inventory accounting.



Comment: 

Commenters also indicated that the proposed regulations do not take into account the three relative value methods
listed in 
proposed  146.98(b). Commenters also pointed out that the proposed regulation does not provide a mechanism
to attribute consumption within the zone.

Response: 

Customs agrees and has determined to eliminate proposed 
 146.98(b) from the revised proposed rule; and proposed 
 146.98(c) is now redesignated as  146.93(e). In addition, 
as previously emphasized, revised   146.93, 146.95 and 146.96 now provide for consumption within the
subzone. Moreover, Customs has decided to add an Appendix to proposed subpart H as revised in order to give detailed
examples of attribution as well as the relative value calculation. 



Conclusion 



After careful consideration of the comments received and further review of the matter, it has been determined to republish
the proposal with the modifications noted and to allow interested persons an additional opportunity to submit comments
on the proposal. Also, Customs has determined to add definitions in the revised proposed rule for ``feedstock factor'',
``petroleum refinery'', and ``refinery operating unit'', and to eliminate the definitions for ``protection of
the revenue'' and ``stock in process'' formerly set forth in proposed  146.92(m) and (o), respectively. Commenters
on the original proposal need not resubmit their comments. They will be considered along with any new comments received
in response to this notice.

Subpart H_Petroleum Refineries in Foreign Trade Subzones 



 146.91

Applicability. 



This subpart applies only to a petroleum refinery (as 
defined herein) engaged in refining petroleum in a foreign trade zone or subzone. This subpart also applies only to
feedstocks (crude petroleum and derivatives thereof) which are introduced into production in a refinery subzone.
Further, the provisions relating to zones generally, which are set forth elsewhere in this part, including documentation
and document retention requirements, and entry procedures, such as weekly entry, shall apply as well to a 
refinery subzone, insofar as applicable to and not inconsistent with the specific provisions of this subpart. 



 146.92

Definitions. 



The following definitions are applicable to this subpart H: 


(a) 

Attribution

. ``Attribution'' means the association of a final product with its source material by application of: 

(1) Actual operating records; 

(2) Producibility under T.D. 66-16; or 

(3) Other Customs approved method. 

(b) 

Feedstocks

. ``Feedstocks'' means crude petroleum or intermediate product that is used in a petroleum refinery to make a final
product. 

(c) 

Feedstock factor

. ``Feedstock factor'' means the relative value of final products utilizing T.D. 66-16 (see  146.92(h)),
and which takes into account any loss or gain. 

(d) 

Final product

. ``Final product'' means any petroleum product that is produced in a refinery subzone and thereafter removed therefrom
or consumed within the zone.

(e) 

Manufacturing period

. ``Manufacturing period'' means a period selected by the refiner which shall not exceed a calendar month, for which
attribution to a source feedstock must be made and, if required, a relative value assigned for every final product
made, consumed in or removed from the refinery subzone. 

(f) 

Petroleum refinery

. ``Petroleum refinery'' means a facility that refines a feedstock listed on the top line of the tables set forth in
T.D. 66-16 into a product listed in the left column of the tables set forth in T.D. 66-16. 

(g) 

Price of product

. ``Price of product'' means the average per unit market value of each final product for a given manufacturing period
or the published standard product value if updated each month. 

(h) 

Producibility

. ``Producibility'' is a method of attributing products to feedstocks for petroleum manufacturing in accordance
with the Industry Standards of Potential Production set forth in T.D. 66-16. 

(i) 

Relative value

. ``Relative value'' means a value assigned to each final product attributed to the separation from a privileged foreign
feedstock based on the ratio of the final product's value compared to the privileged foreign feedstock's duty. 

(j) 

Refinery operating unit

. ``Refinery operating unit'' means a unit in a refinery in which feedstock is processed such as a distillation tower,
cracking tower or reformer. 

(k) 

Time of separation

. ``Time of separation'' means the 
manufacturing period in which a privileged foreign status feedstock is deemed to have been separated into two or more
final products. 



 146.93

Inventory control and recordkeeping system. 



(a) 

Attribution

. (1) 

Producibility

. The producibility method of attribution requires that records be kept to attribute 
final products to feedstocks which have been introduced into a refinery operating unit during the current or prior
manufacturing period. 

(2) 

Actual production records

. An operator may use its actual production records as provided for under  146.96(b) of this subpart. 

(3) 

Other inventory method

. An operator may use the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method of accounting (see  191.22(c) of this chapter).
The use of this method is illustrated in the Appendix to this subpart. 

(4) 

Feedstock not eligible for attribution

. Feedstock admitted into the refinery subzone, until it is introduced into a refinery operating unit in the subzone,
is not eligible for attribution to any final product. 

(b) 

Consumption or removal of final product

. Each final product that is consumed in or removed from a refinery subzone must be attributed to a feedstock introduced
into a refinery operating unit during the current or a prior manufacturing period. Each final product attributed
as being produced from the separation of a privileged foreign status feedstock must be 
assigned the proper relative value as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. 

(c) 

Relative value

. A relative value calculation is required when two or more final products are produced as the result of the separation
of privileged foreign status feedstock. Ad valorem and compound rates of duty must be converted to specific rates
of duty in order to make a relative value calculation.

<PARENT> FR940304-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(d) 

Consistent use required.

 The operator must use the selected method and the price of product consistently (see  146.92(g)) of this subpart).




 146.94 

Records concerning establishment of manufacturing period. 



(a) 

Feedstock charged into a refinery operating unit.

 The operator must record the date and amount of each feedstock charged into a refinery operating unit during each manufacturing
period. 

(b) 

Final product consumed in or removed from subzone.

 The operator must record the date and amount of each final product consumed in, or removed from the subzone. 

(c) 

Consumption or removal.

 The consumption or removal of a final product during a week may be considered to have occurred on the last day of that
week for purposes of attribution and relative value calculation instead of the actual day on which the removal or consumption
occurred, unless the refiner elects to attribute using the FIFO method (see Example II to Appendix to this subpart).


(d) 

Gain or loss.

 A gain or loss that occurs during a manufacturing period must be taken into account in determining the attribution
of a final product to a feedstock and the relative value calculation of privileged foreign feedstocks. Any gain in
a final product attributed to a nonprivileged foreign status feedstock is dutiable if entered for consumption unless
otherwise exempt from duty. 

(e) 

Determining gain or loss; acceptable methods.


 
(1) 

Converting volume to weight.

 Volume measurements may be converted to weight measurements using American Petroleum Institute conversion factors
to account for gain or loss. 

(2) 

Calculating feedstock factor to account for volume gain.

 A feedstock factor may be calculated by dividing the value per barrel of production per product category by the quotient
of the total value of production divided by all feedstock consumed. This factor would be applied to a finished product
that has been attributed to a feedstock to account for volume gain. 

(3) 

Calculating volume difference.

 Volume difference may be determined by comparing the amount of feedstocks introduced for a given period with the amount
of final products produced during the period, and then assigning the volume change to each final product proportionately.



 146.95 

Producibility. 



(a) 

Industry standards of potential production.

 The industry standards of potential production on a practical operating basis necessary for the producibility attribution
method are contained in tables published in T.D. 66-16. With these tables, a subzone operator may attribute
final products consumed in, or removed from, the subzone to feedstocks during the current or a prior manufacturing
period. 

(b) 

Attribution to product or feedstock not listed in T.D. 66-16.

 For purposes of attribution, where a final product or a feedstock is not listed in T.D. 66-16, the operator must
submit a proposed attribution schedule, supported by a technical memorandum, to the appropriate district director.
If an operator elects to show attribution on a producibility basis, but fails to keep records on that basis, Customs
shall use the operator's actual operating records to determine attribution and any necessary relative value calculation.




 146.96 

Methods of attribution. 



(a) 

Producibility.

 (1) 

General.

 A subzone operator must attribute the source of each final product. The operator is limited in this regard to feedstocks
introduced into a refinery operating unit during the current or a prior period. Attribution of the final products
is allowable to the extent that the quantity of such products could have been produced from such feedstocks, using
the industry standards of potential production 
on a practical operating basis, as published in T.D. 66-16. Once attribution is made for a particular product,
that attribution is binding. Subsequent attributions of feedstock to product must take prior attributions into
account. Each refiner shall keep records showing each attribution. 

(2) 

Attribution to privileged foreign feedstock; relative value.

 If a final product is attributed to the separation of a privileged foreign feedstock, their relative values must be
assigned. 




Example. An operator who elects to attribute on a monthly basis files the following estimated removal of final products
for the first week in September:

 





Because it does not elect to make attributions for feedstocks that were charged to operating units during the same
week, the operator attributes the estimated removals to final products made during August from the following feedstocks:

 





During August the operator produced from those feedstocks:

 





There is a gain: 105,000^95,000=10,000 




Using the tables in T.D. 66-16, the following choices are available for attribution: 






Relative value factors are calculated:

<PARENT> FR940304-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 










(b) 

Actual production records.

 An operator may use the actual refinery production records to attribute the feedstocks used to the removed or consumed
products. Customs shall accept the operator's recordation conventions to the extent that the operator demonstrates
that it actually uses the conventions in its refinery operations. Whatever convention is elected by the operator,
it must be used consistently in order to be acceptable to Customs. 




Example. If the operator mixes three equal quantities of material in a day tank and treats that product as a three-part
mixture in its production unit, Customs will accept the resulting product as composed of the three materials. If,
in the alternative, the operator assumes that the three products do not mix and treats the first product as being composed
of the first material put into the day tank, the second product as composed of the second material put into the day tank,
and the third product as being composed of the third material put into the day tank, Customs will accept that convention
also.

 146.97 

Approval of other recordkeeping systems. 



(a) 

Approval. 

An operator must seek approval of another recordkeeping procedure by submitting the following to the Director, Office
of Regulatory Audit: 
(1) An explanation of the method describing how attribution will be made when a finished product is removed from or
consumed in the subzone, and how and when the feedstocks will be decremented; 
(2) A mathematical example covering at least two months which shows the amounts attributed, all necessary relative
value calculations, the dates of consumption and removal, and the amounts and dates that the transactions are reported
to Customs. 
(b) 

Failure to comply. 

Requests received that fail to comply with paragraph (a) of this section will be returned to the requester with the
defects noted by the Director, Office of Regulatory Audit. 
(c) 

Determination by Director. 

When the Director, Office of Regulatory Audit, determines that the recordkeeping procedures provide an acceptable
basis for verifying the admissions and 
removals from or consumption in a refinery subzone, the Director will issue a written approval to the applicant. 



Appendix to Subpart H_Examples of Attribution and Relative Value 



I. Attribution Using Producibility 



Day 1 



Transfer, within the refinery subzone, from one or more storage tanks to the crude distillation unit:




50,000 pounds privileged foreign (PF) class II crude oil 
50,000 pounds PF class III crude oil
50,000 pounds domestic status class III crude oil 



Day 20 



Removal from the refinery subzone for exportation of 50,000 
pounds of aviation gasoline. 

The period of manufacture for the aviation gasoline is Day 1 to Day 20. The refiner must first attribute the designated
source of the aviation gasoline. 
In order to maximize the duty benefit conferred by the zone operation, the refiner chooses to attribute the exported
aviation gasoline to the privileged foreign status crude oil. Under the tables for potential production (T.D. 66-16),
class II crude has 
a 30% potential, and class III has a 40% potential. The maximum 
aviation gasoline producible from the class II crude oil is 15,000 pounds (50,000  x  .30). The maximum aviation
gasoline producible from the privileged foreign status class III crude oil is 20,000 pounds (50,000  x  .40).
The domestic class III crude would also make 20,000 pounds of aviation gasoline. 
The refiner could attribute 15,000 pounds of the privileged foreign class II crude oil, 20,000 pounds of the privileged
foreign class III crude oil, and 15,000 pounds of the domestic class III crude oil as the source of the 50,000 pounds
of the aviation gasoline that was exported; 35,000 pounds of class II crude oil would be available for further production
for other than aviation gasoline, 30,000 pounds of privileged foreign class III crude oil would be available for further
production for other than aviation gasoline, and 35,000 pounds of domestic status class III crude oil would be available
for further production, of which up to 5,000 pounds could be attributed to aviation gasoline. 


Day 21



Transfer, within the refinery subzone, from one or more storage tanks to the crude oil distillation unit:

 


50,000 pounds PF status class I crude oil 
50,000 pounds PF status class IV crude oil 



Day 30 



Removal from the refinery subzone:

 


30,000 pounds of motor gasoline for consumption 
10,000 pounds of jet fuel sold to the US Air Force for use 
in military aircraft 

10,000 pounds of aviation gasoline sold to a U.S. commuter 
airline for domestic flights 



10,000 pounds of kerosene for exportation

 


To the extent that the crude oils that entered production on Day 1 are attributed as the designated sources for the products

removed on Day 30, the period of manufacture is Day 1 to Day 30. If the refiner chooses to attribute the crude oils that
entered production on Day 21 as the designated sources of the products removed on Day 30 using the production standards
published in T.D. 66-16, the manufacturing period is Day 21 to Day 30. This 30 
choice will be important if a relative value calculation on the privileged foreign status crude oil is required, because
the law requires the value used for computing the relative value to be the average per unit value of each product for
the manufacturing period. Relative value must be calculated if a source feedstock is separated into two or more products
that are removed from the subzone refinery. If the average per unit value for each product differs between the manufacturing
period from Day 1 to Day 30 and the manufacturing period from Day 21 to Day 30, the correct period must be used in the calculation.


In order to minimize duty liability, the refiner would try to attribute the production of the exported kerosene and
the sale of the jet fuel to the US Air Force to the privileged foreign crude oils. For the same reason, the refiner would
try to attribute the removed motor gasoline and the aviation gasoline for the commuter airline to the domestic crude
oil.

Accordingly, the refiner chooses to attribute up to 5,000 pounds of the domestic status class III crude as the source
of the 10,000 pounds of aviation gasoline removed from the subzone refinery for the commuter airline. Since no other
aviation gasoline could have been produced from the crude oils that entered production on Day 1, the refiner must attribute
the remainder to the crude oils that entered production on Day 21. Again, using the production standards from T.D.
66-16, the class I crude could produce aviation gasoline in an amount up to 10,000 pounds (50,000  x  .20).
Likewise, the class IV crude oil could 31 
produce aviation gasoline in an amount up to 8,500 pounds (50,000  x  .17). 

The refiner selects use of the class I crude as the source of the aviation gasoline. The refiner could attribute up to
27,300 pounds (35,000_5,000  x  .91) of the domestic class III crude oil as the source of the motor gasoline. This
would leave 2,700 pounds of domestic class III crude available for further production for other than aviation gasoline
or motor gasoline. The remaining motor gasoline removed (also 2,700 pounds) must be attributed to a privileged foreign
crude oil. The refiner selects the privileged foreign class II crude oil that entered production on Day 1 as the source
for the remaining 2,700 pounds of motor gasoline. 

This would leave 32,300 pounds of privileged foreign class II crude oil available for further production, of which
no more than 27,400 pounds could be designated as the source of motor gasoline. The refiner attributes the jet fuel
that is removed from the refinery subzone for the US Air Force for use in military aircraft to the privileged foreign
class II crude oil. The refiner could attribute up to 20,995 pounds of jet fuel from that class II crude oil (32,300  x 
.65). Designating that class II crude oil as the source of the 10,000 pounds of jet fuel leaves 22,300 pounds of privileged
foreign class II crude oil available for further 
production, of which up to 10,995 pounds could be attributed as the source of the jet fuel. Because the motor gasoline
and the jet fuel, under the foregoing attribution, would be considered to have been separated from the privileged
foreign class II crude oil, a relative value calculation would be required. 

The jet fuel is eligible for removal from the subzone free of duty by virtue of 19 U.S.C. 1309(a)(1)(A). The refiner
could attribute the privileged foreign class II crude oil as being the source of 9,812 pounds of jet fuel (22,300  x 
.44). The refiner chooses to attribute the privileged foreign class III crude oil as the source of the jet fuel. The
refiner could attribute to that class III crude oil up to 15,000 pounds of kerosene (30,000  x  .50). 



II. Attribution on a FIFO Basis 



Day 1-5 


Transfer, within the Refinery Subzone, from one or more storage tanks into process 150 barrels of Privileged Foreign
(PF) Class II crude oil, equivalent to 50,000 pounds. 



Day 6 



Removal from the refinery subzone 119 barrels of residual oils to customs territory, equivalent to 40,000 pounds.


Since the operator uses the FIFO method of attribution, as the product is removed from the subzone, or consumed or lost
within the 
subzone, attribution must be to the oldest feedstock available for 
attribution. Accordingly, the 40,000 pounds (119 barrels) of residual oils will be attributed to 40,000 pounds of
the PF Class II crude oil from Day 1-5. 
 


Day 10 



Transfer, within the refinery subzone, from one or more storage tanks 4 barrels of domestic motor gasoline blend stock,
equivalent to 1,000 pounds to motor gasoline blending tank. 



Day 6-15



Transfer, within the refinery subzone, from one or more storage tanks into process 320 barrels of Domestic Class III
crude oil, equivalent to 100,000 pounds.

Day 16 


Removal from the refinery subzone 14 barrels of asphalt to customs territory, equivalent to 5,000 pounds. 
The 5,000 pounds of asphalt will be attributed to 5,000 pounds of PF Class II crude oil from Day 1-5. 


Day 17


Removal from the refinery subzone, 324 barrels of motor gasoline to customs territory, equivalent to 81,000 pounds.


The 81,000 pounds of motor gasoline will be attributed to 1,000 pounds of domestic motor gasoline blend stock from
Day 10, to the remaining 5,000 pounds of PF Class II crude oil from Day 1-5 and 75,000 pounds of domestic Class III
crude oil from Day 6-15. 


Day 16-20 


Transfer, within the refinery subzone, from one or more storage tanks into process 169 barrels of Privileged Foreign
(PF) 34 
Class III crude oil, equivalent to 50,000 pounds. 



Day 22 


Removal from the refinery subzone, 214 barrels of jet fuel for exportation, equivalent to 60,000 pounds. 
The 60,000 pounds of jet fuel will be attributed to the remaining 25,000 pounds of domestic Class III crude oil from
Day 6-15 and 35,000 pounds of PF Class III crude oil from Day 16-20. 



Day 21-25 


Transfer, within the refinery subzone from one or more storage tanks into process, 143 barrels of domestic Class I
crude oil, equivalent to 50,000 pounds. 


Day 30 (End of Manufacturing Period) 



It is determined that during the manufacturing period just ended, that 34 barrels of fuel, equivalent to 10,000 pounds
was consumed, and 5 barrels of oil, equivalent to 1,500 pounds was irrecoverably lost as provided in  146.53(c)(1)(iv)
of this part, in the refining production process within the refinery subzone. 

The 10,000 pounds of fuel consumed will be attributed 10,000 pounds of PF Class III crude oil from Day 16-20. The
1,500 pounds of oil lost in the refining production process will be attributed to 1,500 pounds of PF Class III crude
oil from Day 16-20. The remaining 3,500 pounds of PF Class III crude oil from Day 16-20 will be the first to
be attributed during the next manufacturing period. 



III. Relative Value Calculation 



Because privileged foreign feedstocks transferred into process during Day 1-5 and Day 16-20 have two
or more products attributed to them, each feedstock will require a relative value calculation. 

Relative value calculation for UIN Day 1-5, 50,000 pounds, equivalent to 150 barrels. 










Since all products attributed to the 50,000 pounds (150 BBLS) of PF Class II crude entered customs territory duty equals
$7.88 (150  x  .0525).

Relative value calculation for UIN Day 16-20, 46,500 pounds equivalent to 157 barrels. 









Since jet fuel was exported, no duty is applicable. Fuel consumed for refinery process was consumed within the subzone
premises and did not enter customs territory, thus no duty is applicable. Likewise, the process loss occurred entirely
within the subzone. Therefore, no duty is applicable.

ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On August 20, 1993, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) submitted materials in response to requirements
in part D of title I of the Clean Air Act for new source review in nonattainment areas. This submittal included no revisions
to any Ohio regulations. Instead, the submittal described how Ohio intended to implement various applicable part
D requirements, and presented a rationale that no revisions to State regulations would be necessary to satisfy these
requirements. USEPA disagrees with this rationale and proposes to disapprove the State's submittal for failure
to satisfy applicable requirements.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background


On August 20, 1993, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) submitted a letter with attachments to the United
States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) addressing new source review in nonattainment areas. USEPA notified
OEPA on October 22, 1993, that it found this submittal complete. This submittal was intended to satisfy Clean Air Act
requirements for new source review in nonattainment areas, particularly the new requirements established by the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
Provisions for new source review in Ohio were included in the original State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted
on January 31, 1972, and replacement regulations submitted on June 6, 1973. The relevant regulations provided for
best available control technology (BACT) and other requirements applied uniformly throughout the State. Subsequently,
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 provided for designations of areas as being in attainment or nonattainment of
the air quality standards, and required a further State submittal to impose additional requirements (most notably
lowest achievable emission rates (LAER) and offsets) for new sources in nonattainment areas. Ohio submitted relevant
material on July 25, 1980, and September 25, 1980. USEPA conditionally approved these submittals on October 31, 1980,
on the condition that Ohio submit regulations delineating requirements that new sources in nonattainment areas
must meet.
Ohio submitted revised regulations on October 4, 1982, and January 24, 1983. These regulations impose nonattainment
area new source permitting requirements by incorporating appendix S to title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
part 51 (appendix S to 40 CFR part 51_''Emission Offset Interpretative Ruling'') into the State regulations. USEPA
granted limited approval to this submittal on September 8, 1993 (58 FR 47211), concluding that the regulation strengthened
the SIP but did not fully satisfy the nonattainment area planning requirements established in 1977 in part D of title
I of the Clean Air Act. Of particular concern were the exemptions of temporary sources and resource recovery facilities
provided in appendix S (and thus incorporated by reference in the State rules) but not approvable under the criteria
established in 40 CFR part 51, subpart I. By the time of this 1993 rulemaking, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 had
imposed further requirements for nonattainment area new source review. The State provided USEPA material concerning
the new requirements on November 19, 1992, December 2, 1992, January 13, 1993, and April 26, 1993. USEPA notified the
State on June 1, 1993, that these materials did not represent a complete submittal. The State then provided additional
information on August 20, 1993, which USEPA found on October 22, 1993, to constitute a complete submittal. USEPA has
conducted a full review and proposes to disapprove the submittal for failing to satisfy the current nonattainment
area new source review requirements of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act.
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 established numerous new requirements for new source review. Among the more significant
of these requirements that apply to Ohio are provisions for specific emission offset requirements in ozone nonattainment
areas, including specified minimum offset rations, for review of major new sources and major modifications for nitrogen
oxides (NO

x

) in ozone nonattainment areas, and for an alternative siting analysis for all nonattainment area pollutants. Additionally,
the State plan must include provisions for proper calculation of offsets, provisions reflecting certain substantial
restrictions on growth allowances, provisions for supplying from nonattainment new source review permits to USEPA's
RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse, provisions relating to rocket engines or motors, provisions relating to stripper
wells, provisions relating to the definition of ``stationary source'' affecting the treatment of internal combustion
engine sources, and provisions relating to temporary clean coal technology demonstration projects.

1







The 1990 Amendments also specify various deadlines for submittal of SIP revisions to satisfy these requirements.
For areas designated nonattainment for fine particulate matter, a plan satisfying the requirements of sections
173 and 189 was to be submitted by June 30, 1992. For areas designated nonattainment and classified as marginal or above
for ozone, a plan satisfying the requirements of sections 173 and 182 was to be submitted by November 15, 1992. For areas
designated nonattainment for carbon monoxide, a plan satisfying the requirements of section 173 was to be submitted
by November 15, 1993. The State of Ohio has areas designated nonattainment for ozone and particulate matter, for which
it was required to meet these SIP revision deadlines. The August 20, 1993, material was submitted in an effort to satisfy
these requirements.


II. Review of State's Submittal


A. Review Relative to Pre-1990 Requirements


The State's recent submittal does not address new source review requirements that applied prior to the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990. Therefore, the USEPA review of the State's plan relative to pre-1990 requirements published
on September 8, 1993 (58 FR 47211), remains current. The September 8 notice granted limited approval on the basis of
the strengthening effect of the 1982 regulations relative to the prior SIP, but found the State's plan to be insufficient
to meet the pre-1990 new source review requirements. The 1982 regulations essentially incorporate appendix
S of 40 CFR part 51 by reference. USEPA identified deficiencies relating to the exemptions from offset requirements
for resource recovery facilities and temporary sources provided in appendix S and therefore incorporated by reference
into Ohio's regulations. Since these deficiencies have not been addressed, the State's new source review program
continues to fail to satisfy part D requirements.
The September 8 notice also noted that the provisions of appendix S, as incorporated by reference into Ohio's regulations,
are not as explicit as the current requirements of subpart I of 40 CFR part 51 for annual, actual emissions offsets.
Although USEPA interprets Ohio's regulations to require that federally enforceable actual emission offsets be
obtained as a condition of any permit pursuant to part D, section 173(c) requires that Ohio clarify that this requirement
applies.


B. Review Relative to Post-1990 Requirements


The substance of Ohio's submittal of August 20, 1993, is a document entitled ``Ohio EPA New Source Review State Implementation
Plan_Requirements for Major New Sources in Nonattainment Areas.'' This document focuses on requirements established
by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and identifies OEPA's plans for implementing these requirements. This document
is referred to below as Ohio's statement of permitting criteria.
The State's submittal provides no new regulations to govern review of new sources in nonattainment areas. Instead,
the submittal states that regulations adopted in 1974 provide the necessary authority to implement the new requirements
for new source review, and that these SIP approved regulations in conjunction with the submittal's statement of permitting
criteria should satisfy Clean Air Act requirements. Thus, a key question in this rulemaking is whether USEPA can approve
this approach and enforce the intended permitting requirements.
The USEPA, in its technical support document, evaluated the adequacy with which Ohio's submittal satisfies selected
key requirements. USEPA's review indicated that the statement of permitting criteria does not provide adequate
specificity and clarity of criteria by which detailed implementation decisions would be made. The following discussion
of sample requirements illustrates the basis for this conclusion.
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require that specified offset ratios for volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions
and presumptively for nitrogen oxides (NO

x

) emissions must be obtained in ozone nonattainment areas. That is, any significant increase in potential emissions
for either of these pollutants must be accompanied by an decrease in actual emissions that is larger by at least a specified
ratio. Ohio's statement of permitting criteria includes: (1) A preliminary clause stating that ``the following
additional requirements will be applicable,'' (2) an item 1 identifying ``minimum required offset ratios,'' and
(3) an item 4 noting that ``NO

x

 . . . shall be treated as a nonattainment pollutant'' in ozone nonattainment areas. No definition of offset ratio is
provided, and so it is unclear what averaging time applies, whether offsets are to reflect allowable or actual emissions,
whether all emission increases must be offset (e.g., fugitive and secondary emissions), where the offsets must occur,
and whether interpollutant offsets are permissible. (Item 4 of Ohio's statement implies that NO

x

 offsets must come from the same county as the emission increases.) The statement also does not explicitly state that
either VOC or NO

x

 offsets are required. 
A second new requirement is that the other various major source requirements (e.g., lowest achievable emission rates)
also apply to major sources of NO

x

 in ozone nonattainment areas, unless USEPA makes certain determinations that NO

x

 control would not be beneficial. Ohio implies the applicability of these requirements by making the above statement
that NO

x

 is to be treated as a nonattainment pollutant. Ohio's statement continues that ``[n]ew source applicants are required
to meet the major new source definitions and major modifications thresholds as specified in the CAA.'' However, the
Clean Air Act itself does not explicitly define ``major new source'' and does not specify major modification thresholds.
Also, Ohio's statement could be read to require all sources to meet the size minimums for major new sources or major
modifications. Ohio's statement continues: ``For major modifications, these CAA requirements will be applicable
to sources of NO

x

 greater than 40 tons per year.'' It is not clear whether Ohio intends this apparent reduction from 100 to 40 tons per
year of the threshold of source sizes at which major modifications trigger new source review requirements. 
Review of further requirements established by the 1990 Amendments is provided in the technical support document.
The conclusion of USEPA's review is that the statement of permitting criteria does not address many of the questions
that would arise in imposing the identified requirements.


C. Analysis of the Need for Regulations


The above examples clarify a central issue in this rulemaking, i.e. whether formal regulations are necessary to establish
the requirements dictated by the Clean Air Act. Ohio's statement and the submittal cover letter present the State's
position that existing Ohio statutes and regulations already require that the provisions of the amended Clean Air
Act be met. Specifically, Ohio notes that its Rule 3745-31-05 requires that permits to install shall be
issued only if the construction and operation will ``not result in a violation of any applicable laws,'' which is defined
to include the Clean Air Act including any amendments. Although Ohio proceeds to describe in general terms how it intends
to apply the new requirements, the submittal cover letter expressly states that ``the current, federally approved,
Ohio SIP is adequate for fulfilling the requirements of a NSR SIP, and that no changes are necessary.'' 
Ohio's position raises fundamental questions about the role of implementing regulations. In general, statutes
present general criteria that must be met, whereas regulations define the specific requirements that apply in each
circumstance. In limited circumstances a statute may be enforced without implementing regulations, but generally
regulations are necessary to define the precise obligations of affected individuals and the precise criteria by
which relevant decisions (e.g. determinations of compliance) will be made. The proper adoption of clearly defined
criteria for making relevant decisions is essential to support these decisions. Therefore, in the absence of exhaustively
detailed statutes, the adoption of detailed regulations is essential for successful program implementation.
In the case of new source review, the Clean Air Act identifies general provisions which are to be included in State plans.
The State's statement of permitting criteria closely parallels the language in the Clean Air Act. As the above examples
illustrate, Ohio's submittal fails to define many of the details of how these requirements would be implemented.
In the absence of these details, a subject source could not be expected to know its obligations pursuant to these requirements,
and could object to the imposition of the general requirements based on the failure of the State to pre-define the specific
criteria that would be applied. Further, as a commenter noted when the State proposed its SIP revision, the statement
of permitting criteria was not adopted according to the full procedures in Ohio for adoption of regulations, even
though this statement is intended to serve purposes normally served by regulations. Consequently, the statement
of permitting criteria lacks the specificity, the regulatory standing, and the assurance of being enforceable that
are needed to satisfy Clean Air Act requirements.


III. This Action


USEPA's review indicates that Ohio's submittal does not clearly establish the specific criteria by which judgments
in new source permitting will be made. Furthermore, by relying not on properly adopted regulations but rather on a
general regulatory provision (requiring compliance with the Clean Air Act) in conjunction with a statement of permitting
criteria, the State has failed to follow proper procedures to become authorized to impose specific, detailed permit
conditions in accordance with the Clean Air Act requirements. In addition, the existing regulations exempt two types
of sources which may not be exempted under applicable USEPA regulations. For these reasons, USEPA proposes to disapprove
Ohio's submittal for failure to satisfy part D requirements.
Under section 179(a)(2), if USEPA takes final action to disapprove a submission under section 110(k) for an area designated
nonattainment based on the submission's failure to meet one or more of the elements required by the Act, USEPA must
apply one of the sanctions set forth in section 179(b) unless the deficiency has been corrected within 18 months of
such disapproval. Section 179(b) provides two sanctions available to USEPA: highway funding restrictions, and
a requirement for two-for-one offsets. The 18-month period referred to in section 179(a) would begin to run at the
time USEPA publishes final notice of this disapproval. Moreover, the final disapproval would trigger the Federal
Implementation Plan (FIP) requirement under section 110(c). Separate rulemaking is being conducted to identify
which sanction would apply first and to address related issues on the application of sanctions, for example whether
USEPA must publish final approval of a new submittal before the deficiency may be considered corrected. 
Public comment is solicited on this proposed rulemaking action. Comments received by [Insert date 30 days from date
of publication] will be considered in the development of USEPA's final rulemaking action.
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
USEPA's disapproval of the State request under section 110 and part D of the Clean Air Act does not affect any existing
requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place after this disapproval.
Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its State enforceability. Moreover, USEPA's disapproval
of the submittal does not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, USEPA certifies that this disapproval
action would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing
requirements nor does it impose any new Federal requirements.
This action has been classified as a Table Two action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published
in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), based on revised SIP processing review tables approved by the Acting Assistant
Administrator for Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional Administrators).
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget waived Tables Two and Three SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from the
requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years. USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent
waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's
request. This request continued in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on
September 30, 1993.

Hazardous Waste Management System; 
Identification and Listing of Hazardous Waste; 
Proposed Exclusion 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule and request for comment.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is proposing to grant a petition submitted by Bethlehem Steel
Corporation (BSC), Sparrows Point, Maryland, to exclude certain solid wastes generated at its facility from the
lists of hazardous wastes contained in  261.31 and  261.32. This action responds to a delisting petition
submitted under  260.20, which allows any person to petition the Administrator to modify or revoke any provision
of Parts 260 through 265 and 268 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and under  260.22, which specifically
provides generators the opportunity to petition the Administrator to exclude a waste on a ``generator-specific''
basis from the hazardous waste lists. The proposed decision is based on an evaluation of waste-specific information
provided by the petitioner. If this proposed decision is finalized, the petitioned waste will be conditionally excluded
from regulation as a hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). 


The Agency is also proposing the use of a fate and transport model to evaluate the potential impact of the petitioned
waste on human health and the environment, based on the waste-specific information provided by the petitioner. This
model has been used in evaluating the petition to predict the concentration of hazardous constituents that may be
released from the petitioned waste, once it is disposed of.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



A. Authority 



On January 16, 1981, as part of its final and interim final regulations implementing section 3001 of RCRA, EPA published
an amended list of hazardous wastes from non-specific and specific sources. This list has been amended several times,
and is published in  261.31 and  261.32. These wastes are listed as hazardous because they typically and
frequently exhibit one or more of the characteristics of hazardous wastes identified in Subpart C of part 261 (

i.e.

, ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, and toxicity) or meet the criteria for listing contained in   261.11(a)(2)
or (a)(3). 

Individual waste streams may vary, however, depending on raw materials, industrial processes, and other factors.
Thus, while a waste that is described in these regulations generally is hazardous, a specific waste from an individual
facility meeting the listing description may not be. For this reason,  260.20 and  260.22 provide an exclusion
procedure, allowing persons to demonstrate that a specific waste from a particular generating facility should not
be regulated as a hazardous waste. 
To have their wastes excluded, petitioners must show that wastes generated at their facilities do not meet any of the
criteria for which the wastes were listed. See  260.22(a) and the background documents for the listed wastes.
In addition, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984 require the Agency to consider any factors (including
additional constituents) other than those for which the waste was listed, if there is a reasonable basis to believe
that such additional factors could cause the waste to be hazardous. Accordingly, a petitioner also must demonstrate
that the waste does not exhibit any of the hazardous waste characteristics (

i.e.

, ignitability, reactivity, corrosivity, and toxicity), and must present sufficient information for the Agency
to determine whether the waste contains any other toxicants at hazardous levels. See  260.22(a), 42 U.S.C.
6921(f), and the background documents for the listed wastes. Although wastes which are ``delisted'' (

i.e.

, excluded) have been evaluated to determine whether or not they exhibit any of the characteristics of hazardous waste,
generators remain obligated under RCRA to determine whether or not their waste remains non-hazardous based on the
hazardous waste characteristics. 

In addition, residues from the treatment, storage, or disposal of listed hazardous wastes and mixtures containing
listed hazardous wastes are also considered hazardous wastes. See   261.3 (a)(2)(iv) and (c)(2)(i),
referred to as the ``mixture'' and ``derived-from'' rules, respectively. Such wastes are also eligible for exclusion
and remain hazardous wastes until excluded. On December 6, 1991, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
vacated the ``mixture/derived from'' rules and remanded them to the Agency on procedural grounds (

Shell Oil Co.

 v. 

EPA

, 950 F.2d 741 (D.C. Cir. 1991)). On March 3, 1992, EPA reinstated the mixture and derived-from rules, and solicited
comments on other ways to regulate waste mixtures and residues (57 FR 7628). The Agency plans to address issues related
to waste mixtures and residues in a future rulemaking. 



B. Approach Used To Evaluate This Petition 



This petition requests a delisting for a listed hazardous waste. In making the initial delisting determination,
the Agency evaluated the petitioned waste against the listing criteria and factors cited in   261.11(a)(2)
and (a)(3). Based on this review, the Agency agreed with the petitioner that the waste is non-hazardous with respect
to the original listing criteria. (If the Agency had found, based on this review, that the waste remained hazardous
based on the factors for which the waste was originally listed, EPA would have proposed to deny the petition.) EPA then
evaluated the waste with respect to other factors or criteria to assess whether there is a reasonable basis to believe
that such additional factors could cause the waste to be hazardous. The Agency considered whether the waste is acutely
toxic, and considered the toxicity of the constituents, the concentration of the constituents in the waste, their
tendency to migrate and to bioaccumulate, their persistence in the environment once released from the waste, plausible
and specific types of management of the petitioned waste, the quantities of waste generated, and waste variability.

For this delisting determination, the Agency used such information to identify plausible exposure routes (

i.e.

, ground water, surface water, air) for hazardous constituents present in the petitioned waste. The Agency determined
that disposal in a landfill is the most reasonable, worst-case disposal scenario for BSC's petitioned waste, and
that the major exposure route of concern would be ingestion of contaminated ground water. Therefore, the Agency is
proposing to use a particular fate and transport model to predict the maximum allowable concentrations of hazardous
constituents that may be released from the petitioned waste after disposal in a regulated municipal solid waste landfill
and to determine the potential impact of disposal of BSC's waste on human health and the environment. Specifically,
the Agency used the maximum estimated waste volume and the maximum reported leachate concentrations as inputs to
estimate the constituent concentrations in the ground water at a hypothetical receptor well downgradient from the
disposal site. The calculated receptor well concentrations (referred to as compliance-point concentrations)
were then compared directly to the health-based levels used in delisting decision-making for the hazardous constituents
of concern. 

EPA believes that this fate and transport model represents a reasonable worst-case scenario for disposal of the petitioned
waste in a landfill, and that a reasonable worst-case scenario is appropriate when evaluating whether a waste should
be relieved of the protective management constraints of RCRA Subtitle C. The use of a reasonable worst-case scenario
results in conservative values for the compliance-point concentrations and ensures that the waste, once removed
from hazardous waste regulation, will not pose a threat to human health or the environment. Because a delisted waste
is no longer subject to hazardous waste control, the Agency is generally unable to predict and does not control how
a waste will be managed after delisting. Therefore, EPA currently believes that it is inappropriate to consider extensive
site-specific factors when applying the fate and transport model. For example, a generator may petition the Agency
for delisting of a metal hydroxide sludge which is currently being managed in an on-site landfill and provide data
on the nearest drinking water well, permeability of the aquifer, dispersivities, etc. If the Agency were to base its
evaluation solely on these site-specific factors, the Agency might conclude that the waste, at that specific location,
cannot affect the closest well, and the Agency might grant the petition. Upon promulgation of the exclusion, however,
the generator is under no obligation to continue to manage the waste at the on-site landfill. In fact, it is likely that
the generator will either choose to send the delisted waste off-site immediately, or will eventually reach the capacity
of the on-site facility and subsequently send the waste off site to a facility which may have very different hydrogeological
and exposure conditions. 

The Agency also considers the applicability of ground-water monitoring data during the evaluation of delisting
petitions. In this case, the Agency determined that, because BSC is seeking an upfront delisting (

i.e.

, an exclusion based on data from waste generated from a bench-scale treatment process), ground-water monitoring
data collected from the areas where the petitioner plans to dispose of the waste in the future are not necessary. Because
the petitioned waste is not currently generated or disposed of, ground-water monitoring data would not characterize
the effects of the petitioned waste on the underlying aquifer at the disposal sites and, thus, would serve no purpose.
Therefore, the Agency did not request ground-water monitoring data. 

BSC petitioned the Agency for an upfront exclusion (for waste that has not yet been generated) based on descriptions
of the proposed stabilization process that will be used to treat BSC's dewatered filter cake, characterization of
dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake, and results from the analysis of waste subjected to BSC's proposed stabilization
process.

<TEXT>
 

Similar to other facilities seeking upfront exclusions, this upfront exclusion (

i.e.,

 an exclusion based on information characterizing the process and waste) would be contingent upon the analytical
testing of the petitioned waste once stabilization is initiated at BSC's Sparrows Point facility. Specifically,
BSC will be required to collect representative samples of stabilized filter cake to verify that the stabilization
process is on-line and operating as described in the petition. The verification testing requires BSC to demonstrate
that the proposed stabilization process, once on-line, will generate a non-hazardous waste (

i.e.,

 a waste that meets the Agency's verification testing conditions).

From the evaluation of BSC's delisting petition, a list of constituents was developed for the verification testing
conditions. Tentative maximum allowable leachable concentrations for these constituents were derived by back
calculating from the delisting health-based levels through the proposed fate and transport model for a landfill
management scenario. These concentrations (

i.e.,

 ``delisting levels'') are the proposed verification testing conditions of the exclusion.

The Agency encourages the use of upfront delisting petitions because they have the advantage of allowing the applicant
to know what treatment levels for constituents will be sufficient to render specific wastes non-hazardous, before
investing in new or modified waste treatment systems. Therefore, upfront delistings will allow new facilities to
receive exclusions prior to generating wastes, which, without upfront exclusions, would unnecessarily have been
considered hazardous. Upfront delistings for existing facilities can be processed concurrently during construction
or permitting activities; therefore, new or modified treatment systems should be capable of producing wastes that
are considered non-hazardous, and managed as such sooner than otherwise would be possible. At the same time, conditional
testing requirements to verify that the delisting levels are achieved by the fully operational treatment systems
will maintain the integrity of the delisting program and will ensure that only non-hazardous wastes are removed from
Subtitle C control.

Finally, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 specifically require the Agency to provide notice and an
opportunity for comment before granting or denying a final exclusion. Thus, a final decision will not be made until
all public comments (including those at public hearings, if any) on today's proposal are addressed.



II. Disposition of Delisting Petition



Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Sparrows Point, Maryland.



A. Petition for Exclusion



Bethlehem Steel Corporation (BSC), located in Sparrows Point, Maryland, is involved in the production of tin and
chromium plated parts and steel strip. BSC petitioned the Agency to exclude its chemically stabilized wastewater
treatment filter cake presently listed as EPA Hazardous Waste No. F006_``Wastewater treatment sludges from electroplating
operations except from the following processes: (1) Sulfuric acid anodizing of aluminum; (2) tin plating on carbon
steel; (3) zinc plating (segregated basis) on carbon steel; (4) aluminum or zinc-aluminum plating on carbon steel;
(5) cleaning/stripping associated with tin, zinc and aluminum plating on carbon steel; and (6) chemical etching
and milling of aluminum''. The listed constituents of concern for EPA Hazardous Waste No. F006 waste are cadmium,
hexavalent chromium, nickel, and cyanide (complexed) (see part 261, appendix VII).

BSC petitioned the Agency to exclude its stabilized filter cake because it does not believe that the waste, once generated,
will meet the criteria of the listing. BSC claims that its treatment process will generate a non-hazardous waste because
the constituents of concern in the waste are either not present or are in an essentially immobile form. BSC also believes
that the waste will not contain any other constituents that would render the waste hazardous. Review of this petition
included consideration of the original listing criteria, as well as the additional factors required by the Hazardous
and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984. See section 222 of HSWA, 42 U.S.C. 6921(f), and 40 CFR 260.22(d)(2)-(4).
Today's proposal to grant this petition for delisting is the result of the Agency's evaluation of BSC's petition.



B. Background



On January 2, 1991, BSC petitioned the Agency to exclude its stabilized filter cake from the lists of hazardous wastes
contained in  261.31 and  261.32, and subsequently provided additional information to complete its
petition. Specifically, BSC requested that the Agency grant an upfront exclusion (

i.e.,

 an exclusion that applies to waste not presently generated) for dewatered filter cake that will be stabilized using
lime kiln dust and powerplant fly ash at its Sparrows Point facility.

In support of its petition, BSC submitted: (1) Detailed descriptions of its manufacturing, waste treatment, and
stabilization processes, including schematic diagrams; (2) Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) for all trade name
products used in the manufacturing and waste treatment processes; (3) results from total constituent analyses for
the eight Toxicity Characteristic (TC) metals listed in  261.24, nickel, cyanide, zinc, and sulfide from representative
samples of the dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake and the stabilized filter cake; (4) results from the EP Toxicity
Test and the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP, SW-846 Method 1311) for the eight TC metals
(except for barium and selenium) and nickel from representative samples of the dewatered (unstabilized) filter
cake, uncured stabilized filter cake, and the cured stabilized filter cake; (5) results from total oil and grease
analyses from representative samples of the dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake and stabilized filter cake; (6)
results from the Multiple Extraction Procedure (MEP, SW-846 Method 1320) for the eight TC metals (except for
barium and selenium) and nickel from representative samples of the stabilized filter cake; (7) test results and information
regarding the hazardous characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, and reactivity; (8) results from the TCLP
analyses for the TC volatile and semivolatile organic compounds from representative samples of the dewatered (unstabilized)
filter cake; and (9) results from total constituent analyses for hexavalent chromium from representative samples
of dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake.

Similar to other facilities seeking upfront exclusions, once BSC's proposed stabilization system is on-line at
its Sparrows Point, Maryland facility, BSC would be required to submit additional analytical data for the petitioned
waste to verify that the on-line stabilization system meets the treatment capability of the stabilization process
as described in the petition and the verification testing conditions specified in the exclusion (see Section F_

Verification Testing Conditions

).

BSC's Sparrows Point, Maryland facility is involved in electroplating operations producing tin and chromium plated
parts and steel strip. Three plating lines contribute wastes to the wastewater treatment plant generating BSC's
chromium high density filter cake, namely, a tin free steel-chromium type (TFSCT) plating line and two halogen tinning
lines.

The TFSCT plating line is designed to deposit a layer of chromium on the steel strip with an additional outer protective
covering of chromium oxides. The TFSCT plating line consists of five major sections: The Entry Section, the Pre-Treatment
Section, the Plating Section, the Post-Treatment Section, and the Delivery Section. The purpose of the entry section
is to join the ends of the steel coils in preparation for subsequent continuous processing in the following sections.
The pre-treatment section cleans and prepares the steel to be plated. The strip passes through an electrolytic cleaning
system, brush scrubber, and pickle and pickle rinse cells to remove oil, dirt, rust, and other foreign substances.
In the plating section, the steel strip passes through the plater conditioner cell prior to entering the plating cell.
The chromium and chromium oxide layers are electrolytically plated onto the steel strip. The steel strip is rinsed,
after it leaves the plater, in the dragout and rinse cells. In the post-treatment section, the coated steel strip is
washed, dried, and oiled prior to being coiled for shipping or storage. The oil film helps to prevent scratching of
the coated strip during handling, serves as a lubricant for punching and forming operations, and retards oxidation
and corrosion. The delivery section consists of the equipment required for strip tension control, storage, measurement
and inspection, and shearing and winding into coils.

During the TFSCT plating process overflow chromic acid solution from the plater conditioner, overflow rinse waters
from the dragout and rinse cells of the plater section, and overflow rinse waters from the final washer cell are sent
to a sump (the chromium sump) which collects only chromium-bearing wastewaters. The collected wastewater is then
pumped from the chromium sump to the chromium High Density Sludge (HDS) Wastewater Treatment Plant. In addition,
if it is necessary to shut down the TFSCT plating line for repairs or in the event of a strip break, chromium-bearing
wastewaters from the plater conditioner and plater section are sent to a storage tank for subsequent treatment via
the chromium HDS wastewater treatment plant.

The two halogen tinning lines are designed to deposit a thin layer of tin on metal strip with an outer protective covering
of a very thin film of chromium and chromium oxides. The two halogen lines also consist of five major sections: the Entry
Section, the Pre-treatment Section, the Tin Plating Section, the Post-Treatment Section, and the Delivery Section.
The purpose of the entry section is to join the ends of the coils in preparation for subsequent continuous processing
in the following sections. The pre-treatment section cleans and prepares the metal strip to be plated. The metal strip
is cleaned in a hot, alkaline solution. A brush scrubber removes loosened dirt and any remaining caustic film, then
a sulfuric acid solution is used to remove metal oxides. A second brush scrubber removes the remaining acid film. In
the plating section, the cleaned, prepared metal strip is electroplated with tin. In the tin plating unit, the strip
rides on top of the halogen plating solution, while a series of soluble anodes below the surface provide the tin for
plating. The metal strip is sprayed and rinsed, after it leaves the plater, to remove any residual plating solution.
After being dried, the metal strip passes through the electrical induction reflow (melting) process where the plated
tin is converted from a matte (as plated) finish to a bright finish. The post-treatment section consists of a chemical
treatment tank and a washer. In the chemical treatment tanks sodium dichromate is used to produce a thin uniform chromium
and chromium oxide layer on the tinned surface via cathodic electrolysis. The film serves to stabilize or ``passivate''
the tinned surface preventing the undesirable tin oxides from forming. This section is completed with a dryer, Trion
oiler, and a bridle roll. The delivery section consists of the delivery looping tower, a bridle roll, inspection and
a recoil area where the metal strip is cut and transferred to empty reels.

During the halogen tinning process, rinse waters from the chemical treatment washer are sent to the chemical treat
sump and further pumped to the chromium HDS treatment system. This is the only wastewater entering the chromium HDS
wastewater treatment system from the Halogen Tinning Lines. 
The waste streams from the TFSCT plating (chromium sump) and Halogen Tinning (chemical treat sump) lines are combined
in a 50,000-gallon storage tank. From the storage tank the wastewater is pumped to a 10,000-gallon reduction reactor
where the pH of the wastewater is adjusted by the addition of sulfuric acid. In addition, liquid sulfur dioxide (SO

2

) is added to reduce hexavalent chromium to trivalent chromium. The reduced chromium wastewater is next transferred
to a 7,000-gallon neutralization tank and mixed with lime and previously-precipitated solids. The wastewater then
flows by gravity to a 1,200-gallon flocculator tank where a polymer is added to promote flocculation of the metal hydroxides.
The neutralized wastewater, containing approximately 2-5 percent solids, is then sent through a 50-foot diameter
gravity thickener, where thickened sludge is removed and subsequently dewatered by a rotary drum vacuum filter to
35-55 percent solids. The thickener effluent is filtered and the filtrate is discharged to the Tin Mill Canal
for further wastewater treatment prior to discharge to a receiving surface water body. The filtrate from the vacuum
filter and the filter backwash are returned to the flocculator tank. The dewatered filter cake is discharged to a collection
hopper and currently shipped to/treated at a permitted hazardous waste treatment facility (Envirite Corporation,
York, Pennsylvania) before disposal. 
In its petition, BSC proposed to stabilize the dewatered filter cake using lime kiln dust and powerplant fly ash. This
process is based on the pozzolanic reaction that adsorbs and/or encapsulates the heavy metals present in the chromium
filter cake into a calcium-alumino-silicate matrix. Based on bench-scale studies of its proposed stabilization
process, BSC proposed using 3 parts lime kiln dust, 2 parts powerplant fly ash to 5 parts dewatered filter cake (by weight)
and 2 parts water to form the stabilized filter cake. Once delisted, BSC plans to dispose of the stabilized filter cake
at an on-site to-be-constructed Subtitle D landfill. 
BSC initially collected a total of four composite samples of its dewatered filter cake during a four-week period between
April 1, 1988 and April 28, 1988. The samples were collected using a scoop as sludge was discharged from the end of the
vacuum filter press. Each composite sample was comprised of grab samples collected over a period of approximately
five days. Portions of the composite samples were then stabilized using lime kiln dust and powerplant fly ash in a bench-scale
process. Specifically, 1,000 grams of dewatered filter cake were mixed with 600 grams of lime kiln dust, 400 grams
of powerplant fly ash, and water and allowed to cure until air-dried. 
BSC provided analysis results for samples of dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake, filter cake samples that had
just been stabilized, and filter cake samples that were allowed to cure for 15 days. Four composite samples of dewatered
(unstabilized) filter cake and four composite samples of stabilized filter cake samples were analyzed for the total
concentrations (

i.e.,

 mass of a particular constituent per mass of waste) of the eight TC metals, nickel, cyanide, zinc, sulfide, and total
oil and grease content. Composite samples of dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake, uncured stabilized filter cake,
and cured stabilized filter cake were also analyzed for EP Toxicity and TCLP leachate concentrations (

i.e.,

 mass of a particular constituent per unit volume of extract) of the eight TC metals (except for barium and selenium)
and nickel. 
On March 18, 1992, BSC submitted additional information which included results from the analysis of four composite
samples of dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake. These samples were collected over a period of four weeks from January
15, 1992 to February 10, 1992. Using a stainless steel scoop, BSC collected grab samples from the middle and both ends
of the filter drum to ensure a representative sample. Each daily composite sample was comprised of 5 grab samples.
After the last grab sample was taken each day, the samples of filter cake were thoroughly mixed to form the daily composite.
All four dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake composite samples were analyzed for total chromium, hexavalent chromium,
and TCLP leachate concentrations of the TC volatile and semivolatile organic compounds.

BSC claims that due to consistent manufacturing and waste treatment processes, the analytical data obtained from
the two sampling events are representative of any variation in the chemically stabilized wastewater treatment filter
cake constituent concentrations. BSC further explained in its petition that the samples collected in January and
February 1992 represent filter cake generated specifically when different combinations of the three plating lines
were operating. 


C. Agency Analysis 


BSC used SW-846 Method 7000 to quantify the total constituent concentrations of arsenic, barium, cadmium,
lead, nickel, selenium, silver, and zinc in the filter cake samples. BSC used an Agency approved Bethlehem Steel Standard
Method
 to quantify the total constituent concentration of chromium in the filter cake samples. BSC used SW-846 Method
3060 to digest the samples, and then followed Method 7195 to analyze/quantify hexavalent chromium concentrations
in the dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake samples. BSC used ``Determination of Mercury in Water By Gold-Film Analyzer'',
to quantify the total constituent concentration of mercury in the filter cake samples. BSC used SW-846 Method
9010 to quantify the total constituent concentration of cyanide in the filter cake samples. BSC used ``Methods for
Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes'' Method 376.1 to quantify the total constituent concentration of sulfide
in the filter cake samples. 




Using SW-846 Method 9071, BSC determined that its stabilized filter cake had a maximum oil and grease content
of 0.099 percent; therefore, the leachate analyses did not have to be modified in accordance with the Oily Waste EP
methodology (i.e., wastes having more than one percent total oil and grease may either have significant concentrations
of constituents of concern in the oil phase, which may not be assessed using the standard leachate procedures, or the
concentration of oil and grease may be sufficient to coat the solid phase of the sample and interfere with the leaching
of metals from the sample). 
BSC used SW-846 Method 1310 (EP)/Method 7000 to quantify the EP leachable concentrations of arsenic, cadmium,
chromium, lead, mercury, nickel, and silver in the filter cake samples, and used modified SW-846 Method 1310
(using distilled waster, instead of acetate buffer, in the extraction) and Method 9010 to quantify the EP leachable
concentration of cyanide in cured stabilized samples. BSC used SW-846 Method 1311 (TCLP)/Method 7000 to quantify
the TCLP leachable concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel, and silver in the filter
cake samples. BSC used SW-846 Method 1320 (MEP)/Method 7000 to quantify the MEP leachable concentrations of
the TC metals (except for barium and selenium) and nickel in the cured stabilized filter cake. 
Table 1 presents the maximum total constituent concentrations of the eight TC metals, nickel, cyanide, zinc, and
sulfide for the dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake and stabilized filter cake.

Table 2 presents the maximum reported or calculated EP or TCLP leachate concentrations for the eight TC metals, nickel,
cyanide (EP analysis only), and zinc. Table 3 presents the leachate concentrations obtained from the MEP leachate
analysis performed on the cured stabilized filter cake. 

The detection limits presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3 represent the lowest concentrations quantifiable by BSC when
using the appropriate SW-846 or Agency-approved analytical methods to analyze its waste. (Detection limits
may vary according to the waste and waste matrix being analyzed, 

i.e.

, the ``cleanliness'' of waste matrices varies and ``dirty'' waste matrices may cause interferences, thus raising
the detection limits). 

BSC used SW-846 Method 1311 (TCLP) to leach, then followed Method 8260 and Method 8270 to quantify the leachable
concentrations of the volatile and semivolatile organic compounds listed in Table 1 of  261.24. Chloroform,
the only detected organic constituent, was found at a maximum concentration of 0.0624 ppm (without blank correction)
in BSC's dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake. Chloroform was also detected at a level of 0.0950 ppm in one of two method
blanks; therefore, its presence in the waste is uncertain and may be attributed to laboratory contamination. 

Last, on the basis of explanations provided by the petitioner, none of the analyzed samples exhibited the characteristics
of ignitability, corrosivity, or reactivity. See  261.21,  261.22 and  261.23.

BSC submitted a signed certification stating that, based on the current annual generation rate of dewatered (unstabilized)
filter cake, the maximum annual generation rate of stabilized filter cake will be 1,476 wet tons (approximately 1100
cubic yards, based on a bulk density of 1.34 tons per cubic yard). The Agency reviews a petitioner's estimates and,
on occasion, has requested a petitioner to re-evaluate estimated waste generation rate. EPA accepts BSC's certified
estimate of 1100 cubic yards per year of stabilized filter cake. 


EPA does not generally verify submitted test data before proposing delisting decisions. The sworn affidavit submitted
with this petition binds the petitioner to present truthful and accurate results. The Agency, however, has maintained
a spot-check sampling and analysis program to verify the representative nature of the data for some percentage of
the submitted petitions. A spot-check visit to a selected facility may be initiated before finalizing a delisting
petition or after granting a final exclusion. The Agency was present at BSC's Sparrow Point facility to observe the
collection of dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake samples on January 23, 1992. 




D. Agency Evaluation 




The Agency considered the appropriateness of alternative waste management scenarios for BSC's chemically stabilized
filter cake and decided, based on the information provided in the petition, that disposal in a municipal solid waste
landfill is the most reasonable, worst-case scenario for this waste. Under a landfill disposal scenario, the major
exposure route of concern for any hazardous constituents would be ingestion of contaminated ground water. The Agency,
therefore, evaluated BSC's petitioned waste using the modified EPA Composite Model for Landfills (EPACML) which
predicts the potential for ground-water contamination from wastes that are landfilled. See 56 FR 32993 (July 18,
1991), 56 FR 67197 (December 30, 1991), and the RCRA public docket for these notices for a detailed description of the
EPACML model, the disposal assumptions, and the modifications made for delisting. This model, which includes both
unsaturated and saturated zone transport modules, was used to predict reasonable worst-case contaminant levels
in ground water at a compliance point (

i.e.

, a receptor well serving as a drinking-water supply). Specifically, the model estimated the dilution/attenuation
factor (DAF) resulting from subsurface processes such as three-dimensional dispersion and dilution from ground-water
recharge for a specific volume of waste. The Agency requests comments on the use of the EPACML as applied to the evaluation
of BSC's petitioned waste. 


For the evaluation of BSC's petitioned waste, the Agency used the EPACML to evaluate the mobility of the hazardous
inorganic constituents detected in the extract from BSC's stabilized filter cake. The Agency's evaluation, using
a maximum annual waste volume estimate of 1100 cubic yards per year and the maximum reported or calculated EP, TCLP,
or MEP leachate concentrations (see Tables 2 and 3), yielded compliance-point concentrations (see Table 4) that
are orders of magnitude below the health-based levels used in delisting decision-making. Maximum leachable levels
from both uncured and cured stabilized waste were below levels of concern.

The maximum reported or calculated leachate concentrations of arsenic, barium, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel,
selenium, and zinc in the stabilized filter cake yielded compliance point concentrations well below the health-based
levels used in delisting decision-making. The Agency did not evaluate the mobility of the remaining inorganic constituents
(

i.e.

, cadmium, silver, and cyanide) from BSC's waste because they were not detected in the leachate using the appropriate
analytical test methods (see Tables 2 and 3). The Agency believes that it is inappropriate to evaluate non-detectable
concentrations of a constituent of concern in its modeling efforts if the non-detectable value was obtained using
the appropriate analytical method. If a constituent cannot be detected (when using the appropriate analytical method
with an adequate detection limit), the Agency assumes that the constituent is not present and therefore does not present
a threat to either human health or the environment. 

As also reported in Table 1, the maximum concentration of total cyanide in BSC's stabilized filter cake is 52 ppm. Because
reactive cyanide is a specific subcategory of the general class of cyanide compounds, the maximum level of reactive
cyanide will not exceed 52 ppm. Thus, the Agency concludes that the concentration of reactive cyanide will be below
the Agency's interim standard of 250 ppm. See ``Interim Agency Thresholds for Toxic Gas Generation,'' July 12, 1985,
internal Agency Memorandum in the RCRA public docket. Lastly, because the total constituent concentration of sulfide
in the stabilized filter cake is 160 ppm (see Table 1), the Agency believes that the concentration of reactive sulfide
will be below the Agency's interim standard of 500 ppm. See ``Interim Agency Thresholds for Toxic Gas Generation,''
July 12, 1985, internal Agency Memorandum in the RCRA public docket. 

As noted previously, chloroform was detected in the TCLP extracts of unstabilized waste, and also in one of the method
blanks. Thus, the presence of chloroform is uncertain and may be attributed to laboratory contamination. However,
the Agency also used the EPACML to evaluate the mobility of chloroform detected in the extract from BSC's dewatered
(unstabilized) filter cake as a worst-case analysis of this constituent. The Agency's evaluation, using a maximum
annual waste volume estimate of 1100 cubic yards per year and a maximum leachate concentration of 0.0624 ppm, yielded
a compliance-point concentration of 0.0006 ppm. Thus, even under these worst-case assumptions, this concentration
is less than the delisting health-based level for chloroform of 0.006 ppm. 

The Agency concluded, after reviewing BSC's processes and raw materials list, that no other hazardous constituents
of concern, other than those tested for, are being used by BSC and that no other constituents of concern are likely to
be present or formed as reaction products or by-products in BSC's waste. In addition, on the basis of explanations
provided by BSC, pursuant to  260.22, the Agency concludes that the waste does not exhibit any of the characteristics
of ignitability, corrosivity, or reactivity. See  261.21,  261.22, and  261.23, respectively.


During its evaluation of BSC's petition, the Agency also considered the potential impact of the petitioned waste
via non-ground water routes (

i.e.,

 air emission and surface runoff). With regard to airborne dispersal in particular, the Agency believes that exposure
to airborne contaminants from BSC's stabilized waste is unlikely. 

BSC's dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake is composed of metal hydroxides, primarily chromic hydroxide, which
is one of the more stable wastes in the environment. BSC's dewatered filter cake will then be stabilized through the
pozzolanic reaction of lime and fly ash, which adsorbs and binds the heavy metals present in the chromium filter cake
into a calcium-alumino-silicate matrix, thereby rendering them essentially immobile. The stabilization product
will ultimately cure into a concrete-like solid material. Therefore, EPA does not believe that airborne exposure
to hazardous contaminants released from BSC's chemically stabilized filter cake is likely to present a hazard to
human health. In addition, there are no significant volatile constituents of concern present in the filter cake for
that could lead to airborne exposure to any organic constituent. 

However, the Agency evaluated the potential hazards resulting from the unlikely scenario of airborne exposure to
hazardous constituents released from BSC's waste in an open landfill. The results of this worst-case analysis indicated
that no substantial present or potential hazard to human health from exposure to particulate emissions from BSC's
waste is likely. A description of the Agency's assessment of the potential impact of BSC's waste, with regard to airborne
dispersal of waste contaminants, is presented in the docket for today's proposed rule. 

The Agency also considered the potential impact of the petitioned wastes via a surface water route. Because BSC's
waste will be stabilized in a solidified form, contamination of surface water is unlikely to occur through particulate
runoff from a landfill containing the BSC's waste. The Agency also believes that containment structures at municipal
solid waste landfills can effectively control surface water run-off, as the recently promulgated Subtitle D regulations
(see 56 FR 50978, October 9, 1991) prohibit pollutant discharges into surface waters.

<PARENT> FR940304-1-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Furthermore, the concentrations of any hazardous constituents dissolved in the runoff will tend to be lower than
the levels in either the TCLP or MEP leachate analyses reported in today's notice, due to the aggressive acid medium
used for extraction in the TCLP and MEP tests. The Agency believes that, in general, leachate derived from the waste
is unlikely to directly enter a surface water body without first travelling through the saturated subsurface zone
where further dilution and attenuation of hazardous constituents will also occur. Significant releases to surface
water through erosion and runoff of landfilled BSC's waste are unlikely due to the solidified concrete form of the
waste. Furthermore, in the unlikely event that BSC's chemically stabilized filter cake reached surface water, the
stabilized form of the waste would mitigate any impact. Leachable concentrations provide a direct measure of the
solubility of a toxic constituent in water, and are indicative of the fraction of the constituent that may be mobilized
in surface water, as well as ground water. The reported TCLP and MEP extraction data show that the metals in BSC's chemically
stabilized filter cake are essentially immobile in aqueous solution. For example, the maximum leachable chromium
level was 0.10 ppm, which is less than 0.0002% of the chromium present in BSC's chemically stabilized filter cake.
Therefore, BSC's waste that might be released to surface water would be likely to remain undissolved. Finally, any
transported constituents would be further diluted in the receiving surface water body due to relatively large flows
of the streams/rivers of concern.

Based on the reasons discussed above, EPA believes that contamination of surface water through run-off from the waste
disposal area is very unlikely. Nevertheless, the Agency evaluated potential impacts on surface water if BSC's waste
were released from a municipal solid waste landfill through run off and erosion (see the docket for today's proposed
rule). The estimated levels of the hazardous constituents of concern in surface water would be well below health-based
levels for human health, as well as below the EPA Chronic Water Quality Criteria for aquatic organisms (USEPA, OWRS,
1987). The Agency, therefore, concluded that BSC's chemically stabilized waste is not a substantial present or potential
hazard to human health and environment via the surface water exposure pathway. 



E. Conclusion 



The Agency believes that BSC's descriptions of its stabilization process and its characterization of waste composition,
in conjunction with the proposed delisting testing requirements, provide a reasonable basis to conclude that the
likelihood of migration of hazardous constituents from the petitioned waste will be substantially reduced, and
thus, that BSC's petition for an upfront conditional exclusion should be granted. The Agency believes that the sampling
procedures used by BSC were adequate, and that the samples are representative of the day-to-day variations in constituent
concentrations found in the stabilized filter cake. The Agency believes that data submitted in support of the petition
show that BSC's proposed stabilization process can render the dewatered filter cake immobile and non-hazardous.
In addition, under the testing provisions of the conditional exclusion, BSC will be required to re-treat or dispose
of as hazardous any batch exhibiting extract levels at or above a specified level (

i.e.,

 ``delisting level'') (see Section F_

Verification Testing Conditions

). 

The Agency proposes to grant a conditional, upfront exclusion to Bethlehem Steel Corporation, located in Sparrows
Point, Maryland, for the stabilized filter cake described in its petition as EPA Hazardous Waste No. F006. The Agency's
decision to exclude this waste is based on process descriptions, characterization of dewatered (unstabilized)
filter cake, and results from the analysis of waste subjected to BSC's proposed stabilization process. If the proposed
rule is finalized, the petitioned stabilized filter cake, provided the conditions of the exclusion are met, will
no longer be subject to regulation under Parts 262 through 268 and the permitting standards of Part 270. 



F. Verification Testing Conditions 



As proposed, verification tests are to be conducted in two phases, initial and subsequent. The initial testing requirements
apply to at least the first eight weeks that BSC stabilizes its dewatered filter cake as described in its petition.
Upon approval by EPA, the subsequent testing requirements apply to the stabilized waste generated after the initial
verification testing period. The proposed conditions also include an annual testing requirement. 

If the final exclusion is granted as proposed, BSC will be required both to verify that the treatment system is on-line
and operating as described in the petition, and to show that, once on-line, the stabilized filter cake continues to
meet the Agency's verification testing limitations (

i.e.,

 ``delisting levels''). These proposed conditions are specific to the upfront exclusion petitioned for by BSC. The
Agency may choose to modify these proposed conditions based on comments that may be received during the public comment
period for this proposed rule. This proposed exclusion for BSC's stabilized filter cake is conditional upon the following
requirements:




(1) 

Testing:

 Sample collection and analyses (including quality control (QC) procedures) must be performed according to SW-846
methodologies. If EPA judges the stabilization process to be effective under the conditions used during the initial
verification testing, BSC may replace the testing required in Condition (1)(A) with the testing required in Condition
(1)(B). BSC must continue to test as specified in Condition (1)(A) until and unless notified by EPA in writing that
testing in Condition (1)(A) may be replaced by Condition (1)(B) (to the extent directed by EPA). 

(A) 

Initial Verification Testing:

 During at least the first eight weeks of operation of the full-scale treatment system, BSC must collect and analyze
weekly composites representative of the stabilized waste. Weekly composites must be composed of representative
grab samples collected from every batch during each week of stabilization. The composite samples must be collected
and analyzed, prior to the disposal of the stabilized filter cake, for all constituents listed in Condition (3). BSC
must report the analytical test data, including a record of the ratios of lime kiln dust and fly ash used and quality
control information, obtained during this initial period no later than 60 days after the collection of the last composite
of stabilized filter cake.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940304-1-00056 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940304-1-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Agency has determined, based on the generation rate of stabilized filter cake, that approximately eight weeks
would be required for BSC to collect sufficient data to verify that a full-scale stabilization process is operating
correctly. The proposed initial testing condition, if promulgated, will require BSC to collect a minimum of eight
composite samples during the first eight weeks that BSC stabilizes its dewatered filter cake. The Agency believes
that proposed initial verification testing is appropriate, because the volume of dewatered (unstabilized) filter
cake to be generated daily is relatively small, and hazardous constituents in the filter cake become immobile after
chemical stabilization. This initial testing condition would ensure that the full-scale treatment system is closely
monitored during the start-up period. If the Agency determines that the data collected under this condition reveal
that the treatment system is not being operated as described in BSC's petition, the exclusion will not cover the generated
stabilized filter cake. If the Agency determines that the data obtained from the initial verification period demonstrates
the treatment process is effective, EPA will notify BSC in writing that the testing conditions in (1)(A) may be replaced
with the testing conditions in (1)(B). 
The Agency believes that the concentrations of the constituents of concern in the stabilized filter cake may vary
somewhat over time. Based on information BSC provided in its petition, total chromium concentrations in the dewatered
(unstabilized) filter cake range from 7.75 percent to 24 percent. To ensure that BSC's stabilization process effectively
handles the variation in chromium concentration in the dewatered filter cake, the Agency is proposing a subsequent
verification testing condition. In addition to chromium, low leachable concentrations of lead and nickel were found
in unstabilized and stabilized filter cake. Thus, the proposed subsequent testing would demonstrate that the stabilization
process is operating as described in the petition and that the stabilized filter cake does not exhibit unacceptable
levels of key toxic constituents (

i.e.

, chromium, lead, and nickel). Therefore, the Agency is proposing to require BSC to analyze monthly composites of
the stabilized filter cake as described in Condition (1)(B). 



(B) 

Subsequent Verification Testing

: Following written notification by EPA, BSC may substitute the testing condition in (1)(B) for (1)(A). BSC must collect
and analyze at least one composite representative of the stabilized filter cake generated each month. Monthly composites
must be comprised of representative samples collected from all batches that are stabilized in a one-month period.
The monthly samples must be analyzed prior to the disposal of the stabilized filter cake for chromium, lead and nickel.
BSC may, at its discretion, analyze composite samples more frequently to demonstrate that smaller batches of waste
are non-hazardous. 



The Agency is also proposing to require BSC to demonstrate, on an annual basis, that the characteristics of the petitioned
waste remain as originally described. Therefore, the Agency is proposing to require BSC to analyze, on an annual basis,
a representative composite sample of the stabilized filter cake for all Toxicity Characteristic (TC) constituents
as described in Condition (1)(C). 



(C) 

Annual Verification Testing:

 In order to confirm that the characteristics of the waste do not change significantly over time, BSC must, on an annual
basis, analyze a representative composite sample of stabilized filter cake for all TC constituents listed in 40 CFR
 261.24 using the method specified therein. This composite sample must represent the stabilized filter cake
generated over one week.

<TEXT>
 

The Agency believes that collecting monthly composite samples will ensure that BSC's stabilization process is not
adversely affected by the potential variability in concentrations of chromium, lead and nickel. The data obtained
from the annual recharacterization of the petitioned waste will assist EPA in determining whether the petitioned
waste is more variable than originally described by the petitioner. The Agency also believes that the annual recharacterization
of the petitioned waste is not overly burdensome to the petitioner and notes that these data will assist the petitioner
in complying with  262.11(c) which requires generators to determine whether their wastes are hazardous, as
defined by the Toxicity Characteristic (see  261.24). 
Future delisting proposals and decisions issued by the Agency may include different testing and reporting requirements
based on an evaluation of the manufacturing and treatment processes, the waste, the volume of waste (including whether
there is a fixed volume of waste), and other factors normally considered in the petition review process. For example,
wastes with variable constituent concentrations, discussed in previous delisting decisions (see 

e.g.

, 56 FR 41286, August 20, 1991, and 56 FR 67197, December 30, 1991), may require more frequent and more extensive continuous
batch testing. 




(2) 

Waste Holding and Handling

: BSC must store, as hazardous, all stabilized filter cake generated until verification testing (as specified in
Conditions (1)(A) and (1)(B)) is completed and valid analyses demonstrate that the delisting levels set forth in
Condition (3) are met. If the levels of hazardous constituents measured in the samples of stabilized filter cake generated
are below all of the levels set forth in Condition (3), then the stabilized filter cake is non-hazardous and may be managed
and disposed of in accordance with all applicable solid waste regulations. If hazardous constituent levels in any
weekly or monthly composite sample equal or exceed any of the delisting levels set in Condition (3), the stabilized
filter cake generated during the time period corresponding to this sample must be retreated until it is below these
levels or managed and disposed of in accordance with Subtitle C of RCRA. 




The purpose of Condition (2) is to ensure that stabilized filter cake which contains hazardous levels of specific
constituents is managed and disposed of in accordance with Subtitle C of RCRA. Holding the stabilized filter cake
until characterization is complete will protect against improper handling of hazardous material. The stabilized
samples must be analyzed for the appropriate parameters, and must meet the appropriate delisting levels in Condition
(3), in order for the waste to be excluded from the hazardous waste regulatory system. 
The Agency selected the set of constituents specified in Condition (3) after reviewing information about the composition
of BSC's unstabilized and stabilized F006 filter cake and descriptions of BSC's manufacturing and treatment processes.
The analytes in Condition (3) include TC metallic constituents currently regulated under  261.24 and nickel.


The Agency established the delisting levels by first back-calculating the maximum allowable leachate concentrations
(MALs) from the health-based levels (HBLs) for the constituents of concern using the EPACML DAF of 96 for BSC's maximum
annual stabilized waste volume of 1,100 cubic yards, 

i.e.

, MAL=HBL  x  DAF. The calculated MALs were then compared with the maximum contaminant concentrations for the
toxicity characteristic (

i.e.

, TC levels) shown in  261.24, as  260.22(d)(3) precludes delisting any waste that exhibits a characteristic.
The delisting levels established in Condition (3) are the lesser of the calculated MALs and the TC levels. Delisting
levels are set at the TC levels for selenium, barium, chromium, and silver. 




(3) 

Delisting Levels

: All concentrations must be measured in the waste leachate by the method specified in 40 CFR 261.24. The leachable
concentrations for the constituents must be below the following levels (ppm): arsenic_4.8; barium_100; cadmium_0.48;
chromium_5.0; nickel_9.6; lead_1.4; mercury_0.19; selenium_1.0; silver_5.0.

 

Condition (4) given below allows BSC to alter the stabilization process (

e.g

., the stabilization reagents) from the process conditions identified during the initial verification testing
under (1)(A). The Agency believes that this condition allows BSC a reasonable amount of flexibility to change and
improve its process, but still requires BSC to notify EPA and to confirm that the process remains effective. 



(4) 

Changes in Operating Conditions

: After completing the initial verification test period in Condition (1)(A), if BSC decides to significantly change
the stabilization process (

e.g.

, stabilization reagents) developed under Condition (1), then BSC must notify EPA in writing prior to instituting
the change. After written approval by EPA, BSC may manage the waste generated from the changed process as non-hazardous
under this exclusion, provided the other conditions of this exclusion are fulfilled. 




Condition (5) given below outlines the procedures BSC must follow in submitting data collected under the conditional
exclusion to EPA. The certification statement that BSC must sign provides added assurance that data provided are
accurate and complete.

(5) 

Data Submittals: 

Two weeks prior to system start-up, BSC must notify in writing the Section Chief, Delisting Section (see address below)
when stabilization of the dewatered filter cake will begin. The data obtained through Condition (1)(A) must be submitted
to the Section Chief, Delisting Section, OSW (OS-333), U.S. EPA, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460 within
the time period specified. The analytical data, including quality control information and records of ratios of lime
kiln dust and fly ash used, must be compiled and maintained on site for a minimum of five years. These data must be furnished
upon request and made available for inspection by EPA or the State of Maryland. Failure to submit the required data
within the specified time period or maintain the required records on site for the specified time will be considered
by the Agency, at its discretion, sufficient basis to revoke the exclusion to the extent directed by EPA. All data must
be accompanied by a signed copy of the following certification statement to attest to the truth and accuracy of the
data submitted: 

``Under civil and criminal penalty of law for the making or submission of false or fraudulent statements or representations
(pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Federal Code, which include, but may not be limited to, 18 U.S.C. 1001
and 42 U.S.C. 6928), I certify that the information contained in or accompanying this document is true, accurate and
complete. 

As to the (those) identified section(s) of this document for which I cannot personally verify its (their) truth and
accuracy, I certify as the company official having supervisory responsibility for the persons who, acting under
my direct instructions, made the verification that this information is true, accurate and complete. 

In the event that any of this information is determined by EPA in its sole discretion to be false, inaccurate or incomplete,
and upon conveyance of this fact to the company, I recognize and agree that this exclusion of waste will be void as if
it never had effect or to the extent directed by EPA and that the company will be liable for any actions taken in contravention
of the company's RCRA and CERCLA obligations premised upon the company's reliance on the void exclusion.'' 




If made final, the proposed exclusion will apply only to the stabilized filter cake generated during the treatment
of dewatered filter cake produced by BSC's Sparrows Point, Maryland facility. In addition, if made final the exclusion
will apply only to the processes and waste volume (a maximum of 1100 cubic yards of stabilized filter cake generated
annually) covered by the original demonstration. The facility would require a new exclusion if either its manufacturing
or treatment processes are significantly altered beyond the changes in operating conditions described in Condition
(4), such that an adverse change in waste composition (

e.g., 

if levels of hazardous constituents increased significantly) or increase in waste volume occurred. Accordingly,
the facility would need to file a new petition for the altered waste. The facility must treat stabilized filter cake
generated either in excess of 1100 cubic yards per year or from changed processes as hazardous until a new exclusion
is granted. 

Although management of the waste covered by this petition would be relieved from subtitle C jurisdiction upon final
promulgation of an exclusion, the generator of a delisted waste must either treat, store, or dispose of the waste in
an on-site facility, or ensure that the waste is delivered to an off-site storage, treatment, or disposal facility,
either of which is permitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage municipal or industrial solid waste. Alternatively,
the delisted waste may be delivered to a facility that beneficially uses or reuses, or legitimately recycles or reclaims
the waste, or treats the waste prior to such beneficial use, reuse, recycling, or reclamation. 



III. Effective Date 



This rule, if made final, will become effective immediately upon final publication. The Hazardous and Solid Waste
Amendments of 1984 amended section 3010 of RCRA to allow rules to become effective in less than six months when the regulated
community does not need the six-month period to come into compliance. That is the case here, because this rule, if finalized,
would reduce the existing requirements for persons generating hazardous wastes. In light of the unnecessary hardship
and expense that would be imposed on this petitioner by an effective date six months after publication and the fact
that a six-month deadline is not necessary to achieve the purpose of section 3010, EPA believes that this exclusion
should be effective immediately upon final publication. These reasons also provide a basis for making this rule effective
immediately, upon final publication, under the Administrative Procedure Act, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d). 



IV. Regulatory Impact 



Under Executive Order 12866, EPA must conduct an ``assessment of the potential costs and benefits'' for all ``significant''
regulatory actions. This proposal to grant an exclusion is not significant, since its effect, if promulgated, would
be to reduce the overall costs and economic impact of EPA's hazardous waste management regulations. This reduction
would be achieved by excluding waste generated at a specific facility from EPA's lists of hazardous wastes, thereby
enabling this facility to treat its waste as non-hazardous. There is no additional impact due to today's rule. Therefore,
this proposal would not be a significant regulation, and no cost/benefit assessment is required. The Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) has also exempted this rule from the requirement for OMB review under section (6) of Executive Order
12866. 



V. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, whenever an agency is required to publish a general
notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory
flexibility analysis that describes the impact of the rule on small entities (

i.e., 

small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions). No regulatory flexibility analysis
is required, however, if the Administrator or delegated representative certifies that the rule will not have any
impact on any small entities.

<DOCNO> FR940304-1-00059 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940304-1-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This rule, if promulgated, will not have any adverse economic impact on any small entities since its effect would be
to reduce the overall costs of EPA's hazardous waste regulations and would be limited to one facility. Accordingly,
I hereby certify that this proposed regulation, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. This regulation, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. 



VI. Paperwork Reduction Act 



Information collection and recordkeeping requirements associated with this proposed rule have been approved by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511,
44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

) and have been assigned OMB Control Number 2050-0053.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; withdrawal.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) withdraws the proposal to list 

Hesperocnide sandwicensis

 (no common name), a plant endemic to the island of Hawaii, Hawaiian Islands, as an endangered species under the U.S.
Endangered Species Act, as amended (Act). Additional field surveys have provided new information revealing that
the species has a wider distribution than previously known. The Service has considered the additional information
and determined that this species is not likely to become either endangered or threatened throughout all or a significant
portion of its range in the foreseeable future, and it does not qualify for listing under the Act.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




Background



On December 17, 1992, the Service published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 59951) a proposal to list 22 plant taxa from the island of Hawaii as endangered or threatened. 

Hesperocnide sandwicensis

 was included in this proposal. During the comment period on the proposal, additional information was received regarding


Hesperocnide sandwicensis

 indicating that individuals are more numerous than previously believed (possibly over 1 million) and they face few
serious threats. The Service has considered the new information and determined that the species does not warrant
listing under the Act. A final rule listing the other 21 plant taxa included in the proposal is published in the 

Federal Register

 concurrently with this notice of withdrawal of 

Hesperocnide sandwicensis

. The final rule contains more detailed information about the status of 

Hesperocnide sandwicensis

.

 NMFS proposes regulations to implement Amendment 2 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Commercial King and
Tanner Crab Fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI). This FMP amendment would establish the Norton
Sound Section of the Northern District of the king crab fishery as a superexclusive registration area. If this amendment
is approved, existing regulations, which supersede State of Alaska (State) regulations that establish Norton Sound
as a superexclusive registration area in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the BSAI, will be removed and reserved.
This action is necessary for the effective management of the fishery having the smallest biomass and guideline harvest
level (GHL) in the BSAI crab fisheries. This action is intended to promote management and conservation of crab and
other fishery resources and to further the goals and objectives contained in the FMP for the Commercial King and Tanner
Crab Fisheries of the BSAI.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 304(a)(1)(D)(ii) of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires the Secretary
to publish regulations proposed by a Council within 15 days of receipt of the amendment and regulations. At this time,
the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) has not determined that the amendment these rules would implement is consistent
with the national standards, other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable laws. The Secretary, in making
that determination, will take into account the information, views, and comments received during the comment period.




Background 



The commercial king and Tanner crab fisheries in the EEZ of the BSAI are managed under the FMP. This FMP was prepared
by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management
Act (Magnuson Act). It is a framework FMP that, with oversight by the Council and Secretary, defers management of the
crab resources in the BSAI to the State. The FMP was approved by the Secretary and implemented on June 2, 1989. At times,
regulations implementing the FMP must be amended to resolve problems pertaining to management of the BSAI crab fisheries.

The State's Board of Fisheries (Board) formulates regulations to manage the crab fisheries under procedures specified
in the State's Administrative Procedure Act. On February 8, 1993, the Board established Norton Sound in the BSAI as
a superexclusive registration area for purposes of managing the Norton Sound red king crab fishery. The operator
of any vessel registered in a superexclusive area would not be able to register the vessel in any other area during that
registration year. This management measure was proposed to address the unique collection of problems that make fishery
management difficult in Norton Sound. The problems are associated with conservation and management of a fishery
with a small biomass, small guideline harvest level (GHL), and a stock on the edge of its geographic range, which makes
it biologically sensitive. The problems include overcapitalization, short seasons, high management costs, and
both over-harvest and under-harvest of GHLs. Historically, the fishery has been characterized by years with low
levels of participation and fairly high catch rates followed by years with high levels of participation and low catch
rates. A combination of factors has led to high participation, which is expected to continue into the future. These
factors are primarily the overcapitalized crab fleet and participants' efforts to establish catch histories in
the event individual fishing quotas (IFQs) are instituted. Superexclusive registration would be expected to create
a management environment discouraging participation by large crab vessels and catcher/processors. Probable results
are a slower-paced fishery, fuller attainment of GHLs, a longer season, and reduced administrative and enforcement
costs. 


The Alaska Crab Coalition (ACC) appealed the State's designation of Norton Sound as a superexclusive registration
area. Following Secretarial review of the State's action, the Secretary issued an interim final rule that superseded
State regulations establishing Norton Sound as a superexclusive registration area in the EEZ of the BSAI (58 FR 38727,
July 20, 1993). This action was necessary because the Secretary had determined that designation of superexclusive
registration areas was inconsistent with provisions of the FMP. The FMP contains three categories of management
measures: (1) Specific Federal management measures that require an FMP amendment to change; (2) framework type management
measures, with criteria set out in the FMP that the State must follow when implementing changes in State regulations;
and (3) measures that are neither rigidly specified nor frameworked in the FMP, and which may be freely adopted or modified
by the State, subject to an appeals process or other Federal laws. Registration areas are listed as a Category 2 measure.
Section 8.2.8 of the FMP specifies that king crab registration areas may be designated as either exclusive or nonexclusive.
Designation of a registration area as superexclusive would require an FMP amendment and incorporation into the FMP
as a Category 1 management measure. 


In July 1993, the Council requested proposals for possible amendments to the FMP. On August 13, 1993, the Board submitted
a proposal to designate Norton Sound as a superexclusive registration area. This proposal was reviewed by the crab
FMP plan team, which ranked it as a high priority and recommended it to the Council for consideration. At its September
1993 meetings, the Council recommended analysis of the Board's proposal. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G)
and NMFS prepared a draft analysis for the proposed FMP amendment to designate Norton Sound as a superexclusive registration
area. The draft analysis was reviewed by the Council and its Advisory Panel (AP) and Scientific and Statistical Committee
(SSC) during the Council's December 1993 meetings and adopted for public review. At its January 1994 meetings, the
Council considered the testimony and recommendations of the AP, SSC, fishing industry representatives and the general
public on the proposed action to designate Norton Sound as a superexclusive registration area. The Council adopted
the proposed action under Amendment 2 to the FMP and requested NMFS to remove existing regulations at 50 CFR 671.20,
which supersede existing State regulations designating Norton Sound as a superexclusive registration area. 




Classification 




NMFS prepared an IRFA as part of the RIR, which concludes that this proposed rule, if adopted, could have significant
effects on small entities. Overall, superexclusive registration area designation likely will result in a transfer
of participation and income from a predominantly large-vessel fleet to a predominantly small-vessel fleet. Twenty-six
vessels registered and fished in Norton Sound in 1992, and Norton Sound crab contributed no more than 0.7 percent to
any of these vessels' crab landings for the year. Norton Sound crab contributed no more than 1.6 percent of the total
for any of the catcher/processors in 1990. Neither operators of individual vessels nor participants in the pre-1993
fleet were dependent on this fishery in terms of year-to-year participation or landings within any one year.

Not knowing the outcome of the ACC's appeal and Secretarial review, many vessel owners chose not to register for the
Norton Sound fishery in 1993. Twenty-eight percent of the vessels that were registered were from the local region.
A new fresh market for summer king crab was developed and resulted in higher ex-vessel prices than that received for
crab that are processed and frozen. Local residents are maintaining plans to develop this market further. Most of
the fishermen on the small vessels are expected to be unemployed if they do not participate in this fishery. The infusion
of employment and income from the 1993 small vessel fishery was significant in the Nome area. The 1993 king crab fishery
represented the largest fishery in the region in terms of income.

Superexclusive registration is predicted to result in an increase in retained revenues and possibly to improve market
conditions for increasing overall revenues. It is expected to reduce industry compliance costs. The economic impact
on small entities under the proposed action would not result in a reduction in annual gross revenues of more than 5 percent,
annual compliance costs that increased total costs of production by more than 5 percent, or compliance costs for small
entities that are at least 10 percent higher than compliance costs as a percent of sales for large entities. A copy of
this analysis is available from the Council (see

I. Introduction 


a. Authority 



Part B of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, Public Law 94-163, as amended by the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act, Public Law 95-619, by the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act, Public Law
100-12, by the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988, Public Law 100-357, and the
Energy Policy Act of 1992, Public Law 102-486
 created the Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products other than Automobiles. The consumer products subject
to this program (often referred to hereafter as ``covered products'') are: Refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers
and freezers; dishwashers; clothes dryers; water heaters; central air conditioners and central air conditioning
heat pumps; furnaces; direct heating equipment; television sets; kitchen ranges and ovens; clothes washers; room
air conditioners; fluorescent lamp ballasts; and pool heaters; as well as any other consumer product classified
by the Secretary of Energy. Section 322. To date, the Secretary has not so classified any additional products. 





Under the Act, the program consists essentially of three parts: testing, labeling, and Federal energy conservation
standards. The Department, in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is required
to amend or establish new test procedures as appropriate for each of the covered products. Section 323. The purpose
of the test procedures is to produce test results that measure the energy efficiency, energy use, or estimated annual
operating cost of a covered product during a representative average use cycle or period of use and shall not be unduly
burdensome to conduct. Section 323 (b)(3). A test procedure is not required if DOE determines by rule that one cannot
be developed. Section 323 (d)(1). Test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, subpart B. 


The Federal Trade Commission is required by the Act to prescribe rules governing the labeling of covered products
for which test procedures have been prescribed by DOE. Section 324(a). These rules are to require that each particular
model of a covered product bears a label that indicates its annual operating cost and the range of estimated annual
operating costs for other models of that product. Section 324(c)(1). Disclosure of estimated operating cost is not
required under section 324 if the Federal Trade Commission determines that such disclosure is not likely to assist
consumers in making purchasing decisions, or is not economically feasible. In such a case, the Federal Trade Commission
must require a different useful measure of energy consumption. Section 324(c). At the present time there are Federal
Trade Commission rules requiring labels for the following products: room air conditioners, furnaces, clothes washers,
dishwashers, water heaters, refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers, central air conditioners and
central air conditioning heat pumps, and fluorescent lamp ballasts. 44 FR 66475, November 19, 1979, 52 FR 46888, December
10, 1987, and 54 FR 28031, July 5, 1989. 




For each of the 12 covered products, the Act prescribes an initial Federal energy conservation standard. Section
325(b)-(h). The Act establishes dates of applicability for the standards in 1988, 1990, 1992 or 1993, depending on
the product, and specifies that the standards are to be reviewed by the Department within 3 to 10 years, also depending
on the product. Section 325(b)-(h). After the specified period, DOE may promulgate new standards for each product;
however, the Secretary may not prescribe any amended standard which increases the maximum allowable energy use,
or decreases the minimum required energy efficiency of a covered product. Section 325(l)(1). The Department's current
review of standards is for room air conditioners, water heaters, direct heating equipment, mobile home furnaces,
kitchen ranges and ovens, pool heaters and fluorescent lamp ballasts and is considering establishing energy conservation
standards for television sets. Section 325(g)(4)(A). 



Any new or amended standard is required to be designed so as to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency
that is technologically feasible and economically justified. Section 325(l)(2)(A). 



Section 325(l)(2)(B)(i) provides that before DOE determines whether a standard is economically justified, it must
first solicit comments on a proposed standard. After reviewing comments on the proposal, DOE must then determine
that the benefits of the standard exceed its burdens, based, to the greatest extent practicable, on a weighing of the
following seven factors: 

(1) The economic impact of the standard on the manufacturers and on the consumers of the products subject to such standard;


(2) The savings in operating costs throughout the estimated average life of the covered product in the type (or class)
compared to any increase in the price of, or in the initial charges for, or maintenance expenses of, the covered products
which are likely to result from the imposition of the standard; 

(3) The total projected amount of energy savings likely to result directly from the imposition of the standard; 

(4) Any lessening of the utility or the performance of the covered products likely to result from the imposition of
the standard; 

(5) The impact of any lessening of competition, as determined in writing by the Attorney General, that is likely to
result from the imposition of the standard; 

(6) The need for national energy conservation; and 

(7) Other factors the Secretary considers relevant. 


In addition, section 325(l)(2)(B)(iii) establishes a rebuttable presumption of economic justification in instances
where the Secretary determines that ``the additional cost to the consumer of purchasing a product complying with
an energy conservation standard level will be less than three times the value of the energy savings during the first
year that the consumer will receive as a result of the standard, as calculated under the applicable test procedure* * *.''



Section 327 of the Act addresses the effect of Federal rules on State laws or regulations concerning testing, labeling,
and standards. Generally, all such State laws or regulations are superseded by the Act. Section 327(a)-(c). Exemptions
to this general rule include: (1) State standards prescribed or enacted before January 8, 1987, and applicable to
appliances produced before January 3, 1988 (section 327(b)(1)); (2) State procurement standards which are more
stringent than the applicable Federal standard (Section 327(b)(3) and (f)(1)-(4)); (3) State regulations banning
constant burning pilot lights in pool heaters (Section 327(b)(4)); and (4) State standards for television sets effective
on or after January 1, 1992, may remain in effect in the absence of a Federal standard for such product (Section 327(b)(6)
and 327(c)). 



b. Background 



The National Energy Conservation Policy Act required DOE to establish mandatory energy efficiency standards for
each of the 13 covered products.
 These standards were to be designed to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency that was technologically
feasible and economically justified. 





The National Energy Conservation Policy Act provided, however, that no standard for a product be established if there
were no test procedure for the product, or if DOE determined by rule either that a standard would not result in significant
conservation of energy, or that a standard was not technologically feasible or economically justified. In determining
whether a standard was economically justified, the Department was directed to determine whether the benefits of
the standard exceeded its burdens by weighing the seven factors discussed above. 


The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act, which became law on March 17, 1987, amended the Energy Policy and
Conservation Act in part by: redefining ``covered products'' (specifically, refrigerators, refrigerator- freezers,
and freezers were combined into one product type from two; humidifiers and dehumidifiers were deleted; and pool heaters
were added); establishing Federal energy conservation standards for 11 of the 12 covered products; and creating
a schedule, according to which each standard is to be reviewed to determine if an amended standard is required. 

The National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988, which became law on June 28, 1988, established Federal
energy conservation standards for fluorescent lamp ballasts. These amendments also created a review schedule for
DOE to determine if any amended standard for fluorescent lamp ballasts is required. 

The Energy Policy Act of 1992, which became law on October 24, 1992, addressed various commercial appliances and equipment.


As directed by the Act, DOE published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking with a 75-day comment period that ended
December 12, 1990, for the eight products subject to today's rulemaking. 55 FR 39624, September 28, 1990. (Hereafter
referred to as the September 1990 advance notice). The September 1990 advance notice presented the product classes
that DOE planned to analyze, and provided a detailed discussion of the analytical methodology and analytical models
that the Department expected to use in performing the analysis to support this rulemaking. The Department invited
comments and data on the accuracy and feasibility of the planned methodology and encouraged interested persons to
recommend improvements or alternatives to the Department's approach. The comments in response to the advance notice
are addressed in Sections II and III of this notice.

a. Energy Descriptors



As discussed above, the Act established initial energy conservation standards for all of the covered products except
television sets. Some of these standards were of a prescriptive form, such as the requirement of a no heat dry option
for dishwashers, and others were performance standards, stated in terms of an energy descriptor, such as seasonal
energy efficiency ratio for central air conditioners, annual fuel utilization factor for furnaces, etc. The intent
of these standards, and the subsequent required DOE analyses and rulemaking regarding amending the standards, is
to save energy. In conducting rulemakings and analyses required by the Act to determine if standards should be amended,
the Department previously determined that the form of a standard may need to change in order to evaluate the efficiency
standards. For example, the final rule issued for dishwashers changed the standard from the initial prescriptive
standard to a performance standard based on an energy descriptor. 56 FR 22250, May 14, 1991. Additionally, the Department
has determined in this rulemaking that energy descriptors may need to be changed when it is found they do not account
for all of the energy or all types of energy consumed by an appliance. Not to change these energy descriptors would result
in an incomplete analysis and could lead to standards being met by utilizing unaccounted energy resulting in products
that might satisfy the energy descriptor but result in little or no total energy savings. Examples of unaccounted
energy are the pilot light energy of a pool heater which is not accounted for by the current energy descriptor of Thermal
Efficiency or the electrical fan energy of a gas furnace which is not accounted for by the current energy descriptor
of the annual fuel utilization factor. Accordingly, the Department is proposing in today's notice to change the energy
descriptors of the initial standards for direct heating equipment, mobile home furnaces, and pool heaters.



b. Test Procedures



For each product discussed in today's proposed rulemaking there is an applicable DOE test procedure to evaluate its
energy efficiency.

A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would amend the test procedures for mobile home furnaces, direct heating equipment,
and pool heaters was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 23, 1993 (58 FR 44538); in addition, another Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which includes amendments to
the test procedures for clothes washers, water heaters, ranges and ovens is being published.



c. Technological Feasibility



1. General



For those products and classes of products discussed in today's notice, DOE believes that the efficiency levels analyzed,
while not necessarily being realized in production, are technologically possible. The technological feasibility
of the design options are addressed in the product-specific discussion. The Department's criteria for evaluating
design options for technological feasibility are that the design options are already in use by the respective industry,
or that research has progressed to the development of a prototype.



2. Maximum Technologically Feasible Levels



The Act requires the Department, in considering any new or amended standards, to consider those that ``shall be designed
to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible
and economically justified.'' (Section 325 (l)(2)(A)). Accordingly, for each class of product under consideration
in this rulemaking, a maximum technologically feasible (max tech) design option was identified. The max tech level
is one that can be carried out by the addition of design options, both commercially feasible and prototypes, to the
baseline units.
 The Department believes that in identifying the max tech level a unit must be capable of being assembled, but not necessarily
mass produced, by the effective date of the amended standards. Manufacturing ability is determined under economic
justification. For example, in the November 1989 Final Rule, DOE concluded that evacuated panels for refrigerators
was a technically feasible design option since refrigerators had been produced on a limited scale with this technology
included. However, DOE concluded that this technology was not economically justified because the chemical industry
would not be able to make sufficient quantities of the raw materials commercially available by the effective date
of the standard.





The max tech levels were derived by adding energy-conserving engineering design options to the respective classes
in order of decreasing consumer payback. For example, the max tech level for room air conditioners includes higher
efficiency fan motors, which were added early, and variable speed compressors, which were added later because of
their slower payback. A complete discussion of each max tech level, and the design options included in each, is found
in the 

Engineering Analysis.

 See Technical Support Document, Chapter 3.

Tables 2-1 through 2-8 present the Department's max tech performance levels for all classes of the subject
products:

The Department believes that these are the max tech levels from an engineering analysis standpoint. Each of the levels
was evaluated in accordance with the economic justification factors specified in the Act to determine economic justification.


The Department evaluated each max tech level to determine if it would be economically justified at the time the standards
would become effective. The Department rejected energy conservation standards that had unacceptable impacts on
consumers or manufacturers (e.g., unusually long payback periods and substantially adverse impacts on manufacturers'
returns on equity).

d. Energy Savings



1. Determination of Savings



The Department forecasted energy consumption through the use of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy
Model, which forecasted energy consumption over the period of analysis for candidate standards and the base case.
The Department quantified the energy savings that would be attributable to a standard as the difference in energy
consumption between the candidate standard's case and the base case. The base case represents the forecasts of outputs,
e.g., prices, operating expenses, energy consumption, shipments, and manufacturer impacts in the absence of new
or amended standards.

The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy Model was used by DOE in previous standards rulemakings. The
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy Model is explained in the Technical Support Document accompanying
this notice. (See Appendix B to that document for a detailed discussion of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential
Energy Model.) The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy Model contains algorithms to project average
efficiencies, usage behavior, and market shares for each product.

COMMEND is the Commercial Energy End-Use Model. It was developed by the Electric Power Research Institute, to characterize
energy end-use in the commercial sector. For this rulemaking, the Commercial Energy End-Use Model is being used to
evaluate more stringent standards on fluorescent lamp ballasts, which are found principally in the commercial sector
of the economy.

The market share calculations contain the following steps: potential purchasers may purchase any competing technology
within an end-use, or none. For room air conditioners, fluorescent lamp ballasts, and television sets, the decision
to purchase or not is modeled, and the fraction of the total that chooses each class, e.g., F40T12 lamps, F96T12 lamps,
etc., is specified exogenously. For the other products, along with the considerations above, the choice of fuel is
modeled. Long-term market share elasticities have been assumed with respect to equipment price, operating expense,
and income. The effects of standards are expected to be lower operating expense and increased equipment price. The
percentage changes in these quantities are used, together with the elasticities, to determine changes in sales volumes
resulting from standards. Higher equipment prices will decrease sales volumes, while lower operating expenses
will increase them. The net result depends on the standard level selected, and associated equipment prices and operating
expenses.

The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy Model and the Commercial Energy End-Use Model (for ballasts
only) are used to project energy use over the relevant time periods for seven of these products with and without amended
standards, and, in the case of televisions, with and without standards. By comparing the energy consumption projection
at alternative standard levels with the legislated standards, the Department estimated the amount of energy projected
to be saved during the period 1996-2030.
 The energy saved is expressed in quads, i.e., quadrillions of British thermal units (Btu). With respect to electricity,
the savings are quads of source or primary energy, which is the energy necessary to generate and transmit electricity.
The Act defines ``energy use'' as the quantity of energy directly consumed by a consumer product at point of use. This
is generally called ``site'' energy, as opposed to ``source'' energy. There are major differences between these
types of energy. From data that remains rather constant over the years, the amount of electrical energy consumed at
the site is less than one-third of the amount of source energy that is required to generate and transmit the site electrical
energy.
 Therefore, it is important to identify whether the electricity involved is site or source energy.






The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy Model projections are dependent on many assumptions. Among
the most important are responsiveness of household appliance purchasers to changes in residential energy prices
and consumer income, future energy prices, future levels of housing construction, and options that exist for improving
the energy efficiency of appliances. The Commercial Energy End-Use Model projections are dependent upon changes
in commercial energy prices, future construction of commercial floorspace, responsiveness of building owners
to future energy and equipment prices and to utility demand-side management programs, and options for improving
the energy efficiency of lighting. As is the case with any complicated computer model simulation, the validity of
the outputs is critically dependent on the inputs.

2. Significance of Savings.



Under section 325(l)(3)(B) of the Act, the Department is prohibited from adopting a standard for a product if that
standard would not result in ``significant'' energy savings. While the term ``significant'' has never been defined
in the Act, the U.S. Court of Appeals, in 

Natural Resources Defense Council

 v. 

Herrington

, 768 F.2d 1355, 1406 (DC Cir. 1985), concluded that Congressional intent in using the word ``significant'' was to
mean ``non-trivial.''

e. Rebuttable Presumption



The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act established new criteria 
for determining whether a standard level is economically justified. Section 
325(l)(2)(B)(iii) states:




``If the Secretary finds that the additional cost to the consumer 
of purchasing a product complying with an energy conservation standard 
level will be less than three times the value of the energy savings 
during the first year that the consumer will receive as a result of the 
standard, as calculated under the applicable test procedure, there shall 
be a rebuttable presumption that such standard level is economically 
justified. A determination by the Secretary that such criterion is not 
met shall not be taken into consideration in the Secretary's 
determination of whether a standard is economically justified.''




If the increase in initial price of an appliance due to a conservation 
standard would repay itself to the consumer in energy savings in less than 
three years, then it is presumed that such standard is economically 
justified.
 This presumption of economic justification can be rebutted upon a proper showing. 






f. Economic Justification 



As noted earlier, Section 325(l)(2)(B)(i) of the Act provides seven 
factors to be evaluated in determining whether a conservation standard is 
economically justified. 



1. Economic Impact on Manufacturers and Consumers 



The engineering analysis identified improvements in efficiency along with the associated costs to manufacturers
for each class of product. For each design option, these costs constitute the increased per-unit cost to manufacturers
to achieve the indicated energy efficiency levels. Manufacturer, wholesaler, and retailer markups will result
in a consumer purchase price higher than the manufacturer cost. 

To assess the likely impacts of standards on manufacturers, and to 
determine the effects of standards on different-sized firms, the Department 
used a computer model that simulated hypothetical firms in the eight 
industries under consideration. This model, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory 
Manufacturer Impact Model, is explained in the Technical Support Document. 


See

 Technical Support Document, Appendix C. The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Manufacturer Impact Model provides a
broad array of outputs, including shipments, price, revenue, net income, and short- and long-run returns on equity.
An ``Output Table'' lists values for all these outputs in the base case and in each of the standards cases under consideration.
It also gives a range for each of these estimates. A ``Sensitivity Chart'' shows how returns on equity would be affected
by a change in any one of the model's nine control variables. 

For consumers, measures of economic impact are the changes in purchase 
price and annual energy expense. The purchase price and annual energy 
expense, i.e., life-cycle cost, of each standard level are presented in 
Chapter 6 of the Technical Support Document. Under section 325 of the Act, 
the life-cycle cost analysis is a separate factor to be considered in 
determining economic justification. 


2. Life-cycle Costs. 

One measure of the effect of proposed standards on consumers is the change in operating expense as compared to the change
in purchase price, both resulting from standards. This is quantified by the difference in the life-cycle costs between
the base and standards cases for the appliance classes analyzed. The life-cycle cost is the sum of the purchase price
and the operating expense, including installation and maintenance expenditures, discounted over the lifetime
of the appliance.

<DOCNO> FR940304-1-00075 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940304-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The life-cycle cost was calculated for the range of efficiencies in the 
Engineering Analysis for each class in the year standards are imposed, using 
real consumer discount rates of 2, 6, and 10 percent. The purchase price is 
based on the factory costs in the Engineering Analysis and includes a factory 
markup plus a distributor and retailer markup. Energy price forecasts are 
taken from the 1991 Annual Energy Outlook of the Energy Information 
Administration. (DOE/Energy Information Administration_0383(91)). 
Appliance usage inputs are taken from the relevant test procedures. 




3. Energy Savings 



While the significant conservation of energy 
is a separate statutory requirement for imposing an energy conservation 
standard, the Act requires DOE, in determining the economic justification of a 
standard, to consider the total projected savings that are expected to result 
directly from revised standards. The Department used the Lawrence Berkeley 
Laboratory Residential Energy Model results, discussed earlier, in its 
consideration of total projected savings. The savings for the eight products 
are provided in Section IV of this notice. 



4. Lessening of Utility or Performance of Products 



This factor cannot be quantified. In establishing classes of products and design options, the Department tried to
eliminate any degradation of utility or performance in the eight products under consideration in this rulemaking.
That is, to the extent that comments, or the Department's own research, indicated that a product included a utility
or performance-related feature that affected energy efficiency, a separate class with a different efficiency standard
was created for that product. In this way, the Department attempted to minimize the impact of this factor as a result
of the standards that were analyzed. 



5. Impact of Lessening of Competition



It is important to note that this factor has two parts; on the one hand, it assumes that there could be some lessening
of competition as a result of standards; and on the other hand, it directs the Attorney General to gauge the impact,
if any, of that effect. 


In order to assist the Attorney General in making such a determination, 
the Department studied the affected appliance industries to determine their 
existing concentrations, levels of competitiveness, and financial 
performances. This information will be sent to the Attorney General. See 
Technical Support Document, Chapter 7. The Department has also provided the 
Attorney General with copies of this notice and the Technical Support Document 
for her review. 




6. Need of The Nation to Conserve Energy



The results of the environmental effects from each standard level for each product will be reported under this factor
in the product specific discussion (Section IV) of this notice. 




7. Other Factors



This provision allows the Secretary of Energy, in determining whether a standard is economically justified, to consider
any other factors that the Secretary deems to be relevant. The Secretary is seeking comments on two issues which may
be considered in this rulemaking. The issues are (1) the incremental impact of appliance conservation standards
on energy use, consumers, manufacturers and other factors (See the discussion regarding rebuttable presumption
under General Analytical Comments) and, (2) the extent to which any proposed national efficiency standard is likely
to disproportionally affect identifiable groups of consumers and whether the analysis should be modified to consider
such impacts in the selection of efficiency standard levels (See the discussion regarding other comments under Product-Specific
Comments for Direct Heating Equipment). 



III. Discussion of Comments



The Department received 90 written comments in response to the September 
1990, advance notice. These comments addressed all aspects of the analysis. 
In this section, the Department will present discussions of the general 
analytical issues raised by the comments, followed by discussions of the 
product-specific issues.

a. General Analytical Comments 


Discount Rates


The Department's plans to use a 7 percent discount rate in the 
standards' analyses drew more comments than any other issue. (American 
Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 6; Public Citizen, No. 7 at 
4; Wayne Goode, No. 8 at 1; Ohio Sierra Club, No. 11 at 1; Natural Resources 
Defense Council, No. 13 at 5 and appendix; Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 
1; Citizens Environmental Coalition Education Fund, Inc. No. 18 at 1; 
California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 2; Advance Transformer, No. 25 at 3; 
Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 1; Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 
at 2; Champaign County (IL) Board, No. 36 at 1; Washington Gas Light, Inc., 
No. 37 at 2; George Smith, No. 38 at 1; Lone Star Gas Co., No. 39 at 2; 
Florida Energy Office, No. 42 at 2; Sierra Club, No. 43 at 2; Ohio Office of 
the Consumers' Council, No. 60 at 7; Helen Satterthwaite, No. 67 at 1; Warren 
Widener, No. 78 at 1; and Martin Frost, No. 80 at 1).
 Most of the comments asserted that the 7 percent rate was unjustifiably high, while several stated that a 7 percent
or even higher rate was an appropriate rate for the various analyses. 





Commentators seeking a higher rate focused on consumer impacts, while 
those advocating a lower rate generally pointed to societal benefits. These 
different perspectives are not easily captured in a single discount rate. The 
Department has reconsidered the issue, and has decided that multiple discount 
rates, with each pertaining to a different perspective, are warranted. These 
different rates (i.e., consumer, commercial and societal) are used to capture 
the impacts of the standards on different constituents. The consumer and 
commercial rates are used to calculate life-cycle costs for purchasers of 
residential and commercial products, respectively. The social discount rate 
is used to calculate the net present value of standards for the Nation as a 
whole. Separate rates, therefore, were used for the consumer sector, the 
commercial sector (since fluorescent lamp ballasts are purchased primarily by 
commercial firms), and for society as a whole. This discussion will describe 
the derivations of the consumer, commercial and social discount rates that 
were used in the different analyses. 

1. 

Consumer discount rate. 

On November 17, 1989, DOE published a final 
rule for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, freezers, and small gas 
furnaces (54 FR 47916, November 17, 1989), hereafter referred to as the 
November 1989 final rule. In the November 1989 final rule, DOE selected a 7 
percent discount rate, based on a methodology derived from the Court of 
Appeals decision, 

Natural Resources Defense Council 

v. 

Herrington, 

768 F.2d 
1355, 1406 (D.C. Cir 1985). As discussed in the November 1989 final rule, 
the applicability of the court decision changed somewhat with the passage of 
the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-514). The Tax Reform Act phased out 
the deductibility of interest paid on consumer loans. Based on the revised 
methodology, DOE calculated a range of discount rates that consumers incur; 
this range is from less than 1 percent to slightly more than 15 percent. As 
explained in the November 1989 final rule, DOE selected 7 percent for the 
analysis for purposes of that rulemaking proceeding because it was near the 
mid-point of the potential consumer discount rates. In addition, DOE believes 
that the approach is reasonable in that it was related to the opportunity cost 
of money for purchasing consumer durables. As such, it was justified in terms 
of alternate consumer purchases that are foregone in order to finance the 
purchases of appliances. 
In a subsequent final rule on energy conservation standards for 
dishwashers, clothes washers, and clothes dryers (56 FR 22250, May 14, 1991), 
hereafter referred to as the May 1991 final rule, the Department restated that 
the 7 percent rate was near the mid-point of the range of consumer finance 
rates for the purchase of appliances. It was further stated that if the 
Department could obtain data on the methods that consumers use to purchase 
appliances, it could develop a weighted-average, real, after-tax finance rate 
to use as a consumer discount rate in the analysis. 
In its comments on the September 1990 advance notice, Whirlpool 
Corporation offered estimates of consumer financing of purchases of its 
equipment: 40 percent of retail sales are paid in cash; 35 percent use credit 
cards; 25 percent use retailer loans. These figures excluded new home 
construction, which accounts for approximately 25 percent of Whirlpool 
Corporation's total sales. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 1-2 and Appendix 
1.) 
While Whirlpool Corporation represents only one source of data, the 
Department has no reason to believe that Whirlpool Corporation's customers 
differ from those of other manufacturers, and, therefore, accepted Whirlpool 
Corporation's estimates as representative. 
These numbers were applied to the real, after-tax finance rates that are 
incurred by consumers, as reported in the November 1989 final rule. Those 
rates were estimated to be just over 3 percent for appliances purchased as 
part of a new home (whose finance rate is a tax-deductible mortgage interest 
rate), to slightly under 1 percent for cash purchases, to more than 15 percent 
for credit card purchases.

<TEXT>
 

When these rates were applied to Whirlpool Corporation's estimates, the 
resulting weighted-average, real, after-tax rate incurred by consumers in 
appliance purchases was approximately 6 percent. The Department, then, used 6 
percent for the consumer discount rate in the analyses, with sensitivities at 
4 and 10 percent. The Department believes that this range of discount 
sensitivities will capture the real, after-tax rates that consumers encounter 
in financing the purchase of an appliance. 
The Department recognizes however, that there remains considerable 
uncertainty in this estimate of the average consumer discount rate. There are 
numerous possible financial interactions that could be involved in the 
purchase of an appliance. For example, a credit card purchase could be paid 
in full within the customary billing grace period, thereby being exempt from 
finance charges, and, in effect, resembling a cash purchase. This would tend 
to put downward pressure on the weighted-average range of purchase financing 
choices. On the other hand, a cash purchase may actually be financed, 
indirectly, by an increase in credit card debt. This would tend to put upward 
pressure on the weighted-average range of purchase finance rates. Furthermore, this analysis does not take into
account varying consumer 
perceptions of the value of reducing current consumption in favor of longer- 
term financial gains. For these reasons, the Department continues to solicit 
data that might provide a more complete basis for the derivation of a consumer 
discount rate used in these analyses. 
Furthermore, while financing rates may indicate the direct financial 
impact to consumers of an investment in increased efficiency, they do not 
reflect either other types of investments available to them, or varying 
consumer perceptions of the value of reducing current consumption in favor of 
longer-term financial gains. For example, what value of energy savings does a 
consumer need to receive from an investment in an energy efficient 
refrigerator in order to justify reducing savings, increasing debt, or 
delaying the purchase of other consumer goods? 
The costs of consumer financing does not indicate whether there are 
similar investment opportunities, available to most consumers, that produce 
higher rates of return. For example, are there home improvements or other 
investments that could be made by most consumers that would have higher rates 
of return than an investment in an energy-efficient appliance? Also, a 
consumer discount rate based on consumer financing expenses does not fully 
account for the risks of individual consumer investments in improved appliance 
efficiency. For example, the actual rates of return experienced by individual 
consumers may vary widely depending on energy prices, appliance usage and 
useful life. 
Some have argued that implicit discount rates estimated through an 
examination of actual consumer purchases of appliances and related consumer 
equipment would be a better basis for the consumer discount rate used under 
this program. Various studies have indicated that these implicit discount 
rates range from 3 percent to as high as 100 percent (or more) for certain 
appliances. However, because implicit discount rates are based on actual 
consumer purchase behavior, they also reflect the extent to which the numerous 
potential market failures in energy efficiency investments occur, such as 
inadequate information, conflicting owner/renter incentives, and second party 
(builder/contractor) purchases. One of the major reasons why Federal 
appliance efficiency standards were originally established was to overcome 
these market failures regarding investment in energy efficiency. 
Consequently, DOE does not believe unadjusted (i.e., not corrected for 
potential biases) discount rates derived from actual consumer behavior should 
be used in evaluating the economic impact of proposed standards on consumers. 
This conclusion appears to be supported by court rulings affecting the 
program. In 

Natural Resources Defense Council 

v. 

Herrington, 

768 F.2d 1355, 
1406 (DC Cir. 1985), the court stated that ``the entire point of a mandatory 
program was to change consumer behavior'' and ``the fact that consumers demand 
short payback periods was itself a major cause of the market failure that 
Congress hoped to correct.'' The Department believes that the intent of the 
legislation which established the appliance standards program is to achieve 
energy savings which are being foregone because of market failures which 
distort consumer decision-making (and behavior) from investing in energy 
efficiency. 
However, if information were available on the implicit discount rates 
revealed by consumer decision-making in the absence of any significant market- 
failure biases, it might provide a better basis for the discount rates to be 
used in assessing the impacts on consumers of proposed appliance efficiency 
standards. Another approach might be to examine the rate of return consumers 
would require from other fixed investments of comparable risk and liquidity. 
The Department solicits information on the results of any analyses that could 
support the derivation of discount rates using either of these approaches.

On the other hand, the nature of the appliance standards program may 
imply that a household average required rate of return, whether based on 
actual appliance purchase decisions (in the absence of potential market 
failure distortions) or on comparable investments, may understate the 
appropriate rate. Because the Act requires minimum standards, their effect is 
generally greater on the low-efficiency, low purchase-price end of the market, 
sometimes eliminating the lowest-priced models. To the extent that low-income 
households purchase a disproportionate share of these low-efficiency/low-price 
appliances, they will be disproportionately represented among the affected 
consumers. 

At the same time, limited empirical research
 suggests that these 
households exhibit higher-than-average discount rates (i.e., required rates of 
return) across all of their time-sensitive decisions, including (but not 
limited to) their appliance purchases. If, indeed, these households are 
disproportionately affected by standards, their discount rates would need to 
be given greater weight in determining the effects of alternative standard 
levels on consumers. The Department seeks comment on this issue. 





Based on the information now available, it appears that the average 
consumer discount rate lies in the range of 4 to 10 percent. As discussed 
above, the Department has used a 6 percent consumer discount rate for the 
analyses in this rulemaking. The Department has conducted sensitivity 
analyses using the 4 to 10 percent range and will continue to solicit data and 
comments that would provide a better basis for the derivation of consumer 
discount rates. 

2. 

Commercial discount rate. 

For a discount rate that would be 
applicable in the fluorescent ballast analysis, the Department believes that 
one based on consumer expenses is inappropriate; the rate should be based on 
costs in the commercial sector, since fluorescent lamp ballasts are purchased 
for use primarily in that sector. In developing a rate for use in the 
commercial sector, the Department considered a procedure similar to the 
procedure used to develop a consumer discount rate, and examined possible 
methods of financing purchases of more efficient lighting equipment. One such 
method would be to finance a loan. For the most credit-worthy customers, the 
prime rate of interest would be applicable. Tables 15 and 21 of the 
DRI/McGraw-Hill 

Review of the U.S. Economy; Long-Range Focus; Winter 1990-91 


presented forecasts of prime interest rates and percentage changes in the 
consumer price index (CPI) for each year between 1995 and 2015. During this 
period, the prime rate is expected to be fairly stable, ranging from 8.37 
percent to 8.50 percent. The changes in the consumer price index are 
projected to range from 3.88 percent to 4.90 percent. The resulting real 
rates of interest are projected to range from 3.55 percent in 2014 to 4.64 
percent in 1995, with a 21-year average of 3.85 percent.

<PARENT> FR940304-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Most companies, of course, are not eligible for prime-rate loans. For 
them, the terms of borrowing are generally less favorable. While 
DRI/McGraw-Hill does not forecast long-term, non-prime loan rates, some 
insight can be gained from how such loans rates differ from prime loan rates. 

Based on a telephone conversation with the Federal Reserve System, DOE 
learned that most commercial loans were in the 6 percent to 15 percent range. 
Using the higher rate, 15 percent, and deducting the applicable changes in the 
consumer price index, the Department calculated real rates of interest ranging 
from 10.1 percent in 2014 to 11.2 percent in 1995, with a 21-year average of 
10.46 percent. 

Alternatively, the Department looked at the divergence of the 15 percent 
loans from the then current prime rate; such loans were 50 percent greater 
than the 10 percent prime rate prevailing in 1990. By applying a 50 percent 
increase to the projected prime interest rates, the Department obtained 
nominal rates of interest of 12.56 percent to 12.75 percent. After a 
deduction of the expected changes in the consumer price index, real rates of 
interest ranged from 7.76 percent to 9.87 percent, averaging 8.05 percent over 
the 21-year period. 

Another possible financing mechanism would be for the corporation to 
finance the purchase of the more efficient equipment by displacing investment 
capital. In Table 8 of DRI/McGraw-Hill's forecasts, there are annual 
projections of the after-tax costs of financial capital for each year between 
1995 and 2015. After converting the numbers to pre-tax costs, and after 
deducting the expected changes in the consumer price index, the Department 
obtained the respective real rates of interest. The costs of financial 
capital are projected to range from 11.61 percent in 1995 to 12.86 percent in 
2015. The consumer price index rates forecasts are the same as before, and 
the resulting real finance rates range from 7.67 percent in 2000 to 7.96 
percent in 2015, with the 21-year average being 7.86 percent. 

Of the different possible means of companies paying for conservation 
improvements in lighting equipment, the range of real rates of interest is 
from 3.55 percent to 11.12 percent. 

Economic theory suggests that in deriving a commercial discount rate, 
the Department should consider the opportunity costs of commercial investments 
that were foregone. Therefore, the Department also investigated real rates of 
return from commercial investment activities between 1961 and 1990. These 
data were compiled from Annual Statistical Digests of the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System. The variables that were examined were 
commercial trade credit, i.e., bankers acceptances; time deposits, i.e. 
certificates of deposits; U.S. Treasury securities; and commercial paper. 
During the 30-year period, the average real investment returns realized in the 
commercial sector ranged from 2.02 percent for bankers' acceptances (which 
constituted 70 percent of the investment dollars), to 2.29 percent for 
investments in Treasury securities (which constituted 9 percent of commercial 
investment dollars). 

When more risky investments, such as tax-exempt (class B) and corporate 
(AA) bonds were examined, their real rates were 1.27 percent and 3.52 percent, 
respectively, over the 1970-to-1986 period. These real rates, too, were 
substantially outside of the purchase finance range. The real rates for such 
bonds in earlier years also fell below the purchase financing range of rates. 

After considering the above, the Department elected to use four percent 
as the commercial discount rate. The Department believes that this rate 
approximates the real costs likely to be incurred by private businesses which 
are able to finance small additional investments in energy efficiency by 
reducing relatively liquid corporate investments, e.g., bankers' acceptances, 
or by obtaining loans at or near the prime interest rate, without diminishing 
their normal business investment. 

However, if increasing investments in more energy efficient technology 
are assumed to displace other, more profitable business investments, or would 
require loans available only at more typical commercial interest rates, the 
approximate discount rate would be higher. For example, between 1980 and 
1991, the real rates of return to nonfinancial corporations averaged between 7 
and 8 percent based on data contained in Table 1.16 of the National Income and 
Product Accounts, as presented in the Department of Commerce's 

Survey of 
Current Business 

and, as noted above, real commercial interest rates often 
exceeded 7 percent.

The Department invites comment on the most appropriate methodology upon 
which to base the commercial discount rate and the best types and sources of 
data to use in the calculation of this rate. 

3. 

Social discount rate. 

In identifying a discount rate that is 
appropriate for use in calculating benefits to the Nation as a whole, the 
Department must consider the opportunity costs of devoting more economic 
resources to the production and purchase of more energy-efficient appliances 
and fewer national resources to other alternative types of investment. It is 
not necessary, however, to determine the characteristics of specific classes 
of consumers or businesses directly impacted by the proposed standard. For 
these reasons, a broad measure of the average rates of return earned by 
economic investment throughout the United States is the most useful basis for 
a social discount rate. 

Using this approach, the Office of Management and Budget prepared a 
Background on OMB's Discount Rate Guidance in November of 1992, containing an 
analysis of the average annual real rate of return earned on investments made 
since 1960 in nonfinancial corporations, non-corporate farm and non-farm 
proprietorships, and owner-occupied housing in the United States. The results 
of this analysis indicated that since 1980, the annual real rate of return for 
these categories of investments averaged slightly more than 7 percent, ranging 
from a low of about 4 percent for owner-occupied housing (which represented 
about 43 percent of total capital assets in 1991 of about $15 trillion) to a 
high of about 9 percent on non-corporate farm and non-farm capital (which 
represented about 23 percent of the total). Between 1960 and 1980, the 
average real rate of return on capital was higher, averaging about 8.5 percent 
in the 1970's and about 11.2 percent in the 1960's. As a result of this 
analysis, the Office of Management and Budget chose to designate 7 percent as 
the social discount rate specified in revisions to Office of Management and 
Budget Circular A-94 issued on November 10, 1992 (57 FR 53519). In that 
revised circular, Office of Management and Budget established, 

inter alia,

 discount rate guidance for benefit-cost analyses of regulatory programs that 
provide benefits and costs to the general public. 

An alternative method for deriving such social discount rate might be 
broad measures of the costs of financing capital investments in the United 
States. One such measure is the Federal Government's cost of borrowing or the 
interest rate that is payable on long-term Government securities. Another 
might be the prime interest rate available to major corporate borrowers. In 
order to derive a real discount rate from either of these measures the 
relevant interest rate would be adjusted for inflation. 

With regard to long-term Government securities as an example, the 
nominal rates during June 1991 on Government securities maturing between the 
years 2000 and 2015 averaged 8.55 percent. Adjusted by long term forecasts of 
inflation, the rate would be approximately 4 percent. Because the Government 
borrowing rate most accurately reflects the direct cost to the Government of 
added investment, the Office of Management and Budget has used this approach 
as the basis for discount rates used in evaluating Federal investments which 
directly affect Federal costs (such as energy efficiency investments in 
Federal facilities). Using the prime interest rate or some combination of 
rates to reflect non-Federal financing costs would result in somewhat higher 
rates. 

As indicated above, because the cost of financing additional capital 
investments does not reflect the full opportunity cost of shifting private 
investment from one area to another, it is not considered to be a good basis 
for deriving discount rates. For this reason, DOE is now proposing the use of 
a 7 percent social discount rate in National net present value calculations, 
although it will also perform sensitivity analyses at 4 percent and 10 
percent. The Department seeks comment on appropriate discount rates for the 
analysis. 



Life-Cycle Cost Analysis 


Another consumer issue that drew a considerable number of comments was 
the suggestion that in its life-cycle cost analyses, the Department include 
any additional installation and maintenance expenses that may result from 
conservation standards. (Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 10; Energen, No. 
12 at 2; American Gas Association, No. 23 at 2; Florida Energy Office, No. 42 
at 1; Southern Natural Gas Company, No. 46 at 1; Montana-Dakota Utilities 
Company, No. 54 at 4; Laclede Gas Company, No. 55 at 4; Oklahoma Natural Gas 
Company, No. 57 at 3; ENTEX, No. 58 at 4-5; Gas Research Institute, No. 59 at 
1; Arkansas Western Gas Company, No. 64 at 7; Piedmont Natural Gas Company, 
No. 71c at 4; Public Service Company of North Carolina, Inc., No. 74 at 4; 
Southern California Gas Company, No. 79 at 1; and Louisiana Gas Service 
Company, No. 81 at 2).

<TEXT>
 

In each of the consumer analyses, such as payback and life-cycle costs, 
the Department did include all incremental expenses caused by standards. For 
those design options entailing additional maintenance expenses (beyond the 
base case), the incremental maintenance expenses were included in the consumer 
price of the design option. Installation expenses that were specific to the 
design option and independent of the application were also included in the 
consumer price of the design option. 



Regional and Other Variations in Impacts 



Several comments recommended that the Department look at regional 
variations in usages of some climate-sensitive products, e.g., direct heating 
equipment. (Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 10; United Texas Transmission 
Company, No. 26 at 3; Florida Energy Office, No. 42 at 1; Arkansas Western Gas 
Company, No. 64 at 3; and Minnegasco, No. 83 at 2.). 

The standards analysis assumes that nationwide average appliance usage 
rates, energy prices, and efficiency applied to all consumers in all areas of 
the nation, although the Department recognizes that there exist large 
variations in each of these factors. However, the Department did conduct a 
sensitivity analysis on the life-cycle cost for energy prices by substituting 
various high and low regional prices for national prices. The results of 
these sensitivities are presented in the Technical Support Document. See 
Technical Support Document, Chapter 4. However, these sensitivity analyses 
were performed at the national level, and no effort is made to link them with 
any specific population groups. 

The Department seeks information concerning the extent to which any 
proposed national efficiency standard is likely to affect identifiable groups 
of consumers disproportionally and how best to consider such impacts in the 
selection of efficiency standard levels. The Department is also seeking 
additional data to help it better assess the disproportionate impacts on such 
groups. 



Usage 


On a related issue, numerous comments suggested that the usage variables 
the Department should use are those that are calculated from field usage data. 
In addition, many of the comments provided estimates of annual operating 
expenses of several of the appliances, e.g. water heaters, direct heating 
equipment, and ranges and ovens. (Southern Gas Association No. 4 at 4; __ 
American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 2; Whirlpool 
Corporation, No. 31 at 17, 19; Washington Gas Light, No. 37 at 5; Lone Star 
Gas Company, No. 39 at 3; Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 
8; Columbia Gas, No. 45 at 3; Southern Natural Gas Company, No. 46 at 1; 
Montana-Dakota Utilities Company, No. 54 at 3; Laclede, No. 55 at 4; Oklahoma 
Natural Gas Company, No. 57 at 3, 5; Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers, No. 61A at 36; Arkansas Western Gas Company, No. 64 at 6; 
Peoples Natural Gas Company, No. 65 at 1; Northern Minnesota Utilities, No. 68 
at 1; Minnegasco, No. 83 at 2; and Flair, No. 85 at 2). 

The Department appreciates the data it received. The Department also 
obtained data on unit energy consumption by appliance type, principally from 
utility companies. The Department reviewed the data received from all sources 
and generated what it believes are the best estimates of energy consumption 
which are contained in the proposed test procedure amendments for mobile home 
furnaces, direct heating equipment, pool heaters and kitchen ranges and ovens 
discussed above, and were used in the analyses for today's notice. 

As noted above, regional energy prices were used in sensitivity 
analyses. Additionally, in the proposed test procedure amendments, the usage 
for mobile home furnaces and direct heating equipment have been modified from 
a national basis to a regional one to reflect the mostly regional distribution 
of these products. 



Rebound Effect 


Two comments raised the issue of rebound effects, which occur when an 
appliance that is made more efficient is used more intensively, so that the 
expected energy savings from the efficiency improvement do not fully 
materialize. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 5; 
Washington Gas Light, No. 37 at 2). American Council for an Energy Efficient 
Economy commented that the consumer sees and reacts to his or her total 
utility bill, so any efficiency change in a particular product that has a 
small impact on his or her total utility bill should not affect usage 
behavior. Washington Gas Light suggested that usage elasticities should be 
decided by rigorous analyses of regional appliance usage characteristics.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940304-1-00082 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940304-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In this rulemaking, the rebound effects assumed were: 30 percent for 
direct heating equipment and mobile home furnaces, 20 percent for room air 
conditioners, and 10 percent for ranges and ovens. These percentages 
represent the amounts by which the potential energy savings from standards are 
reduced. 

There is, however, an argument that the usage elasticities/rebound 
effects for at least some household uses of energy may be substantial. Within 
a household, the price elasticity of demand will be an average of the 
elasticities of demand for each end use, e.g. appliance. For example, suppose 
the price elasticity of demand at the household level is .3. If some levels 
of appliance usage (say refrigerators) are insensitive to price changes, i.e., 
zero elasticity, then at least one other use must have an elasticity in excess 
of .3. 

If the usage elasticity for a product is identical to the price 
elasticity of demand for the energy the product uses, then it follows that the 
weighted average of the usage elasticities of all household uses must equal 
the household price elasticity of demand. Since the appliances subject to 
energy efficiency standards account for more than 80 percent of household 
consumption, it would be unlikely that all appliances would have usage 
elasticities less that the overall household price elasticity of demand. 

According to the Energy Information Administration, the household price 
elasticity of demand for electricity is about .15 in the short run and upward 
of .7 in the long run. Thus usage elasticities, should, on average 
approximate these estimates. The Department seeks comments on this argument. 



Marginal Electricity Rates




American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, Natural Resources 
Defense Council, and Washington Gas Light all urged the Department to use 
marginal electricity rates rather than average ones. (American Council for an 
Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 6; Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 
13 at 18; and Washington Gas Light, No. 37 at 3). American Council for an 
Energy Efficient Economy and Natural Resources Defense Council both stated 
that since room air conditioners are run disproportionately during periods of 
peak utility load (when rates are the highest), the use of average electricity 
rates will undervalue the electricity savings from improved efficiency. 

The Department agrees that use of average electricity prices can produce 
inaccuracies and does attempt to use energy prices specific to each end use. 
In the past, electricity rates have been assumed higher for air conditioning 
than for other end uses, based on survey data of consumer expenditures, 
disaggregated according to equipment ownership. The consumer analysis for 
this proposed rule continues to distinguish energy prices by end use, based on 
such survey results. 

Washington Gas Light added that in addition to using marginal 
electricity prices, the Department should use the All-Ratepayers Test when 
measuring the cost effectiveness of a standard level. This test was developed 
by the California Public Utilities Commission, and it measures the impact of 
an action on all ratepayers, including non-participants in the conservation 
activity. (Washington Gas Light, No. 37 at 13). 

In this program the Department examines the effect of energy conserved 
by each purchaser of a more efficient appliance, but does not examine the 
effects that the aggregate conservation effects would impose on the rates 
charged within a given utility. The impacts on any system's rates from 
increased energy standards would depend on the participation rates of its 
customers in the conservation activity and the particular financial position 
of the utility. 

Several comments discussed the impact of energy conservation standards 
on low-income people. (Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 2; 
Southern Union Gas Company, No. 46 at 1; Laclede, No. 55 at 5; Oklahoma 
Natural Gas Company, No. 57 at 5; and Public Service Company of North 
Carolina, Inc., No. 74 at 5). While the Rocky Mountain Institute stated that 
with improved energy efficiency, the prices of used appliances could be 
expected to decline in the short run, the other comments all stated that the 
higher prices that would be caused by improved efficiency standards on new 
units would have price-increasing effects on used appliances and, therefore, 
be harmful for lower-income and elderly consumers on fixed incomes.

<TEXT>
 

The Department conducted literature searches on purchasing and usage 
decisions in low-income households, to determine whether the inputs of the 
consumer analysis should be adjusted to account for differences between low- 
and average-income households. There was no information available on which to 
base any changes to the consumer analysis. 



Lighting Prices 



Another consumer issue was raised by Valmont Electric, which stated that 
new energy conservation standards on fluorescent ballasts would raise the 
retail prices of such ballasts, thereby impeding the conversion from 
incandescent lighting to fluorescent lighting. (Valmont Electric, No. 16 at 
2). 

Conversions from incandescent lighting to fluorescent lighting occurs 
principally through compact fluorescent bulbs, the ballasts of which are not 
included as part of the review of the legislated fluorescent ballast 
conservation standards. Any revised energy conservation standards on 
fluorescent ballasts will not affect the prices of compact fluorescent bulbs 
and thereby slow the conversion from incandescent to fluorescent lighting. 



Heat Pump Water Heaters 



On the issue of consumer acceptance of heat pump water heaters, 
Crispaire Corporation stated that studies show consumer satisfaction with 
them. (Crispaire Corporation, No. 19 at 1). In addition, the company 
provided attachments with estimates of unit energy consumption and annual 
performance factors for heat pump and resistance water heaters. 

The Department appreciates the information provided and used the cited 
studies in developing data for the consumer analysis and forecasting efforts. 



Appliance Lifetimes 



Two comments discussed product lifetimes. Wisconsin Blue Flame Council 
stated that pilot lights decrease condensate, thereby extending the tank life 
of gas water heaters. (Wisconsin Blue Flame Council, No. 33 at 2). 

The Department based product lifetimes on an analysis comparing recent 
replacement sales to historical shipments, and researched the effects of 
particular design options on product life. 

Air Energy Heat Systems said that the lifetime of heat pumps for pool 
heaters is approximately the same as for air conditioning, if the water 
chemistry of the pool is maintained in proper balance. (Air Energy Heat 
Systems, No. 44 at 1). 

The Department did not analyze heat pump pool heaters because no test 
procedure is available. 



Modeling 



There were several issues raised with regard to the forecasting efforts 
in the analyses. For example, Natural Resources Defense Council suggested 
that the Department model uncertainty, not point forecasts in economic growth 
and consumer choice and further suggested that the Department could model 
uncertainties in economic growth by modeling high-, mid-, and low-growth 
scenarios. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 35-36). 

The Department recognizes that all forecasts contain uncertainties. The 
principal method by which DOE has accounted for uncertainties has been through 
sensitivity analyses, which, in the past, have been performed on equipment 
prices, energy prices, projected equipment efficiencies and market discount 
rates (the last of which models uncertainties in consumer choices of 
efficiency). 

The Department favors an explicit representation of the uncertainty in 
the forecasts. Clearly, the best representation would be a statistical 
treatment of the uncertainty in each of the important variables, including the 
coefficients used in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy 
Model. At this time, however, such a specification of the distribution of 
each of the variables and coefficients does not exist. As the Lawrence 
Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy Model is updated, such distributions 
will be generated, which will allow the Department to work towards the 
capability to perform an uncertainty analysis in the model. Until then, the 
Department will model uncertainties with sensitivities.

On the other hand, Natural Resources Defense Council endorsed the 
Department's different assumptions used when calculating energy savings and 
net present value. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 36). 

For this rulemaking, the Department maintained the current methodologies 
for calculating energy savings and net present value. 



Ballast Energy; Use Forecasting



Advance Transformer Company recommended that the Department exclude 
fluorescent lamp ballasts from incorporation in the Lawrence Berkeley 
Laboratory Residential Energy Model because of their small number of sales in 
the residential sector. (Advance Transformer Company, No. 25 at 3). 

The Department did exclude fluorescent lamp ballasts from incorporation 
in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy Model. Instead, the 
Department analyzed fluorescent lamp ballasts in the commercial sector using 
the Electric Power Research Institute end-use model and the Commercial Energy 
End-Use Model. 



Television Sets



With regard to television power and usage forecasts, the Electronics 
Industries Association stated that television sets of newer vintage draw less 
power than those of older vintage. To support this, Electronic Industries 
Association presented data for the period 1967-1991. (Electronic Industries 
Association, No. 30 at 2). 

Thomson Consumer Electronics, Inc. provided data on the energy 
consumption of color televisions by size, and asserted that the most important 
factor in energy usage is viewing habits, specifically, the number of 
concurrently operating televisions in a household, the number of daily 
operating hours for each receiver, and control settings, i.e., brightness and 
sound levels. (Thomson Consumer Electronics, Inc., No. 49 at 3-5). 

The Department welcomes the additional data provided in the comments. 
The Department agrees that the energy consumption of a television set is a 
function of vintage. It was included in a previous analysis
 and is included in the analysis for this proposed rule. 





The Department also agrees that the number of television sets per 
household and number of viewing hours are determinants of energy usage, and 
included these factors in its forecasts. On the other hand, while the 
Department recognizes that control settings are important, it does not expect 
them to be different in the future than from today, and, therefore, it did not 
forecast them. 



Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy Model



Two comments addressed the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential 
Energy Model methodology and documentation. Whirlpool Corporation stated that 
it had no strong concerns with the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential 
Energy Model at this time. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 1). The Florida 
Energy Office said that the Department should document, well before the final 
rule, all model assumptions. In addition, the Florida Energy Office offered 
to provide Florida-specific data to the Department. (Florida Energy Office, 
No. 42 at 2, 6). 

The Department will continue to use the basic Lawrence Berkeley 
Laboratory Residential Energy Model methodology, but will incorporate updates 
to data and coefficients for specific products as new analyses proceed. The 
model assumptions and data for this rulemaking are documented in the Technical 
Support Document accompanying this proposed rule. 



Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model



1. 

Modeling. 

There were numerous comments on the manufacturer impact 
analysis. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool 
Corporation made several suggestions for improving the modeling of 
manufacturer impacts. 

The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers suggested that the 
Department devote more modeling efforts to developing demand curves that are 
empirically verifiable. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A 
at 66).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940304-1-00085 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940304-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In response, the Department notes that many of the demand curves used in 
the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model were derived from 
those that were empirically estimated by Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 
1976.
 The Department recognizes that a project to update the demand curves could be useful, considering the age of the data
currently being used. The Department does not believe that such data exist. However, the Department 
requests that if such data does exist that it be submitted as comment on 
today's proposed rule. 





2. 

Product mix. 

The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact
Model should, but does not, take into account the effect that standards have on the relative 
prices among product classes, which in turn will change the product mix 
demanded by the market. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A 
at 67). 

The Department did take cross-elasticity effects into account in the 
analysis of water heaters (between electric and gas fuels) where they were 
particularly important, and will continue to look for instances where such 
effects may arise in order to take those effects into account as warranted. 
(See Technical Support Document, Volume F, Appendix B). 

3. 

Market power. 

The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers was 
critical of the way the Department models marketplace monopsony power, i.e., 
the market power of purchasers. In its critique, the Association of Home 
Appliance Manufacturers stated that the ability of manufacturers to pass on 
increased costs to the consumer is limited because their customers are 
primarily a group of large and sophisticated retailers who have significant 
and increasing power in the marketplace, and who exert downward pressure on 
the retail prices of appliances. It further stated that the Lawrence Berkeley 
Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model attempts to model the situation by 
modeling a larger number of manufacturers than actually exist in the 
marketplace. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said that no 
theoretical underpinnings were given for this assertion and that there is no 
reason why the predictions of this ``false model'' should have any resemblance 
to what actually transpires in the real world. (Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers, No. 61A at 67-68). 

The Department believes that oligopsony power itself could probably be 
modeled analogously to oligopoly power. There is, however, no accepted theory 
on the modeling of an industry characterized by both oligopoly and oligopsony. 
Thus, DOE detailed the assumptions and relevant mathematical derivations of 
the approach in the aforementioned Technical Support Document for the final 
rule for dishwashers, clothes washers, and clothes dryers. The approach is to 
increase the number of firms input into the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory- 
Manufacturer Impact Model until the markups that are actually observed in the 
marketplace are achieved; this is also an obvious implication of The 
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers's comments that manufacturers' 
ability to pass on costs is limited. In fact, the most prominent comments 
from a review panel on the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact 
Model indicated a concern that the modeling assumptions had gone too far in 
the direction of reduced markups.






4. 

Individual firm. 

There were also three comments critical of the 
Department's modeling of an individual firm. It was argued that the use of a 
``typical firm'' does not address the differential impacts of standards on 
companies, e.g., sizes, costs, niche markets. The Association of Home 
Appliance Manufacturers insisted that the Department could address the lack of 
data in performing this type of analysis by researching the economic 
literature or by developing an economic theory of how different classes of 
manufacturers would be affected by standards. Whirlpool Corporation suggested 
addressing the data problem by putting a range on the cost and margin data. 
(Advance Transformer, No. 25 at 3; Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 1; 
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 68-69). 

The problem is essentially a lack of data. The Department's review of 
the economic literature offered no solution to this problem. The Department 
does analyze the cost and margin data (in addition to other parameters) by 
performing a sensitivity analysis where the Department changes those 
parameters (and others) in the model, and tests the sensitivity of the model's 
results. 

During interviews conducted with manufacturers, the Department asked a 
series of questions covering the effects of firm size and specialization. To 
date, DOE has not been given information by the industry to draw conclusions 
about probable effects.

<TEXT>
 

While it would be desirable to analyze the impact of standards on the distribution of firms in an industry, fundamentally,
this requires detailed information on how individual firms differ from the norm. 

Stating that the primary concern to manufacturers is the short-run industry impact from standards, Whirlpool Corporation
and the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers called for the Department to present greater focus on, or explanation
of, short-run impacts. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 1; Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A
at 69-70). 

There are limitations to such an analysis. While general impacts may be understood, the specific details of how each
firm reacts at each point of the short-run adjustment process are beyond the ability of economic theory to elucidate.
The Department believes that it has treated the short run properly by modeling it on the short-run impact of the downturn
from a business cycle. In addition, in considering standard levels to propose, the Department did take explicit account
of the short-run Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results. 

The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers suggested that more detailed analysis of the impacts on individual
firms and other areas should be done. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers commented that an analysis
of how industry will fare, on average, belies the very serious effects that adjustment can have, especially if standards
force a company in a small community to close. Therefore, it is important, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers
believes, that DOE evaluate these potential short-term and individual company impacts. (Association of Home Appliance
Manufacturers, No 61A at 70). 

In the analyses to date, the Department has used industry profitability as the best single indicator of plant closures
and other significant disruptions on manufacturers. Further, the primary impact variables of returns on equity,
net income, revenue, price, and shipments have been presented as the best summary statistics with which to capture
the significant impacts resulting from standards. 

5. 

Multiple standards.

 In another comment, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that firms face constraints on the share
of their resources that can be devoted to meeting each new wave of conservation standards from DOE. The cumulative
impact of each new rulemaking on manufacturers' resources must be considered in evaluating manufacturer impacts.
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 70-72). 

The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model is designed to analyze the impact of standards on industry
profitability for an individual appliance. To date, this has involved treating each manufacturer of a subject product
as a separate company. Recognizing, however, that many of the manufacturers produce more than one appliance type
subject to these rulemakings, and recognizing that those companies may have limited resources to comply with the
requirements of all of the relevant regulations, the Department is presently seeking approaches to account for the
cumulative effects on a multi-product company of the appliance conservation standards that it promulgates and requests
comments in this regard. 

6. 

Variable costs.

 On another manufacturer issue, Whirlpool Corporation criticized the Department's assumption that pricing relates
only to variable costs. Whirlpool Corporation suggested, instead, that changes in fixed costs do have an impact on
pricing in an industry. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 1). 

The Department acknowledges that firms may try to pass on fixed costs; however, standard economic theory concludes
that even monopolists will find this unprofitable, and will eventually decide not to try it. The Department has seen
no argument or evidence to the contrary. It is interesting to note that if Whirlpool Corporation were correct, the
manufacturers who decided to do so would be impacted far more favorably by standards than the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer
Impact Model predicted. 



Consumer Demand 



Whirlpool Corporation stated the Department assumes that consumers will pay more for energy efficiency. Whirlpool
Corporation claims studies have shown this has not been true. In support, Whirlpool Corporation supplied a list of
20 key buying factors from an August 1988 McKinsey study. Energy efficiency placed tenth in consideration for kitchen
products. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31, at Attachment 2). 

The Department notes that energy efficiency placed ahead of other factors such as ``lowest price available among
similar makes and models,'' ``has an extended service agreement at a fair price,'' and ``runs quietly.'' These results
tend to support the Department's position that consumers are willing to pay for energy efficiency.

Rebuttable Presumption



For consideration of rebuttable presumptions, the Association of Home 
Appliance Manufacturers stated that incremental payback, not cumulative 
payback, are the appropriate payback for standards. (Association of Home 
Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 64). 

Since the legislation requires that payback be considered from a 
standard level compared to the base case, DOE believes that only cumulative 
payback may be used for the rebuttable presumption determination. 
Additionally, the other impacts of appliance conservation standards on energy 
use, consumers, manufacturers, and other factors were determined by comparing 
projections under the base case
 with the projections under the proposed standards. 





Standards Decision Making 



Natural Resources Defense Council and the Rocky Mountain Institute 
addressed the Department's standards selection criteria. Both Natural 
Resources Defense Council and the Rocky Mountain Institute stated that in 
deciding the economic justification of standards, the Department should not be 
attempting to maximize the economic benefits to consumers, but should instead 
be maximizing energy savings. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 
16; Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 2). 

In response, the Department recognizes that the basic statutory 
direction to set standards is to achieve the ``maximum improvement in energy 
efficiency that the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and 
economically justified'' (section 325(l)(2)(A). DOE notes that the economic 
impact of standards on consumers is only one of the factors the Department 
considers in reaching its decision to set conservation standards. Other 
factors include impacts on manufacturers and on national benefits and costs. 
However, regarding consumer benefits, while the minimum consumer life-cycle 
cost point is selected as a trial standard level, and in many cases, the most 
stringent standard level that the Secretary determined was economically 
justified coincided with that level, several of the proposed standard levels 
have life-cycle costs that exceed the minimum life-cycle cost. Thus, 
maximizing consumer benefits does not take precedence over maximizing energy 
savings. 

Natural Resources Defense Council further stated that in deciding on 
standard levels, the Department must first consider the most stringent level 
of efficiency, i.e., the ``max tech'' level, and if it is economically 
justified, DOE must set the standard at that level. If it is not economically 
justified, DOE must then consider the next most stringent level, and if 
economically justified, set the standard at that level. (Natural Resources 
Defense Council, No. 13 at 17). 

The Department does consider candidate standard levels in this manner. 
However, in making its determination as to whether a standard is economically 
justified, the Department considers both: The benefits and costs of the 
standard level under consideration relative to the base case; and how these 
benefits and costs compare to the benefits and costs of other standards 
analyzed by the Department in the technical support document for this rule. 

Currently the costs and benefits of all candidate standard levels are 
analyzed in comparison to the base case. However, it is possible that more 
direct comparisons of the impacts of different standard levels may be useful. 
In light of the above, the Department specifically solicits comment on whether 
any incremental perspectives would be useful and valid in the determination as 
to whether a particular standard level is ``economically justified.'' 

The Florida Energy Office stated that after considering all relevant 
costs and benefits over the life of the appliance, the Department should set 
standards at the highest levels that are cost-effective to the nation. 
(Florida Energy Office, No. 42 at 1).

As stated above, consideration of the national costs and benefits of the 
impacts of candidate standard levels was one of the factors considered in this 
rulemaking. (See Technical Support Document, Chapter 8.) 


External Costs and Benefits 


A number of comments on the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking urged 
the Department to consider the external costs and benefits in its economic 
analyses of the efficiency standards proposed in this Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking. For example, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy 
suggested that DOE account explicitly for environmental costs in its economic 
analysis. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 6.) In 
addition, Public Citizen stated that the Department should include in its 
analyses all external costs and benefits, e.g., environmental quality, 
national security, and reduced energy imports. (Public Citizen, No. 7 at 4.) 
The Sierra Club stated that the difference between ``Consumer Analysis'' 
and ``Life-Cycle Cost Analysis'' is difficult to ascertain. They urged DOE to 
evaluate, as part of the Consumer Analysis; (a) environmental external costs; 
and, (b) national security and balance-of-payments costs of increased/decreased 
oil consumption. (Sierra Club, No. 43 at 2.) 
The Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council said that the consumer and 
utility analyses should include monetization of externalities (environmental 
and security) such as sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen 
oxides, particulate, and other air, water, and land use impacts of energy 
production and use. Such considerations should be consistent with current 
trends in state utility regulations. (Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council, 
No. 60 at 2.) 
The Department recognizes that appliance standards may generate external 
societal benefits arising from reductions in oil imports, and emissions of 
SO

2

, NO

x

, and CO

2

 and perhaps other pollutants. In this proposed rulemaking, 
as in previous rulemakings, the Department derives the quantities of oil 
savings and emissions reductions associated with the estimated energy demand 
reductions expected to result from the proposed standards, but does not attach 
any externality values to these benefits. In a separate Advance Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking for three products (58 FR 47326, September 8, 1993), the 
Department has indicated that it would be desirable to establish monetary 
values for these external benefits, if sound analytical bases can be found for 
doing so. The Department will attempt to develop and use such monetary values 
in the analysis of the likely impacts of updated standards for these three 
product categories. However, because there is no consensus on how to 
undertake the analysis underlying estimates of such environmental and energy 
security externalities, the Department is not yet able to set monetary values 
for such externalities accurately enough to be useful in the current 
rulemaking. 


Standards 


1. 

Regional standards. 

On another standards determination issue, the 
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated opposition to the setting 
of regional standards for room air conditioners. (Association of Home 
Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 22.) 
The Department is not setting regional standards, but did conduct a 
sensitivity analysis on life-cycle cost for room air conditioners because 
their energy use is affected by climate. The sensitivity analysis considered 
regional energy prices and usage. 
2. 

Corporate average fuel economy. 

The Rocky Mountain Institute stated 
that the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for appliances, like the 
Corporate Average Fuel Economy for automobiles, could allow for the gradual 
phase-in of technologies that are substantially different from the present, 
less-efficient technologies, e.g., horizontal-axis clothes washers and heat 
pump water heaters. (Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 3.) 
The Department acknowledges that some stringent standard levels could 
involve radical industry manufacturing changes and recognizes that a Corporate 
Average Fuel Economy-type approach to such standards could help to ease 
industry's transition to producing these more efficient appliances. The 
Department believes, however, that the Act precludes that option since the 
statute requires any covered product to meet the energy conservation standard.

Fuel switching. 

Several of the comments in this area dealt with the 
standards selection criteria for specific products. For example, Peoples 
Natural Gas Company stated a concern that standards could unintentionally 
increase energy consumption by forcing a switch from gas water heaters to 
electric. Peoples Natural Gas Company recommended limiting standards-induced 
price increases to consumers for gas water heaters to 120 percent of the 
standards-induced price increases for electric resistance water heaters. 
Peoples Natural Gas Company contended that this would avoid switching from gas 
to electric by price-sensitive consumers, such as home builders and low-income 
homeowners. (Peoples Natural Gas Company, No. 28 at 1). 
In response, the Department analyzed standard levels by the methodology 
proposed in the September 1990 advance notice, wherein fuel switching was 
accounted for as part of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy 
Model's forecasting of economic impacts. While some fuel switching did occur 
(electric water heaters are projected to increase their share of the market 
from 45.5 percent to 50.3 percent, as shown by Table 3.4 of Volume F of the 
Technical Support Document), the Department does not believe it occurred 
because of the relative equipment price increases since the price of electric 
water heaters are projected to increase much faster than that of gas, as 
presented in Section IV below. The Department ascribes the fuel switching 
that is projected to occur to the relative increase in the price of gas 
compared to electricity as shown in Table 5.5 of Volume A of the Technical 
Support Document. 


Impacts on Manufacturers


The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers contracted with 
Arthur D. Little, Inc. to prepare a report on the Department's analysis of 
top-loading, horizontal-axis clothes washers. In that report, entitled 
``Financial Impact of DOE Top-Loading Horizontal Axis Standards on U.S. Washing 
Machine Manufacturers,'' Arthur D. Little listed a number of criticisms of the 
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model and suggested that the 
Department use a ``Cash Flow Model,'' instead. (Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers, Nos. 61D and 61E). Although clothes washers have been dropped 
from this rulemaking, as discussed below, many of Arthur D. Little's comments 
have general applicability to the other appliances. 
One of Arthur D. Little's criticisms of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory- 
Manufacturer Impact Model involved that model's consumer preference 
assumptions. Arthur D. Little stated, ``The combination of price and energy 
savings account for under two-thirds of the basis of selection. Thus, the 
Manufacturer Impact Model at best is taking into account a little less than 
two-thirds of the consumer's decision to purchase.'' Arthur D. Little 
concluded, ``neglected features seriously distort the prediction of 
consumer's * * * well being.'' (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 
61E at 25.) 
The Department intends to set standards that do not reduce consumer 
utility, a gauge of well being, by establishing product classes that protect 
utility. While utility is sometimes a matter of degree, instead of an open 
and shut case, the basic concept is the establishment of classes that protect 
a less efficient, but desirable, feature such as the through-the-door ice 
service for refrigerators. Since the establishment of classes is performed 
before the manufacturer impact analysis, it is appropriate for the Lawrence 
Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model to assume there is no difference 
in consumer utility between an appliance meeting the different trial standard 
levels. Furthermore, since standards are intended to affect only an 
appliance's energy efficiency (which usually is positively related to price), 
modeling consumer response only to changes in those variables is reasonable. 
The Arthur D. Little report was also critical of the Lawrence Berkeley 
Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model's treatment of market power issues. The 
report stated that the manufacturer analysis concludes that manufacturers can 
set their own prices because the manufacture of the product is concentrated in 
the hands of a small number of producers. (Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers, No. 61E at 27.) Furthermore, the report asserted that within 
the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model, mark-up is 
countered only by a very weak consumer reaction, as measured by the elasticity 
of demand relative to the purchase price of the appliance and its operating 
expense. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, 

Id.

) 
A major difference that exists in the manufacturer impact analysis 
performed for today's notice and typical manufacturer experience to increasing 
prices is that the analysis assumes that all manufacturers in the industry 
will have to increase prices to meet the standard. This is a very different 
scenario from an individual firm raising its prices independently from its 
competitors. To accomplish the analysis, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-
Manufacturer Impact Model uses two elasticities; an individual firm 
elasticity, which is used to establish price, and an industry elasticity, 
which is used to establish sales. The individual firm elasticity used by the 
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model is greater than the 
industry elasticity, and is such that if a firm raises prices it loses sales. 
It is this price elasticity faced by the individual firm that determines how 
much the firm can mark up price. However, the initial effect of this 
elasticity is tempered in the model by the fact that the firm's competitors 
are also raising prices until equilibrium is reached between increased costs 
to meet the standard and increased prices. The consumer reaction to this 
higher price is then calculated by the industry elasticity, which is the 
consumers' responsiveness to having the appliance or not, as opposed to buying 
it from a competing seller for less. Since the Department considers the whole 
industry to be affected by standards, a resulting rise in the general level of 
prices for an appliance would likely have a relatively weak aggregate consumer 
reaction.

<TEXT>
 

In addition, the Department notes that in Arthur D. Little's own ``cash 
flow'' model, long-run sales of appliances are seemingly unaffected by price; 
Arthur D. Little has assumed there is no consumer reaction to price, or in 
other words, a price elasticity of zero.






This assumption would imply that manufacturers were completely free to 
set price at any level they wanted. 
Another area in which the Arthur D. Little report was critical of the 
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model was in the treatment of 
dynamic adjustment issues. As Arthur D. Little's report stated, ``To determine 
the impact on manufacturers, the Manufacturer Impact Model only examines two 
static cases * * * and misses important changes in the health of the industry 
[during the adjustment period].'' (Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers, 

Id.

). 
The ``two static cases'' to which Arthur D. Little is referring are the 
base and standards cases. However, Arthur D. Little is incorrect in stating 
that these two cases are static. As is documented in the Technical Support 
Document, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model also 
computes a short-run analysis, the sole purpose of which is to assess the 
dynamic impact of standards, in addition to computing the long-run analysis to 
determine the impacts after those dynamic impacts have been absorbed. The 
dynamic effect that is captured with the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model short-run analysis
is the extra price competition 
that may occur when the quantity demanded is suddenly reduced by the 
standards-induced price increase. This dynamic effect generally results in 
lower profitability over the short-run, as compared to over the long-run, 
especially at the higher standard levels as reported in Section IV below. 
This effect is completely ignored by the Arthur D. Little model with its zero 
price elasticity. However, Arthur D. Little does address a different dynamic 
effect which the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model does 
ignore. 
The dynamic effect addressed by Arthur D. Little is the forward time- 
shifting of appliance purchases in anticipation of a standards-induced price 
increase. The Department has been aware of this for some time, but has not 
incorporated it into the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact 
Model because of a lack of data on the extent of purchase time-shifting. 
Additionally, the Department believes that any effect of time-shifting 
is initially positive and then negative. When appliances are bought in 
advance of standards, the initial effect probably would be to improve profits 
and cash flow. When the quantity demanded falls temporarily after standards, 
the effect probably would be to hurt profits and cash flow. These two effects 
very nearly should cancel over time. The Department notes that this result is 
in sharp contrast to the dynamic effect that the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory- 
Manufacturer Impact Model does consider, which has a non-recoverable impact on 
the industry. Nonetheless, DOE agrees that time-shifting could bear further 
investigation and will evaluate whether the estimates supplied by Arthur D. 
Little on the magnitude of time-shifting can be of use.

Arthur D. Little also was critical of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory- 
Manufacturer Impact Model's inability to take into account (or try to predict) 
some of the consequences of the low profitability that the model sometimes 
predicts. In particular, its report points out that if the rate of profit did 
decline significantly in real terms, the industry would have a very hard time 
raising additional equity. Arthur D. Little points out that, in actuality, 
both owners and financial backers of firms would limit capital until expected 
return matched their required return. According to the comment, the Lawrence 
Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model, therefore, ``* * * sacrifices 
realism in modeling the relationship between expected return and the 
willingness of owners and financial backers to commit capital for retooling.'' 
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61E at 27-28.) 
The Department agrees with Arthur D. Little's statement regarding the 
difficulty that industry likely would have in raising capital as a consequence 
of significantly reduced profitability. Furthermore, it is true that the 
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model is limited to 
estimating the impact of potential standards on an industry, whether positive 
or negative, as characterized by profitability. The model does not attempt to 
predict the specific forms of the damage and the complex reactions (inability 
to raise capital, failures of some firms, foreign buy-outs, mergers, capacity 
reductions, etc.) that could occur within a negatively affected industry. 
However, the Department does not believe that it is necessary to attempt to 
predict that sort of detail. Rather, DOE believes it is obligated not to set 
standards that would cause serious damage. 
The Department believes that the magnitude of the hypothetical profit 
loss is a very good indicator of the magnitude of the impacts that will be 
imposed on the industry. When the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer 
Impact Model predicts a precipitous decline in profit, this should be 
interpreted as damaging to the industry. Indeed, in many cases, as discussed 
in Section IV below, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact 
Model does predict a sharp drop in profitability, and this prediction figures 
strongly in rejecting the standard in question. 
Because of all the ``deficiencies'' in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory- 
Manufacturer Impact Model, Arthur D. Little's report suggested that the 
Department abandon the model, and proposed, instead, that the Department use a 
cash-flow model. The cash-flow model determines the economic impact of energy 
conservation standards on manufacturers by estimating the cash flows 
associated with meeting the standards, and calculating a value for those cash 
flows. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61E at 19 and 
Appendix C.) 
However, Arthur D. Little's cash-flow model submitted does not predict 
whether a manufacturing industry will or will not be hurt by standards. It 
allows one to make various assumptions about the market's behavior, and then 
to predict the impact of those assumptions on cash flow; but, it tells nothing 
about the market's behavior. As a result, the Department notes that Arthur D. 
Little has run three scenarios with radically different implications for the 
industry, with no way to choose among them. The model is equally capable of 
processing the optimistic and the pessimistic scenario, but it does not have 
an expected scenario. The Department, therefore, does not believe that the 
cash flow model, as presented in Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers's 
comments, could serve to replace the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer 
Impact Model for use in the analyses of the impacts of appliance standards on 
manufacturers. 
However, the Arthur D. Little report also stated that one of the key 
assumptions in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model is 
the proportion of costs that are fixed. The Arthur D. Little report went on 
to state that, ``After interviewing all five domestic manufacturers, Arthur D. 
Little was unable to verify that the washing machine manufacturers have any 
sense as to the proportion of their costs which are long-term fixed costs * * *. Basing a model upon an
assumption that is not empirically verifiable is a risky proposition.'' (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers,


Id

.) 

The Department agrees that one of the key assumptions in the Lawrence 
Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model is the proportion of costs that 
are fixed and variable. The Department is sensitive to the claim that this 
key input parameter to the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact 
Model is ``completely alien to manufacturers.'' The Department would certainly 
consider alternate manufacturer impact models that utilize more known and 
verifiable inputs. However, to be an acceptable alternative model, the 
Department believes that such model would have to have forecasting ability 
similar in scope and sophistication as the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory- 
Manufacturer Impact Model. As discussed above, the cash-flow model submitted 
by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers does not meet this test. 
Additionally, the Department would be interested in any analyses that indicate 
adverse manufacturer impacts at any of the proposed standard levels, as 
opposed to arguments over the severity of the adverse impact of rejected 
standard levels.

Impacts on Utilities 


Several comments addressed the Department's proposed analysis of the 
impacts of energy conservation standards on electric utilities. Natural 
Resources Defense Council stated that the utility analysis needs to consider 
that under the base cases, there will be less forecasting certainty than would 
occur under new and revised standards, and a greater probability that 
utilities would misforecast electricity demand. (Natural Resources Defense 
Council, No. 13 at 32). The Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council also 
suggested that the utility analysis should consider the value of reduced 
uncertainty in utility forecasts as a result of standards. In addition, the 
Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council gave references to a methodology. (Ohio 
Office of the Consumers' Council, No. 60 at 6). 
Increased demand certainty after standards is an effect that was not 
captured in the utility analysis. It results in substantial benefits to 
electric utilities, particularly when demand growth is rapid. These benefits 
accrue because demand growth is uncertain, and if the utility misforecasts 
demand, it may build too few or too many power plants. This risk of capital 
misallocation can be substantial in certain cases. 
With regard to the appropriate measure of dollars to use in the utility 
impact analysis, Natural Resources Defense Council stated that ``DOE needs to 
do the utility impact analysis in nominal dollar terms, using actual utility 
assumptions for depreciation and rate of return. Utility rates and finances 
are computed in nominal dollars, not real dollars, and this can have a 
dramatic impact on how new power plant construction will affect rates.'' 
(Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 32). 
It is true that utilities calculate rates in nominal dollar terms. The 
Department, therefore, calculated utility impacts in both real and nominal 
dollars, in order to determine how adding an inflation factor would affect the 
results. 
With regard to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-549, 
November 15, 1990), Natural Resources Defense Council stated that utility 
expansion plans will need to be consistent with the Act, which will require 
more controls as the demand for electricity grows. Appliance standards will, 
all other things being held equal, make compliance with the Clean Air 
Amendments less expensive for utilities, as it allows them to meet the cap on 
emissions more easily. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 32, 35). 
The utility analysis and the environmental analysis are consistent with 
the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. The Department collected forecasts of the 
value of marketable permits for sulfur, estimates of the other effects of the 
Clean Air Act Amendments, and assessments of future utility generation by fuel 
type. The Department assessed these estimates and assimilated them into the 
analysis. (See Technical Support Document, Environmental Assessment, Section 
2). 
The Florida Energy Office stated that capacity cost credit (for avoided 
capacity) should not be limited to combustion turbines but should match the 
load characteristics of the subject appliance, categorized into peaking, 
intermediate, and baseload groups. Air conditioners should be categorized 
according to their load duration characteristics. (Florida Energy Office, No. 
42, at 2). 
The Department agrees that load shape characteristics should be included 
in an assessment of air conditioner (and other appliances) avoided peak 
demand. The current utility analysis accounted for these effects. The 
Department investigated separating energy savings into peaking, intermediate, 
and baseload categories, to determine if this would have a significant effect 
on the results. The utility analysis assumed a combustion turbine proxy, 
which values all peak demand savings at the cost of a combustion turbine. 
This is the most widely used approach by U.S. utilities. 
The Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council stated that the utility 
analysis should consider transmission and distribution capacity savings. 
(Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council, No. 60 at 5). 
The Department agrees that transmission and distribution capacity 
savings should be included in the utility analysis, and did include them. 
Avoided transmission and distribution costs were based on the value assigned 
to this avoided transmission and distribution capacity by many different U.S. 
utilities. 
Two commentators stated that off-peak water heaters (those that heat 
water only during off-peak hours) save energy, and that this should be 
included in the utility analysis. (National Regional Electric Cooperative 
Association, No. 17 at 1; Vaughn Manufacturing Company, No. 75 at 1). 
In response, the Department notes that where utilities offer time-of-day 
rates, the economics of off-peak water heating change dramatically and may be 
very attractive. However, the Department does not have the authority to 
require utilities to offer such rates, and believes the lack of these rates 
offered nation-wide precludes consideration of off-peak water heaters in a 
national standard. 

Several comments discussed the impacts of appliance conservation 
standards on natural gas utilities. The Washington Gas Light, Inc. urged the 
Department to dedicate a similar level of analytical effort to the utility 
cost consequences of standards on natural gas appliances as it devotes to 
impacts on electric utilities from standards on electric appliances. 
(Washington Gas Light, Inc., No. 37 at 12). 
The Department initially studied the potential impacts of standards on 
electric utilities and not natural gas utilities because there were more 
abundant data on the former. Furthermore, significantly more residential 
energy consumption is electricity rather than natural gas.

<TEXT>
 

Nevertheless, the Department recognizes that for analytical 
completeness, it should conduct studies on the potential impacts of standards 
on natural gas utilities. Accordingly, DOE is now examining methodologies and 
data sources that will enable it to conduct such studies. The Department, 
therefore, welcomes submittals of relevant information and data in this 
regard. 
Columbia Gas and the Montana-Dakota Utilities Company stated that 
conservation standards on gas appliances would result in a loss of natural gas 
sales, which, in turn, would lead to higher rates to all gas customers. 
(Columbia Gas, No. 45 at 5; Montana-Dakota Utilities Company, No. 54 at 3). 
The Department does not accept the inevitability of that contention; a 
loss of gas sales may or may not increase rates. The actual effect depends on 
the cost structure of the gas utility. If avoided costs are larger than 
rates, then reducing sales would actually decrease rates. Without study of 
individual gas utility cost structures, no 

a priori

 conclusion in this regard can be drawn. 
Lastly, four comments addressed the Department's planned analysis of 
environmental effects. Both the Southern Union Gas Company and Columbia Gas 
pointed out that the negative environmental effects from electric resistance 
water heaters are more severe than are the effects from natural gas water 
heaters. Columbia Gas stated that carbon dioxide emissions from electric 
resistance water heaters are 3.8 times higher than those from a minimum 
efficiency gas water heater. (Southern Union Gas Company, No. 22 at 2; 
Columbia Gas, No. 45 at 5). Also, the American Gas Association and Columbia 
Gas urged the Department to consider the environmental impact of the total 
energy delivery cycle, i.e., source energy, not just site consumption only. 
(American Gas Association, No. 23 at 3; Columbia Gas, No. 45 at 2). 
The statements regarding the relative environmental impacts of gas and 
resistance electric water heating are generally correct. Furthermore, the 
Department does account for source energy (not just site energy) savings by 
including the fuel used by electric utilities and the consequent emissions in 
the utility impact assessment and environmental analysis. These effects are 
reported in Chapter 9 of the Technical Support Document accompanying this 
Notice. 


b. Product-Specific Comments 


1. Room Air Conditioners 




Classes.

 In the September 1990 advance notice, DOE proposed 12 classes of room air conditioners. The product classes consist
of four categories; units with side louvers, units without side louvers, units with reversing valve with side louvers,
and units with reversing valve without side louvers. There are five class divisions by capacity within each of the
two categories without reversing valves. 
The California Energy Commission proposed a reduction in product classes 
from 12 to 4, eliminating the class divisions based on capacity. (California 
Energy Commission, No. 24 at 2). Whirlpool Corporation and Association of 
Home Appliance Manufacturers proposed two additional classes, a casement 
slider and a casement only room air conditioner. They stated that restricted 
geometry adversely impacts the potential new designs that can be applied to 
those types of room air conditioners. For example, rotary compressors could 
not be fitted into the casement units. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 7; 
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers No. 61A at 4). The American 
Council for an Energy Efficient Economy in its comments cited room air 
conditioners as an example where broad product classes have been properly 
selected. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6, at 1). 
There are several constraints placed on the design of room air 
conditioners. Because most room air conditioners are installed in double-hung 
windows, the size of the most typical double-hung windows becomes a 
significant factor in cabinet design and production. Every room air 
conditioner unit could be designed to optimize performance and efficiency as 
long as a specific cabinet could be built to best suit the unit's particular 
capacity and efficiency. Manufacturers cannot afford the luxury of optimizing 
every model they produce, so they limit their production of cabinets to three 
or four sizes. Because of space and configuration limitations, the larger 
capacity units for a given cabinet size will tend to be less efficient. For 
this reason the Department is rejecting the California Energy Commission 
proposal to ignore capacity in establishing classes. 
The Department decided to adopt additional classes for casement slider 
and casement only room air conditioners. These units offer a unique utility 
to the consumer in that they offer a performance-related feature (fitting into 
casement windows) which other room air conditioners cannot provide. The 
Department believes that the size limitations imposed on casement units are 
more significant than those faced by typical double-hung window units. Since 
its performance-related feature justified a lower standard, separate product 
classes were established for casement slider and casement only units. Because 
of the small amount of empirical data on casement type units, the Department 
was unable to analyze these classes. As a result, the Department is not 
proposing any standards for them.

Design options

. Both the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and 
Whirlpool Corporation provided detailed comments on each design option. 
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 5-22 and Whirlpool 
Corporation, No. 31 at 6-13). A number of the comments concerned design 
changes to improve heat exchanger (evaporator and condenser) performance. 
These improvements can be put into two categories; designs for increasing the 
heat transfer surface area and designs for increasing the heat transfer 
coefficients. The heat transfer surface area can be increased by any of the 
following methods: increasing the depth of the coil by adding vertical tube 
rows, increasing the frontal area of the coil by increasing the height or 
width, increasing the fin density, or adding a subcooler to the condenser 
coil. The heat transfer coefficients can be increased by using an enhanced 
fin design or grooved (rifled) refrigerant tubing. In addition, spraying 
condensate on the condenser can improve its heat transfer coefficient. 
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool 
Corporation commented that cabinet size could prevent or at least limit the 
number of tube rows that could be added to increase the depth of the coil. In 
addition, they state that the effect of each successive tube row on system 
performance diminishes rapidly. The Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers also commented that compressor reliability could be affected. 
The addition of tube rows increases the internal volume of the system and, 
therefore, the amount of refrigerant required. Compressor reliability could 
be reduced as the compressor would be required to pump excess refrigerant. 
Whirlpool Corporation added that a thicker coil will increase air flow 
restriction and may actually reduce efficiency. (Association of Home 
Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 9-10; Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 8). 
In the analysis of additional tube rows, the Department used engineering 
design data provided by room air conditioner manufacturers. The data were 
based on measurements taken from actual room air conditioner units and 
included information that specified the number of tube rows that could be 
added to the existing coils. The computer simulation model which was used in 
the analysis of room air conditioners considered the effect that additional 
tube rows have on the entire room air conditioner refrigerant system. 
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool 
Corporation commented that increasing the frontal area of the coil would 
require an increase in chassis size. Coils in existing room air conditioners 
are already so large that any useful increase would require an increase in the 
size of the cabinet. The incremental cost for such a change would be 
significant. Whirlpool Corporation added that an increase in frontal area 
reduces the water removal capability of the evaporator coil. (Association of 
Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 10; Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 
7). 
The Department agrees with the Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers's and Whirlpool Corporation's comments regarding the increase of 
the coil's frontal area. Any useful increase in performance would require 
that the cabinet size be increased as well. Manufacturers' cost data for this 
design were taken into consideration in the analysis. The computer simulation 
model takes into account the impact of increasing the coil frontal area on the 
evaporator's water removal capability. 
Both the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool 
Corporation stated that there is a limit to how high the fin density can be 
increased before air flow becomes too restricted and adversely affects the 
efficiency of the unit. In addition, an increased fin density might prevent 
the proper drainage of condensate from the evaporator. The Association of 
Home Appliance Manufacturers added that dirt build-up is a serious concern in 
coil design. With a higher fin density, greater dirt build-up is likely to 
result in coil degradation and lower unit efficiency. (Association of Home 
Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 11; Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 8). 
The Department solicited comments from room air conditioner 
manufacturers regarding the maximum allowable fin densities for a variety of 
evaporator and condenser coils. Their comments served as a guideline to how 
high fin densities could be increased for prospective coils. The computer 
simulation model is capable of calculating the effect that increased fin 
density has on the air-side pressure drop across the coil and, in turn, the 
power consumption of the fan motor.

In its comment concerning subcoolers, Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers asserted that subcoolers are not used unless it is impossible to 
achieve the needed subcooling without them. The Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers also stated that when a subcooler is needed, the available room 
in the chassis dictates the allowable length of the subcooler. (Association 
of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 12, 13). Whirlpool Corporation 
stated that a subcooler type that transfers heat from the refrigerant in the 
liquid line to the superheat exiting the evaporator is not practical in room 
air conditioners due to limited space within the cabinet. (Whirlpool 
Corporation, No. 31 at 10). 
The Department understands the conventional practice used by 
manufacturers for incorporating subcoolers into room air conditioners. But 
the Department does not believe that this should prevent the design option 
from being considered. As long as the chassis of the particular unit is large 
enough to accommodate it, a subcooler will be considered as a way to improve a 
unit's performance. Engineering data supplied by manufacturers provided 
information on the maximum length of subcoolers which could be incorporated 
into a particular unit. The data were used to establish subcooler length for 
prospective room air conditioners. 
Enhanced fin surfaces, such as wavy or slit patterns, improve the heat 
transfer capability of a coil by increasing the air-side heat transfer 
coefficient. In its comments regarding enhanced fin designs, the Association 
of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that most manufacturers now use a wavy 
or ``waffle'' fin (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 12). 
Additional improvement can be achieved through the use of ``lanced'' or 
``louvered'' fins. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers expressed a 
concern that data based on work performed by manufacturers should be more 
heavily relied upon than data based on published research papers available in 
the public domain. The publicly available data seems to be either based upon 
theoretical analysis or research-type testing of simulated coil 
configurations. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that 
the correlation between the data and actual performance results in room air 
conditioners is difficult to determine. (Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers, No. 61A at 13, 14). Whirlpool Corporation stated that air flow 
is reduced and air-side pressure drop across the coil is increased due to 
incorporating enhanced fin surfaces into coils. But Whirlpool Corporation 
added that enhanced fin designs provide significant improvement without 
substantial additional cost. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 9). 
The Department generally agrees with the comments made by Association of 
Home Appliance Manufacturers concerning enhanced fin design. Test data 
received from room air conditioner manufacturers and heat exchanger 
manufacturers are given more weight than theoretical analyses when deciding 
how much of an improvement should be given to the air-side heat transfer 
coefficients due to enhanced fin surfaces. The Department does not believe 
that the theoretical or research data available in the public domain should be 
dismissed entirely, and is using it as a check on the data received from 
manufacturers to determine if their information is reasonable. Improvements 
to the air-side heat transfer coefficients are input to the computer 
simulation model. With this information on improvements, the model is able to 
determine what effect enhanced fin surfaces have on the entire room air 
conditioner system. 
Augmenting the smooth inside surface of refrigerant tubing with grooves 
increases the tube's refrigerant-side heat transfer coefficient. Grooved 
(rifled) tubing can therefore improve the heat transfer capability of a coil. 
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers' comments concerning grooved 
tubing are similar to the comments it gave regarding enhanced fin surfaces. 
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that data based on work 
performed by manufacturers should be more heavily relied upon than data 
provided by refrigerant tubing manufacturers. The Association of Home 
Appliance Manufacturers asserted that the data made available by tubing 
manufacturers are generally obtained under optimized conditions rather than 
under conditions representing actual application in room air conditioners. 
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 15). Whirlpool 
Corporation states that grooved tubing costs significantly more than smooth 
tubing but has a beneficial effect on system performance. (Whirlpool 
Corporation, No. 31 at 9). 
As with enhanced fin surface data, the Department is giving more weight 
to data received from room air conditioner manufacturers when deciding how 
much improvement should be given to the refrigerant-side heat coefficients due 
to grooved tubing. The Department is using data made available by refrigerant 
tubing manufacturers as well as data provided by research papers in the public 
domain to compliment the data received from room air conditioner 
manufacturers. (See Technical Support Document, Volume H). Improvements to 
the refrigerant-side heat transfer coefficients are input as multipliers to 
the computer simulation model. With the multipliers, the model is able to 
determine what effect grooved tubing has on the entire room air conditioner 
system.

Whirlpool Corporation stated that it is standard practice to spray condensate produced by the evaporator onto the
condenser coil. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 9).

Because most, if not all, manufacturers incorporate the spraying of condensate into their room air conditioners,
the Department did not analyze condensate spray as a design option. Baseline models for each of the product classes
are assumed to include condensate spray in their designs.

Improving the air system efficiency can be accomplished either by increasing the fan or fan motor efficiency. In a
room air conditioner, both the evaporator and condenser fans are driven by one fan motor. The Association of Home Appliance
Manufacturers stated that increases in air system efficiency are limited because of the following: Configuration
constraints due to the compact design of room air units; standardization of air system components because the industry's
supply comes almost entirely from a single vendor; lower fan motor efficiencies that occur because the room air unit
design is optimized at fan speeds other than the point of maximum motor efficiency; and air system designs which must
limit noise levels. In addition, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that fan motor efficiency
is not expected to increase significantly by the year 1995. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers also
stated that reductions in restrictions to air flow can be made only by increasing the space available for air flow.
Major increases in cost would be associated with such a change as it would necessitate an increase in the chassis of
the room air conditioner. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 16-19). Whirlpool Corporation
repeated much of what the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated and, in addition, stated that the use
of separate fan motors would require significant redesign and increase the product cost. (Whirlpool Corporation,
No. 31 at 11). Natural Resources Defense Council said that DOE should add improved air flow past coils as a design option.
(Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 27). The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy recommended
that DOE treat fan and fan motor efficiency separately. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at
3).

In its analysis of increasing the air system efficiency, the Department analyzed only improvements that could be
made to the fan motor. The data from fan manufacturers did not provide information on the effect of different fan types
on air system efficiency in a room air conditioner application. Therefore, the Department did not analyze improvements
due to changes in the fan efficiency. The Department agrees with the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers's
comment regarding restrictions to air flow. Increasing the space available for air flow can be accomplished only
by enlarging the chassis size. In the analysis of increased coil face areas where the cabinet size had to be increased,
increases in system efficiency were assumed to be a result not only of the enlarged coil, but also the improvement in
air flow resulting from the larger cabinet. Therefore, improvements in the air flow past the coils are inherently
considered in the analysis of increased coil face areas. The Department utilized data obtained from fan motor manufacturers
to determine efficiency increases and the associated incremental costs for improving the efficiency of fan motors.

Both the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool Corporation commented that most room air conditioner
manufacturers use rotary compressors. Improvements beyond the currently available efficiency of 11.0 energy efficiency
ratio are expected to be small. They also stated that higher efficiency scroll compressors might be suitable for larger
capacity room air units. But use of scroll compressors would significantly increase the cost of room air conditioners.
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 19, 20; Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 11). Natural Resources
Defense Council said that DOE should disaggregate the design option of improving the compressor efficiency into
motor efficiency, volumetric efficiency, reduced mechanical resistance in pumps, and alternate compressor designs.
(Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 27).

The Department took into account data from both room air conditioner and compressor manufacturers when determining
the available efficiency increase in compressors. The data indicated that most room air conditioners use rotary
compressors and that the maximum energy efficiency ratio for compressors of this type is 11.0. Other compressor types
were also analyzed. New technologies for reciprocating compressors with capacities exceeding 17,000 Btu/h have
pushed energy efficiency ratios past 11.0. These reciprocating compressors were considered for the two largest
capacity classes of room air conditioners. Scroll compressors were also considered, but for the compressor capacities
in the range used in room air conditioner units, energy efficiency ratios did not exceed 11.0. Compressor manufacturers
indicated that there is a high probability that compressor energy efficiency ratios ranging from 11.5 to 12.0 would
be available by the year 1995. Based on this information, compressor efficiencies of this magnitude were analyzed
by the Department. In response to Natural Resources Defense Council's comment, compressor manufacturers increase
compressor efficiency by improving the performance of these individual components. Data for the impact of component
improvements are not available but, component improvements are reflected in higher compressor energy efficiency
ratios. Therefore, the Department is analyzing the compressor as a whole rather than attempting to analyze individual
components.

Other comments.

 The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy proposed that DOE revise the room air conditioner test procedure
to determine the energy savings on a cycling rather than a steady state basis. If the test procedure cannot be revised
during the rulemaking, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy recommended development of methods
to estimate the benefits of design options which tend to improve efficiency under cycling conditions. (American
Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 2). On the other hand, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers
and Whirlpool Corporation stated room air conditioners are not normally turned on for extended periods of time, and
when they are turned on the (room and ambient) temperature is more likely to be high, reducing the amount of cycling.
The current one-temperature test procedure adequately matches consumer usage patterns for room air conditioners.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said that any change in the procedure will drive up the product cost
and provide no benefit. It was the contention of the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool Corporation
that design options such as variable speed compressors, electronic expansion valves, thermostatic cycling controls,
and possibly use of alternative refrigerants that improve efficiency under cycling conditions will not result in
any measurable efficiency improvements. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that the addition
of a cycling test must be justified by in-depth studies and field experiments to determine if the efficiency improvements
such a revision would predict are cost-effective. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 6-8;
Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 12-14).

In response, the Department believes that some design options may improve efficiency under cycling conditions.
The Department also agrees that before such design options are translated into test procedure credits, field tests
would need to be conducted to provide evidence to support such credits. Therefore, for purposes of this rulemaking,
cycling designs for room air conditioners will not be given test procedure credit.

Though no test procedure credit will be given to cycling designs, the Department believes that energy savings can
be realized through the use of variable speed compressors. Energy savings for variable speed compressors have been
estimated by extrapolating from results based on tests performed on central air conditioners. The extrapolated
estimate is significantly lower than what test results indicate for central systems. A low estimate is used because
room air conditioners probably cycle less than central systems. Cycling data for room air conditioners are not available.

There are some design options listed in the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which are theoretically possible,
but for which experimental data or prototypes are not available. The impact of electronic expansion valves and thermostatic
cycling controls on the efficiency of room air conditioners has not been analyzed because the Department was not able
to obtain any data for these designs.

Both the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool Corporation made comments regarding replacement
refrigerants for R-22. They commented that though research has identified refrigerant blends (non-azeotropic
mixtures) that could improve the efficiency of room air conditioners, no prototypes have been developed that demonstrate
this potential. In addition, changes would be required in room air conditioner systems, e.g., heat exchangers, in
order for the unit to operate efficiently with the replacement refrigerant. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers,
No. 61A at 8; Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 15).

The Department agrees with the comments made by the Association of Home 
Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool Corporation regarding replacement 
refrigerants for R-22. Since no prototypes exist, the Department did not 
analyze replacement refrigerants as a design option for room air conditioners. 
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers provided extensive 
comments regarding the computer simulation model used by the Department to 
analyze room air conditioners. The Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers proposed the following changes to the computer simulation model: 
(1) Modification of the compressor subroutine to model rotary compressors and 
to simulate reciprocating compressors better; (2) correction of the condensate 
spray subroutine to predict its effect on system performance better; (3) 
addition of correction factors to account for indoor/outdoor air leakage, 
short-circuiting of indoor air, and heat leakage through the divider wall; (4) 
addition of multiplication factors to modify coil heat transfer coefficients 
as a result of using enhanced fin surfaces; (5) addition of correction factors 
to modify such values as the compressor power and refrigerant mass flow rate 
in order to assist in calibrating the model to test data; and (6) addition of 
a psychometric heat balance routine to check that the results from the 
simulation model are thermodynamically consistent. In addition to making 
changes to the simulation model, the Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers requested that DOE calibrate the model to match industry test 
data for the baseline models chosen to represent each of the room air 
conditioner product classes. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
also requested that the room air conditioner industry be given the opportunity 
to conduct experiments to judge the model
s validity after the needed changes 
to the model were completed. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
also stated that manufacturers' data should be given significant weight in 
predicting the increases to efficiency due to design modifications. 
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 2,3). Whirlpool 
Corporation stated that it fully supports the Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers's recommended changes to the computer simulation model. 
(Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 15). 
The Department has made the changes to the simulation model that were 
proposed by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers. Simulation of 
baseline models were calibrated against test data submitted by manufacturers. 
The Department encourages the room air industry to test the validity of the 
simulation model and submit results in response to the standard levels being 
proposed in this rulemaking. 
The Rocky Mountain Institute proposed that latent cooling be considered 
in room air conditioner energy savings, and that DOE investigate whether the 
spread between evaporator temperatures has been reduced to a minimum. (Rocky 
Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 4). 
The computer simulation model used in the analysis of room air 
conditioners evaluated the thermodynamic performance of the refrigerant 
system. In this evaluation, the removal of latent heat was calculated. 
Minimization of the difference in evaporator inlet and outlet temperatures is 
an inherent consideration in heat exchanger and system design. This 
temperature difference was determined by the simulation model.

The Florida State Energy Office (FSEO) suggested that the Department 
consider classifying room air conditioners according to their load 
characteristics. (FSEO, No. 42 at 5, 6). The Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers stated that regional standards could increase the product's cost 
by denying manufacturers the economy of large production runs and augment 
distribution problems by isolating inventories by region. (Association of 
Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 22-25). 
The Department assumes that the Florida State Energy Office comment 
concerns regional standards. The Department believes the program requires the 
setting of a national standard and is proposing therefore only a national 
standard for room air conditioners. 
The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Florida State Energy 
Office proposed that DOE establish procedures that take into account the 
integration of room air conditioners and water heaters (heat recovery units). 
(Natural Resources Defense Council No. 13 at 29; FSEO No. 42 at 2,3). 
Establishing standards and developing test procedures for appliances 
which serve two types of loads simultaneously is a very complex problem. The 
Department is in the process of developing standards and test procedures for 
combined central air conditioners and water heaters. However, because of the 
difficulty of running water lines to a remote room air conditioner location 
and the inherent heat losses from the hot water line, a room air 
conditioner/water heater configuration does not seem particularly appropriate. 
At this time, DOE will not establish a standard for room air conditioner/water 
heater systems. 
The Natural Resources Defense Council, the Florida State Energy Office 
and the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy stated that DOE 
should consider the cost of peak power in evaluating the cost effectiveness of 
room air conditioner standards. (Natural Resources Defense Council No. 13 at 
18; Florida State Energy Office No. 42 at 5,6; American Council for an Energy 
Efficient Economy No. 6 at 7). 
The price of electricity used for room air conditioners is the projected 
1996 average residential electricity price from DOE Annual Energy Outlook 
1991. Analysis of electricity price by end-use from data in the DOE/EIA 1987 
Residential Energy Consumption Survey indicates that the average electricity 
price for residential air conditioning was the same as the national average 
residential electricity price (in other words, the end-use price multiplier is 
1.00). Cost effectiveness to the consumer, e.g., life cycle cost, payback and 
cost of conserved energy, is evaluated according to the actual charges to the 
consumer. 
The Fedders Corporation urged DOE to establish a minimum energy 
efficiency ratio for window air conditioners of 10.0, stating that this should 
be done to keep the industry competitive on a global basis. The Fedders 
Corporation also stated that existing technology clearly can support this 
minimum efficiency at small cost to manufacturers. (Fedders, No. 91 at 1). 
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers responded to the Fedders 
Corporation's comment stating that the Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers was unclear as to which classes the Fedders Corporation was 
referring, and urging DOE to maintain and evaluate separate classes of room 
air conditioners. Furthermore, the Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers stated that the Fedders Corporation cannot accurately judge the 
technological and economic impacts of such a minimum energy efficiency ratio 
on other manufacturers. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 92 
at 1). 
The Department notes both comments and has analyzed each proposed class 
of room air conditioners separately, using all available cost and performance 
data. The results presented in today's notice as proposed minimum energy 
efficiency ratio's for room air conditioners range from 9.3 to 11.1, depending 
on size and configuration. 


2. Water Heaters





Classes.

 There was considerable discussion about water heater product 
classes. Many comments came from gas utilities. 
The American Gas Association urged DOE to adopt a source-based energy 
analysis and to recognize the importance of efficiency of the total energy 
delivery cycle. (American Gas Association, No. 23 at 3.)

The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act separates water heaters 
into three product classes by fuel type: Gas, electric and oil.
 Also, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act directs the Secretary to develop different standards for product
classes within an appliance type if they ``consume a different kind of energy from that consumed by other covered 
products within such type.''
 Therefore, the Department did not compare 
water heaters of different fuel types. However, the Department considered the 
effects of fuel-switching caused by the standards, as forecasted by the 
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy Model. 






The American Gas Association and many of the gas utilities proposed 
additional classes for gas water heaters based on several factors. These 
included the utility of having hot water if the power fails and the high cost 
of bringing electricity to locations without electric outlets near the water 
heater. The American Gas Association argued that a precedent already exists 
with ranges/ovens for separate product classes with or without an electric 
cord. (American Gas Association, No. 23 at 4-6.) 

Several comments proposed that DOE establish four classes for gas water 
heaters: With and without draft hood, and with and without electric cord. 
(American Gas Association, No. 23 at 2; Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 3; 
Lone Star Gas Company, No. 39 at 3; Southern Natural Gas Company, No. 46 at 2; 
LaClede Gas, No. 55 at 3; Equitable Resources, No. 72 at 1; Madison Gas & 
Electric, No. 77 at 1; Louisiana Gas, No. 81 at 1; United Texas Transmission, 
No. 26 at 2; Southern Union Gas Company, No. 22 at 1; Colorado Interstate Gas, 
No. 14 at 2; Wisconsin Gas Company, No. 33 at 1; South Carolina Electric and 
Gas Company, No. 34 at 2; Bay State Gas, No. 52 at 1; Arkansas Oklahoma Gas, 
No. 56 at 1; Providence Gas, No. 62 at 1; Southern Connecticut Gas, No. 63 at 
1; Arkansas Western Gas, No. 64 at 4; ENTEX, No. 58 at 5; Essex County Gas, 
No. 69 at 1; K N Energy, No. 70 at 3; and Delta Natural Gas, No. 73 at 2.) 

The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated that DOE should 
recognize the particular utility and performance characteristics of 
conventional gas water heaters and preserve the availability of this product 
to the American consumer. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 
3.) 

Two gas utility companies proposed three product classes for gas-fired 
water heaters: with a draft hood with and without electric cord, and with 
electric cord (no designation on presence of draft hood). (Atlantic Gas Light 
Company, No. 29 at 2; and Energen, No. 12 at 4.) 

Some gas utilities proposed two product classes for gas water heaters, 
namely, with and without electric cord. (Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, No. 57 
at 1; and Northern Indiana Public Service, No. 48 at 2.) 

The Arkansas Western Gas Company listed several benefits provided by a 
standing pilot in water heaters. These benefits include keeping the flue 
warm, helping maintain water temperature in the tank, providing a low-cost, 
fail-proof ignition system, allowing operation during power outages, and low 
operating cost. (Arkansas Western Gas Company, No. 64 at 5.) Piedmont 
Natural Gas Company, Inc. urged the Department to evaluate fully the benefits 
of standing pilot ignition systems. Many citizens in North and South 
Carolina continued to have hot water and were able to cook after hurricane 
Hugo caused extensive power outages which lasted up to several weeks. 
(Piedmont Natural Gas Company, No. 71C at 2.) 

The Department considered only one product class for gas-fired storage 
water heaters. The Department believes that designs that eliminate draft 
hoods or add electric cords do not change the utility of water heaters; 
therefore, these designs do not warrant inclusion in a separate class. These 
design options were evaluated solely on economic considerations. Additional 
installation cost to bring electricity to water heaters not close to outlets 
was included in the analysis of those design options. When condensation from 
mid-efficiency water heaters would damage masonry chimneys, the cost of 
relining or power venting was added to the installation costs.

The Department does not consider the utility of having hot water, or 
other amenities, during power outages adequate reason to develop separate 
product classes. Between 90 percent and 93 percent of residential electric 
customers experience no electricity outages longer than four hours per 
year.
 Currently, central gas furnaces are not divided into product classes 
based on the use of electricity as proposed above for gas water heaters. 
Additionally, in this proposal, ranges/ovens are not divided into two product 
classes based on the use of electricity. 





The Public Service Company of North Carolina, Inc. recommended that 
additional product classes be defined for gas-fired storage water heaters 
installed outside. (Public Service Company of North Carolina, Inc., No. 74 at 
3). 

The Department is not aware of any unique water heater design features 
that lead to any utility and lower energy efficiency that justifies a separate 
class. Therefore, the Department is not establishing a separate product class 
for gas-fired water heaters installed outside. 

The Pacific Power and Edison Electric Institute supported three separate 
classes for electric water heaters (resistance, instantaneous, and heat pump). 
The Pacific Power stated that heat pump water heater efficiency depends upon 
climate and use patterns. (Pacific Power, No. 53 at 1, and Edison Electric 
Institute, No. 20 at 2). Peoples Natural Gas Company stated that heat pump 
water heaters should be promoted over electric resistance water heaters. 
(Peoples Natural Gas Company, No. 28 at 3). 

Several comments proposed that heat pump water heaters be treated as a 
design option for electric storage water heaters, and not as a separate 
product class. (DEC International No. 3 at 1; Mr. Wayne Goode, No. 8 at 1; 
Mr. Joe Wilson, No. 10 at 1; American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, 
No. 6 at 1; Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 21; Rocky Mountain 
Institute, No. 15 at 2; Crispaire, No. 19 at 1; Citizens Environmental 
Coalition Educational Fund, No. 24 at 3; Champaign County Board, No. 36 at 1; 
Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at 1; Mr. George Smith, No. 32 at 2; 
Sierra Club, No. 43 at 2; and Mr. Warren Widener, No. 78 at 2). Northwest 
Power Planning Council proposed a separate product class for add-on heat pumps 
for water heaters. (Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at 2). 

The Natural Resources Defense Council argued that heat pump water 
heaters should not be a separate class. In its comments, the Natural 
Resources Defense Council acknowledged some arguments in favor of keeping them 
a separate class, such as the inability to operate at low temperatures, which 
the Natural Resources Defense Council claimed can be overcome with electric 
resistance backup; first hour rating, which the Natural Resources Defense 
Council stated can be overcome with a larger tank; and noise, which the 
Natural Resources Defense Council suggested can be overcome with more 
insulation. The Natural Resources Defense Council argued that these are 
economic considerations, not product utility considerations. (Natural 
Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 22). On the other hand, Edison Electric 
Institute supported a separate product class for heat pump water heaters. 
Because of replacement market considerations, the heat pump compressor may 
have to be located outdoors, the air temperature must be greater than 45
 F, 
sufficient air circulation is needed (500 cfm) or surrounding air space must 
be of sufficient volume (1000 ft3), and there must be provision for condensate 
drainage. (Edison Electric Institute, No. 20 at 2). 

The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated that DOE should not 
analyze heat pump water heaters since their shipments are extremely low, 
totaling less than 0.05 percent of all electric water heater shipments. (Gas 
Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 4). 

The Department considered only one product class for electric storage 
water heaters. Heat pump water heaters were regarded as design options for 
electric storage water heaters. They provide the same utility as electric 
resistance storage water heaters. The Department agreed with the Natural 
Resources Defense Council that all of the issues regarding heat pump water 
heaters discussed above are economic in nature, and are treated as such in the 
analyses.

The Department decided a separate product class was not appropriate for 
add-on heat pumps. Since this type of heat pump is always used with a storage 
tank, there is no difference in the utility provided to the consumer. 
No detailed information describing the location of electric water 
heaters in existing houses was provided. Lacking better data, DOE assumed 
sufficient volume of air circulation would be available to allow proper 
operation of heat pump water heaters. Most of the heat pump water heaters 
considered in this analysis are currently available. They are all equipped 
with freeze protection and have backup resistance elements. This permits 
operation under adverse conditions. Providing condensate drains was included 
in the installation costs for all heat pump water heaters. 
The Department rejected the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association's 
comment that heat pump water heaters not be considered in the analysis because 
of their low sales volume. The Department would agree with the Gas Appliance 
Manufacturers Association if heat pump water heaters warranted a separate 
class; however, since they are treated as a design option, DOE concluded that 
they warrant consideration. The effect on water heater manufacturers of 
standard levels requiring heat pump water heaters was considered in the 
manufacturing impact analysis. 
The low heating rate of electric instantaneous water heaters presents a 
disadvantage with respect to their capability to provide a large quantity of 
hot water as rapidly as an electric resistance storage water heater. This 
difference justified two product classes (instantaneous and all other) for 
electric water heaters. There is little that can be done to improve the 
efficiency of electric instantaneous water heaters. Therefore, standards were 
not developed for electric instantaneous water heaters. 
Gas-fired instantaneous water heaters can provide unlimited amounts of 
hot water, but at limited rates. The Department judged this to be a 
significant difference in utility to the consumer. Gas instantaneous water 
heaters were, therefore, specified as a separate product class, and analyzed 
as such for standards.

United Technologies Carrier proposed a separate product class for a 
combined space and water heater. Electricity-using design options are viable 
for combination appliances, but would cause substantial increases in prices 
for gas water heater installations, and would inconvenience many customers. 
(United Technologies Carrier, No. 84 at 1). The Florida Governor's Office and 
the Northwest Power Planning Council proposed a product class for 
desuperheater water heaters. These are popular in Florida and use waste heat 
from air conditioners. Therefore, they operate only during the cooling 
season. (Florida Governor's Office, No. 42 at 6, and Northwest Power Planning 
Commission, No. 32 at 2). 
Before the Department can consider combination space and water heating 
appliances and desuperheating water heaters for regulation, test procedures 
would have to be developed and adopted by DOE for such appliances. 
Furthermore, appliances that provide combined services will be examined during 
a forthcoming rulemaking on amended standards for central air conditioners and 
central air conditioning heat pumps. 


Design options. 

There were many comments on the design options for water heaters. A discussion of these comments follows below. 
The Southern Gas Association and other gas companies provided price 
estimates of more efficient water heater designs. For water heaters with 
energy factors of 0.63, 0.74, and 0.54, the American Gas Association estimated 
uninstalled prices of $667, $729, and $195, respectively. (Southern Gas 
Association No. 4 at 4; Energen Corp. and Alabama Gas Corp., No. 12 at 6; 
South Carolina Electric and Gas Co., No. 34 at 3; Montana-Dakota Utilities 
Co., No. 54 at 3; Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, No. 57 at 4). 
The Columbia Gas provided a comparison of design options, energy factors 
and retail prices for four designs of efficiencies of gas water heaters. 
These were atmospheric draft/underfired (energy factor .54, $150-$350), 
atmospheric draft/subchamber (energy factor .62, $250-$500), forced 
draft/subchamber (energy factor .72, $600-$900), forced draft/immersed 
chamber (energy factor .82, $1300-$1800). (Columbia Gas, No. 45 at 3). 
The Department used a retail price of $155.48 for the baseline model 
with an energy factor of .54. This is based on a factory cost of $95.63 
supplied by the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association. The 63 percent 
markup from factory cost to retail price was provided by the Lawrence Berkeley 
Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model. Installation expense used in the 
analysis for the baseline model was $126.12. 
The Department included a standard venting, submerged combustion chamber 
water heater with heat traps, reduced heat leaks and R-16 insulation in the 
analysis, with an estimated energy factor of .57. At large-scale production, 
the submerged combustion chamber will not increase the factory cost.
 The 
heat traps, reduced heat leaks, and R-16 insulation added $18.19 to the 
factory cost, for a total factory cost of $113.82. The Lawrence Berkeley 
Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model estimated a markup of about 57 percent 
for a total retail price of $179.22. 




A model with an energy factor of .74 (calculated to have an energy 
factor of .71 using the proposed test procedure) was also included in the 
analysis. This unit has 2 inches of foam insulation surrounding a plastic 
tank, heat traps, indirect heating of the water, and electronic ignition. The 
Department estimated the factory cost of this unit at large-volume production 
to be $344.41. This estimate was based on an estimated 16 percent reduction 
in factory costs due to large-scale production. The retail price predicted 
by Manufacturer Impact Model was $612.96, with a 78 percent markup. 
A water heater with forced draft and submerged combustion chamber was 
not analyzed. However, the Department did consider forced draft with 
increased baffling. An estimated incremental manufacturing cost of $312.50 
was supplied by the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association. Heat traps, 
reduced heat leaks, and R-16 insulation were also included on this unit for an 
energy factor of .67 (calculated to have an energy factor of .66 using the 
proposed test procedure). A total factory cost of $426.32 was used. A markup 
of 40 percent from the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model 
was applied to arrive at a retail price of $596.83. 
The Department was not aware of any existing designs or prototypes for 
water heaters with forced draft and immersed chambers. No analysis was done 
for this design option.

The Wisconsin Blue Flame Council cited an incremental unit cost of $150 
to $200 to add automatic ignition devices and flue dampers to residential gas-fired water heaters. (Wisconsin Blue
Flame Council, No. 33 at 33). Equitable 
Resources stated the additional cost for electrical safety controls to be 
approximately $20 to $50. (Equitable Resources, No. 72 at 2). 
The Department used an incremental material cost of $49 for a spark 
ignition system, flue damper, 24-volt plug-transformer, and control relay.
 
Other factory costs were from the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association 
data.





Design Options for Storage Water Heaters


The Rocky Mountain Institute stated that DOE should study insulated 
pressure relief valves, plastic drain pipes, and flexible anode rods. (Rocky 
Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 4). The Natural Resources Defense Council 
proposed that DOE evaluate thermal short circuits through insulation. Work 
performed by the California Energy Commission and the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology showed that the effective thermal resistance is often 
50 percent or less than the thermal resistance calculated from the level of 
insulation. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 27). 
Reduced heat leaks were included as one of the design options in the 
analysis of water heaters. The actual features of this design option were not 
specified. Measures that could be included in this design option were to 
eliminate thermal bridges from jacket to feed throughs, to eliminate voids in 
insulation, to insulate the pressure relief valve, to install plastic drain 
pipes, and to reduce the number of feed throughs by combining functions. 
These measures were not modeled separately. 
The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy proposed that 
vacuum panels be considered as a design option. (American Council for an 
Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 3). 
Vacuum insulation was considered as one of the design options for both 
gas-fired and electric storage water heaters. 
The Rocky Mountain Institute stated that DOE should study more accurate 
thermostats and pipe insulation. (Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 4). 
The Department is not aware of any method to quantify energy savings 
from more accurate thermostats. Pipe insulation, which is not part of the 
water heater, was not considered as a design option because of concerns that 
it might not always be installed in the field. 
The Pacific Power stated its research shows that heat traps add only 1 
percent to an electric water heater's efficiency, not 5 percent as assigned in 
the previous DOE testing procedure for water heaters. (Pacific Power, No. 53 
at 2). 
The Department used data from a letter report prepared for DOE.
 This 
report determined actual heat losses out of pipe fittings with and without 
heat traps. The letter reported that heat traps provide a savings of nine 
watts on the hot water outlet and seven watts on the inlet. Applied to the 
baseline model, this results in a 2.5 percent increase in energy factor. 





Design Options for Gas-Fired Storage Water Heaters. 



The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association recommended that the 
multiple flues and submerged combustion chamber design options be combined 
into a single category to be called increased heat transfer surface. (Gas 
Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 4). 
The Department found enough difference in efficiency and cost between 
these designs to merit classification as individual design options. Water 
heaters currently on the market with submerged combustion chambers have 
recovery efficiencies of 85 percent, whereas currently available units with 
multiple flues have recovery efficiencies of 80 percent.

The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association recommended that pulse 
combustion and condensation be simplified to condensation of flue gases. The 
essential efficiency improvement is to extract enough heat out of the flue 
gases, such that condensation occurs. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers 
Association, No 40. at 5). 
The Department notes that manufacturing costs and actual efficiencies 
for design options that condense flue gases depend on the method of 
condensation. Therefore, pulse combustion was retained as a separate design 
option. 
Northern Indiana Public Service recommended that pulse combustion and 
condensation of flue gases be eliminated as design options. While these 
designs are clearly feasible from a technical standpoint, cost considerations 
have proven to be insurmountable thus far. (Northern Indiana Public Service, 
No. 48 at 3). 
Since pulse combustion and condensation of flue gas technologies are 
feasible, the Department cannot eliminate these design options, but has 
considered their cost impacts using the best available estimates of 
manufacturing cost. 
The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy proposed that flue 
dampers and intermittent ignition devices be treated as separate designs. 
(American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 3). 
Because of concerns about contaminating indoor air with combustion 
products from the pilot light, the Department did not consider flue dampers as 
a separate design option. 
The Natural Resources Defense Council proposed that DOE evaluate power 
combustion with intermittent ignition devices. (Natural Resources Defense 
Council, No. 13 at 27). 
From the limited description of this design option, the Department 
assumed that the Natural Resources Defense Council was referring to a fan-assisted combustion system using electronic
ignition with the fan before the 
combustion chamber. Part of the increase in efficiency from this design is 
caused by the fan restricting off-cycle air flow through the flue. This 
reduces off-cycle flue losses. The Department analyzed power vent with 
intermittent ignition devices, which is a fan-assisted combustion system with 
the fan after the combustion chamber. The reduction of flue losses would be 
similar to the reduction for the design option recommended by the Natural 
Resources Defense Council. 
Northern Indiana Public Service also stated that for vent fans, the main 
energy-conserving value is the reduction of flue losses, and a thermal vent 
damper could be used to accomplish that reduction more simply. (Northern 
Indiana Public Service, No. 48 at 4). 
The Department did not analyze vent dampers, which are above the draft 
hood, but did analyze flue dampers, which are below the draft hood, in 
conjunction with intermittent ignition devices as discussed above. 
Oklahoma Natural Gas proposed that DOE analyze improved burner design, 
modulating controls, improved flue baffling and improved fill tube designs to 
reduce sediment buildup and temperature stacking of heated water. (Oklahoma 
Natural Gas, No. 57 at 2). 
The Department was not able to obtain cost and efficiency data for 
improved burner design or fill tube designs. No analysis was done for 
modulating controls, because the Department is not aware of how this design 
would improve efficiency. Improved flue baffling was included as a design 
option. 
Mr. Rajendra Narang provided patented items for improving the efficiency 
of gas and oil water heaters. These included preheat of combustion air, self-
regulating fuel flow to the burner, lower heat input, combustion dampers, and 
better heat exchangers. (Narang, No. 82). 
No data on potential energy efficiency improvements or incremental 
manufacturing costs were available for these design options. In addition, DOE 
was not able to develop any estimates on the cost or efficiency of these 
designs. Therefore, they were not included in today's proposed rule. The 
Department requests cost and efficiency data on these designs in order to 
evaluate them for inclusion in the final rule.

Pilot Light Design Options


The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated that ``reduced pilot 
light input rate'' should not be considered as a design option because pilot 
inputs have been reduced to the optimal point. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers 
Association, No. 40 at 4). 
The Department agrees with the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association 
on this issue. Therefore, further reductions in pilot light input rate were 
not considered. 
Northern Indiana Public Service stated that the elimination of a pilot 
light has a very small savings. (Northern Indiana Public Service, No. 48 at 
4). Washington Gas Light Company noted that not all of the heat from a pilot 
light is wasted. (Washington Gas Light Company, No. 37 at 9). 
The Department agrees that only a portion of the heat from a pilot light 
is wasted. In the analysis, DOE assumed 76 percent of the pilot light's 
energy went to maintaining water temperature. This is based on the theory 
that a pilot light would have the same efficiency as the recovery efficiency 
of the water heater. Therefore, only the 24 percent of the pilot light input 
available to be saved by an intermittent ignition device was included in the 
analysis. 


Design Options for Electric Storage Water Heaters


The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association stated that off-peak 
water heaters save energy. (National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, 
No. 17 at 1). Vaughn said that off-peak electric water heaters can save 
energy use by controlling time period elements are allowed to heat water. 
(Vaughn, No. 75 at 2). 
The Department did include off-peak water heaters as a design option in 
the Engineering Analysis for electric water heaters. However, as stated 
above, the Department believes that the economics of this design option, in 
the absence of the nationwide availability of time-of-day rates, precludes 
using this design option in setting national standards. 
Crispaire provided unit energy consumption and annual performance 
factors for heat pump water heaters and electric resistance water heaters. 
Crispaire also stated that its studies showed consumer acceptance of heat pump 
water heaters. (Crispaire, No. 19 at 2). 
The Department included two existing models of heat pump water heaters 
in the analysis of electric water heaters. One was an E-Tech brand model 
manufactured by Crispaire. Energy consumption for this model was calculated 
from the energy factor derived from the DOE water heater test procedure in 
effect prior to October 17, 1990,
 derated by 25 percent to account for 
estimated reductions due to the current test procedure relative to the 
previous test procedure. This derating value was based on estimated 
reductions of 15-20 percent from ETL Testing Laboratories,
 27 percent from the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association,
 and 30 percent from Electric Power Research Institute
 simulation models. The Gas Appliance 
Manufacturers Association estimate was based on the difference between data 
supplied in support of the rulemaking and the least efficient heat pump water 
heater listed in its directory. This is a minimum estimate of the difference. 
The Department requests test data on heat pump water heaters, in accordance 
with the existing test procedures, for consideration in the final rule. 








The Natural Resources Defense Council advised that increased jacket 
insulation and heat traps be evaluated for heat pump water heaters. (Natural 
Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 27). 
Heat pump water heaters were analyzed as a design option for electric 
storage water heaters. Increased jacket insulation and heat traps were also 
included as design options for this product class. 
The Ohio Sierra Club commented that in many parts of the U.S., a solar 
water heating system is considerably more cost-effective than an electric 
water heater. (Ohio Sierra Club, No. 11 at 2).

The Department included solar pre-heating as a design option for 
electric storage water heaters. Baltimore, Maryland was used as the location 
for evaluating the solar water heating systems. Baltimore was chosen as the 
one site that most closely approximated the population-weighted average 
climate of the United States. 


Design Options for Instantaneous Gas-Fired Water Heaters


The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association commented that reducing the 
amount of water within instantaneous water heaters would reduce the heater's 
ability to provide sufficient heated water. The Gas Appliance Manufacturers 
Association further noted that instantaneous water heaters do not utilize 
flues to transfer heat to water. Design options which concern flue 
improvements are not applicable to instantaneous water heaters. (Gas 
Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 5). 
The Department agrees with the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association 
on these issues. Reducing the amount of water in the heater and flue 
improvements were not considered in the analysis of instantaneous water 
heaters. 
The Natural Resources Defense Council recommended that DOE consider an 
intermittent ignition device for instantaneous water heaters as a design 
option. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 27). 

This design option was included in the analysis of instantaneous water 
heaters. 


Reducing Water Heater Setpoint Temperature


Another comment on design options dealt with a design to limit the 
temperature of the hot water produced by a water heater. National Wildlife 
Federation proposed that DOE consider the promulgation of a design standard 
covering the factory setting of water heater temperature controls. It stated 
that 140
 F water can cause burns, and reducing this temperature could lower 
accidents. In addition, the energy savings would be substantial. (National 
Wildlife Federation, No. 21 at 3). 
The Department did not consider the hot water setting as a design option 
for water heaters. While it is true that reducing the hot water temperature 
will save energy at the water heater, hot wash cycles in clothes washers and 
dishwashers with 140
 F water are required for certain conditions. All clothes 
washers and dishwashers would have to contain electric resistance booster 
heaters to maintain this utility. The use of these electric resistance 
booster heaters would mean that some water heating currently being performed 
by gas water heaters would be performed by electrical resistance heating with 
a corresponding loss in overall efficiency. 


Other Comments.

 Fuel switching. One of the most discussed consumer issues involved the impact of increases in initial purchase price
for gas water heaters, since standards could alter consumer fuel choice, resulting in increased electricity consumption
at the expense of gas consumption, and increased environmental degradation. (Middle Tennessee Natural Gas Utility
District, No. 1 at 1; Wisconsin Southern Gas Company, No. 9 at 1-2; Colorado Interstate Gas Company, No. 14 at
2; Peoples Natural Gas Company, No. 28 at 1; Wisconsin Blue Flame Council, No. 33 at 1-2; WGL, No. 37 at 5; Columbia
Gas Distribution Company, No. 45 at 3; Northern Indiana Public Service Company, No. 48 at 4; ENTEX, No. 58 at 2; Peoples
Gas Light and Coke Company (Peoples), No. 65 at 1; Mobile Gas Service Corporation, No. 66 at 2; Northern Minnesota Utilities,
No. 68 at 1; Delta Natural Gas Company, Inc., No. 73 at 1; Public Service Company of North Carolina, Inc., No. 74 at 4;
and Southern California Gas Company, No. 79 at 1). 
Concern was expressed that if standards imposed on gas water heaters 
include automatic ignition, requiring electric service, there will be a 
sizeable increase in the prices of gas appliances. The comments argued that 
builders are concerned with initial purchase prices, not life-cycle costs; 
thus, a switch to electricity consumption will occur. 
The Department is sensitive to fuel-switching issues. The Department 
incorporated available data about fuel shares in new housing and replacement 
markets, based on historical purchase patterns, in the Lawrence Berkeley 
Laboratory Residential Energy Model. Additional data to quantify the 
sensitivity in the market to first cost and to operating cost were obtained. 
Also, sensitivity analyses were performed in the forecast of shipments of 
water heaters.

The Department also notes that standards resulting in price increases on 
gas water heaters would cause switching to electric water heaters only if 
similar or greater price increases did not occur for efficiency improvements 
to electric water heaters, which is certainly not the case. 



Supplying Electricity to Gas-Fired Storage Water Heaters 



Several comments addressed inclusion of installation and maintenance 
expenses in the engineering analyses. The Southern Gas Association, American 
Gas Association, and Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, among others, 
stated that installation (electric supply and venting alterations) and 
maintenance for gas water heater designs that would require electricity, such 
as intermittent ignition device, induced draft combustion, power venting, and 
condensing, must be included in the analyses. (Southern Gas Association, No. 
4 at 10; American Gas Association, No. 23 at 3; and Gas Appliance 
Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 8). 

The American Gas Association, Southern Gas Association, and several 
other gas utilities gave estimates of costs for providing electric service to 
a water heater. For an existing appliance location, costs ranged from $75 to 
$200 and for new construction from $15 to $50. (American Gas Association, No. 
23 at 5; Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 3; Lone Star, No. 39 at 6; 
Energen, No. 12 at 5; Equitable Resources, No. 72 at 2; South Carolina Gas and 
Electric Company, No. 34 at 2, 3; Arkansas Western Gas Company, No. 64 at 5; 
ENTEX, No. 58 at 5; Public Service Company of North Carolina, No. 74 at 4; 
Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, No. 57 at 3.) 

The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated that installation 
expenses for electric service could double the installed price of the water 
heater. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 3). On the other 
hand, Flair said that in northern climates, the water heater most likely 
stands next to the furnace, which has an electrical supply readily and 
cheaply available to the water heater. Flair estimated that the average price 
of adding electricity is much less than the cost of the water heater. (Flair, 
No. 85 at 1). 

The Department used a cost of $11.20 for the installer to add a small 
plug-in transformer and install low-voltage wiring to the water heater.

 The Department assumed this would not require an electrician, and would allow 
the water heater to be installed a large distance from an existing outlet. 
This would provide sufficient power to run safety controls, spark ignition, 
flue damper, and a small venting fan. For design options, such as condensing 
flue gases, submerged combustion, and direct firing, which would require 
higher voltage, a charge of $100 was used as the installation price of 
providing electricity. This figure was presented to the Department by 
Southern Gas Association.

Modification of Existing Venting Systems 



The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association mentioned that for water 
heating systems to be compatible with existing venting systems, recovery 
efficiencies must be less than 82 percent. Gas Appliance Manufacturers 
Association further stated that elimination of the draft hood and installation 
of a new venting system for both a furnace and water heater would modify the 
installed price of the water heater by three to five times. (Gas Appliance 
Manufacturers Association, No.40 at 4). The Gas Research Institute said that 
additional expenses of altering venting systems are necessary for high- 
efficiency water heaters. Estimates of these expenses
 were provided to the Department on a regional basis. (Gas Research Institute, No. 59 at 2-3). 





The Washington Gas Light, Inc. indicated that ``installing a water heater 
with a vent damper or power combustion into an existing masonry chimney . . . 
may result in the need to reline the chimney.'' The charge for this would be 
between $500 and $2000. (Washington Gas Light, Inc., No. 37 at 8). ENTEX 
estimated installing a new vent system in its service area would be 
approximately $260. (ENTEX, No. 58 at 5). Energen Corporation estimated the 
incremental cost of adding a new vent system at $125 to $175. (Energen, No. 12 
at 6). 

The charge for relining venting systems that were not type-B was added 
to the installation expense of all design options with recovery efficiencies 
above 80 percent that were not power vented. The Department used values of 
$408 for relining masonry chimneys, $85 for replacing vent connectors, and $75 
for adding a sidewall venting system.






Maintenance



Mississippi Valley and Energen stated that when an intermittent ignition 
device and flue damper or forced draft combustion are added to a gas water 
heater, it is likely that at least one of the following components (ignitor, 
fan motor, printed circuit board, fan relay system, or vent damper assembly) 
will fail and need service or replacement in the 10- to 12-year life of the 
water heater. (Mississippi Valley, No. 5 at 6; Energen, No. 12 at 8). 

Among other comments on the engineering analysis of water heaters, 
Energen stated that reliability and functionality issues are most important in 
a total system-specific, real world situation. Issues such as venting 
materials, vent categories, common venting, vent-system condensation, 
corrosion, masonry chimney suitability, backdrafting, spillage, negative room 
pressure, combustion air management, construction clearances, vent termination 
requirements, heat or flame roll out, flammable vapors ignition, and others 
must be a significant part of the efficiency equation. (Energen, No. 12 at 
9). 

The limited data available on component lifetimes suggested failure 
would occur near the end of the service life of water heaters. Therefore, the 
Department did not include maintenance expenses in the analysis. The 
Department requests data on water heater lifetimes, component lifetimes and 
service costs for consideration in the final rule. 



Baseline Model



The Southern Gas Association and other gas suppliers recommended 
baseline units and costs. (Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 8). Energen 
said that the baseline unit should logically be a natural draft, non-powered 
unit upgraded to the highest field-proven technology level, including heat 
traps, advanced insulation techniques, sealing of the pilot light and/or main 
burner combustion cavity, piezo pilot ignitors, flue dampers and or advanced 
flue baffling. (Energen No. 12 at 8). Lone Star proposed that shipment data 
from the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association be used for baselines. (Lone 
Star, No. 39 at 3). 

The baseline model used in this analysis was established from data 
provided by the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association who was supplied with 
the data by manufacturers. The baseline represents a typical water heater 
that marginally meets the 1990 National Appliance Energy Conservation Act 
standards. 

The baseline gas-fired storage water heater is a center flue, glass- 
lined steel tank with a standing pilot. It has a 40-gallon tank and 
1-inch-thick foam insulation. Both the inlet and outlet are at the top of the 
tank. It has six feed throughs and no heat traps. It is bottom-fired with a 
three-inch central flue. The burner input is 34,000 Btu per hour. The pilot 
light input rate is 400 Btu per hour.

The baseline model for the electric water heater analysis is a glass-lined steel tank, with two 4,500-watt resistance
elements. It has a 52-gallon tank and 2-inch-thick foam insulation. Both the inlet and the outlet are on top of the tank.
It has eight feed throughs and no heat traps.



Measured Versus Rated Volume



The California Energy Commission proposed that the measured volume rather than the rated volume of water heaters
be used in all analyses. (California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 3).

With regard to how the Department should set water heater conservation standards, the California Energy Commission
proposed that any standard be expressed as EF = A + (B * V), and not as EF = A ^ (B * V), so that an exaggeration of volume, V,
by manufacturers would result in a more stringent standard. (California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 3).

The California Energy Commission also argued that tolerances between rated and measured volumes of 5 percent and
10 percent, respectively, for gas and electricity water heaters volumes, are too high. (California Energy Commission,
No. 24 at 2).

The energy conservation standards are in the form of equations that are a function of the volume of the water heater.
A footnote refers to the volume as being rated volume. The DOE test procedure contains provisions to determine the
measured or actual volume, but is silent on the rated volume which is established by the manufacturer. The tolerances
to which the California Energy Commission are referring are those set by safety testing agency specifications and
are not related to the energy efficiency program. In the vast majority of cases, the measured volume is lower than the
rated volume. All of the 13 water heaters tested by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in support of
the DOE test procedure had measured volumes below rated volumes. Furthermore, one out of six electric water heaters
and one out of five gas water heaters tested by the National Institute of Standards and Technology exceeded the safety
tolerances for rated volume. (55 FR 42166, October 17, 1990 and 54 FR 1893, January 17, 1989). To conduct the analysis
which forms the basis for today's notice in an accurate manner, the actual volume had to be used. To be consistent with
that analysis, the Department is proposing that the volume referred to in the efficiency equation be the actual or
measured volume. The Department believes that the use of measured volume rather than rated volume in the calculation
will eliminate this issue.



Definitions in Test Procedure and Conservation Standards



The California Energy Commission proposed that the coverage of the water heater test procedures and efficiency standards
be consistent, i.e., the test procedure does not cover some classes and sizes of water heaters that otherwise would
be covered by the efficiency standards. (California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 2-3).

Modifications to the test procedures for water heaters, which address these issues, are contained in the Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking referenced above.

Gas Research Institute Study



Energen urged DOE to evaluate thoroughly a study commissioned by the gas 
industry on cost/efficiency of water heater designs. (Energen, No. 12 at 9.)

The Department did review and use information from this Gas Research Institute study,
 particularly cost data for installation and reventing. The study was also useful in categorizing standby losses.





3. Direct Heating Equipment





Classes.

 Among the comments on product classes, Southern Gas Association, Energen Corp. and Atlanta Gas Light Company proposed
that direct heating product classes be expanded to separate each present class into two classes, one with and one without
an electric cord. The division of product classes by capacity is not mentioned. Their arguments deal generally with
economic and utility issues, i.e., the ability of products without an electric cord to provide heat if a power outage
occurs, and the affordability of these products to lower-income people. (Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 6; Energen,
No. 12 at 12-13; and AGLC, No. 29 at 3). The California Energy Commission stated that there are too many product
classes for this product and proposed three classes which are wall (fan and gravity), floor (fan and gravity), and
room (fan and gravity). (California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 4).

As stated above, the Department does not believe that the ability of gas equipment to operate during electricity outages
is a utility that requires separating the existing gravity product classes into those with and without a power cord.
Instead, designs that use electricity are evaluated on their economic advantages and disadvantages. The Department
has kept the four product class categories as designated by the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act. The categories
are: fan-wall, gravity-wall, room, and floor. With respect to division by capacity, the Department kept the National
Appliance Energy Conservation Act divisions during the engineering analyses. The current class divisions by capacity
are necessary because of the manner in which direct heating equipment is evaluated by the DOE test procedure. The energy
descriptor for this equipment, the annual fuel utilization efficiency, is a function of, among other things, the
pilot fraction. The pilot fraction is defined as the energy input rate to the pilot light (Q

p

) divided by the steady-state heat input rate to the heater (Q

in

). As the pilot fraction decreases, the annual fuel utilization efficiency will increase. For each of the four categories
of direct heating equipment (fan-wall, gravity-wall, room, floor), the pilot light input rate is constant. Thus,
for heaters of two different capacities within the same category and with the same steady-state efficiency, the annual
fuel utilization efficiency will always be higher for the larger capacity equipment. The division of classes by capacity
is required to account for this relationship between the annual fuel utilization efficiency and the pilot fraction.



Design options.

 The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated that gravity-type direct heating units provide a unique utility
in that they operate during an electrical power outage. In addition, gravity-type equipment can be used where an external
electrical source is not available. Because of these reasons, the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association argued
that design options requiring electricity should not be required for floor heaters, room heaters, or gravity wall
furnaces. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association No. 40 at 6).

As stated above, the Department does not believe that the ability of gas equipment to operate during electric outages
is a utility that forecloses consideration of electricity-using design options for those appliances. Therefore,
the Department considered, for economic justification, design options that would require electricity for gravity
wall, floor, and room direct heating equipment.

With regard to electronic ignition systems, both Southern Gas Association and North Carolina Public Service Co.
stated that adding an automatic ignition system and electronic controls would add significantly to the price of direct
heating equipment. The Southern Gas Association said it would add $190 while North Carolina Public Service Co. stated
it would add $150 to $200. (Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 7; North Carolina Public Service Co., No. 74 at 5). The
American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy said that intermittent ignition device and vent dampers should
be considered separately. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 3).

The Department took into account all sources of available data when determining the cost of an electronic ignition
system for direct heating equipment. Sources of data included manufacturers, suppliers, utilities, and published
papers and reports. The electronic ignition design option was evaluated not only separately from any other design
option, but also with other design options, including vent dampers.

The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association commented that increased insulation does not improve the energy efficiency
of room heaters since this equipment is located within the heated space. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association,
No. 40 at 6).

The Department agrees with the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association's comment and is not considering the increased
insulation design option for room heaters or wall furnaces. Insulation is only applicable to floor furnaces as this
equipment's intended installation is in an unconditioned crawl space.

The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association also commented that two-stage or modulating burners reduce the energy
efficiency of direct heating equipment. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers 
Association, No. 40 at 6). 

The Department agrees with the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association's comment. When incorporated into a typical
gravity or forced-air 
direct heater, i.e., heaters that are currently being manufactured, two-stage 
and modulating burners actually reduce the energy efficiency of direct heating 
equipment. Two-stage and modulating burners which are currently manufactured 
regulate the gas flow but not the air flow. Excess air is induced at lower 
gas-flow rates, resulting in lower combustion efficiencies when compared to a 
normal or maximum gas flow rate. Because of this, typical heaters equipped 
with two-stage or modulating burners will always have a lower energy 
efficiency, as measured by the DOE test procedure, than heaters equipped with 
single-stage burners. The Department is not aware of any two-stage or 
modulating burners that regulate both the gas and air flow. The Department 
believes however, that it is possible to regulate the air flow being drawn 
into a two-stage or modulating burner if the direct heater is also equipped 
with a two-speed or variable-speed combustion fan, i.e., induced or forced 
draft system. With a multi-speed combustion fan, a low fan speed can be used 
to reduce the excess air that would normally occur at low gas flow rates. 
Thus, the steady-state efficiency that occurs at the high gas flow rate of a 
two-stage or modulating burner can be maintained at its lower gas flow rate. 
Since currently manufactured two-stage and modulating burners actually reduce 
energy efficiency in typical direct heating equipment, DOE is considering them 
as a design option only if they are incorporated into a heater already 
equipped with a multiple-speed induced or forced draft combustion system. 

The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy said that DOE 
should consider two-speed or variable-speed blowers. (American Council for an 
Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 3). 

The practical application of two-speed or variable-speed blowers is with 
two-stage or modulating burners. When heating loads are low, both the burner 
rate and the blower speed could be reduced. This would prevent cycling of the 
unit and reduce large fluctuations in room temperature. In addition, overall 
energy consumption could be reduced. As with two-stage and modulating 
burners, two-speed and variable-speed blowers will also be considered by the 
Department only on heaters already equipped with a multiple-speed induced or 
forced draft combustion system. This is because two-stage or modulating 
operation can improve system efficiency only if coupled with a device, i.e., a 
multi-speed combustion system that can regulate the air flow rate into a 
two-stage or modulating burner. 

The North Carolina Public Service Co. suggested that DOE consider 
whether blowers can be used in direct heating equipment with self-generating 
pilots. (North Carolina Public Service Co., No. 74 at 5). 

It is not clear to what North Carolina Public Service is referring, as 
it fails to define clearly in its comment which blower it is discussing and 
what a self-generating pilot is. A blower could be interpreted as either an 
air circulation fan or an induced or power draft fan. The self-generating 
pilot is probably some type of electronic ignition device. The Department has 
evaluated all of the above-mentioned design options and has determined that 
blowers of any type can be used with electronic ignition systems. 

The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association commented that for a 
replacement unit incorporating an increased heat exchanger surface area, 
condensate must be avoided in the existing vent system. This requirement 
results in limiting the combustion efficiency to 83 percent. (Gas Appliance 
Manufacturers Association, 40 at 7). 

The Department agrees with the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association's 
comment and considered venting issues in the analysis. Design options that 
increased the combustion efficiency over 83 percent require an additional 
installation charge to account for venting low-temperature flue gases and 
draining condensate. 



Other comments. 

The Southern Gas Association, Energen, and the Atlanta Gas 
Light Company recommended baseline units for direct heating equipment. 
(Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 8; Energen, No. 12 at 15,16; Atlanta Gas 
Light Company, No. 29 at 4). 

The Department considered these comments regarding baseline units in the 
Engineering Analysis. Baseline unit efficiency levels for each of the direct 
heating product classes have been set at the standard levels established by 
the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act. Of the units currently 
produced, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act minimum efficiency 
standards are representative of the efficiency levels that presently exist for 
most models. 

Minnegasco said that installation and maintenance expenses for direct 
heating products are important, and that DOE must consider them. (Minnegasco, 
No. 83 at 3).

The Department has considered these expenses in the analysis of direct 
heating equipment. The increase in consumer expenses caused by a design 
option includes not only the increase in retail price, but also any additional 
installation and maintenance expenses that result from incorporating that 
design option into the equipment. 

Southern Gas Association contended that more efficient direct heating 
equipment would have a severe economic impact on lower-income and elderly 
consumers, and that low usage in Southern states should be evaluated. 
(Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 7,10). Minnegasco also commented on the 
issue of low usage by urging DOE to consider regional usage when performing 
the engineering analysis. (Minnegasco, No. 83 at 2). 

The Department has lowered its usage assumption by using the modified 
burner operating hours contained in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
mentioned above for furnace test procedures. The proposed burner operating 
hours for direct heating equipment has been revised downward to account for 
the regional distribution of this product disproportionately to the southern 
half of the Nation. The Department has no data with which to measure the 
standards' impacts on elderly and lower-income consumers in determining 
whether a standard level is economically justified; however, DOE will consider 
the financial effect that the standard has on such consumers. 

In the Advance Notice for this rulemaking, the Department described how 
it performs sensitivity analyses to help it understand the effects on the 
forecasted impacts because of changes in the exogenous variables and 
assumptions. (55 FR 39633). 

Those sensitivities were developed at the national level, and no effort 
was made to link them with any specific population groups. With the exception 
of the direct heating equipment analysis discussed above, the standards 
analysis assumed that nationwide average appliance usage rates, energy prices, 
and efficiency applied to all consumers in all areas of the nation, although 
the Department recognized that there exist large variations in each of these 
factors. The Department seeks additional information concerning the extent to 
which any proposed national efficiency standard is likely to affect 
identifiable groups of consumers disproportionally and, especially how best to 
consider such impacts in the selection of efficiency standard levels. The 
Department is also seeking additional data to help it better assess the 
disproportionate impacts on such groups. 



4. Mobile Home Furnaces 





Design options. 

The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated that an 
intermittent ignition device design is not appropriate to mobile home 
furnaces. The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated there is almost 
no flow through the heat exchanger during the off-cycle. If the intermittent 
ignition device failed, a gas-air mixture could build up and possibly lead to 
an explosion when the intermittent ignition device is activated. (Gas 
Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 7). 

The Department accepted Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association's 
comment and did not consider an intermittent ignition device plus vent damper 
as an engineering design for mobile home furnaces. 

American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy proposed intermittent 
ignition devices and vent dampers be separately considered and that two-speed 
or variable-speed blowers be evaluated. (American Council for an Energy 
Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 4). 

The Department has accepted these approaches. The intermittent ignition 
device with fan-forced combustion has been considered as one option, while the 
combustion box damper has been considered as a separate option. A combustion 
box damper has the same effect on efficiency as a vent damper for isolated 
combustion-type systems. Mobile home furnaces are required to have isolated 
combustion systems by the Housing and Urban Development code. Both two-stage 
and continuously modulated burners were included in the final list of design 
options.

Evcon commented that vent dampers are inappropriate designs because of 
damper location and isolated combustion design. (Evcon, No. 76 at 1). 
The Department has considered combustion box dampers instead of vent 
dampers. The Department knows of no design considerations that would render 
combustion box dampers inappropriate. 
Evcon also suggested that condensing designs and intermittent ignition 
devices are inappropriate because of excessive cost. (Evcon, No. 76 at 1-2). 
The Department has incorporated the costs for materials, components, 
maintenance, and installation into the Engineering Analysis. 
Evcon further commented that expense and noise problems exist with 
pulsed combustion furnaces. (Evcon, No. 76 at 1). 
The Department acknowledges these points and notes that pulsed 
combustion is no longer on the list of design options. In eliminating this 
design option, the Department reasoned that non-pulsed combustion technology 
can achieve efficiencies equivalent to pulsed-combustion technology at a lower 
cost. This is particularly true for manufacturers having to pay patent 
royalties for pulse combustion technology. Manufacturing cost data from the 
manufacturers supported this conclusion. 
Lastly, Evcon commented that corrosion and cost problems exist with two-stage and modulating burner designs. (Evcon,
No. 76 at 2). 
In the Engineering Analysis, the Department assumed that material costs 
(for the concentric flue/supply air assembly) would increase because of the 
need to design for possible intermittent condensation in two-stage non- 
condensing furnaces. Non-condensing modulating furnaces are not included in 
the present list of design options. 


Other comments. 

Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association also commented that 
replacement furnaces must be able to fit into the same spaces as the units 
being replaced. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 7). 
The Department does not believe that any of the studied design options 
would result in significant space problems. 
Evcon also commented that American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, 
and Air-conditioning Engineers Standard 103-1982 is inadequate for the testing 
of various design options and urged that American National Standards 
Institute/American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning 
Engineers Standard 103-88 be adopted. (Evcon, No. 76 at 2). 
Modifications to the test procedures for furnaces, which address these 
issues, are contained in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking referenced above. 


5. Kitchen Ranges and Ovens 




Classes. 

The comments on classes for conventional ranges and ovens ranged 
from Aloha Systems Inc.'s recommendation that all electric cooktops be one 
product class to Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers's proposal to add 
several classes to those proposed in the Advanced Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking. Specifically, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
recommended that DOE add, as classes, electric cooktops with grill/griddle 
without downdraft feature, and for gas cooktops_grill/griddle with 
downdraft feature, grill/griddle without downdraft feature with and without an 
electric cord, and warming/simmer burners. (Aloha Systems, Inc., No. 2 at 1; 
and Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 38). 
Several comments supported the range/oven product classes that were 
listed in the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Four gas utilities, 
Southern Gas Association, Energen, South Carolina Electric and Gas Company - 
Gas Operations, and the Oklahoma Natural Gas Co., all supported the classes 
selected by DOE for gas cooktops and gas ovens. (Southern Gas Association, 
No. 4 at 7; Energen, No. 12 at 14; South Carolina Electric and Gas Company - 
Gas Operations, No. 34 at 6; and the Oklahoma Natural Gas Co., No. 57 at 6).

The rest of the comments on range/oven product classes argued that the 
Department had proposed far too many different classes in the September 1990 
advance notice. As mentioned, Aloha Systems, Inc. recommended a single 
product class for electric cooktops. The American Council for an Energy 
Efficient Economy, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the California 
Energy Commission, and the Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council all stated 
that there are too many classes for conventional ranges and ovens. (Aloha 
Systems, Inc. No. 2 at 1; American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, 
No. 6 at 1; Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 25, California Energy 
Commission, No. 24 at 5; and Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council, No. 60 at 
9). ENTEX proposed that the Department specify freestanding, drop-in, and 
slide-in ovens and wall ovens as one class. (ENTEX, No. 58 at 6). Whirlpool 
Corporation, a manufacturer of ranges and ovens, suggested that DOE not 
analyze those classes with low sales volumes, and instead restrict the 
analysis to the following nine classes: Electric cooktops with open coil 
elements; electric cooktops with solid disk elements; standard or catalytic 
electric ovens; self-cleaning electric ovens; conventional or sealed burner 
gas cooktops (with and without power cords); standard or catalytic gas ovens 
(with and without power cords) and self-cleaning gas ovens. (Whirlpool 
Corporation, No. 31 at 16). Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
stated that three of the classes listed in the Advanced Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking for gas cooktops, conventional burners with electrical cords, 
conventional burners without electrical cords and sealed burners, should be 
consolidated into two classes, namely, conventional and sealed burners with 
electrical cords and conventional and sealed burners without electrical cords. 
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 47, 48). 

After considering the comments and reviewing the data, the Department 
believes that many of the classes proposed in the September advance notice 
were not warranted on a utility and performance basis. 

For this proposed rule, four product classes were considered for 
electric cooktops: Low or high wattage open (coil) elements, smooth cooktops, 
grill with or without downdraft feature, and griddle with or without downdraft 
feature. The baseline cooktop element selected for smooth cooktops is a solid 
disk element. As compared to open coil element cooktops, smooth cooktops are 
much easier to clean. Because cleanability is a consumer utility, the 
Department believes that a separate class is warranted for smooth cooktops. 
Induction cooking, halogen lamps, and radiant elements were considered as 
design options for smooth cooktops and assessed according to the economic 
characteristics of the particular design. Because of the small amount of 
empirical data on grill and griddle cooktops, the Department was unable to 
analyze these classes. In addition, the DOE test procedure is presently 
unable to measure grill or griddle energy consumption, and the Department has 
not proposed to include the testing of grills or griddles. As a result, the 
Department is not proposing any standard for these two classes. 

Four product classes are now considered for gas cooktops: Conventional 
burners, grill with or without downdraft feature, griddle with or without 
downdraft feature, and warming/simmer burners. For other designs, the 
Department does not believe that significant utility issues exist, for 
example, in the ability of the appliance to operate during electric outages, 
which would require that classes be established into gas cooktops with and 
without electrical cords. Between 90 and 93 percent of residential 
electricity customers experience no electric outages longer than four hours 
per year.
 Designs which use electricity were evaluated on their economic 
advantages and disadvantages. Other classes in the Advance Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (sealed and radiant burners) were considered as design options for 
conventional cooktops. There were no utility issues warranting separate 
classes for sealed and radiant burners. As with electric cooktops, because of 
the small amount of empirical data on grill and griddle cooktops and warming 
burners, the Department was unable to analyze these classes. In addition, the 
DOE test procedure is presently unable to measure grill, griddle or warming 
burner energy consumption, and the Department has not proposed to include the 
testing of grills, griddles or warming burners. As a result, the Department 
is not proposing any standard for these three classes.

Two product classes were considered for electric ovens: Standard ovens 
with or without catalytic linings and self-cleaning ovens. Oven types that 
were listed as classes in the September 1990 advance notice (forced convection 
for cooking, forced convection for cleaning, halogen lamp, and steam cooking 
with and without pressure) were considered as design options. The Department 
believes that no utility issues exist warranting additional classes beyond 
standard and self-cleaning ovens. 


As with electric ovens, two product classes were considered for gas 
ovens: Standard ovens and self-cleaning ovens. Oven types that were listed as 
classes in the September 1990 advance notice (radiant burner and convection) 
were considered as design options. In addition, the Department does not 
believe that significant utility issues exist in the ability of the appliance 
to operate during electric outages, which would require that classes be 
established into those with and without electrical cords. Designs which use 
electricity are evaluated on their economic advantages and disadvantages. 

As for microwave oven classes, both Whirlpool Corporation and 
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers recommended that the Department 
limit its analysis to microwave ovens with and without browning elements, the 
classes which accounted for 96.8 percent of domestic shipments in 1989. 
(Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 9; Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers, No, 61A at 30). 

The Department rejected the proposals to limit the analysis to two 
product classes: conventional microwave ovens with and without browning 
elements. The Department combined these ovens into one class. Since the test 
procedure does not measure the energy use of the browning element, there is no 
need to separate these two kinds of ovens into classes; therefore, only one 
class of microwave ovens was analyzed. 



Design options

. There were numerous comments on the design options for 
ranges/ovens and microwave ovens. Natural Resources Defense Council 
recommended that DOE study (for ranges/ovens) reduction in thermal mass, 
catalytic burners, reflective surfaces, the biradiant concept, and improved 
magnetrons for microwave ovens. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 
27-28). Aloha Systems, Inc. said that induction cooking is the most 
efficient method. (Aloha Systems, Inc., No. 2 at 1,2). American Council for 
an Energy Efficient Economy proposed that DOE evaluate the infrared jet gas 
burner for conventional ovens, and for microwave ovens, advanced transformer 
winding and core materials, and the high-efficiency electronic controller 
(which turns power on and off). (American Council for an Energy Efficient 
Economy, No. 6 at 4). The Rocky Mountain Institute proposed that DOE study 
improved controls that allow the resistance element to ``coast'' the food to 
completion. A reference to European tests was given, stating that this design 
requires a thermostat and temperature control knob and saves 20 percent or 
more of the energy. (Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 5). The Oklahoma 
Natural Gas Co. suggested that thermostatically controlled gas burners be 
replaced by various-sized (Btu/h input and dimensions) and manually controlled 
surface burners to accommodate different-size cookware. (Oklahoma Natural Gas 
Co., No. 57 at 6). The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers provided 
comments on each design option for ranges/ovens and microwave ovens. 
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 30-62). Whirlpool 
Corporation supported the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers' 
comments on ranges/ovens and microwave ovens. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 
at 16, 19).

For gas cooktops, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated 
that thermostatically controlled gas burners are not effective at controlling 
temperature. The sensing element which is designed to make contact with the 
cooking vessel will not allow effective control if the cooking utensil has an 
uneven bottom in the area where it is to be ``sensed.'' In addition, since the 
electric sensing element will retain heat due to its mass, reaction times 
could be delayed, thus allowing wide swings in the thermostatically selected 
temperature. The DOE test procedure also cannot measure the effect of 
thermostatically controlled burners. (Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers, No. 61A at 54, 55.) The Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers stated that the performance of reflective surfaces is degraded 
significantly from reaction to cooking vapors, burnt-on spillovers and 
cleaning with abrasive pads. To maintain reflective surfaces it would be 
necessary to replace these expensive units periodically. The Association of 
Home Appliance Manufacturers felt that the energy savings from reflective 
surfaces are very small. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 
61A at 56, 57.) With regard to insulation, the Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers stated it is occasionally used in gas cooktops where there are 
surface temperature problems on the surrounding structures. The insulation is 
attached outside of the burner box. Any other placement would impair utility, 
because the space underneath the countertop cooktop unit (that is designed to 
fit in drawers) would become significantly reduced. 
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers also felt that the 
energy savings from insulation is very small. (Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers, No. 61A at 56, 57.) In its comments regarding product classes, 
the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, though it suggested that both 
conventional and sealed burners be considered as one class, stated that it is 
incorrect to assume that sealed burners are more efficient than conventional 
burners. Sealed burners obtain all of their secondary air from above the 
cooktop, which requires that either the grate height be raised or the burner 
be derated in order for it to be as efficient as conventional burners. 
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 47, 48.) The 
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that radiant burners should 
be considered as a product class rather than a design option and went on to 
state several problems with these burner types. Since radiant burners use a 
powered pre-mix burner, carbon monoxide control is more critical, and the 
burner flame can only be varied by 30 percent. Test work performed by the Gas 
Research Institute with the American Gas Association Laboratories on 
prototypes has revealed that low burner rate is difficult to maintain. This 
means that current prototypes would not meet American National Standards 
Institute standards. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers also 
stated that burner efficiency might be no better than conventional burners. 
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 49-51.) 
The Department took into account all sources of available data when 
determining the cost and energy savings from thermostatically controlled 
burners, reflective surfaces, and sealed burners. Sources of data included 
the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, manufacturers, suppliers, and 
published papers and reports. Lack of any available data regarding catalytic 
burners, high efficiency electronic controllers, and insulation prevented the 
Department from analyzing these design options. The Department agrees with 
the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers' comments regarding radiant 
gas burners. Because there is no prototype that works satisfactorily, it is 
not possible to determine if this design option is technologically feasible. 
For electric open coil cooktops, the Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers stated that the contact conductance of open coil elements cannot 
be significantly improved. Manufacturers have worked together to improve the 
flatness of this element type, and have produced an element that is doing an 
excellent job. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 57, 
58.) The reflective surface and insulation design options cause the same 
problems for electric open coil cooktops as for gas burners. See comments, 
supra, for gas cooktops. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 
61A at 58.)

Manufacturers' data provided by the Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers and published reports
 were used by the Department to analyze 
the effects from improved contact conductance and reflective surfaces. Cost 
data were also provided by these sources. The electronic controls referred to 
by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy and the Rocky Mountain 
Institute cannot be evaluated by the DOE test procedure. Different types of 
tests based on boiling water have been used to evaluate electronic controls. 
But boiling water tests have yet to be standardized by DOE as a method to rate 
cooktops. Therefore, this design option was not analyzed by the Department. 





For electric smooth cooktops, the Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers's comments on product classes proposed separate classes for 
solid disk elements, radiant elements under glass, halogen elements under 
glass, and induction elements. The Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers commented that though solid disk elements are inherently less 
efficient than open coil elements, they should be a separate class because of 
the additional utility in their ease of cleaning. (Association of Home 
Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 39, 40). With regard to radiant and 
halogen elements under glass, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
commented that not only are these cooktops easy to clean because of their 
smooth surfaces, but additional work space is gained when the cooktop surface 
is not in use. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers also stated 
that the recommended cookware for halogen elements are metal pots and pans, 
since glass and ceramic cookware are not good heat conductors. (Association 
of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 40, 41). The Association of Home 
Appliance Manufacturers stated that since induction elements heat items by 
transferring electromagnetic energy, the glass or ceramic countertop under 
which they lie is unaffected and remains relatively cool. This also means 
that the cookware used with induction elements must be made from magnetic 
materials. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers listed the 
following advantages of induction cooking: fast response and control of heat 
source, ease of cleaning (since food spills do not burn onto the cooking 
surface), and the ability to heat utensils that are not flat. The Association 
of Home Appliance Manufacturers pointed out that because the DOE test 
procedure uses non-magnetic aluminum blocks, it is not suitable for testing 
induction elements. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No.61A at 
41-43). 
As stated in the discussion of product classes, the Department has 
established two classes for electric cooktops (open coil and smooth), and 
believes that radiant, halogen, and induction elements offer no consumer 
utility which prevents them from being analyzed as design options for smooth 
cooktops. Solid disk elements are treated as the baseline unit for smooth 
cooktops. Data provided by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, 
cooktop manufacturers, suppliers, and a published report
 were used in the 
analysis of smooth cooktops. Data were provided which evaluated radiant, 
halogen, and induction elements according to the DOE test procedure. The 
Department test results were obtained for induction elements by attaching a 
ferro-magnetic material to the aluminum test block. As with open coil 
elements, different types of tests based on boiling water have been used to 
evaluate electronic controls for smooth cooktops. But boiling water tests 
have yet to be standardized by DOE as a method to rate cooktops. Therefore, 
this design option was not analyzed by the Department.

In its comments on design options for gas and electric ovens, the 
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that since the DOE test 
procedure does not require maintaining heat in the oven over a period of time, 
improving the insulation in the cabinet will not show any energy savings. 
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 58). With regard to 
reduced vent size, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that 
this design option should be considered only for electric ovens, not for gas 
ones. It then proceeded to state how any reductions in vent size will 
negatively impact cooking and baking performance as well as safety. 
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 58, 59). The 
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that, according to the DOE 
test procedure, existing instrumentation cannot measure the small energy 
efficiency gains that result from reducing conduction losses. (Association of 
Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 59). As with cooktops, the 
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that reflective surfaces 
degrade quickly in ovens. This significantly reduces their impact on energy 
use over the life of the product. (Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers, No. 61A at 59, 60). The Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers asserted that oven thermal mass cannot be reduced. Further 
reductions in the gauge of the oven wall material may result in cracking and 
heat loss. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 60). The 
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that an oven separator to 
reduce oven thermal mass would pose potential safety problems due to improper 
installation, gas combustion considerations, and the handling of the separator 
by the consumer. No test procedure currently exists to certify the safety or 
performance of an oven using a separator. In addition, the Association of 
Home Appliance Manufacturers questioned the separator's utility, as consumers 
already use microwave and toaster ovens for small loads. The Association of 
Home Appliance Manufacturers also questioned whether the DOE test procedure 
could evaluate this design option. (Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers, No. 61A at 60-62). 
For electric ovens, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
proposed separate product classes for forced convection ovens for cooking and 
cleaning, halogen lamp ovens, and steam cooking ovens. The Association of 
Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that due to unique operating 
characteristics a separate class should be adopted for convection ovens. 
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 45, 46). With regard 
to halogen lamp ovens, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
asserted that the baking performance is relatively poor compared to the 
characteristics of a conventional electric oven. But since it may have 
certain advantages for broiling applications, the Association of Home 
Appliance Manufacturers said it should be a separate class. (Association of 
Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 46). Since no United States 
manufacturer is currently producing steam ovens and because the food products 
that can be cooked or baked by this oven type are limited, the Association of 
Home Appliance Manufacturers said it should be adopted as a separate class. 
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 47). 
As stated in the discussion of product classes, the Department has 
established two product classes for electric ovens (standard and 
self-cleaning), and analyzed halogen lamp, convection, and steam cooking as 
design options for electric ovens. The design options commented on by the 
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and others have all been 
considered for electric ovens. This includes the biradiant oven concept that 
was referred to by the Natural Resources Defense Council. Data provided by 
the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, oven manufacturers, 
suppliers, and published reports
 were used in the analysis of electric 
ovens. Manufacturers' data supplied by the Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers were the only source of cost and efficiency data provided to 
analyze oven separators. The improved insulation and reduced vent size design 
options were analyzed only for standard electric ovens. Insulation 
improvement levels and vent size reductions for standard ovens were selected 
to bring their baseline unit to the same efficiency level as the baseline unit 
selected for self-cleaning ovens. The Department received no data that 
indicated that insulation could be improved beyond the baseline level for 
self-cleaning ovens. In addition, any further reductions in vent size were 
assumed to jeopardize both oven safety and cooking performance. The 
Department did not receive any energy-use or cost data concerning the halogen 
lamp and steam cooking design options, thus preventing them from being 
analyzed for electric ovens.

For gas ovens, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers proposed 
separate product classes for standard and self-cleaning convection ovens and 
radiant burner gas ovens. As with electric convection ovens, the Association 
of Home Appliance Manufacturers said the unique operating characteristics of 
the convection oven warrant a separate class. (Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers, No. 61A at 53). For radiant burner gas ovens, the Association 
of Home Appliance Manufacturers made reference to its comments on radiant 
burners for gas cooktops. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 
61A at 53). 
As stated in the discussion of product classes, the Department has 
established two product classes for gas ovens (standard and self-cleaning). 
The Department believes that convection and radiant burner gas ovens should be 
analyzed as design options. A separate class would be warranted if lower 
efficient design options had consumer utility relative to convection and 
radiant burner gas ovens. The design options commented on by the Association 
of Home Appliance Manufacturers and others have all been considered for gas 
ovens. The bi-radiant oven concept referred to by the Natural Resources 
Defense Council was determined to be applicable to electric ovens only.
 
Data provided by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, 
manufacturers, suppliers, and published reports
 were used in the analysis of gas ovens. Manufacturers' data supplied by the Association of Home 
Appliance Manufacturers were the only source of cost and efficiency data 
provided with which the Department could analyze oven separators. As with 
electric ovens, the improved insulation and reduced vent size design options 
were analyzed only for standard gas ovens. The Department did not receive any 
energy-use or cost data concerning the radiant burner gas oven, thus 
preventing it from being analyzed. 






For microwave ovens, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
stated that high-grade stainless steel (or reflective material steel coating) 
would be more efficient than painted cold-rolled steel by approximately one 
percent. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers No. 61A at 30-33). The 
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that a small efficiency 
improvement may be available if fan air flow is increased or if motor energy 
consumption is decreased. (Id. at 32). The Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers said that magnetron efficiency has reached its maximum at 72 
percent. (Id. at 33). The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated 
that solid-state power supplies are not more efficient, but cost more. At low 
power levels, improved performance is expected because they eliminate the 
on/off cycling used by other power supplies. (Id. at 34). The Association of 
Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that there are no data available to 
suggest that solid-state microwave generators would increase the generating 
efficiency over the 70+ percent efficiency available in today's magnetrons. 
(Id. at 34). The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said that a 
modified wave guide may decrease energy absorption by one percent. (Id. at 
35). The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that microwave 
oven models with fan-type stirrers use a cover over the fan to prevent 
inadvertent damage to the fan when inserting or removing food and to prevent 
degradation of the wave guide due to food splatter. While these ceramic 
stirrer covers may absorb some microwave energy, they are essential for 
protecting the stirrer and to prevent accumulation of food splatter inside the 
wave-guide. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers No. 61A at 35). 
The Department has utilized the Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers's estimates for energy savings from improved magnetrons, 
reflective surfaces, modified wave guides, and more efficient fans. After 
considering the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers's comments, the 
Department has also excluded solid-state microwave generators and modified 
food stirrers from its cost/efficiency tables. The Department has generated 
data for, and included a more efficient power supply in, its cost/efficiency 
analysis for microwave ovens. 
Arkansas Western Gas said that maintenance and installation should be 
considered. (Arkansas Western Gas, No. 64 at 7).

Maintenance and installation costs were considered for ranges and ovens. 
The Department determined that the only design option which required 
additional maintenance costs was electronic ignition for gas cooktops. Using 
data obtained from electronic ignition manufacturers, the Department 
established a price for replacing malfunctioning electronic ignition devices. 
A retirement function based on data received from electronic ignition 
manufacturers and service technicians was used to establish the rate of 
failure of these control devices. With the retirement function and 
replacement cost, the expected maintenance expense was then determined. 

Mr. Rajendra Narang provided patents for improving the efficiency of gas 
ranges/ovens. These included, for ovens: Combustion air preheated by 
discharge gases, heated discharge gases discharged only when combustion 
occurs, and circulation fans for better airflow; for cooktops: an efficient 
piloted ignition and flame containing burner rings to support pots and pans. 
(Narang, No. 82). 

The Department was not able to assess the energy savings from most of 
the design options presented by Mr. Narang. (Circulation fans were analyzed, 
however.) Experimental data and simulation models were not available to allow 
evaluation of these design options. 



Other comments. 

The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers recommended 
that the usage assumptions for ranges/ovens be decreased to account for 
changes in lifestyles since the original usage values were estimated. The 
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said the reductions in energy use 
are from 68 to 74 percent for cooktops and ovens. (Association of Home 
Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61 at 38). Whirlpool Corporation stated that DOE 
should revise the test procedure to account for lower usage; the present test 
procedure overstates usage for cooktops and ovens by 70 and 76 percent, 
respectively. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 17). The American Council 
for an Energy Efficient Economy also recommended that the usage values be 
updated. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. at 2). 
Finally, Arkansas Western Gas said range use is down, and that gas use is so 
low (6Mcf) that any conservation item will have little effect. (Arkansas 
Western Gas, No. 64 at 6). 

As stated previously, the Department has proposed revised test 
procedures for kitchen ranges and ovens. The Department used the proposed 
test procedure, including the more current field usage numbers, for the 
analyses in today's notice. The new annual useful cooking energy output 
values were determined to be 209.4 kWh for electric cooktops, 732.5 kBtus for 
gas cooktops, 35.5 kWh for electric ovens, and 124.2 kBtus for gas ovens. 

With regard to potential microwave oven standards, the Association of 
Home Appliance Manufacturers contended that such standards would have an 
insignificant effect on energy consumption. (Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers, No. 61A at 29). 

The Department analyzed quantitatively the energy-saving potential of 
standards on microwave ovens and found that significant savings are possible. 
(See Technical Support Document, Chapter 5). 

With respect to the usage values for microwave ovens, Whirlpool 
Corporation stated that microwave energy use has increased significantly, and 
DOE should initiate a new study to determine a reasonable estimated energy use 
for microwave ovens. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 19). Citing the 
Electronic Industries Association's estimated 100 kWh/yr usage for microwave 
ovens in 1987, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that it 
was consistent with its 1976 data showing 75 kWh/yr usage because, although 
average family size has decreased, microwave oven use within the household has 
increased. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 27). 

As with the usage number for conventional ranges and ovens, the 
Department used the proposed test procedure usage values for the analysis of 
microwave ovens. The Department obtained the proposed energy use values from 
several utility conditional demand studies resulting in the proposed usage 
value of 270 kWh/yr for microwave ovens.

Lastly, some comments urged changes in the ranges and ovens test 
procedure as well as the microwave oven test procedure. Aloha Systems, Inc. 
commented that the present test procedure using an aluminum block is not 
realistic, and that induction cooking cannot be evaluated with the present 
test procedure since that procedure requires iron pots and pans. (Aloha 
Systems, Inc., No. 2, at 2). Whirlpool Corporation and the Association of 
Home Appliance Manufacturers both urged the Department to change its microwave 
test procedure to the 1988 International Electrotechnical Commission test 
procedures for measuring microwave power and energy use. (Whirlpool 
Corporation, No. 31 at 18; Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers No. 61A 
at 25.) 

Modifications to the test procedures for kitchen ranges and ovens, which 
address these issues, are contained in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
referenced above. 



6. Pool Heaters 





Classes. 

With regard to comments on pool heater classes, Southern Gas 
Association, Energen, South Carolina Gas and Electric, Laclede, and the 
Oklahoma Gas Co. proposed that an additional product class for pool heaters be 
established_gas pool heaters with automatic ignition. (Southern Gas 
Association, No. 4 at 8; Energen, No. 12 at 15; South Carolina Gas and 
Electric, No. 34 at 6; Laclede, No. 55 at 6; and Oklahoma Gas Company, No. 57 
at 7.) 

The Department believes there is no significant difference in consumer 
utility between gas-fired pool heaters which use electricity and those which 
do not. In addition, pool heaters are customarily installed adjacent to the 
pump and filter. Therefore, electricity will be readily available for the 
pool heater. The Department decided to keep gas-fired pool heaters as one 
class and to consider electricity-using design options as another design 
option. Accordingly, the installation and maintenance expenses (in addition 
to increased manufacturer costs) associated with design options using 
electricity were considered in the economic calculations. 

Another product class issue dealt with heat pump pool heaters. Air 
Energy Heat Systems (Air Energy Heat Systems, No. 44 at 1) provided efficiency 
data. The company stated that coefficients of performance are available in 
the mid five's and will reach the low six's in the future. 

The Department has adopted American National Standards Institute Standards Z21.56-1989 and Z21.56a-1990
as the test procedure for pool heaters. 
The American National Standards Institute standards apply to gas-fired pool 
heaters only, not electric resistance pool heaters or electric heat pump pool 
heaters. Since a test procedure does not exist for electric pool heaters, 
coefficients of performance data were not used in the analysis. 



Design options. 

As for pool heater design options, the Gas Appliance 
Manufacturers Association argued that since pool heaters have ``no flues,'' many 
of the design options listed in the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking are 
inappropriate, such as use of flue dampers, multiple flues, and increased flue 
baffling. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 5.) 

Most pool heaters currently being manufactured pass the water through a 
heat exchanger pipe which is located inside a combustion chamber above the 
burner. This design does not have a flue, and would not benefit from design 
options to improve the flue. The Department agrees with Gas Appliance 
Manufacturers Association and is not considering these design options. 

One company took issue with the Gas Appliance Manufacturers 
Association's comments about flue dampers not being an appropriate design for 
pool heaters. Flair said, ``We know of several manufacturers who build boiler-type pool heaters equipped with flues.''
(Flair, No. 85 at 1.) Flair also 
recommended that the Department evaluate a water heater design option of 
automatic ignition with a flue damper for pool heaters. (Flair, No. 85 at 2.) 

The Department is not aware of any residential pool heaters being 
manufactured currently with separate boilers or tanks that store water at 
elevated temperatures. Flue dampers are effective only at reducing standby 
losses from storage tanks. Therefore, flue dampers were not considered. 
Automatic ignition was included as a design option. 



Other comments. 

One comment dealt with pool heater test procedure issues. 
The California Energy Commission stated new test procedures are needed for 
oil-fired, electric resistance, and heat pump pool heaters, and the gas-fired 
pool heater test needs to include standby losses so that intermittent ignition 
devices are credited for increasing the energy factor. (Commission Energy 
Commission, No. 24 at 5.) 

Modifications to the test procedures for pool heaters, which address 
these issues, are contained in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking referenced 
above.

Lastly, one comment proposed that pool heaters be brought under the appliance labeling program. (California Energy
Commission, No. 24 at 6).

In response, the Department notes that the appliance labeling program is administered by the Federal Trade Commission.
It will be the Federal Trade Commission's decision, not the Department's, whether to bring pool heaters under labeling
requirements.



7. Clothes Washers



In a final rule regarding standards for three types of appliances, including clothes washers, published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 14, 1991 (56 FR 22250), the Department announced that it was accelerating the second review of energy efficiency
standards for clothes washers. In response to that notice, a number of energy-efficiency advocates and appliance
manufacturers requested that the Department delay the second review until 1995-96.
 The additional time was requested in order to allow manufacturers time to implement the standards imposed by the 1991
final rule and to fully evaluate new, more energy-efficient technologies such as top-loading horizontal-axis clothes
washers. This additional time, manufacturers contend, will enable them to provide more meaningful and relevant
comments on the next, legislatively required rulemaking. The Department considered the request, and by letter,
dated February 26, 1992, notified the parties requesting the delay that the Department had determined that it will
conduct the rulemaking on the later schedule, as requested.







8. Fluorescent Lamp Ballasts





Classes.

 Several fluorescent ballast class issues were raised in the comments on the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
One comment supported the Department's proposed classes. (Advance Transformer, No. 25 at 2). On the other hand, a
number of comments recommended additional classes for fluorescent lamp ballasts based on the size and type of lamp
for which the ballast is designed. One set of comments proposed adding three and four-lamp F40T12 ballasts and F32T8
ballasts as product classes. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 2; Public Citizen, No. 7 at
3; Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 26; Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 3; California Energy Commission,
No. 24 at 6; Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at 2; and Sierrra Club, No. 43 at 2). Several comments proposed
adding ballasts for compact fluorescent lamps as a product class. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 26;
Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 3; Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at 2; and Sierra Club, No. 43 at 2). Lastly,
three comments proposed that dimming features on ballasts warrant a separate class, since such ballasts provide
the utility to vary light output. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy No. 6 at 5; California Energy Commission,
No. 24 at 7; Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at 6).

In response, the Department has added three and four-lamp F40T12 ballasts and one, two, three, and four-lamp F32T8
ballasts to the list of product classes. These new classes will all have unique ballast efficiency factors. Compact
fluorescent ballasts, however, are integrated with a lamp and sold as one package. As such, one cannot determine the
efficiency of the ballast separate from the lamp. Although dimming ballasts do provide a unique utility to vary light
output, the Department believes that such ballasts do not warrant a separate class. At full light output, their energy
efficiency is expected to be equal to that of non-dimming ballasts. Therefore, any standard developed for non-dimming
ballasts will apply to dimming ballasts operated at full light output.

Design options.

 The comments on the fluorescent lamp ballast design options consisted largely of suggestions of additional designs
for the Department to consider. Certified Ballast Manufacturers stated that it feels there are only two design options,
electromagnetic and electronic. (Certified Ballast Manufacturers, No. 47 at 2). Four comments proposed improvement
of magnetic ballasts through the use of lower resistance conductors and low-loss silicone or amorphous steel core
material. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 5; Valmont Electric, No. 16 at 1; California
Energy Commission, No. 24 at 7; and Northwest Power Planning Commission, No. 32 at 5). A number of comments suggested
that design options which reduce energy use of magnetic ballasts through cathode (heater) cutout, including use
of electronic controls (hybrid ballasts), be considered. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No.
6 at 5; Public Citizen, No. 7 at 3; Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 17 at 29; Valmont, No. 16 at 1; California Energy
Commission, No. 24 at 7; and Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at 5). The California Energy Commission stated
that instant start should be considered as one of the design options for magnetic ballasts. (California Energy Commission,
No. 24 at 7). There were several comments regarding the consideration of levels of efficiency of electronic ballasts
as design options such as instant start and use of integrated circuits. (American Council for an Energy Efficient
Economy, No. 6 at 5; Public Citizen, No. 7 at 3; Sierra Club, No. 16 at 2; Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 17 at
29; Valmont, No. 16 at 1; California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 7; and Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at
5). Finally, three comments proposed that dimming capability (task tuning) be considered as a design option of electronic
ballasts. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 5; California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 7;
and Northwest Power Planning Commission, No. 32 at 5).

Dimming capability (task tuning) is addressed above in the product class discussion. The analysis treated cathode
cutout and instant start for magnetic ballasts, as well as lower resistance conductors and low-loss steel cores,
as design options. The Department also analyzed one efficiency level for instant start and one for rapid-start electronic
ballasts. The Department concluded that the use of integrated circuits as a substitute for discrete components is
common enough to be included in the initial electronic ballast design option.



Other comments.

 Two comments recommended that energy-efficient magnetic ballasts be used as the baseline for all product classes.
(Valmont, No. 16 at 1; and Magnetek Universal, No. 35 at 1).

The Department agrees with these recommendations and used energy-efficient magnetic ballasts for the baseline
units for all classes.

Several comments advised against the Department's considering standards to reduce the harmonic distortion of fluorescent
lamp ballasts. (Valmont, No. 16 at 3; Advance Transformer, No. 25 at 4; Magnetek, No. 35 at 2; and National Electrical
Manufacturers Association, No. 41 at 1). These comments contended that the harmonic distortions caused by fluorescent
lamp ballasts, presently less than 30 percent, are not a serious problem, and that options designed to reduce such
distortions would not be cost-effective. (Both magnetic and electronic ballasts generate harmonic distortion.)

The Department treated the harmonic content for electronic ballasts as acceptable for conventional, i.e., non-compact,
ballasts and did not assign any additional cost to achieving reduced harmonic distortion.

With regard to the fluorescent ballast test procedure, Advance 
Transformer and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association stated that 
there is presently no test procedure for electronic ballasts. (Advance 
Transformer, No. 25 at 2; National Electrical Manufacturers Association, No. 
41 at 2). 

The Department used the present test procedure for magnetic ballasts to 
measure the ballast efficacy factor of electronic ballasts. The Department 
notes that the 60 hertz input power measurement and the light output 
measurement are the same, regardless of the type of ballast (low or high 
frequency). The Department believes that the existing test procedure is 
adequate to measure the ballast efficacy factor of electronic ballasts. 

Three manufacturers provided energy savings estimates for various design 
options. Energy Advantage stated that 20 percent savings from electronic 
ballasts, compared to energy-efficient magnetic ballasts, are possible. In 
addition, this energy savings can be accomplished with up to a 50 percent 
increase in lifetime. (Energy Advantage, No. 27 at 1). Magnetek said that 
losses for a two lamp F40 electronic ballast can be reduced from 5-6 watts to 
about 3.5-4.5 watts, for a savings of 1.25-1.5 watts out of 56-58 watts, by 
substitution of an integrated circuit for discrete components. (Magnetek, No. 
35 at 1). One other company, Valmont, provided energy savings tables for five 
ballast product classes, their maximum technologically feasible efficiencies, 
and the costs of achieving those efficiencies. (Valmont, No. 16 at 4-7). 

The Department used some of the above data in combination with data from 
directories and other published data
 to determine energy savings for 
various classes of fluorescent ballasts. (See Technical Support Document, 
Volume B). The Department found that 10-15 percent energy savings from 
electronic ballasts, relative to energy-efficient magnetic ballasts, are 
possible. The Department developed data that indicated larger energy savings 
are possible with electronic ballasts than were estimated by Valmont. This 
resulted in higher maximum technologically feasible efficiencies for all 
ballast product classes than provided by Valmont. The Department used 
incremental manufacturer costs that were specific to the energy efficiency 
gains estimated for each ballast product class studied, and, therefore, did 
not use the cost data provided by Valmont. A more detailed discussion of 
assumptions and analysis used for this product class are provided in the 
Technical Support Document. As for lifetimes of ballasts, the Department 
assumed the lifetime for an electronic ballast to be equal to that of a 
magnetic ballast, since no experimental data were received or found to 
differentiate their lifetimes. 






Three manufacturers suggested that some combination of education and 
controls would be superior to standards in saving lighting energy use. 
Advance Transformer contended that fluorescent ballasts do not belong in the 
proposed rulemaking, and that improved education about lighting will 
accomplish more than standards. (Advance Transformer, No. 25 at 1). Magnetek 
and Certified Ballast Manufacturers both stated that controls, i.e., occupancy 
sensors, light feedback, daylighting, and automatic timers, can save more 
energy than can more stringent ballast standards. (Magnetek, No. 35 at 1; 
Certified Ballast Manufacturers, No. 47 at 2).

In response, the Department notes that the Act requires DOE to consider, 
in this rulemaking, more stringent fluorescent ballast standards and the 
concomitant energy savings therefrom. The Department considered such programs 
as alternatives to standards in the Regulatory Impact Analysis found in 
Section V of today's notice. 



9. Television Sets






Classes

. The Natural Resources Defense Council, Rocky Mountain Institute, and Thomson commented on television set class
delineations. The Natural Resources Defense Council stated that separate classes may be needed for stereo sound,
remote control, and other features. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No 13 at 24). Also, the Rocky Mountain Institute
stated that it might make sense to differentiate on the basis of features like remote control, electronic tuning,
and stereo sound. (Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 2). 

Thomson stated that the large number of necessary variables or items 
used to classify television receivers, including, for example, feature content 
and screen size, would greatly complicate any attempt to categorize television 
receivers in order to establish meaningful energy usage guidelines. Thomson 
also said that many customer-preferred performance qualities, such as high 
picture brightness and high-quality stereo sound consume correspondingly 
higher levels of power than television sets that do not exhibit those 
qualities. There are other desirable, if not necessary, features, such as 
remote control and on-screen function displays, and federally mandated 
features, such as closed caption decoding, that may increase energy use. 
(Thomson, No. 49 at 3, 5). 

The Electronic Industries Association stated that in 1989, 83 percent of 
color television sets sold to dealers reportedly included a remote control 
feature and that virtually all television sets use electronic tuning. 
(Electronic Industries Association, No. 30 at 3, 4). 

In response to these comments, the Department established one class for 
color television sets with electronic tuning and remote control. However, the 
Department believes that the energy used to illuminate the screen is strongly 
affected by screen size and, therefore, has proposed standards for television 
sets that are a function of screen size. Furthermore, DOE believes that there 
is no need to separate classes according to stereo sound because the sound is 
not on during the efficiency test and therefore sound energy does not affect 
test procedure measurements. 

The standard level analysis is based primarily on manufacturers' data 
for 19/20
'
' color television sets because recent manufacturer cost and energy 
use data for other screen sizes were very limited. The results of the 
analysis, based on the 19/20
'
' color television sets and the limited data 
available for other screen sizes ranging from 13.5
'
' to 33
'
', were then used to derive the proposed standards as a function of screen size. 

Additionally, the Department did not consider standards for black and 
white television sets since their share of the market is rapidly decreasing 
and over 50 percent of those sold are designed for battery or battery-AC 
operation and are thus designed to minimize energy use. 



Design options

. Among the comments on television set design options, the 
Rocky Mountain Institute proposed that DOE consider all reasonable options for 
reducing standby power as well as operating power. One option would be to 
require a clearly labeled switch that would give consumers the choice of 
turning the set to standby or completely off. (Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 
15 at 5). 

The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy suggested that DOE 
analyze use of a step down transformer rather than a resistance circuit for 
electronic tuning and new transformer materials with low core loss (amorphous 
alloys). The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy also urged DOE 
to look at television sets in other countries, particularly Germany. 
(American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 3-4). The Natural 
Resources Defense Council proposed that DOE consider power supply efficiency 
improvement. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 38).

<TEXT>
 

The Electronics Industry Association said that average remote control power is 4W, while some are as low as 2W; electronic
tuning uses less than 1W, brightness sensor less than 1W. (Electronic Industries Association, No. 30 at 3-4).
Thomson said that remote control uses 3-6W and that a brightness sensor consumes essentially no power in itself
and offers no energy benefit not otherwise available to the consumer by using the customary picture control adjustments.
(Thomson, No. 49 at 6, 7). The Electronic Industries Association provided data on voltage-regulating power supplies.
It said that a change in the type of regulator from shunting to switching can save approximately six watts at an additional
cost of $1.50. Other comments were provided for other design options, but no additional data were submitted. (Electronic
Industries Association, No. 30 at 4). 

The Department considered all comments on design options by analyzing standby power; power supply efficiency improvements,
including voltage-regulating power supplies; and step down transformers for electronic tuning. These design options
are shown in the cost/efficiency tables in the Technical Support Document. Data submitted by the Electronic Industries
Association and previously submitted data from manufacturers were used to develop these tables. While a switch to
allow consumers to turn off the remote control portion of the television (suggested by the Rocky Mountain Institute)
would likely save some energy, the amount would be determined by consumer behavior and is not predictable. The Department
discovered no data on improved transformer materials with low core loss nor any data on the energy use, as measured
according to DOE test procedure, for the German models. The Department did develop data on Japanese models measured
according to its test procedure. These data were included in the analysis. 



Other comments.

 Several comments questioned the feasibility of establishing energy conservation standards for television sets.
The Electronic Industries Association said that television set efficiency has improved over the years because manufacturers
have been steadily limiting power to reduce internal heat. (Electronic Industries Association, No. 30 at 2). Thomson
said there is little, if any, opportunity for further reductions in energy use. Thomson also said the major factors
that influence energy use are controlled by the consumer: Operating hours, brightness, sound level, and control
settings. (Thomson, No. 49 at 2-6). The Electronic Industries Association argued that efficiency standards
would impede the development of high definition television. (Electronic Industries Association, No. 30 at 6). G&A
Consultancy suggested that DOE ``not place retarding restrictions upon television sets because precluding the
television set's potential role as an energy control may inadvertently deny the American homeowner a far more valuable
system of energy savings.'' (G&A Consultancy, No. 50 at 4). 

The Department considered all these comments in the decision-making process for television set standards. With
regard to such standards precluding the potential for a television set to become a home energy controller, it is the
Department's belief that if television sets were transformed to home energy controllers, the nature of the appliance
might have changed sufficiently for it to be considered a new appliance. If so, it would not be a covered product and
subject to an energy conservation standard for television sets. 

Two comments stated that standards are inappropriate for television sets, stating that they already are energy efficient,
leaving little room for improvement. (Electronic Industries Association, No. 30 at 7; Thomson, No. 49 at 2). 

The Department analyzed television set standard levels by the methodology proposed in the advance notice, thereby
taking into account the costs and benefits of any potential efficiency improvements. The Department found that the
efficiency of the typical television set can be improved. 



IV. Product-Specific Discussion 



a. Room Air Conditioners 



1. Efficiency Levels Analyzed




The Department examined a range of standard levels for room air conditioners. Table 4-1 presents the seven efficiency
levels selected for analysis for the twelve classes of room air conditioners. Level 7 corresponds to the highest efficiency
level, max tech, considered in the engineering analysis.

Rather than presenting the results for all classes of room air 
conditioners in today's notice, the Department selected a class of room air 
conditioners as being representative, or typical, of the product, and is 
presenting the results only for that class. The results for the other classes 
can be found in the Technical Support Document in the same sections as those 
referenced for the representative class. The representative class for room 
air conditioners is room air conditioners with side louvers, less than 6,000 
BTU's per hour, which is one of the most prevalent classes of room air 
conditioners. For this representative class, trial standard levels 1 and 2 
accomplish the above efficiency improvements from the baseline by enhanced 
evaporator and condenser fins and the use of a permanent split-capacitor fan 
motor; level 3 adds a subcooler and grooved tubes to both the evaporator and 
condenser coils; level 4 increases the compressor energy efficiency ratio to 
11.0; level 5 increases the compressor energy efficiency ratio further to 
11.5; level 6 increases the evaporator and condenser coil area; and level 7 
adds a variable-speed compressor and brushless DC fan motor. Similar design 
options are used to achieve the above efficiencies for the other classes and 
are found tabulated in Section 1.4 of the Technical Support Document. 



2. Payback Period 



Table 4-2 presents the payback periods for the 
efficiency levels analyzed for the representative class of the product. For 
this representative class, standard levels 1 through 4 satisfy the rebuttable 
presumption test, i.e., the additional price of purchasing a product will be 
less than three times the value of the energy savings that the consumer will 
receive during the first year. Payback for all classes of room air 
conditioners may be found in Tables 4.13 to 4.24 of the Technical Support 
Document. 






3. Significance of Energy Savings 



To estimate the energy savings by 
the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of new room air 
conditioners under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of 
those sold under the candidate standard levels. For the candidate energy 
conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy 
Model projects that over the period 1996-2030, the following energy savings 
would result for all classes of the product: 




Level 1_0.28 Quad 
Level 2_0.62 Quad 
Level 3_1.24 Quads 
Level 4_1.42 Quads 
Level 5_2.22 Quads 
Level 6_3.06 Quads 
Level 7_5.22 Quads

<DOCNO> FR940304-1-00130 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940304-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Department finds that each of the increased standards levels 
considered above would result in a significant conservation of energy. 



4. Economic Justification 



A. 

Economic impact on manufacturers and consumers. 

The per unit 
increased cost to manufacturers to meet the efficiency of levels 1 and 2 for 
the representative class is $3.81; to meet levels 3-7, the manufacturers' cost 
increases are $10.10, $11.75, $23.42, $50.24, and $210.24, respectively. See 
Technical Support Document, Table 1.6. 

At those levels of efficiency, the consumer price increases are $4.77 
for levels 1 and 2 and $13.64, $15.43, $32.55, $54.61, and $220.04 for 
standard levels 3-7, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. 

The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at 
levels 1 and 2 is $5.12 for the representative class; standard level 3 would 
reduce energy expenses by $9.13; standard level 4 by $9.73; standard level 5 
by $11.16; standard level 6 by $12.41; and standard level 7 by $16.10. See 
Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. 

The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for 
all classes of room air conditioners show that revised standards would cause a 
prototypical manufacturer to have some reductions in short-run return on 
equity from the 8.6 percent return in the base case. Standard levels 1 
through 7 are projected to produce short-run return on equity's of 8.5 
percent, 8.5 percent, 8.4 percent, 8.4 percent, 8.4 percent, 5.2 percent and 
minus 4.3 percent, respectively. However, revised standards have little or no 
effect on the prototypical manufacturer's long-run return on equity. Standard 
levels 1 through 7 are projected to produce long-run return on equity's of 8.5 
percent, 8.5 percent, 8.5 percent, 8.5 percent, 8.6 percent, 7.9 percent and 
7.1 percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Tables 5.1 and 
5.2. 

Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical 
manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are 
subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that 
the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g. 
debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial 
data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as 
Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual reports. 

B. 

Life-cycle cost and net present value. 

A life-cycle cost is 
calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For the 
representative class, life-cycle costs at all standard levels other than level 
7, the max tech level, are less than the baseline unit. Of the seven 
candidate standard levels, a unit meeting level 4 has the lowest consumer 
life-cycle cost. See Technical Support Document, Figure 4.1. 

However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase 
units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the 
Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering 
only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower 
efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered. 
This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units 
meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case 
distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of 
efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle 
cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this 
scenario, standard levels 1 and 2 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs 
for the average affected consumer of $38.86 for the representative class of 
room air conditioner; standard level 3 would reduce average life-cycle costs 
by $54.75; standard level 4, by $56.68; standard level 5, by $53.47; and 
standard level 6, by $43.47. These life-cycle cost reductions indicate that 
no standard level, other than max tech, would cause any economic burden on the 
average consumer. At standard level 7, the life-cycle costs are projected to 
increase $86.09, compared to the base case. See Technical Support Document, 
Table 4.13. 

The Department examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, 
and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little 
impact. The Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such 
rates would be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would 
likely face in financing the purchase of room air conditioners. Similarly, 
DOE did not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in 
the life-cycle cost analysis. Since any standard is to be a national 
standard, DOE believed that national average energy prices were appropriate.

The Net Present Value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, 
indicates that for all classes of room air conditioners, standard level 1 
would produce an NPV of $0.44 billion to consumers. The corresponding net 
present values for standard levels 2-6 are $0.82 billion, $1.59 billion, $1.68 
billion, $1.85 billion and $1.32 billion, respectively. The net present value 
for standard level 7 is minus $4.70 billion. See Technical Support Document, 
Table 3.6. 
C. 

Energy savings. 

As indicated above, standards will result in 
significant savings of electricity consumption by room air conditioners. 
D. 

Lessening of utility or performance of products. 

As indicated 
above, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that the 
standards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility or performance of 
room air conditioners. 
E. 

Impact of lessening of competition. 

The determination of this 
factor must be made by the Attorney General. 
F. 

Need of the nation to save energy. 

Room air conditioners use 
electricity directly. In 1987, 4.3 percent of residential sector source 
electricity (or 0.45 quads) was accounted for on a national basis by room air 
conditioners. 
In addition, decreasing future electricity demand as a result of 
standards will decrease air pollution. See Technical Support Document, 
Appendix D of Volume A.
 Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur 
oxides (listed in equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide, or SO

2

). For all classes of room air conditioners at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated SO

2

 reduction would be 52,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of SO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by powerplants in the United States is 0.03 percent. For standard levels
2-7, the reductions are 116,000 tons; 229,000 tons; 261,000 tons; 394,000 tons; 520,000 tons; and 777,000 tons,
respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.35 percent.

<DOCNO> FR940304-1-00132 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940304-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Standards will also result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO

2

) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated NO

2

 reduction would be 47,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of NO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.03 percent. For standard levels
2-7, the reductions are 103,000 tons; 205,000 tons; 234,000 tons; 353,000 tons; 467,000 tons; and 698,000 tons,
respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.35 percent. 

Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO

2

) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO

2

 reduction would be 24 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of CO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.03 percent. For standard levels
2-7, the reductions are 53 million tons; 105 million tons; 119 million tons; 181 million tons; 240 million tons;
and 360 million tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.35 percent. 

Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity
generation. Because virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in oil demand are likely
to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 4.91 million
barrels over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2-7, the reductions in oil imports are estimated to be
10.76, 21.5, 24.45, 37.14, 49.21 and 73.69 million barrels, respectively. 

5. Conclusion



Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards
that ``achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically
feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency,
i.e., standard level 7 for amended room air conditioner standards. 

Of the standard levels analyzed, level 7 would save the most energy (5.22 quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet
this standard, the Department assumes that all room air conditioners would incorporate improved and increased heat
transfer devices and high efficiency and variable-speed fan motors and compressors. However, the payback at this
standard level of 16.1 years for the representative class, and up to 23.9 years for other classes, exceeds the 15-year
life of the product and causes life-cycle cost increases of $86 for the representative class, and up to $178 for other
classes. This level also drives the short-run manufacturer return on equity from 8.6 percent to negative 4.3 percent.


The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 7 for room air conditioners outweigh the benefits,
and rejects the standard level.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940304-1-00133 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940304-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The next most stringent standard level is standard level 6. This 
standard level is projected to save 3.06 quads of energy. This level produces 
life-cycle cost savings compared to the base case of $43, with a payback of 
5.3 years, which is slightly more than one third of the average product 
lifetime. However, this level causes payback as high as 9.1 years for other 
classes (over 60 percent of product life) and reduces manufacturer short-run 
return on equity from 8.6 percent to 5.2 percent, a reduction of almost 40 
percent. Also, at this standard level, some classes are assumed to 
incorporate variable-speed compressors, for which there is not a DOE test 
procedure. The Department believes that the development of such a test 
procedure would be a lengthy process which would probably delay the effective 
date of the standard for room air conditioners. 
The Department therefore, concludes that the burdens of standard level 6 
for room air conditioners outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard 
level. 
After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the 
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-imposed 1990 standard for room air 
conditioners with standard level 5 for room air conditioners. The Department 
concludes that standard level 5 for room air conditioners saves a significant 
amount of energy and is technologically feasible and economically justified. 
There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. 
During the period 1996-2030, these savings are calculated to be 2.22 quads 
of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on 
the environment by reducing the emissions of NO

2

 and SO

2

 by 353,000 tons and 
394,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 0.18 percent each by the year 
2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce emissions of CO

2

 by 181 million 
tons, or as much as 0.18 percent, over the forecast period. 
The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently 
available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The 
consumer payback of this standard level is 3.5 years for the representative 
class and no more than 7.0 years for any class. This standard is at or near 
the lowest life-cycle cost for all classes and is expected to result in a 
reduction in life-cycle cost of approximately $53 for the representative 
class. Additionally, the standard is expected to have essentially no impact 
on the prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of 8.6 percent. Since 
this standard does not involve substantial redesign or retooling, the 
Department expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller 
competitors. 


b. Water Heaters 


1. Efficiency Levels Analyzed. 


The Department examined a range 
of standard levels for water heaters. Table 4-3 presents the efficiency 
levels selected for analysis for the four classes of water heaters. Electric 
and gas storage water heaters each have five efficiency levels that were 
analyzed, but were paired together to yield the eight combinations shown 
below. Level 8 corresponds to the highest efficiency level, max tech, 
considered in the engineering analysis for each class.

<PARENT> FR940304-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 




Rather than presenting the results for all classes of water heaters in 
today's notice, the Department selected two classes of water heaters as being 
representative, or typical, of the product, and is presenting the results only 
for those classes. The results for the other classes can be found in the 
Technical Support Document in the same sections as those referenced for the 
representative classes. The representative classes for water heaters are 
electric storage water heaters and gas storage water heaters, which are the 
most prevalent classes of water heaters. For electric storage water heaters, 
trial standard level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the 
baseline by the use of heat traps and by reducing heat leaks; level 2 
increases the insulation level to R-25; at level 3 the insulation is reduced 
back to the baseline level of R-16, but an add-on heat pump is added; levels 4 
and 5 increase the insulation back to R-25; and levels 6, 7 and 8 assume the 
use of an integral heat pump. For gas storage water heaters, trial standard 
level 1 is the same as the baseline, trial standard level 2 accomplishes the 
above efficiency improvement by the use of heat traps and by reducing heat 
leaks, levels 3 and 4 increase the insulation level to R-16, levels 5 and 6 
increase the insulation level to R-25, at level 7 the insulation level is 
reduced back to R-16 but electronic ignition is added, and at level 8 the flue 
gases are assumed to condense. Similar design options are used to achieve the 
above efficiencies for the other classes and are found tabulated in Sections 
1.5 and 1.6 of the Technical Support Document.

2. Payback Period 



Table 4-4 presents the payback period for the 
efficiency levels analyzed for gas and electric storage water heaters. For 
gas water heaters, standard level 2 satisfies the rebuttable presumption test, 
i.e., the additional price of purchasing a product will be less than three 
times the value of the energy savings that the consumer will receive during 
the first year; for electric water heaters standard levels 1 through 5 satisfy 
the rebuttable presumption test. 







3. Significance of Energy Savings



To estimate the energy 
savings by the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of 
new water heaters under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of 
those sold under the candidate standard levels. For the candidate energy 
conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy 
Model projects that over the period 1996-2030, the following energy savings 
would result for all classes of the product: 





Level 1_0.09 Quad 

Level 2_0.73 Quad 

Level 3_32.10 Quads 

Level 4_34.89 Quads 

Level 5_34.99 Quads 

Level 6_44.39 Quads 

Level 7_45.85 Quads 

Level 8_54.45 Quads 






The Department finds that each of the increased standards Levels considered above would result in a significant conservation
of energy. 



4. Economic Justification
 



A. 

Economic impact on manufacturers and consumers

. The per 
unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for gas 
water heaters is zero since it is the same as the baseline; to meet level 2 
the manufacturers' cost increase is $5.47, levels 3 and 4 are $18.19, levels 5 
and 6 are $28.57, level 7 is $72.14, and level 8 is $358.23. The per-unit 
increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for electric 
water heaters is $5.32; to meet level 2 the manufacturers' cost increase is 
$14.33, level 3 is $201.82, levels 4 and 5 are $210.83, and levels 6 through 8 
are $585.06. See Technical Support Document, Table 1.5, ``Cost Data for Gas-Fired Storage Water Heaters'' and Table
1.9, ``Cost Data for Electric Storage 
Water Heaters.''

<PARENT> FR940304-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

At those levels of efficiency, the consumer price increases for gas 
water heaters are zero for level 1, since it is the same as the baseline, 
$7.35 for level 2, $24.05 for levels 3 and 4, $59.60 for levels 5 and 6, 
$108.55 for level 7 and $901.80 for level 8. For electric water heaters the 
consumer price increases are $6.85 for level 1, $42.04 for level 2, $361.36 
for level 3, $394.38 for levels 4 and 5, and $834.31 for levels 6 through 8. 
See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.1 and 4.2. 

The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at 
level 1 is zero for a gas water heater because it is the same as the baseline; 
standard level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $2.87; standard levels 3 and 
4 by $7.46; standard levels 5 and 6 by $9.20; standard level 7 by $13.32; and 
standard level 8 by $53.02. For electric water heaters standard level 1 would 
reduce energy expenses by $14.66, standard level 2 by $26.78, standard level 3 
by $195.01, levels 4 and 5 by $207.13 and levels 6 through 8 by $250.79. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.1 and
4.2. 

The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturers Impact Model results for 
all classes of water heaters show that any of the revised standards would 
cause a prototypical manufacturer to have negative short-run return on equity. 
This is caused in part by the very low base case return of 0.4 percent, 
indicative of an industry which is extremely price-competitive. The negative 
short-run return on equity's are especially severe at the three most stringent 
levels. Standard levels 1 through 8 are projected to produce negative short- 
run return on equity's of 0.2 percent, 0.3 percent, 3.3 percent, 3.5 percent, 
3.7 percent, 17.1 percent, 18.1 percent and 31.7 percent respectively. 
However, revised standards will slightly increase the prototypical 
manufacturer's long-run return on equity at standard levels above level 2. 
Standard levels 1 through 8 are projected to produce long-run return on 
equity's of 0.4 percent, 0.4 percent, 0.8 percent, 0.8 percent, 0.8 percent, 
1.6 percent, 1.7 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively. See Technical Support 
Document, Tables 5.1 and 5.2. 

Furthermore, most financial data of the type needed to characterize the 
prototypical manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms 
are subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes 
that the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics 
(e.g. debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. 
Financial data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources 
such as Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual 
reports. Also, DOE based its assumptions for the prototypical firm strictly 
on information regarding water heater manufacturers. The Department seeks 
comments on how to better characterize a prototypical firm when heat pump 
water heaters are included in the mix of products. For example, it may be 
that room air conditioner manufacturers become the system manufacturer, with 
the water heater tank becoming a purchased part. In that case, at those 
levels where heat pumps are assumed, it may be reasonable to introduce some of 
the financial characteristics of the room air conditioner industry since the 
heat pumps in question are very similar to room air conditioners. 

B. 

Life-cycle cost and net present value

. A life-cycle cost is 
calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For the 
representative classes, life-cycle costs at all standard levels other than 
level 8, the max tech level, for gas water heaters are less than the baseline 
unit. Of the eight candidate standard levels, units meeting levels 4 and 5 
have the lowest consumer life-cycle costs for electric water heaters and units 
meeting levels 3 and 4 have the lowest consumer life-cycle costs for gas water 
heaters. See Technical Support Document, Figures 4.2 and 4.1.

However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase 
units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the 
Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering 
only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower 
efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered. 
This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units 
meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case 
distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of 
efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle 
cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this 
scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the 
average consumer of $70.39 for the representative class of electric water 
heaters with no impact on gas water heaters, which remain at the base case at 
this level; standard level 2 would reduce average life-cycle costs by $81.04 
and $19.13 for electric and gas water heaters, respectively; standard level 3, 
by $974.88 and $29.81; standard level 4, by $1024.20 and $29.81; standard 
level 5, by $1024.20 and minus $3.77; standard level 6, by $907.99 and minus 
$3.77; standard level 7, by $907.99 and minus $13.12; and standard level 8, by 
$907.99 and minus $437.41. These life-cycle cost reductions indicate that no 
standard level, other than levels 5 through 8 for gas water heaters, would 
cause any economic burden on the average consumer. See Technical Support 
Document, Tables 4.5 and 4.6. 

The Department examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, 
and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little 
impact. The Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such 
rates would be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would 
likely face in financing the purchase of water heaters. Similarly, DOE did 
not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in the life-cycle cost analysis. Since any standard
is to be a national standard, DOE 
believed that national average energy prices were appropriate. 

The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, 
indicates that for all classes of water heaters, standard level 1 would 
produce a net present value of $0.19 billion to consumers. The corresponding 
net present values for levels 2-8 are $0.99 billion, $40.17 billion, $42.92 
billion, $42.68 billion, $38.15 billion, $39.91 billion and $32.50 billion, 
respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 3.6.

C. 

Energy savings.

 As indicated above, standards will result in 
significant savings of energy consumption for water heaters. 

D. 

Lessening of utility or performance of products. 

As indicated 
above, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that the 
standards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility or performance of 
water heaters. 

E. 

Impact of lessening of competition.

 The determination of this 
factor must be made by the Attorney General. 

F. 

Need of the nation to save energy.

 Water heaters use 
electricity, gas, and oil directly. In 1987, 18.4 percent of residential 
sector source electricity (or 1.94 quads) and 30.7 percent of residential 
sector natural gas consumption (or 1.59 quads) were accounted for on a 
national basis by water heaters. 

In addition, decreasing future energy demand as a result of standards 
will decrease air pollution. See Technical Support Document, Appendix D of 
Volume A 
. Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur oxides (listed in equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide, or SO

2

). For all classes of water heaters at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated SO

2

 reduction would be 17,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of SO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.01 percent. For standard levels
2-8, the reductions are 145,000 tons; 5,381,000 tons; 5,885,000 tons; 5,890,000 tons; 7,796,000 tons; 7,823,000
tons; and 7,124,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 3.58 percent. 





Standards will also result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO

2

) 
emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total 
estimated NO

2

 reduction would be 14,000 tons. During this time period, the 
peak annual reduction of NO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by 
power plants in the United States is 0.01 percent. For standard levels 2-8 
the reductions are 118,000 tons; 4,890,000 tons; 5,338,000 tons; 5,336,000 
tons; 6,995,000 tons; 7,086,000 tons; and 7,109,000 tons, respectively. The 
highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 3.57 percent. 

Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon 
dioxide (CO

2

) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO

2

 reduction would be 7 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of CO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.02 percent. For standard levels
2-8 the reductions are 59 million tons; 2,607 million tons; 2,837 million tons; 2,845 million tons; 3,662 million
tons; 3,747 million tons; and 4,113 million tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels
is 4.14 percent. 

Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity
generation. Because virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in oil demand are likely
to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 1.6 million
over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2-8, the reductions in oil imports are estimated to be 24.12,
605.97, 654.55, 677.03, 835.53, 842.83 and 
786.97 million barrels, respectively. 

5. 

Conclusion. 

Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the 
Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve the maximum improvement in energy
efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly,
the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard level 8 for amended water heater
standards. 

Of the standard levels analyzed, level 8 will save the most energy 
(54.45 quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the 
Department assumes that all electric water heaters will incorporate improved 
thermal characteristics and an integral heat pump, and all gas water heaters 
will incorporate improved thermal characteristics and condense the flue gases. 
However, the payback at this standard level of 18.9 years for gas water 
heaters exceeds the 14-year life of the product and causes life-cycle cost 
increases of $437 for gas water heaters, and up to $1,108 for other classes. 
This level also quadruples the first cost of electric and gas water heaters 
and drives the short-run manufacturer return on equity from 0.4 percent to 
negative 32.1 percent.

The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 8 
for water heaters outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level. 

The next two most stringent standard levels, 7 and 6, are projected to 
save 45.85 and 44.39 quads of energy, respectively. However, these levels 
also produce life-cycle cost increases for gas water heaters compared to the 
base case with payback of 11.2 and 10.1 years, which are more than two thirds 
of the average product lifetime. The first cost of electric water heaters at 
these levels is quadrupled from the base case and manufacturer short-run 
return on equity is reduced from 0.4 percent to negative 18.1 and negative 
17.1 percent, respectively. 

The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standards level 7 
and 6 for water heaters outweigh the benefits, and rejects these standard 
levels. 

The next most stringent standard level is standard level 5. This 
standard level is projected to save 34.98 quads of energy. However, this 
level also produces a life-cycle cost increase for gas water heaters compared 
to the base case, with a payback of 10.1 years, which is more than two thirds 
of the average product lifetime. 

The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 5 
for water heaters outweigh the benefits, and rejects this standard level. 

After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the 
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act_imposed 1990 standard for water 
heaters with standard level 4. The Department concludes that standard level 4 
for water heaters saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically 
feasible and economically justified. 

There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. 
During the period 1996-2030, these savings are calculated to be 34.87 quads 
of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on 
the environment by reducing the emissions of NO

2

 and SO

2

 by 5,336,000 tons and 
5,890,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 2.77 and 2.72 percent, 
respectively, by the year 2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce 
emissions of CO

2

 by 2,845 million tons, or as much as 2.93 percent, over the 
forecast period. 
The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently 
available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The 
consumer payback of this standard level is 2.0 and 3.5 years for electric and 
gas water heaters, respectively. This standard has the lowest life-cycle cost 
for all classes and is expected to result in a reduction in life-cycle cost of 
approximately $1,025 and $31 for electric and gas water heaters, respectively. 
Additionally, the standard is expected to double the prototypical 
manufacturer's long-run return on equity from 0.4 to 0.8 percent even though 
the short-run return on equity is projected to drop to negative 3.5 percent. 
However, as stated previously, the Department believes that the requirement of 
heat pumps for electric water heaters will cause other manufacturers, with the 
stronger financial characteristics of room air conditioner manufacturers, to 
be drawn into the mix of manufacturers offering electric water heating 
systems. The Department believes that this mix of manufacturers would have a 
positive return on equity compared to that projected for existing water heater 
manufacturers. 
The Department recognizes that establishing a standard for electric 
water heaters that essentially requires the use of heat pumps is a significant 
change for consumers and manufacturers. However, heat pump water heaters are 
not a technology that has to be developed; the product already exists in the 
marketplace. Additionally, the projected energy savings are very large and 
the forecasted benefits appear to outweigh the burdens. However, the 
magnitude of some of the changes, such as in first cost and product 
manufacturing, could make questionable some of the assumptions contained in 
the analysis and may warrant closer scrutiny. For example, as reported in the 
Technical Support Document, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential 
Energy Model's computation of appliance turnover rate, i.e., the repair or 
replace decision, is based on industry data about historical annual shipments 
and does not explicitly consider the effects of increased first cost. A 
significant increase in first cost could distort this model. The Department 
assumes, however, that water heaters are typically replaced because of tank 
leaks which, because of design features such as glass-lined tanks and foamed-in-place insulation, are essentially
non-repairable. Therefore, the 
Department believes that the impacts on the replacement rate, because of a 
substantial increase in first cost, is likely to be small. The Department 
welcomes comment on this assumption and other areas where it might be thought 
that the magnitude of the first cost increase or manufacturing changes might 
warrant additional or revised modeling assumptions.

Another possible area of concern regarding this proposed standard is 
whether heat pump water heaters are physically able to be installed in 
existing space in the replacement market. The heat pump itself will require 
some additional space, and as was discussed in the product specific comments 
regarding classes for water heaters, the Department assumed a sufficient 
volume would be available to allow air circulation for the proper operation of 
the heat pump. The Department believes that medium and larger sizes of water 
heater installations would typically have sufficient space, being usually 
installed in areas such as basements or garages. For space-restricted 
applications DOE believes that technical solutions, such as heat pumps with 
provisions for ducting air flow, are available as well as integrated space 
conditioning and water heating heat pumps, which are already on the market, 
and could be used if and when the central heat pump system is replaced. For 
very small size installations, such as under-the-counter types, where 
sufficient space for a heat pump may not be readily available or where the 
economics of a heat pump may not be justified because the water heating loads 
are well below average, the use of electric instantaneous water heaters would 
be an effective alternate. A lower limit on the size of electric storage 
water heaters that the proposed standard would cover may also be a way of 
minimizing the space and low load concerns. The Department believes there are 
technical solutions to require the use of heat pump water heaters wherever 
electric storage water heaters are now used and required. This view was 
supported at the Hot Water Heat Pump Workshop held in Breckenridge, Colorado 
on June 30 through July 2, 1993. The proceedings of the workshop are made a 
part of the record of this notice and are available from the Department's 
Freedom of Information Reading Room. 
 Other issues that may warrant further DOE analysis include consumer 
acceptance of possible increased noise from heat pump water heaters and 
anticipated increases in maintenance requirements in comparison to electric 
resistance water heaters. DOE is soliciting public comment on these issues, 
together with additional data or other information that might assist DOE in 
better assessing the impacts of this proposed standard on consumers and 
others. 
 Because the Department has little information on the space constraints 
for replacement water heaters or the frequency with which small water heaters 
experience low annual water heating loads, the cost-effectiveness analysis of 
the proposed standard does not explicitly consider these factors. The 
Department believes the analysis is sufficient but would attempt to expand it 
to include any information on these or other related factors that becomes 
available during the public comment period. Based on this possible revised 
analysis, DOE would consider modifying either the proposed standard level for 
electric water heaters or the definition of the class of water heaters covered 
by the standard. If the analysis warrants, DOE may establish different 
classes for two or more sizes of electric water heaters. The Department 
specifically invites public comment on this expanded analysis and the 
regulatory alternatives described. 


c. Direct Heating Equipment 


1. Efficiency Levels Analyzed



The Department examined a range 
of standard levels for direct heating equipment. In reviewing the design 
options necessary to achieve those standard levels, the Department determined 
that a new energy descriptor was needed to adequately address some of the 
design options in the analysis because the current energy descriptor, annual 
fuel utilization factor, does not include electrical consumption. For 
example, design options such as adding an induced draft fan improve thermal 
efficiency but, at the same time, increase overall electrical consumption 
which, unless accounted for in the energy descriptor, could lead to higher 
Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiencies with little or no net energy savings. 
Because of the above, the Department conducted the analysis, and is proposing 
the standards, in terms of a new energy descriptor, annual efficiency. The 
test procedure to determine this energy descriptor is contained in the 
previously mentioned Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Table 4-5 presents the 
five efficiency levels selected for analysis for the 16 classes of direct 
heating equipment. Level 5 corresponds to the highest efficiency level, max 
tech, considered in the engineering analysis.

Rather than presenting the results for all classes of direct heating 
equipment in today's notice, the Department selected a class of direct heating 
equipment as being representative, or typical, of the product, and is 
presenting the results only for that class. The results for the other classes 
can be found in the Technical Support Document in the same sections as those 
referenced for the representative class. The representative class for direct 
heating equipment is gravity wall heaters greater than 27 kBtu/hr but less 
than 46 kBtu/hr, which is one of the more prevalent classes of direct heating 
equipment. For this representative class, trial standard level 1 accomplishes 
the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by derating the burner by 
20 percent, level 2 adds electronic ignition, level 3 adds a burner box 
damper, level 4 adds the use of an induced draft fan and electronic ignition 
to the baseline unit, and level 5 assumes condensation of the flue gases. 
Similar design options are used to achieve the above efficiencies for the 
other classes of direct heating equipment and are found tabulated in section 
1.4 of the Technical Support Document. 
 



2. Payback Period



Table 4-6 presents the payback period for the efficiency levels analyzed for the representative class of the
product. For this representative class, standard level 1 satisfies the rebuttable presumption test, i.e., the additional
price of purchasing a product will be less than three times the value of the energy savings that the consumer will receive
during the first year. Payback for all classes of direct heating equipment may be found in Tables 4.17 to 4.32 of the
Technical Support Document. 







 
3. Significance of Energy Savings



To estimate the base case energy savings by the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of new direct
heating equipment under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of those sold under the candidate standard
levels. For the candidate energy conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy
Model projects that over the period 1996-2030, the following energy savings would result for all classes of
the product:


 
Level 1_0.04 Quad 
 Level 2_0.21 Quad 
 Level 3_0.38 Quad 
 Level 4_0.23 Quad 
 Level 5_0.23 Quad 


 


The above energy savings are smaller than anticipated because the 
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy Model predicts fuel switching 
from gas to electricity at trial standard levels 4 and above as shown in Table 
3.3 of the Technical Support Document. However, the Department finds that the 
increased standards at levels 1 through 4 considered above would result in a 
significant conservation of energy. 
 



4. Economic Justification
 



A. Economic impact on manufacturers and consumers. The per-unit 
increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for the 
representative class is $8.60; to meet levels 2-5, the manufacturers' cost 
increases are $19.10, $51.80, $157.60, and $227.70, respectively. See 
Technical Support Document, Table 1.16.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940304-1-00143 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940304-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

At those levels of efficiency, the incremental consumer price increases 
are $24.93, $73.60, $171.34, $402.54, and $690.95 for standard levels 1-5, 
respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.10. 
 
The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at 
level 1 is $10.73 for the representative class; standard level 2 would reduce 
energy expenses by $17.32; standard level 3 by $29.53; standard level 4 by 
$35.43; and standard level 5 by $48.24. See Technical Support Document, Table 
4.10. 

 The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for 
all classes of direct heating equipment show that revised standards would 
cause a prototypical manufacturer to have slight increases in short-run return 
on equity from the 7.4 percent in the base case except for the two most 
stringent levels where short-run return on equity plummets. Standard levels 1 
through 5 are projected to produce short-run return on equity's of 7.6 
percent, 7.7 percent, 7.6 percent, 5.2 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively. 
Revised standards have minimal effects on long-run return on equity. Standard 
levels 1 through 5 are projected to produce long-run return on equity's of 7.4 
percent, 7.4 percent, 7.3 percent, 7.4 percent and 7.1 percent, respectively. 
See Technical Support Document, Tables 5.1 and 5.2. 
 
Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical 
manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are 
subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that 
the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g. 
debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial 
data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as 
Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual reports. 
 
B. 

Life-cycle cost and net present value. 

A life-cycle cost is 
calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For the 
representative class, life-cycle costs at standard levels 1 through 3 are less 
than the baseline unit. Of the five candidate standard levels, a unit meeting 
level 3 has the lowest consumer life-cycle cost. See Technical Support 
Document, Figure 4.10. 
 
However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase 
units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the 
Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering 
only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower 
efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered. 
This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units 
meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case 
distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of 
efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle 
cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this 
scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the 
average consumer of $79.31 for the representative class of direct heating 
equipment. Standard levels 2 and 3 would reduce average life-cycle costs by 
$23.26 and $41.65, respectively. These life-cycle cost reductions indicate 
that standard levels 1 through 3 would not cause any economic burden on the 
average consumer. Standard levels 4 and 5 would increase average life-cycle 
costs by $132.40 and $296.32, respectively. See Technical Support Document, 
Table 4.26. 
 
The Department examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, 
and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little 
impact. The Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such 
rates would be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would 
likely face in financing the purchase of direct heating equipment. Similarly, 
DOE did not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in 
the life-cycle cost analysis. Since any standard is to be a national 
standard, DOE believed that national average energy prices were appropriate. 
 
The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, 
indicates that for all classes of direct heating equipment, standard level 1 
would produce a net present value of $9 million to consumers. The 
corresponding net present values for levels 2-5 are $63 million, $113 million, 
negative $259 million, and negative $930 million, respectively. See Technical 
Support Document, Table 3.6.

direct heating equipment.

In 1987, 6.1 percent of 
residential sector natural gas consumption (or 0.32 quad) was accounted for on 
a national basis by direct heating equipment. 

 In addition, decreasing energy use as a result of standards will usually 
decrease air pollution. However, in the case of direct heating equipment, 
projected fuel switching from gas to electric resistance heat causes the 
energy savings to be less than it otherwise would be, and at some of the trial 
standard levels the impact on the environment is negative, since it takes more 
primary energy to heat with resistance electric heat than with a gas furnace. 
See Technical Support Document, Appendix D of Volume A
. Evaluating 
standards for electric direct heating equipment might result in standards 
requiring the use of heat pump technology which would probably resolve this 
abnormality, but DOE has not considered adding standards for electric direct 
heating equipment in this proposed rule. The resulting impact on energy use 
because of fuel switching was considered in The Department's decision-making 
as discussed in the conclusion below. 





Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur oxides (listed in 
equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide, or SO

2

) at level 1. For all classes of 
direct heating equipment at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the 
total estimated SO

2

 reduction would be over 5,000 tons. During this time 
period, the peak annual reduction of SO

2

 emissions that are expected to be 
emitted by power plants in the United States is close to 0 percent. For 
standard levels 2 and 3, the reductions are 20,000 tons and 32,000 tons, 
respectively. For standard levels 4 and 5, SO

2

 emissions are projected to 
increase by 72,000 tons and 320,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak 
annual increase of these levels is 0.18 percent. 
 
Standards at level 1 would result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide 
(NO

2

) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total 
estimated NO

2

 reduction would be over 4,000 tons. During this time period, 
the peak annual reduction of NO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by 
power plants during that time in the United States is 0.01 percent. For 
standard levels 2 and 3, the reductions are 21,000 tons and 37,000 tons, 
respectively. For standard levels 4 and 5, NO

2

 emissions are projected to 
increase by 27,000 tons and 184,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak 
annual increase of these levels is 0.13 percent. 
 
Another consequence of the standards will be changes in (CO

2

) emissions. 
For standard levels 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO

2

 
reductions would be 2 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual 
reduction of CO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in 
the United States is 0.01 percent. For standard levels 2-4 the reductions are 
14 million tons, 26 million tons, and 2 million tons, respectively. The 
highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.03 percent. For standard 
level 5, CO

2

 emissions are expected to increase by 60 million tons with a 
highest peak annual increase of 0.10 percent. 
 
Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in 
reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because 
virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in 
oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For 
standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 1.1 million barrels 
over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2, the reductions in oil 
imports are estimated to be 3.5 and 6 million barrels, respectively; while for 
standard levels 4 and 5 are estimated to result in an increase in oil imports 
of 15.43 and 70.03 million barrels, respectively.

5. 

Conclusion.

 Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards
that ``achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically
feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency,
i.e., standard level 5 for amended direct heating equipment standards. 

Of the standard levels analyzed, level 5 will save the most energy per unit but, because of fuel switching from gas to
electric, this level actually causes an energy increase of 0.23 quad between 1996 and 2030. In order to meet this standard,
the Department assumes that all direct heating equipment will be condensing with induced draft and electronic ignition.
This level produces increased life-cycle costs compared to the base case for all classes of product and has payback
which exceed the average product life for all but two classes. Additionally, this level reduces manufacturer short-run
return on equity from 7.4 percent in the base case to 0.9 percent and has a negative net present value of $1.1 billion.


The Department therefore, concludes that the burdens of standard level 5 for direct heating equipment outweigh the
benefits, and rejects the standard level. 

The next most stringent standard level, level 4, is projected to have energy savings of 0.23 quad, but the savings here
are also reduced by fuel switching. This level also produces life-cycle cost increases, compared to the base case,
of $132 for the representative class, with similar increases for most classes. The payback at this level is 15.0 years
for the representative class, equaling the average product life, with similar payback for most of the other classes.
Additionally this level has a negative impact on the environment by increasing two of the three atmospheric emissions
studied. 

The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 4 for direct heating equipment outweigh the
benefits, and rejects the standard level. 

After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the National Appliance Energy Conservation
Act_imposed 1990 standard for direct heating equipment with standard level 3. The Department concludes that standard
level 3 for direct heating equipment saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically feasible and economically
justified. 

There would be a significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. During the period 1996-2030, these
savings are calculated to be 0.38 quad of primary energy and are essentially not affected by fuel switching. The standard
could have a slight positive effect on the environment by reducing the emissions of NO

2

 by more than 37,000 tons and SO

2

 by almost 32,000 tons by the year 2030. Furthermore, the standard is projected to reduce emissions of CO

2

 by 26 million tons over the forecast period. 

The technology that is necessary to meet this standard: derated burners, electronic ignition, and burner box dampers
or induced draft, is presently available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The consumer
payback of this standard level is 7.5 years, approximately one-half of the average product life. This standard is
expected to result in a reduction in life-cycle cost of approximately $42. Additionally, the standard is expected
to have little or no impact on the prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of 7.4 percent and has a net present
value of $328 million. Since this standard does not involve substantial redesign or retooling, the Department expects
that it will not have negative impacts on smaller competitors. 



d. Mobile Home Furnaces 



1. Efficiency Levels Analyzed 



The Department examined a range of standard levels for mobile home furnaces. In reviewing the design options necessary
to achieve those standard levels, the Department determined that a new energy descriptor was needed to adequately
address some of the design options in the analysis because the current energy descriptor, annual fuel utilization
factor, does not include electrical consumption. For example, to consider improvements in fan motor efficiency,
the savings in electrical consumption would have to be accounted for in the descriptor. Furthermore, other design
options (for instance, fan-assisted combustion) improve thermal efficiency but, at the same time, increase overall
electrical consumption which, unless accounted for in the energy descriptor, could lead to higher annual fuel utilization
factors with little or no net energy savings. Lastly, since annual fuel utilization factor is defined in the Act in
terms of an isolated combustion system, there are steps that could be taken to obtain a higher annual fuel utilization
factor, such as adding jacket insulation, which would have no impact on the efficiency of a furnace installed indoors.
Since practically all mobile home furnaces are installed indoors, the current descriptor is not entirely appropriate
for this rulemaking. Because of the above, the Department conducted the analysis, and is proposing the standards,
in terms of a new energy descriptor, annual efficiency. The test procedure to determine this energy descriptor is
contained in the previously mentioned Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Table 4-7 presents the six efficiency
levels selected for analysis for the two classes of mobile home furnaces. Level 6 corresponds to the highest efficiency
level, max tech, considered in the engineering analysis.

Rather than presenting the results for all classes of mobile home furnaces in today's notice, the Department selected
a class of mobile home furnaces as being representative, or typical, of the product, and is presenting the results
only for that class. The results for the other classes can be found in the Technical Support Document in the same sections
as those referenced for the representative class. The representative class for mobile home furnaces is gas fired
mobile home furnaces, which is the most prevalent class of mobile home furnaces. For this representative class, trial
standard level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by the use of improved fan motor
efficiency, level 2 adds a burner box damper, level 3 adds an improved heat exchanger, level 4 substitutes fan-assisted
combustion and electronic ignition for the burner box damper and improved heat exchanger, level 5 assumes condensing
of the flue gases and level 6 adds continuous furnace modulation. Similar design options are used to achieve the above
efficiencies for oil-fired mobile home furnaces and are found tabulated in Section 1.5 of the Technical Support Document.





2. Payback Period 



Table 4-8 presents the payback period for the efficiency levels analyzed for the representative class of the
product. For this representative class, standard levels 1 and 2 satisfy the rebuttable presumption test, i.e., the
additional price of purchasing a product will be less than three times the value of the energy savings that the consumer
will receive during the first year. Payback for all classes of mobile home furnaces may be found in Tables 4.3 and 4.4
of the Technical Support Document.

3. Significance of Energy Savings 


To estimate the energy savings by 
the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of new mobile 
home furnaces under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of 
those sold under the candidate standard levels. For the candidate energy 
conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy 
Model projects that over the period 1996-2030, the following energy savings 
would result for all classes of the product: 



Level 1_0.02 Quad 
Level 2_0.05 Quad 
Level 3_0.05 Quad 
Level 4_0.03 Quad 
Level 5_0.11 Quad 
 Level 6_^0.02 Quad 



The above energy savings are smaller than anticipated because the 
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy Model predicts fuel switching 
from gas to electricity at trial standard levels 2 and above as shown in Table 
3.4 of the Technical Support Document. However, the Department finds that 
each of the increased standards levels considered above except for level 6, 
the max tech level, would result in a significant conservation of energy. 


4. Economic Justification. 




 A. Economic Impact on Manufacturers and Consumers.

 The Department is refraining from publishing the per-unit increased cost to 
manufacturers to meet the trial standard levels for mobile home furnaces due 
to confidentiality considerations. The Department has determined that the 
data provided is confidential pursuant to 10 CFR 1004.11. There are only two 
manufacturers of this product, and they would provide data only if DOE agreed 
not to publish the data. Today's proposed rule is based upon the Department's 
consideration of these data, and others, e.g., data from component suppliers, 
as described in Section 1.5 of the Technical Support Document. 
At the considered levels of efficiency, the consumer price increases are 
$5.74 for level 1 and $76.80, $186.35, $273.71, $569.32, and $1151.56 for 
standard levels 2-6, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. 
The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at 
level 1 is $9.56 for the representative class; standard level 2 would reduce 
energy expenses by $25.71; standard level 3 by $35.54; standard level 4 by 
$44.96; standard level 5 by $83.20; and standard level 6 by $100.15. See 
Technical Support Document, Table 4.1.

<TEXT>
 

The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for 
all classes of mobile home furnaces show that revised standards would cause a 
prototypical manufacturer to have some fluctuations in short-run return on 
equity from the 7.3 percent return in the base case, especially at the two 
most stringent levels. Standard levels 1 through 6 are projected to produce 
short-run return on equity's of 7.2 percent, 7.3 percent, 6.8 percent, 7.3 
percent, 3.3 percent and 1.9 percent respectively. However, revised standards 
have little or minimal effect on the prototypical manufacturer's long-run 
return on equity. Standard levels 1 through 6 are projected to produce long- 
run return on equity's of 7.3 percent, 7.2 percent, 7.2 percent, 7.2 percent, 
6.1 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document, 
Tables 5.1 and 5.2. 
Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical 
manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are 
subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that 
the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g. 
debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial 
data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as 
Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual reports. 


B. Life-cycle cost and net present value.

 A life-cycle cost is 
calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For the 
representative class, life-cycle costs at all standard levels other than level 
6, the max tech level, are less than the baseline unit. Of the six candidate 
standard levels, a unit meeting level 5 has the lowest consumer life-cycle 
cost. See Technical Support Document, Figure 4.1. 
However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase 
units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the 
Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering 
only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower 
efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered. 
This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units 
meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case 
distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of 
efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle 
cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this 
scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the 
average affected consumer of $100.83 for the representative class of mobile 
home furnace; standard level 2 would reduce average life-cycle costs by 
$210.08; standard level 3, by $210.16; standard level 4, by $227.91; and 
standard level 5, by $358.96. These life-cycle cost reductions indicate that 
no standard level, other than max tech, would cause any economic burden on the 
average consumer. At standard level 6, the average life-cycle costs are 
projected to increase by $34.33, compared to the base case. See Technical 
Support Document, Table 4.3. 
The Department examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, 
and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little 
impact. The Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such 
rates would be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would 
likely face in financing the purchase of mobile home furnaces. Similarly, DOE 
did not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in the 
life-cycle cost analysis. Since any standard is to be a national standard, 
DOE believed that national average energy prices were appropriate. 
The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, 
indicates that for all classes of mobile home furnaces, standard level 1 would 
produce a net present value of $12 million to consumers. The corresponding 
0net present values for standard levels 2-6 are all negative at $175 million, 
$839 million, $1.39 billion, $2.86 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively. 
See Technical Support Document, Table 3.6. 


C. Energy savings.

 As indicated above, standards will result in 
significant savings of energy consumption for mobile home furnaces. 


D. Lessening of utility or performance of products

. As indicated 
above, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that the 
standards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility or performance of 
mobile home furnaces.

<TEXT>
 



E. Impact of lessening competition.

 The determination of this 
factor must be made by the Attorney General. 


F. Need to save energy.

 In 1987, 1.9 percent of residential 
sector natural gas consumption (or 0.1 quad) was accounted for on a national 
basis by mobile home furnaces. 
In addition, decreasing energy use as a result of standards will usually 
decrease air pollution. However, in the case of mobile home furnaces, 
projected fuel switching from gas to electric resistance heat causes the 
energy savings to be less than it otherwise would be, and at most of the 
higher trial standard levels the impact on the environment is negative, since 
it takes more primary energy to heat with resistance electric heat than with a 
gas furnace. See Technical Support Document, Appendix D of Volume A.
 
Evaluating standards for electric mobile home furnaces might result in 
standards requiring the use of heat pump technology which would probably 
resolve this abnormality, but DOE has not considered adding standards for 
electric mobile home furnaces in this proposed rule. The resulting impact on 
energy use because of fuel switching was considered in The Department's 
decision-making as discussed in the conclusion below. 




Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur oxides (listed in 
equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide, or SO

2

) at level 1. For all classes of mobile home furnaces at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated
SO

2

 reduction would be approximately 1,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of SO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is less than 0.01 percent. For standard
levels 2-6, SO

2

 emissions are projected to increase by 5,000 tons; 29,000 tons; 54,000 tons; 122,000 tons; and 270,000 tons, respectively.
The highest peak annual increase of these levels is 0.18 percent. 
Standards at levels 1 and 2 would result in a decrease in nitrogen 
dioxide (NO

2

) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated NO

2

 reduction would be over 1,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of NO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is less than 0.01 percent. For standard
level 2, the total estimated NO

2

 reduction would be less than 1,000 tons. For standard levels 3-6, NO

2

 emissions are projected to increase by 7,000 tons; 16,000 tons; 34,000 tons; and 87,000 tons, respectively. The highest
peak annual increase of these levels is 0.05 percent. 
Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon 
dioxide (CO

2

) emissions at levels 1 and 2. For either of these levels, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO

2

 reduction would be approximately 1 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual 
reduction of CO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is less than 0.01 percent. For standard
levels 3-6, CO

2

 emissions are increased by 2 million tons; 8 million tons; 15 million tons; and 49 million tons, respectively. The
highest peak annual increase of these levels is 0.05 percent. 
Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in 
reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because 
virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in 
oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For 
standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 0.75 million 
barrels over the years 1996 to 2030. Standard levels 2-6, are estimated to 
result in an increase in oil imports of 2.87, 18.14, 35.16, 77.82 and 174.02 
million barrels, respectively. 


5. Conclusion 


Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the 
Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve the maximum improvement in energy
efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly,
the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard level 6 for amended mobile home furnace
standards.

Of the standard levels analyzed, level 6 will save the most energy per 
unit but, because of fuel switching from gas to electric, this level has 
negative overall energy savings (^0.02 quad between 1996 and 2030). In order 
to meet this standard, the Department assumes that all mobile home furnaces 
will be condensing furnaces with full modulation. At nearly triple the 
purchase price to consumers, this level produces negative life-cycle cost 
savings compared to the base case of $154 and has a payback of 13.0 years, 
which is more than half of the average product lifetime. The level also 
reduces manufacturer short-run return on equity by over 70 percent and has a 
negative net present value of $8.9 billion, as well as increasing all three 
environmental atmospheric emissions studied. 
The Department therefore, concludes that the burdens of standard level 6 
for mobile home furnaces outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard 
level. 
The next most stringent standard level is standard level 5. This 
standard level is projected to save the most energy of any of the mobile home 
furnace trial standard levels, 0.11 quad, but the savings here are also 
reduced by fuel switching. This level produces the highest life-cycle cost 
savings compared to the base case of $239 and has a payback of 7.6 years, 
which is slightly more than one third of the average product lifetime. 
However, the level reduces manufacturer short-run return on equity by over 50 
percent and has a negative net present value of $4.6 billion, as well as 
increasing all three atmospheric emissions studied. 
The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 5 
for mobile home furnaces outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard 
level. 
The three next most stringent standard levels, 4, 3, and 2, are 
projected to have energy savings ranging from .03 to .05 quad, but the savings 
here are also reduced by fuel switching. These levels also produce life-cycle 
cost savings compared to the base case ranging from $108 to $210 with payback 
ranging from 7.5 to 3.0 years and have little or no impact on manufacturer 
return on equity. However, these levels all have negative net present values 
ranging from negative $1.39 billion to negative $.175 billion, as well as 
increasing one or more of the three atmospheric emissions studied. 
The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard levels 
4, 3 and 2 for mobile home furnaces outweigh their benefits, and rejects the 
standard levels. 

After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the 
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-imposed 1990 standard for mobile 
home furnaces with standard level 1 for mobile home furnaces. The Department 
concludes that standard level 1 for mobile home furnaces saves a significant 
amount of energy and is technologically feasible and economically justified. 
There would be small but significant energy savings at this level of 
efficiency. During the period 1996-2030, these savings are calculated to be 
0.02 quad of primary energy and are essentially not affected by fuel 
switching. In addition, the standard could have a slight positive effect on 
the environment by reducing the emissions of NO

2

 and SO

2

 by as much as 1,000 tons each by the year 2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce emissions of CO

2

 by 1 million tons over the forecast period. 
The technology that is necessary to meet this standard, improved fan 
motor efficiency, is presently available. The Department finds the level to 
be economically justified. The consumer payback of this standard level is 0.6 
years. This standard is expected to result in a reduction in life-cycle cost 
of approximately $102. Additionally, the standard is expected to have 

'essentially no impact on the prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of 
7.3 percent. Since this standard does not involve substantial redesign or 
retooling, the Department expects that it will not have negative impacts on 
the two competitors. 


e. Kitchen Ranges and Ovens 


1. Efficiency Levels Analyzed


The Department examined a range of standard levels for kitchen ranges and ovens. Table 4-9 presents the five
efficiency levels that had been selected for analysis for the eight classes of kitchen ranges and ovens. Level 5 corresponds
to the highest efficiency level, max tech, considered in the engineering analysis.

For analytical purposes the Department segmented the above classes into three groups: Conventional ovens, conventional
cooking tops and microwave ovens. Rather than presenting the results for all classes of ranges and ovens in today's
notice, the Department selected a class or classes of ranges and ovens as being representative, or typical, of each
group of the product, and is presenting the results only for those classes. The results for the other classes can be
found in the Technical Support Document in the same sections as those referenced for the representative class. The
results and conclusions for each group are presented separately below.



Efficiency levels analyzed for conventional ovens.

 The Department selected two classes of conventional ovens, non-self-cleaning electric ovens and non-self-cleaning
gas ovens, as being representative of conventional ovens. For non-self-cleaning electric ovens, trial standard
level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by improved door seals, reduced venting,
reflective surfaces and by not having an oven door window; level 2 increases insulation; levels 3 and 4 add convection
and reduced thermal mass, and level 5 adds improved insulation, reduced conduction losses, and an oven separator
and is a biradiant oven. For non-self-cleaning gas ovens, trial standard level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency
improvement from the baseline by incorporating an electric ignition and by not having an oven door window; level 2
adds improved door seals, reduced venting, reflective surfaces and increased insulation; levels 3 and 4 add convection,
reduced thermal mass and improved insulation, and level 5 adds an oven separator and reduced conduction losses.



Efficiency levels analyzed for conventional cooking tops.

 The Department selected two classes of conventional cooking tops, electric-coil cooking tops and gas cooking tops,
as being representative of conventional cooking tops. For electric-coil cooking tops, trial standard level 1 remains
at the baseline while level 2 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by improved heating
element contact, level 3 adds reflective surfaces, and levels 4 and 5 for this class are the same as level 3. For gas cooking
tops, trial standard level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by having reduced burner
excess air, level 2 adds electronic ignition, level 3 adds sealed burners and reflective surfaces, and levels 4 and
5 for this class are the same as level 3.

Efficiency levels analyzed for microwave ovens.

 The Department considers microwave ovens to comprise one class. For microwave ovens, trial standard level 1 accomplishes
the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by incorporating a more efficient power supply, level 2 assumes
a more efficient fan, in level 3 the wave guide is modified, level 4 assumes an improved magnetron, and level 5 adds reflective
surfaces.



2. Payback Period for Conventional Ovens



Table 4-10 presents the payback period for the efficiency levels analyzed for the representative classes of
conventional ovens. For both representative classes, standard level 1 satisfies the rebuttable presumption test,
i.e., the additional price of purchasing a product will be less than three times the value of the energy savings that
the consumer will receive during the first year.










Payback period for conventional cooking tops.

 Table 4-11 presents the payback period for the efficiency levels analyzed for the representative classes of
conventional cooking tops. For the gas representative class, standard level 1 satisfies the rebuttable presumption
test, i.e., the additional price of purchasing a product will be less than three times the value of the energy savings
that the consumer will receive during the first year.

 Table 4-12 presents the payback period for the efficiency levels analyzed for microwave ovens. Levels 1 through
3 satisfy the rebuttable presumption test, i.e., the additional price of purchasing a product will be less than three
times the value of the energy savings that the consumer will receive during the first year.

3. Significance of Energy Savings for Conventional Ovens



To estimate 
the energy savings by the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy 
consumption of new conventional ovens under the base case is compared to the 
energy consumption of those sold under the candidate standard levels. For the 
candidate energy conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley 
Laboratory-Residential Energy Model projects that over the period 1996-2030, 
the following energy savings would result for all classes of product:




Level 1_0.69 Quad 

Level 2_1.41 Quads 

Level 3_2.40 Quads 

Level 4_2.69 Quads 

Level 5_3.88 Quads




The Department finds that each of the increased standards levels 
considered above would result in a significant conservation of energy.

Level 2_0.57 Quad 

Level 3_0.67 Quad 

Level 4_0.77 Quad

4. Economic Justification





A. Economic impact on manufacturers and consumers.

 Conventional ovens. The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for gas non-self-cleaning
ovens is $5.92; to meet level 2, the manufacturers' cost increase is $14.40, levels 3 and 4 are $29.75, and level 5 is
$61.64. The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for electric non-self-cleaning
ovens is $4.21; to meet level 2, the manufacturers' cost increase is $8.45, levels 3 and 4 are $19.11, and level 5 is $100.12.
See Technical Support Document, Tables 1.9 and 1.11.

 At those levels of efficiency, the consumer price increase for gas non- self-cleaning ovens at level 1 is $13.84; to
meet level 2, the cost increase is $36.56, levels 3 and 4 are $69.00, and level 5 is $161.09. For electric non-self-cleaning
ovens the cost at level 1 is $8.84; to meet level 2, the cost increase is $18.73, levels 3 and 4 are $41.30, and level 5 is
$213.80. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.4 and 4.6.

The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at level 1 is $8.38 for gas non-self-cleaning
ovens; standard level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $13.32; standard levels 3 and 4 by $14.82; and standard level
5 by $15.35. For electric non-self-cleaning ovens level 1 would reduce energy expenses by $4.22; standard level 2
by $6.07; levels 3 and 4 by $9.45; and level 5 by $14.63. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.4 and 4.6.

The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for all classes of conventional ovens show
that revised standards would have little or no effect on a prototypical manufacturer's short-run return on equity
from the 8.6 percent in the base case. Standard levels 1 through 5 are projected to produce short-run returns on equity
of 8.6 percent, 8.6 percent, 8.6 percent, 8.5 percent and 8.1 percent, respectively. Revised standards have similar
effects on long-run return on equity. Standard levels 1 through 5 are projected to produce long-run return on equity's
of 8.6 percent, 8.6 percent, 8.6 percent, 8.6 percent and 9.1 percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document,
Tables 5.1 and 5.2.

Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical manufacturer are generally not available
because most real firms are subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that the prototypical
firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g. debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent
firms. Financial data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as Securities and Exchange
Commission 10K reports and company annual reports.



Conventional cooking tops.

 The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for gas cooking tops is $0.78; to meet level
2, the manufacturers' cost increase is $15.57, and levels 3, 4 and 5 are $41.71. The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers
to meet the level 1 efficiency for electric-coil cooking tops is zero, since for this class level 1 is the same as the
baseline; to meet level 2, the manufacturers' cost increase is $2.28, and levels 3, 4 and 5 are $5.31. See Technical
Support Document, Tables 1.4 and 1.6.

At those levels of efficiency, the consumer price increase for gas cooking tops at level 1 is $1.63; to meet level 2,
the cost increase is $113.38 and levels 3, 4 and 5 are $168.08. For electric-coil cooking tops, the cost at level 1 is
unchanged, since it is at the baseline; to meet level 2, the cost increase is $4.79, and levels 3, 4 and 5 are $11.24. See
Technical Support Document, Tables 4.1 and 4.3.

The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at level 1 is $0.95 for gas cooking tops; standard
level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $16.09 and standard levels 3, 4 and 5 by $16.68. For electric-coil cooking tops,
level 1 would not reduce energy expenses since it is at the baseline; standard level 2 would reduce energy expenses
by $0.93 and levels 3, 4 and 5 by $1.15. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.1 and 4.3.

The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for all classes of conventional cooking tops
show that revised standards would have slight impacts on a prototypical manufacturer's short-run return on equity
from the 8.6 percent in the base case. Standard levels 1 through 5 are projected to produce short-run returns on equity
of 8.6 percent, 8.4 percent, 8.6 percent, 8.7 percent and 8.7 percent, respectively. Revised standards have similar
effects on long-run return on equity, with some increases at the higher standard levels. Standard levels 1 through
5 are projected to produce long-run returns on equity of 8.6 percent, 8.2 percent, 8.8 percent, 9.5 percent and 10.0
percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Tables 5.1 and 5.2.

Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical manufacturer are generally not available
because most real firms are subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that the prototypical
firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g. debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent
firms. Financial data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as Securities and Exchange
Commission 10K reports and company annual reports.



Microwave ovens. 

The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for microwave ovens is $5.00; to meet level
2, the manufacturers' cost increase is $6.05; level 3 is $7.90; level 4 is $20.40; and level 5 is $36.80. See Technical
Support Document, Table 1.15.

At those levels of efficiency, the consumer price increase for microwave ovens at level 1 is $5.49; to meet level 2,
the cost increase is $6.78; level 3 is $9.14; level 4 is $25.38, and level 5 is $46.80. See Technical Support Document,
Table 4.8.

The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at level 1 is $2.67 for microwave ovens; standard
level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $2.93; standard level 3 by $3.16; level 4 by $3.44; and level 5 by $3.60. See Technical
Support Document, Table 4.8.

The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for microwave ovens show that revised standards
would have little effect, except at the max tech, on a prototypical manufacturer's short-run return on equity from
the 8.6 percent in the base case. Standard levels 1 through 5 are projected to produce short-run returns on equity of
9.0 percent, 9.0 percent, 8.8 percent, 8.0 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively. Revised standards have almost
no effect on long-run return on equity. Standard levels 1 through 5 are projected to produce long-run returns on equity
of 8.6 percent, 8.6 percent, 8.6 percent, 8.7 percent and 8.8 percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document,
Tables 5.1 and 5.2.

Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical manufacturer are generally not available
because most real firms are subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that the prototypical
firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g. debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent
firms. Financial data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as Securities and Exchange
Commission 10K reports and company annual reports.



B. Life-cycle cost and net present value. Conventional ovens. 

A life-cycle cost is calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For the representative classes,
life-cycle costs at all standard levels other than level 5, the max tech level, for electric non-self-cleaning ovens,
are less than the baseline unit. Of the five candidate standard levels, units meeting level 3 or 4 have the lowest consumer
life-cycle cost for electric non-self-cleaning ovens whereas for gas non-self-cleaning ovens, the lowest life-cycle
cost occurred for a unit meeting level 2. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.4 and 4.6.

However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase 
units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the 
Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering 
only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower 
efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered. 
This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units 
meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case 
distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of 
efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle 
cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this 
scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the 
average affected consumer of $73.09 for the representative class of gas non-self-cleaning ovens; standard level
2 would reduce average life-cycle costs by 
$42.07; standard levels 3 and 4, by $26.37; while standard level 5 would 
result in an increase of $59.83. For the representative class of electric 
non-self-cleaning ovens, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle 
costs for the average consumer of $27.29; standard level 2 would reduce 
average life-cycle costs by $38.05; standard levels 3 and 4, by $53.25; while 
standard level 5 would result in an increase of $61.41. The life-cycle cost 
reductions indicate that no standard level, other than max tech, would cause 
any economic burden on the average consumer. See Technical Support Document, 
Tables 4.12 and 4.14. 
 
The Department examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, 
and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little 
impact. The Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such 
rates would be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would 
likely face in financing the purchase of ovens. Similarly, DOE did not 
consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in the life-cycle 
cost analysis. Since any standard is to be a national standard, DOE believed 
that national average energy prices were appropriate. 
 
The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, 
indicates that for all classes of conventional ovens, standard level 1 would 
produce a net present value of $1.20 billion to consumers. The corresponding 
net present values for levels 2-5 are $0.52 billion, $1.09 billion, $1.12 
billion, and negative $2.38 billion, respectively. See Technical Support 
Document, Table 3.6. 
 


Conventional cooking tops. 

A life-cycle cost is calculated for a unit 
meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For the representative 
classes, life-cycle costs at all standard levels are less than the baseline 
unit. However, it should be noted that for another class, electric smooth 
element cooking tops, there are life-cycle cost increases for units meeting 
levels 4 and 5. Of the five candidate standard levels, units meeting level 2 
have the lowest consumer life-cycle costs for the representative classes. See 
Technical Support Document, Tables 4.1 to 4.3. 
 
However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase 
units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the 
Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering 
only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower 
efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered. 
This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units 
meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case 
distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of 
efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle 
cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this 
scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the 
average affected consumer of $8.96 for the representative class of gas cooking 
tops; standard level 2 would reduce average life-cycle costs by $66.08 and 
standard levels 3, 4 and 5, by $18.05. For the representative class of 
electric-coil cooking tops, standard level 1 would cause no change in 
life-cycle costs for the average consumer since it is the same as the 
baseline; standard level 2 would reduce average life-cycle costs by $5.69 and 
standard levels 3, 4, and 5 by $1.64. These life-cycle cost reductions 
indicate that no standard level would cause any economic burden on the average 
consumer. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.9 and 4.11.

The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, indicates that for all classes of conventional
cooking tops, standard level 1 would produce a net present value of $10 million, whereas there would be net present
value savings for levels 2-5 of $3.01 billion, $1.57 billion, negative $1.62 billion, and negative $3.39 billion,
respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 3.6.



Microwave ovens

. A life-cycle cost is calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For microwave ovens, life-cycle
costs at all standard levels other than level 4 and level 5, the max tech level, are less than the baseline unit. Of the
five candidate standard levels, units meeting level 2 had the lowest consumer life-cycle cost for microwave ovens.
See Technical Support Document, Table 4.8.

However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase units of the same efficiency. At each candidate
standard level, the Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering only those consumers
who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being
considered. This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units meeting the efficiencies
of the various standard levels. The base case distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function
of efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle cost reported is the average change only
for affected consumers. Under this scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the
average affected consumer of $14.15 for microwave ovens; standard level 2 would reduce average life-cycle costs
by $14.77 and standard level 3 by $14.12. These life-cycle cost reductions indicate that standard levels 1 through
3 would not cause any economic burden on the average consumer. Standard levels 4 and 5 would increase average life-cycle
costs by $.03 and $20.31, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.16.

The Department examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves
and generally found little impact. The Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such rates would
be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would likely face in financing the purchase of microwave
ovens. Similarly, DOE did not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in the life-cycle cost
analysis. Since any standard is to be a national standard, DOE believed that national average energy prices were appropriate.

The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, indicates that for microwave ovens, standard
level 1 would produce a net present value of $0.74 billion to consumers. The corresponding net present values for levels
2-5 are $0.78 billion, $0.70 billion, negative $0.67 billion, and negative $2.64 billion, respectively. See
Technical Support Document, Table 3.6.



C. Energy savings

. As indicated above, standards will result in significant savings of energy consumption for conventional ovens,
conventional cooking tops and microwave ovens.



D. Lessening of utility or performance of products

. As indicated above, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that the standards analyzed would not
lessen the existing utility or performance of conventional ovens, conventional cooking tops, and microwave ovens.



E. Impact of lessening of competition

. The determination of this factor must be made by the Attorney General.



 F. Need of the nation to save energy. Conventional ovens

. Conventional ovens use electricity and gas directly. In 1987, 4.0 percent of residential sector source electricity
(or 0.42 quad) and 4.4 percent of natural gas consumption (or 0.23 quad) were accounted for on a national basis by conventional
ovens.

In addition, decreasing future energy demand as a result of standards will decrease air pollution. See Technical
Support Document, Appendix D of Volume A.
 Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur oxides (listed in equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide, or SO

2

). For all classes of conventional ovens at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated SO

2

 reduction would be over 51,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of SO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.03 percent. For standard levels
2-5, the reductions are 92,000 tons; 202,000 tons; 239,000 tons; and 405,000 tons, respectively. The highest
peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.20 percent.

Standards will also result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO

2

) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated NO

2

 reduction would be 67,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of NO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants during that time in the United States is 0.04 percent. For
standard levels 2-5, the reductions are 130,000 tons; 249,000 tons; 287,000 tons; and 451,000 tons, respectively.
The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.24 percent. 

Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon 
dioxide (CO

2

) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO

2

 reduction would be 46 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of CO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.05 percent. For standard levels
2-5, the reductions are 93 million tons; 165 million tons; 187 million tons; and 280 million tons, respectively.
The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.29 percent. 



Conventional cooking tops

. Conventional cooking tops use electricity 
and gas directly. In 1987, 3.7 percent of source electricity (or 0.39 quad) 
and 5.0 percent of natural gas consumption (or 0.26 quad) were accounted for 
on a national basis by conventional cooking tops. 


In addition, decreasing future energy demand as a result of standards 
will decrease air pollution. See Technical Support Document, Appendix D.
 
Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur oxides (listed in equivalent 
weight of sulfur dioxide, or SO

2

). For all classes of conventional cooking tops at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated
SO

2

 reduction would be less than 500 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of SO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is less than 0.01 percent. For standard
levels 2-5, the reductions are 30,000 tons; 17,000 tons; 156,000 tons; and 92,000 tons, respectively. The highest
peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.07 percent. 






Standards will also result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO

2

) 
emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total 
estimated NO

2

 reduction would be 1,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of NO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is less than 0.01 percent. For standard
levels 2-5, the reductions are 151,000 tons; 151,000 tons; 255,000 tons; and 206,000 tons, respectively The
highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.13 percent. 

Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon 
dioxide (CO

2

) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO

2

 reduction would be 1 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of CO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is less than 0.01 percent. For standard
levels 2-5, the reductions are 144 million tons; 150 million tons; 193 million tons; and 172 million tons, respectively.
The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.20 percent. 



Microwave ovens

. Microwave ovens use electricity directly. In 1987, 
1.5 percent of source electricity (or 0.16 quad) were accounted for on a national basis by microwave ovens.

In addition, decreasing future energy demand as a result of standards 
will decrease air pollution. See Technical Support Document, Appendix D.
 
Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur oxides (listed in equivalent 
weight of sulfur dioxide, or SO

2

). For microwave ovens at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated SO

2

 reduction would be over 118,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of SO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.09 percent. For standard levels
2-5, the reductions are 138,000 tons; 156,000 tons; 178,000 tons; and 190,000 tons, respectively. The highest
peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.12 percent. 






Standards will also result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO

2

) 
emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total 
estimated NO

2

 reduction would be 94,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of NO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.09 percent. For standard levels
2-5, the reductions are 112,000 tons; 128,000 tons; 147,000 tons; and 158,000 tons, respectively. The highest
peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.12 percent.

Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon 
dioxide (CO

2

) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, 
the total estimated CO

2

 reduction would be 39 million tons. During this time 
period, the peak annual reduction of CO

2

 emissions that are expected to be 
emitted by powerplants in the United States is 0.09 percent. For standard 
levels 2-5, the reductions are 48 million tons; 56 million tons; 65 million 
tons; and 71 million tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of 
these levels is 0.12 percent. 

Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in 
reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because 
virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in 
oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For 
standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 12.74 million 
barrels over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2-5, the reductions 
in oil imports are estimated to be 21.33, 32.68, 51.88, and 63.07 million 
barrels, respectively. 



5. Conclusion
 





Conventional ovens

. Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the 
Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve 
the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is 
technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the 
Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard 
level 5 for amended conventional oven standards. 

Of the standard levels analyzed, level 5 will save the most energy (3.88 
quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the Department 
assumes that all conventional ovens will not have an oven door window and will 
incorporate improved door seals, reduced venting, reflective surfaces, 
increased and improved insulation, convection and an oven separator, and 
reduced thermal mass and conduction losses. Additionally, electric ovens 
would be biradiant, and gas ovens would incorporate an electronic ignition. 
However, the payback at this standard level of 18.9 years and 15.7 years for 
the gas and electric representative classes is roughly equal to the 19-year 
product life and ranges up to 55 years for other classes. At this standard 
level, all classes have increased life-cycle costs. 

The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 5 
for conventional ovens outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level. 

After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the 
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-imposed 1990 standard for the 
conventional oven portion of kitchen ranges and ovens with standard level 4 
for conventional ovens. The Department concludes that standard level 4 for 
conventional ovens saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically 
feasible and economically justified. 

There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. 
During the period 1996-2030, these savings are calculated to be 2.69 quads 
of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on 
the environment by reducing the emissions of NO

2

 and SO

2

 by 287,000 tons and 239,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 0.15 and 0.12 percent, respectively, by the year 2030.
Furthermore, the standard will reduce 
emissions of CO

2

 by 187 million tons, or 0.20 percent, over the forecast period. 

The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently 
available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The 
consumer payback of this standard level is 7.5 years and 4.9 years for the 
representative gas and electric classes, respectively, with a payback no 
higher than 10.4 years, or roughly half of the 19-year product life, for any 
class. This standard has the lowest life-cycle cost for the electric 
representative class and is expected to result in a reduction in life-cycle 
cost of approximately $53 for that class. Life-cycle cost savings are $26 for 
the gas representative class and are positive for all other classes. 
Additionally, the standard is expected to have almost no impact on the 
prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of 8.6 percent. Since this 
standard does not involve substantial redesign or retooling, the Department 
expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller competitors.

Conventional cooking tops.

 Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies 
that the Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that 
``achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary 
determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.'' 
Accordingly, the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, 
i.e., standard level 5 for amended conventional cooking top standards. 

 Of the standard levels analyzed, level 5 will save the most energy (3.04 
quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the Department 
assumes that all representative classes of conventional cooking tops will have 
reflective surfaces. Additionally, electric-coil cooking tops would have 
improved element contact, and gas cooking tops would incorporate reduced 
burner excess air, electronic ignition and sealed burners. It should also be 
noted that the design options for the representative classes are the same for 
levels 5, 4 and 3,_i.e., max tech,_ with the differences in those levels 
having to do with design options for electric smooth element cooking tops. At 
level 5, the max tech level for all classes, electric smooth element cooking 
tops require the use of induction elements. However, the payback at this 
standard level for electric smooth element cooking tops is 193 years, with a 
$550 increase in life-cycle costs. 

 The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 5 
for conventional cooking tops outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard 
level. 

The next most stringent standard level is standard level 4. This 
standard level is projected to save 2.85 quads of energy. As discussed above, 
the representative classes are still at their max tech level, while electric 
smooth element cooking tops require the use of halogen elements. The payback 
at this standard level for electric smooth element cooking tops is 890 years, 
with a $343 increase in life-cycle costs. 

The Department, therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 4 
for conventional cooking tops outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard 
level. 

The next most stringent standard level is standard level 3. This 
standard level is projected to save 2.68 quads of energy. As discussed above, 
the representative classes are still at their max tech level, while electric 
smooth element cooking tops are at the baseline. The payback at this standard 
level for the representative gas and electric classes are 10.1 and 9.8 years, 
respectively, which slightly exceeds half of the product life. Additionally, 
the Department is concerned about the longevity of the design option, 
reflective surfaces, required to meet this standard level. 

The Department therefore concludes that the questionable technology and 
economic burdens of standard level 3 for conventional cooking tops outweigh 
the benefits, and rejects the standard level. 


After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the 
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-imposed 1990 standard for the 
conventional cooking top portion of kitchen ranges and ovens with standard 
level 2 for conventional cooking tops. The Department concludes that standard 
level 2 for conventional cooking tops saves a significant amount of energy and 
is technologically feasible and economically justified. 

There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. 
During the period 1996-2030, these savings are calculated to be 2.54 quads 
of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on 
the environment by reducing the emissions of NO

2

 and SO

2

 by 151,000 tons and 
30,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 0.09 and 0.02 percent, 
respectively, by the year 2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce 
emissions of CO

2

 by 144 million tons, or 0.15 percent, over the forecast 
period. 

The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently 
available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The 
consumer payback of this standard level is 7.0 years and 5.2 years for the 
representative gas and electric classes, respectively, or roughly one-third of 
the 19-year product life. This standard lowers the life-cycle cost for the 
representative gas and electric classes by $66 and $6, respectively. 
Additionally, the standard is expected to have only a slight reduction of the 
prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of 8.6 percent. Since this 
standard does not involve substantial redesign or retooling, the Department 
expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller competitors.

Microwave ovens

. Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the 
Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve 
the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is 
technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the 
Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard 
level 5 for amended microwave oven standards. 


 Of the standard levels analyzed, level 5 will save the most energy 
(0.84 quad between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the 
Department assumes that all microwave ovens will have more efficient power 
supplies, fans and magnetrons; modified wave guides and reflective surfaces. 
However, the payback at this standard level of 13.0 years exceeds the 10-year 
product life, and this level produces increased life-cycle costs. 

The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 5 
for microwave ovens outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level. 

The next most stringent standard level is standard level 4. This 
standard level is projected to save 0.77 quad of energy. However, the payback 
at this standard level of 7.4 years is nearly three quarters of the product 
life and produces an increase in life-cycle costs. 

The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 4 
for microwave ovens outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level. 


After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the 
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-imposed 1990 standard for the 
microwave oven portion of kitchen ranges and ovens with standard level 3 for 
microwave ovens. The Department concludes that standard level 3 for microwave 
ovens saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically feasible and 
economically justified. 

There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. 
During the period 1996-2030, these savings are calculated to be 0.67 quad of 
primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on the 
environment by reducing the emissions of NO

2

 and SO

2

 by 128,000 tons and 
156,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 0.10 percent each by the year 
2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce emissions of CO

2

 by 56 million 
tons, or 0.10 percent, over the forecast period. 

The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently 
available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The 
consumer payback of this standard level is 2.9 years, which meets the 
rebuttable presumption test of economic justification. This standard is close 
to the lowest life-cycle cost for microwave ovens and is expected to result in 
a reduction in life-cycle cost of approximately $14. Additionally, the 
standard is expected to have almost no impact on the prototypical 
manufacturer's return on equity of 8.6 percent. Since this standard does not 
involve substantial redesign or retooling, the Department expects that it will 
not have negative impacts on smaller competitors. 



f. Pool Heaters 



 1. Efficiency Levels Analyzed. 



The Department examined a range 
of standard levels for pool heaters. In reviewing the design options 
necessary to achieve those standard levels, the Department determined that a 
new energy descriptor was needed to adequately address some of the design 
options in the analysis because the current energy descriptor, Thermal 
Efficiency, does not include pilot light usage or electrical consumption. For 
example, to consider electronic ignition, the savings in pilot light gas 
consumption would have to be accounted for in the descriptor. Furthermore, 
other design options, for instance, fan-assisted combustion, improve thermal 
efficiency but, at the same time, increase overall electrical consumption 
which, unless accounted for in the energy descriptor, could lead to higher 
Thermal Efficiency with little or no net energy savings. Because of the 
above, the Department conducted the analysis, and is proposing the standards, 
in terms of a new energy descriptor, annual efficiency. The test procedure to 
determine this energy descriptor is contained in the previously mentioned 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Table 4-13 presents the four efficiency levels 
that had been selected for analysis for pool heaters. Level 4 corresponds to 
the highest efficiency level, max tech, considered in the engineering 
analysis.

The Department considered one class of pool heaters, gas-fired pool heaters. 
For gas-fired pool heaters, trial standard level 1 accomplishes the above 
efficiency improvement from the baseline by incorporating an electronic 
ignition, level 2 assumes heat exchanger efficiency at the noncondensing 
limit, level 3 assumes condensing flue gases with a fan-assisted combustion 
system, and level 4 assumes condensing flue gases utilizing pulse combustion. 



2. Payback Period 



Table 4-14 presents the payback period for the 
efficiency levels analyzed. Standard level 1 satisfies the rebuttable 
presumption test, i.e., the additional price of purchasing a product will be 
less than three times the value of the energy savings that the consumer will 
receive during the first year. 





 

3. Significance of Energy Savings 



To estimate the energy savings by 
the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of new pool 
heaters under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of those 
sold under the candidate standard levels. For the candidate energy 
conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy 
Model projects that over the period 1996-2030, the following energy savings 
could result for each: 




Level 1_0.07 Quad 
 
Level 2_0.23 Quad 
 
Level 3_0.58 Quad 
 
Level 4_0.78 Quad 




The Department finds that each of the increased standards levels 
considered above would result in a significant conservation of energy. 



4. Economic Justification
 




A. Economic impact on manufacturers and consumers

 The per-unit 
increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency is $39.39; to 
meet levels 2-4, the manufacturers' incremental cost increases are $95.05, 
$405.68, and $760.68, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 
1.3, ``Manufacturers Cost for Gas-Fired Pool and Spa Heaters.''

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940304-1-00163 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940304-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

At those levels of efficiency, the incremental consumer price increases 
are $87.13, $213.97, $1,025.41, and $1,839.60 for standard levels 1-4, 
respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. 

The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at 
level 1 is $32.77; standard level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $42.51; 
standard level 3 by $59.53; and standard level 4 by $68.16. See Technical 
Support Document, Table 4.1. 

The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for 
pool heaters show that revised standards would result in increases in a 
prototypical manufacturer's short-run return on equity from the 17.9 percent 
in the base case. Standard levels 1 through 4 are projected to produce short- 
run return on equity's of 18.0 percent, 18.4 percent, 19.7 percent and 19.9 
percent, respectively. Revised standards have even greater increases in long- 
run return on equity. Standard levels 1 through 4 are projected to produce 
long-run return on equity's of 18.7 percent, 20.1 percent, 26.0 percent and 
29.9 percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Tables 5.1 and 
5.2. 

Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical 
manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are 
subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that 
the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g. 
debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial 
data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as 
Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual reports. 

B. 

Life-cycle cost and net present value. 

A life-cycle cost is 
calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For pool 
heaters, life-cycle costs at all standard levels other than level 3 and level 
4, the max tech level, are less than the baseline unit. Of the four candidate 
standard levels, a unit meeting level 1 has the lowest consumer life-cycle 
cost. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.2. 

However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase 
units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the 
Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering 
only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower 
efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered. 
This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units 
meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case 
distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of 
efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle 
cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this 
scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the 
average affected consumer of $231.13 and standard level 2 would reduce average 
life-cycle costs by $198.94. These life-cycle cost reductions indicate that 
standard levels 1 and 2 would not cause any economic burden on the average 
consumer. Standard level 3 would increase average life-cycle costs by 
$447.19, and standard level 4 would increase average life-cycle costs by 
$1,177.57. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.2. 

While DOE examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, and 10 
percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little impact, the 
Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such rates would be 
beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would likely face in 
financing the purchase of pool heaters. Similarly, DOE did not consider 
different energy prices, including regional prices, in the life-cycle cost 
analysis. Since any standard is to be a national standard, DOE believed that 
national average energy prices were appropriate. 

The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, 
indicates that standard level 1 would produce a net present value of $0.14 
billion to consumers. The corresponding net present values for levels 2-4 are 
$0.13 billion, negative $1.09 billion, and negative $2.44 billion, 
respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 3.6. 

C. 

Energy savings. 

As indicated above, standards will result in 
significant savings of electricity consumption for pool heaters. 

D. 

Lessening of utility or performance of products. 

As indicated 
above, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that the 
standards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility or performance of 
pool heaters. 

E. 

Impact of lessening of competition. 

The determination of this 
factor must be made by the Attorney General. 

F. 

Need of the nation to save energy. 

In 1987, 0.8 percent of 
residential sector natural gas consumption (or 0.04 quad) was accounted for on 
a national basis by pool heaters. 

In addition, decreasing future energy demand as a result of standards 
will decrease air pollution. See Technical Support Document, Appendix D of 
Volume A.
 Decreases in air pollution will occur for nitrogen dioxide (NO

2

) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated NO

2 

reduction would be 4,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of NO

2 

emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is less than 0.01 percent. For standard
levels 2-4 the reductions are 12,000 tons; 31,000 tons and 41,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual
reduction of these levels is 0.03 percent. 




Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon 
dioxide (CO

2

) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, 
the total estimated CO

2 

reduction would be 4 million tons. During this time 
period, the peak annual reduction of CO

2 

emissions that are expected to be 
emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.01 percent. For standard 
levels 2-4 the reductions are 12 million tons; 32 million tons and 43 million 
tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.04 
percent. 

Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in 
reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because 
virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in 
oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. Standard 
for pool heaters, standard levels 1-4, are not expected to affect oil 
consumption. 

5. 

Conclusion. 

Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the 
Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve 
the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is 
technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the 
Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard 
level 4 for amended pool heater standards. 

Of the standard levels analyzed, level 4 will save the most energy (0.78 
quad between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the Department 
assumes that all pool heaters will be condensing pulse combustion pool 
heaters. However, the payback at this standard level of 27.0 years exceeds 
the 15-year life of the product and causes life-cycle cost increases of 
$1,178. 

The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 4 
for pool heaters outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level. 

The next most stringent standard level is standard level 3. This 
standard level is projected to save 0.58 quads of energy. However, the 
payback at this standard level of 17.2 years also exceeds the product's life 
and produces an increase in life-cycle costs. 

The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 3 
for pool heaters outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level. 

After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the 
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-imposed 1990 standard for pool 
heaters with standard level 2 for pool heaters. The Department concludes that 
standard level 2 for pool heaters saves a significant amount of energy and is 
technologically feasible and economically justified. 

There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. 
During the period 1996_2030, these savings are calculated to be 0.23 quads 
of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on 
the environment by reducing the emissions of NO

2 

by as much as 12,000 tons, or 
0.01 percent by the year 2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce 
emissions of CO

2 

by 12 million tons, or 0.02 percent, over the forecast 
period. 

The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently 
available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The 
consumer payback of this standard level is 5.0 years or one-third of the 
product life. This standard is expected to result in a reduction in life- 
cycle cost of approximately $199. Additionally, the standard is expected to 
increase the prototypical manufacturer's return on equity from 17.9 percent in 
the base case to 18.4 percent in the short run and to 20.1 percent in the long 
run. Since this standard does not involve substantial redesign or retooling, 
the Department expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller 
competitors. 



g. Fluorescent Lamp Ballasts 



1. Efficiency Levels Analyzed



The Department examined a range 
of standard levels for fluorescent lamp ballasts. Table 4-15 presents the 
three efficiency levels selected for analysis for the 10 classes of 
fluorescent lamp ballasts. Level 3 corresponds to the highest efficiency 
level, max tech, considered in the engineering analysis.

Rather than presenting the results for all classes of fluorescent lamp 
ballasts in today's notice, the Department selected a class of fluorescent 
lamp ballasts as being representative, or typical, of the product, and is 
presenting the results only for that class. The results for the other classes 
can be found in the Technical Support Document in the same sections as those 
referenced for the representative class. The representative class for 
fluorescent lamp ballasts is ballasts for two F40 lamps, which is the most 
prevalent class. For this representative class, trial standard level 1 
accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by assuming 
energy-efficient magnetic ballasts with a heater cutout; levels 2 and 3 
correspond to efficiencies achieved by rapid start electronic ballasts. 
Similar design options are used to achieve the above efficiencies for the 
other classes, except that for the F-32 classes level 3 corresponds to 
efficiencies achieved by instant start electronic ballasts.

2. Payback Period 



Table 4-16 presents the payback period for the 
efficiency levels analyzed for the representative class of fluorescent lamp 
ballast. For this representative class, standard levels 2 and 3 satisfy the 
rebuttable presumption test, i.e., the additional price of purchasing a 
product will be less than three times the value of the energy savings that the 
consumer will receive during the first year. Payback for all classes of 
fluorescent lamp ballasts may be found in Tables 4.11d-4.20d of the 
Technical Support Document. 






 
3. Significance of Energy Savings 



To estimate the base case energy savings by the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of new fluorescent
lamp ballasts under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of those sold under the candidate standard
levels. For the candidate energy conservation standards, Commercial Energy End-Use Model projects over the period
1996-2030, the following energy savings could result 
for each: 


 

Level 1_13.7 Quads 
 
Level 2_15.9 Quads 
 
Level 3_17.0 Quads 



 
The Department finds that each of the increased standards levels 
considered above would result in a significant conservation of energy. 
 


4. Economic Justification

 

A. 

Economic impact on manufacturers and consumers. 

The per-unit 
increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for the 
representative class is $2.00; to meet levels 2 and 3, the manufacturers' cost 
increase is $7.00. See Technical Support Document, Table 1.6. 

 At those levels of efficiency, the consumer price increases are $4.91 
and $8.95 for standard levels 1 and 2/3, respectively. See Technical Support 
Document, Table 4.2. 
 
The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at 
level 1 is $1.11 for the representative class; standard levels 2 and 3 would 
reduce energy expenses by $3.62. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.12a. 
 
The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for 
fluorescent lamp ballasts show that revised standards would result in 
increases in a prototypical manufacturer's short-run return on equity from the 
15.5 percent in the base case. Standard levels 1 through 3 are projected to 
produce short-run return on equity's of 23.7 percent, 24.5 percent and 24.7 
percent, respectively. Revised standards are projected to slightly increase 
long-run return on equity. Standard levels 1 through 3 are projected to 
produce long-run return on equity's of 16.0 percent, 16.1 percent and 16.1 
percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Tables 5.1 and 5.2. 
 
Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical 
manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are 
subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that 
the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g. 
debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial 
data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as 
Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual reports. 
 
B. 

Life-cycle cost and net present value. 

A life-cycle cost is 
calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For the 
representative class, life-cycle costs at all standard levels are less than 
the baseline unit. Of the three candidate standard levels, a unit meeting 
levels 2 or 3 had the lowest consumer life-cycle costs. See Technical Support 
Document, Table 4.2. 
 
However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase 
units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the 
Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering 
only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower 
efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered. 
This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units 
meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case 
distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of 
efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle 
cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this 
scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the 
average consumer of $7.48 for the representative class, and standard levels 2 
and 3 would reduce average life-cycle costs by $30.23. These life-cycle cost 
reductions indicate that no standard level would cause any economic burden on 
the average consumer. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.12d. 
 
While DOE examined the effect of different discount rates (2, 4, and 10 
percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little impact, the 
Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such rates would be 
beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would likely face in 
financing the purchase of fluorescent lamp ballasts. Similarly, DOE did not 
consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in the life-cycle 
cost analysis. Since any standard is to be a national standard, DOE believed 
that national average energy prices were appropriate.

The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, 
indicates that standard level 1 would produce a net present value of $22.3 
billion to consumers. The corresponding net present values for levels 2 and 3 
are $25.4 billion and $27.3 billion, respectively. See Technical Support 
Document, Table 3.6. 

C. 

Energy savings. 

As indicated above, standards will result in 
significant savings of electricity consumption for fluorescent lamp ballasts. 

D. 

Lessening of utility or performance of products. 

As indicated 
above, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that the 
standards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility or performance of 
fluorescent lamp ballasts. 

E. 

Impact of lessening of competition. 

The determination of this 
factor must be made by the Attorney General. 

F. 

Need of the Nation to save energy. 

Fluorescent lamp ballasts 
use electricity directly. In 1987, 27 percent of commercial sector source 
electricity (or 2.17 quads) was accounted for on a national basis by 
fluorescent lamp ballasts. 

In addition, decreasing future energy demand as a result of standards 
will decrease air pollution. See Technical Support Document, Appendix D of 
Volume A.
 Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur oxides (listed 
in equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide, or SO

2

). For fluorescent lamp 
ballasts at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated 
SO

2

 reduction would be over 2,417,000 tons. During this time period, the peak 
annual reduction of SO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power 
plants in the United States is 1.20 percent. For standard levels 2 and 3, the 
reductions are 2,797,000 tons and 2,986,000 tons, respectively. The highest 
peak annual reduction of these levels is 1.47 percent. 




Standards will also result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO

2

) 
emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total 
estimated NO

2

 reduction would be 2,218,000 tons. During this time period, the 
peak annual reduction of NO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by 
power plants in the United States is 1.19 percent. For standard levels 2 and 
3, the reductions are 2,566,000 tons and 2,739,000 tons, respectively. The 
highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 1.47 percent. 

Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon 
dioxide (CO

2

) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, 
the total estimated CO

2

 reduction would be 1,174 million tons. During this 
time period, the peak annual reduction of CO

2

 emissions that are expected to 
be emitted by power plants in the United States are 1.17 percent. For standard 
levels 2 and 3, the reductions are 1,358 million tons and 1,450 million tons, 
respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 1.44 
percent. 

Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in 
reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because 
virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in 
oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For 
standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 230.41 million 
barrels over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2 and 3, the 
reductions in oil imports are estimated to be 266.97 and 285.05 million 
barrels, respectively. 



5. Conclusion



Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the 
Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve 
the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is 
technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the 
Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard 
level 3 for amended fluorescent lamp ballast standards. 

Of the standard levels analyzed, level 3 will save the most energy (17.0 
quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the Department 
assumes that all fluorescent lamp ballasts will be electronic rapid or instant 
start. 

After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the 
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-1988 imposed 1990 standard for 
fluorescent lamp ballasts with standard level 3 for fluorescent lamp ballasts. 
The Department concludes that standard level 3 for fluorescent lamp ballasts 
saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically feasible and 
economically justified.

There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. During the period 1996-2025, these savings
are calculated to be 17.0 quads of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on the environment
by reducing the emissions of NO

2

 and SO

2

 by 2,739,000 tons and 2,986,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 1.47 percent each by the year 2030. Furthermore,
the standard will reduce emissions of CO

2

 by 1,450 million tons, or 1.44 percent, over the forecast period. The technologies that are necessary to meet this
standard are presently available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The consumer payback
of this standard level is 2.4 years for the representative class and no more than 5.3 years for any class. This standard
has the lowest life-cycle cost for all classes and is expected to result in a reduction in life-cycle cost of approximately
$30 for the representative class. Additionally, the standard is expected to increase both the short- and long-run
prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of 15.5 percent. Since this standard does not involve substantial
redesign or retooling, the Department expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller competitors. 

h. Television Sets 

1. Efficiency Levels Analyzed

The Department examined a range of standard levels for color television sets. Table 4-17 presents the efficiency
levels that have been selected for analysis. Level 3 corresponds to the highest efficiency level, max tech, considered
in the engineering analysis. For level 3, the annual energy use in kWh per year can be expressed as E=20.5+6.1D, where
D equals the screen size in inches. 




Trial standard level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by reducing standby power
usage to 2 watts; level 2 corresponds to an efficiency achieved by reducing standby power to 2 watts and by reducing
the white and black screen power each by 6 watts; level 3 corresponds to an efficiency achieved by reducing the standby
power to two watts, white screen power to 73 watts and black screen power to 41 watts. 

2. Payback Period


Table 4-18 presents the payback period for the efficiency levels analyzed for 19
'
'/20
'
' color television sets. Standard levels 1 and 2 satisfy the rebuttable presumption test, i.e., the additional
price of purchasing a product will be less than three times the value of the energy savings that the consumer will receive
during the first year. 




3. Significance of Energy Savings. 

To estimate the energy savings by the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of new television
sets under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of those sold under the candidate standard levels. For
the candidate energy conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy Model projects
that over the period 1996
2030, the following energy savings would result for each: 


Level 1_0.52 Quad Level 2_1.28 Quads Level 3_3.13 Quads

 
The Department finds that each of the increased standards levels considered above would result in a significant conservation
of energy. 

4. Economic Justification



A. Economic impact on manufacturers and consumers.

 The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency is $2.15; to meet levels 2 and 3 the manufacturers'
cost increases are $3.65 and $10.25, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 1.4. At those levels of
efficiency, the incremental consumer price increases are $3.76, $6.39 and $19.37 for standard levels 1
3, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy
expense) at level 1 is $1.81, standard level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $2.95 and standard level 3 by $5.71. See
Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for
television sets show that the prototypical manufacturer has a negative return on equity of 1.9 percent in the absence
of standards and that standards cause slight but further reductions in both short- and long-run return on equity.
Standard levels 1 through 3 are projected to produce negative short-run return on equitys of 2.0 percent, 2.0 percent
and 3.3 percent, respectively. Long-run return on equitys are projected to be negative 1.9 percent, 2.0 percent and
2.2 percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Tables 5.1 and 5.2. Most financial data of the type needed
to characterize the prototypical manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are subsidiaries
or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that the prototypical firm has largely the same financial
characteristics (e.g. debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial data for the parent
firms are based on publicly available sources such as Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company
annual reports.

B. 

Life-cycle cost and net present value.

 A life-cycle cost is calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For color television sets,
life-cycle costs at all standard levels are less than the baseline unit. Of the three candidate standard levels, a
unit meeting level 3 has the lowest consumer life-cycle cost. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. 

However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase units of the same efficiency. At each candidate
standard level, the Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering only those consumers
who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being
considered. This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units meeting the efficiencies
of the various standard levels. The base case distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function
of efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle cost reported is the average change only
for affected consumers. Under this scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the
average consumer of $10.97, standard level 2 would reduce average life-cycle costs by $14.52, and standard level
3 by $24.06. The lower life-cycle costs indicate that no standard level would cause any economic burden on the average
consumer. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.2. 

While DOE examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally
found little impact, the Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such rates would be beyond the range
of real, after-tax rates that consumers would likely face in financing the purchase of television sets. Similarly,
DOE did not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in the life-cycle cost analysis. Since
any standard is to be a national standard, DOE believed that national average energy prices were appropriate. 

The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, indicates that standard level 1 would produce
a net present value of $0.64 billion to consumers. The corresponding net present values for levels 2 and 3 are $1.35
billion and $1.67 billion, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 3.6. 

C. 

Energy savings.

 As indicated above, standards will result in significant savings of electricity consumption for television sets.

D. 

Lessening of utility or performance of products.

 As indicated above, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that the standards analyzed would not lessen
the existing utility or performance of television sets. 
E. Impact of lessening of competition. The determination of this factor must be made by the Attorney General. 
F. 

Need of the nation to save energy.

 Television sets use electricity directly. In 1987, 2.1 percent of residential sector source electricity (or 0.22
quads) was accounted for on a national basis by television sets. 

In addition, decreasing future energy demand as a result of standards will decrease air pollution. See Technical
Support Document, Appendix D of Volume A.
 Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur oxides (listed in equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide, or SO

2

). For television sets at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated SO

2

 reduction would be 120,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of SO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.07 percent. For standard levels
2 and 3, the reductions are 261,000 tons and 599,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these
levels is 0.29 percent. 




Standards will also result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO

2

) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated NO

2

 reduction would be 99,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of NO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.07 percent. For standard levels
2 and 3, the reductions are 225,000 tons and 528,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these
levels is 0.29 percent.

Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO

2

) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO

2

 reduction would be 43 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of CO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.07 percent. For standard levels
2 and 3, the reductions are 108 million tons and 263 million tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction
of these levels is 0.29 percent. 

Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity
generation. Because virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in oil demand are likely
to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 8.86 million
barrels over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2 and 3, the reductions in oil imports are estimated to be 22.05
and 53.88, respectively. 



5. Conclusion 



Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards
that ``achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically
feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency,
i.e., standard level 3 for amended television set standards. 

Of the standard levels analyzed, level 3 will save the most energy (3.13 quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet
this standard, the Department assumes that all television sets will have reduced standby power and reduced white/black
screen power. 

After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is establishing a standard for television sets. The Department
concludes that standard level 3 for television sets saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically feasible
and economically justified. 

There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. During the period 1996-2030, these savings
are calculated to be 3.13 quads of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on the environment
by reducing the emissions of NO

2

 and SO

2

 by 528,000 tons and 599,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 0.29 percent each by the year 2030. Furthermore, the
standard will reduce emissions of CO

2

 by 263 million tons, or 0.29 percent, over the forecast period. 

The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently available. The Department finds the level
to be economically justified. The consumer payback of this standard level is 3.5 years, which compares favorably
with the 12-year product life. This standard has the lowest life-cycle cost and is expected to result in a reduction
in life-cycle cost of approximately $24. Additionally, the standard is expected to have only a slight reduction in
the prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of negative 1.9 percent. Since this standard does not involve substantial
redesign or retooling, the Department expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller competitors. 



V. Environmental, Regulatory Impact, Takings Assessment, Federalism, and Regulatory Flexibility Reviews 



The Department has reviewed today's proposed action in accordance with the Department's obligations under: 

 The National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), the Council on Environmental Quality regulations
implementing the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), and the Department's
regulations for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (10 CFR part 1021); 

 Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) which pertains to agency review of the impact of Federal
regulations; 

 Executive Order 12630 (53 FR 8859, March 18, 1988) which pertains to agency consideration of Federal actions
that interfere with constitutionally protected property rights; 

 Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987) which pertains to agency consideration of Federal actions
that would have a substantial direct effect on States, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the
States, and on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government; and

 The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) which requires, in part, that an agency prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysis for any proposed rule
unless it determines that the rule will not have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.''
In the event that such an analysis is not required for a particular rule, the agency must publish a certification and
explanation of that determination in the 

Federal Register

. 


a. Environmental Review 


The Department prepared an Environmental Assessment (DOE/EA-0819) on the 
proposed standards pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 
U.S.C. 4321 

et seq., 

and the implementing regulations of the Council on 
Environmental Quality (40 CFR parts 1500-1508). The Environmental Assessment 
addresses the possible incremental environmental effects attributable to the 
application of the proposed standards to the design of the eight types of 
covered products: Room air conditioners, water heaters, direct heating 
equipment, mobile home furnaces, kitchen ranges and ovens, pool heaters, 
fluorescent lamp ballasts, and television sets. 
A Finding of No Significant Impact was issued December 1992 and is being 
published elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

. Publishing the finding has been delayed along with the proposed rulemaking due to difficulties in 
resolving issues and coordinating with a related rulemaking. The Finding of 
No Significant Impact concludes that the proposed standards would result in no 
significant environmental impacts and that an environmental impact statement 
is not required. 
The Environmental Assessment is published within the Technical Support 
Document and is available at the DOE Freedom of Information Reading Room at 
the address provided at the beginning of this notice. 


b. Regulatory Impact Review 


Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) directs that, in 
proposing a significant regulatory action,
 an agency perform a regulatory analysis. Such an analysis presents major alternatives to the regulation that could
achieve substantially the same regulatory goal at lower cost, as well as a description of the costs and benefits (including
potential net benefits) of the proposed rule. 




The Department has determined that this proposed rule is a ``significant 
regulatory action.'' Accordingly, the draft regulatory action has been 
prepared and submitted to the Office of Management and Budget. The Office of 
Management and Budget has reviewed the draft regulatory action under Executive 
Order 12866. 
The regulatory review of the draft regulatory action is summarized 
below. This summary focuses on the major alternatives considered in arriving 
at the proposed approach to improving the energy efficiency of consumer 
products. The reader is referred to the complete draft ``Regulatory Impact 
Analysis,'' which is contained in the Technical Support Document, available as 
indicated at the beginning of this notice. It consists of: (1) A statement 
of the problem addressed by this regulation, and the mandate for government 
action; (2) a description and analysis of the feasible policy alternatives to 
this regulation; (3) a quantitative comparison of the impacts of the 
alternatives; and (4) the economic impact of the proposed standard. 
It should be noted at the outset that none of the alternatives that were 
examined for these eight products saved as much energy as the proposed rule. 
Also, most of the alternatives would require that enabling legislation be 
enacted, since authority to carry out those alternatives does not presently 
exist.

Alternatives for Achieving Consumer Product Energy Conservation 



Six major alternatives were identified by DOE as representing feasible policy alternatives for achieving consumer
product energy efficiency. These 
alternatives include:

 

 No New Regulatory Action 
 Informational Action

 

_Product labeling 
_Consumer education

 

 Prescriptive Standards 
 Financial Incentives

 

_Tax credits 
_Rebates

 

 Voluntary Energy Efficiency Targets 
 The Proposed Approach (Performance Standards)

 

Each alternative has been evaluated in terms of its ability to achieve 
significant energy savings at reasonable costs, and has been compared to the 
effectiveness of the proposed rule. 
If no new regulatory action were taken, then no new standards would be 
implemented for these eight products. This is essentially the ``base case'' for each appliance. In this case, between
the years 1996 and 2030 there would be expected energy use of 443.6 quads of primary energy, with no energy savings and
a zero net present value. 
Several alternatives to the base case can be grouped under the heading 
of informational action. They include consumer product labeling and the 
Department's public education and information program. Both of these 
alternatives are mandated by the Act. One base case alternative would be to 
estimate the energy conservation potential of enhancing these programs. To 
model this possibility, the Department assumed that market discount rates 
would be lowered by 5 percent for purchasers of these eight products. This 
resulted in energy savings equal to 1.7 quads, with expected consumption equal 
to 441.8 quads. The net present value is estimated to be $2.7 billion. 
Another method of setting standards would entail requiring that certain 
design options be used on each product, i.e., prescriptive standards. For 
these eight products, prescriptive standards are assumed to be implemented as 
standards at one level below the performance standards. The lower standards 
level entails slightly smaller expenditures for tooling and purchased parts. 
Consequently, the economic impacts that are expected before the implementation 
date should be slightly smaller for prescriptive standards. This resulted in 
energy consumption, between 1996 and 2030, of 389.2 quads, and savings of 54.3 
quads. The net present value, in 1990 dollars, was $92.3 billion. 
Various financial incentive alternatives were tested. These included 
tax credits and rebates to consumers, as well as tax credits to manufacturers. 
The tax credits to consumers were assumed to be 15 percent of the increased 
expense for higher energy efficiency features of these appliances, while the 
rebates were assumed to be 15 percent of the increase in equipment prices. 
The tax credits to consumers showed a change from the base case, saving 3.7 
quads with a net present value of $6.0 billion. Consumer rebates showed more 
sizable changes; they would save 4.5 quads with a net present value of $8.1 
billion. 
Another financial incentive that was considered was tax credits to 
manufacturers for the production of energy-efficient models of these eight 
appliances. In this scenario, an investment tax credit of 20 percent was 
assumed. The tax credits to manufacturers had almost no effect; the energy 
consumption estimates are 442.8 quads with savings equal to 0.7 quad, and a 
net present value equal to $0.8 billion. 
The impact of this scenario is so small because the investment tax 
credit was applicable only to the tooling and machinery costs of the firms. 
The firms' fixed costs and most of the design improvements that would likely 
be adopted to manufacture more efficient versions of these products would 
involve purchased parts. Expenses for purchased parts would not be eligible 
for an investment tax credit. 
Two scenarios of voluntary energy efficiency targets were examined. In 
the first one, the proposed energy conservation standards were assumed to be 
voluntarily adopted by all the relevant manufacturers in 5 years. In the 
second scenario, the proposed standards were assumed to be adopted in 10 
years. In these scenarios, the 5-year delay would result in energy 
consumption by these appliances of 388.0 quads, energy savings of 55.2 quads, 
and a net present value of $97.1 billion; the 10-year delay would result in 
398.4 quads of energy being consumed, 44.8 quads being saved, and a net 
present value of $76.6 billion. 
These scenarios assume that there would be universal voluntary adoption 
of the energy conservation standards by these appliance manufacturers, an 
assumption for which there is no reasonable assurance.

<PARENT> FR940304-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Lastly, all of these alternatives must be gauged against the performance 
standards that are being proposed in this notice. Such performance standards 
would result in energy consumption of the eight appliances to total an 
estimated 379.4 quads of primary energy over the 1996-2030 time period. 
Savings would be 64.1 quads, and the net present value would be an expected 
$108.7 billion. 

 As noted at the beginning of this section, none of the alternatives that 
were considered for these products would save as much energy as the proposed 
rule. 



c. ``Takings'' Assessment Review 



Executive Order 12630 (53 FR 8859, March 18, 1988) directs that, in 
proposing a regulation, an agency conduct a ``takings'' review. Such a review 
is intended to assist agencies in avoiding unnecessary takings and help such 
agencies account for those takings that are necessitated by statutory mandate. 

For purposes of the Order: 

``Policies that have takings implications'' refers to Federal regulations, 
proposed Federal regulations, proposed Federal legislation, comments on 
proposed Federal legislation, or other Federal policy statements that, if 
implemented or enacted, could effect a taking, such as rules and regulations 
that propose or implement licensing, permitting, or other condition 
requirements or limitations on private property use, or that require 
dedications or exactions from owners of private property.






There are three parts of the appliance standards program that 
conceivably could be viewed as having ``takings implications.'' These are 
testing and certification requirements, the impacts of standard levels, and 
possible DOE testing of products for validation. 

With regard to the first part, namely, testing and certification, the 
Department believes that such a requirement, implementing a long-established 
statutory mandate in a manner calculated to minimize adverse economic impacts, 
does not constitute a ``taking'' of private property. 

Similarly, the Department's possible validation testing does not 
constitute a ``taking'' within limitations described above. 

Lastly, the impact of standards could be viewed by some as a ``taking.'' 
Nevertheless, the Department believes that while an energy conservation 
standard may limit some manufacturers in the range of appliance efficiencies 
they can produce, such narrowing of the energy efficiency range does not 
constitute a ``taking'' in the sense described above. 

In short, in none of the three parts of the appliance standards program 
does the Department believe that the provisions of Executive Order 12630 
pertain. 



d. Federalism Review 



Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987) requires that 
regulations or rules be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, 
on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government. 
If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then Executive Order 12612 
requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions 
involved in promulgating and implementing a regulation or a rule. 

The Department finds that today's proposed rule, if finalized, will not 
have a substantial direct effect on State governments. State regulations that 
may have existed on these eight products were preempted by the Federal 
standards established in the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act. States 
could petition the Department for exemption from such preemption, and none has 
done so. Today's Final Rule has no added effect on States. Thus, based on 
the foregoing, the Department finds that the preparation of a Federalism 
assessment for this rulemaking is not warranted.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940304-1-00173 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940304-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Act provides for subsequent State petitions for exemption from 
preemption, which necessarily means that the determination as to whether a 
State law prevails must be made on a case-by-case basis using criteria set 
forth in the Act. When DOE receives such a petition, it will be appropriate 
to consider preparing a federalism assessment consistent with the criteria in 
the Act. 



e. Regulatory Flexibility Review 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354) requires an 
assessment of the impact of regulations on small businesses. Small businesses 
are defined as those firms within an industry that are privately owned and 
less dominant in the market. 

In this rulemaking, eight different products and, hence, industries are 
being addressed. Regulatory flexibility issues will be discussed for the 
industries for which standards are being prescribed. 

First, the energy conservation standard on those room air conditioner 
manufacturers who could be considered small businesses will be discussed. 

The room air conditioner industry is characterized by three firms with 
large market shares (accounting for nearly 75 percent of sales) and numerous 
firms sharing the remaining one-quarter of the market. 

There are significant differences among the major firms. For this 
industry, the Department has learned that average cost has an inverse 
relationship to firm size. Thus, the industry has economies of scale, and 
large firms (to the extent that their facilities are up-to-date) have lower 
average costs than small firms. This fact, coupled with increasing 
competitiveness of the national market, probably accounts for the continuing 
consolidation that has been occurring for several decades. The fact that the 
consolidation has been producing larger firms strongly corroborates the 
finding that large firms have a cost advantage. 

A principal implication of consolidation is that the smaller of the 
firms will be, on average, in more danger of failing or being bought out than 
will the large firms. Because of the greater precariousness of smaller firms, 
any decrease in average profitability is more likely to mean the difference 
between success and failure for a smaller firm. 

From the point of view of competitiveness, a decrease in average 
profitability could speed up the process of consolidation, producing a less 
competitive industry, while an increase in average profitability could help 
maintain the current levels of competition. Either effect might well be 
temporary, because, in the long run, the number of firms should be determined 
by the industry's cost structure and by the way a single firm's elasticity of 
demand relates to the number of competing firms. 

While some small firms have more energy efficient models than larger 
firms, and while some have more models of average efficiency, the impact of 
higher efficiency standards on small firms is likely to be mixed. If 
standards are technologically difficult to meet, however, they may hurt 
selected smaller firms the most, because smaller firms have less sophisticated 
research and development capabilities. 

Secondly, the impact of the energy conservation standards on water 
heater manufacturers needs to be addressed. 

Water heater manufacturing firms can be divided into two groups: those 
that compete on large sales volume products and those that compete in small, 
specialized markets. Small firms are generally forced to specialize in small 
market niches that offer some protection from the cost advantage that large 
firms hold when they can produce in volume. This effect can even be observed 
among the major producers, in the tendency of the smaller major producers to 
produce somewhat more specialized products. 

Just like the room air conditioner industry, water heater manufacturing 
is characterized by economies of scale in production, and large firms 
generally tend to have average costs that are lower than those of small firms. 

Although larger firms have a cost advantage because of economies of 
scale, the very small firms in the water heater manufacturing industry have 
found market niches in which to survive profitably. There are at least two 
small firms which manufacture standard electric resistance water heaters. In 
addition, there are also two small firms that manufacture heat pump water 
heaters. Therefore, if a very stringent efficiency standard for water heaters 
is mandated, one could expect that given the small margins in the industry, 
some small firms may have to leave the market. On the other hand, the small 
firms that specialize in higher efficiency models (such as heat pump water 
heaters) may experience a boom.

 The small firms that sell niche products such as heat pump water heaters 
usually find that these markets have higher margins. As a result, it is 
possible that small firms would have an easier time passing through increased 
variable costs that result from standards, and thus may be more positively 
affected than large firms by standards. However, this prediction should be 
tempered by the observation that if standards are technologically difficult to 
meet, they may hurt selected smaller firms the most since, as noted above, 
smaller firms typically have less sophisticated research and development 
capabilities. 
Thirdly, the direct heating equipment industry must be considered. This 
industry, too, is characterized by economies of scale in production, with 
larger firms having average costs that are lower than those of smaller firms. 
Here, too, there has been continuing consolidation over the past several 
decades. 
The same points raised above about the implications of consolidation and 
competitiveness among water heater firms pertain to manufacturers of direct 
heating equipment as well. 
Next, the mobile home furnace industry will be addressed. In this 
industry, two firms supply all the gas-fired mobile home furnaces. Since 
discussions with industry sources revealed that the market shares of the two 
firms are approximately 50 percent each, the Department believes that neither 
is a small firm on which standards could have a significant adverse impact. 
The characterization of the kitchen ranges and oven industry (including 
microwave ovens) is similar to those industries previously discussed. This 
industry, too, displays economies of scale in production and increasing 
consolidation as the larger firms have been acquiring smaller ones for the 
past few decades. 
Since many, if not most, of the energy conservation standards can be 
achieved without significant retooling of plant and equipment, it is probable 
that such standards will not have significant adverse impacts on the small 
firms. 
The pool heater industry, too, is characterized by economies of scale in 
production, with the consequent price advantage that large firms have over 
smaller ones. This industry, though, is already highly concentrated, and 
apparently never had a large number of firms. Most of the firms manufacture 
gas-fired pool heaters as an adjunct to other larger lines of business, e.g., 
boilers, pool and swimming equipment, etc. It appears that there are no real 
niche markets. Nevertheless, since the proposed standards are generally not 
considered to be technologically difficult to meet, and since the forecasts 
are that all standard levels are profitable, the Department does not expect 
significant adverse impacts on small firms. 
Another industry that shares the characterization of larger firms having 
cost advantages over smaller ones, i.e., that displays economies of scale, is 
the fluorescent lamp ballast industry. Here, too, there has been continuing 
consolidation over time, and presently, three firms produce 90 percent of the 
market. 
Many (if not most) of the standard levels considered do not require 
significant retooling of plant and equipment. In fact, much of the industry 
is currently retooling in anticipation of future growth, which is due in part 
to demand motivated by demand-side management programs of electric utility 
companies. These factors, combined with the estimates that profitability will 
be higher at all standard levels, imply that there will probably not be 
significant adverse impacts on small firms. 
Lastly, the impact of energy conservation standards on the television 
set industry is discussed. This industry also has undergone significant 
consolidation over the past few decades. Presently, as with most of the other 
industries discussed above, the larger firms have cost advantages over the 
smaller ones. 
Zenith is the only domestic television set manufacturer located in the 
U.S., and it has 13 percent of the market. Therefore, there really cannot be 
any adverse small firm impacts since, domestically, there is only one firm, 
and it is not small. 
In view of the foregoing, the Department has determined and hereby 
certifies pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act that 
today's action will not have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities.'' 
In conclusion, for each of these eight industries, the Department finds 
that the standard levels proposed in today's Proposed Rule will not ``have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' and it 
is not necessary to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis.

 2. Conduct of Hearing 



The Department reserves the right to select the 
persons to be heard at the hearing, to schedule the respective presentations, 
and to establish the procedures governing the conduct of the hearing. The 
length of each presentation is limited to 15 minutes. 

 A DOE official will be designated to preside at the hearing. The 
hearing will not be a judicial or an evidentiary-type hearing, but will be 
conducted in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 533 and section 336 of the Act. At the 
conclusion of all initial oral statements at each day of the hearing, each 
person who has made an oral statement will be given the opportunity to make a 
rebuttal statement, subject to time limitations. The rebuttal statement will 
be given in the order in which the initial statements were made. The official 
conducting the hearing will accept additional comments or questions from 
those attending, as time permits. Any interested person may submit, to the 
presiding official, written questions to be asked of any person making a 
statement at the hearing. The presiding official will determine whether the 
question is relevant, and whether time limitations permit it to be presented 
for answer. 
 Further questioning of speakers will be permitted by DOE. The 
presiding official will afford any interested person an opportunity to 
question other interested persons who made oral presentations, and 
employees of the United States who have made written or oral presentations 
with respect to disputed issues of material fact relating to the proposed 
rule. This opportunity will be afforded after any rebuttal statements, to the 
extent that the presiding official determines that such questioning is likely 
to result in a more timely and effective resolution of such issues. If the 
time provided is insufficient, DOE will consider affording an additional 
opportunity for questioning at a mutually convenient time. Persons interested 
in making use of this opportunity must submit their request to the presiding 
official no later than shortly after the completion of any rebuttal 
statements and be prepared to state specific justification, including why the 
issue is one of disputed fact and how the proposed questions would expedite 
their resolution. 
 Any further procedural rules regarding proper conduct of the hearing 
will be announced by the presiding official. 
 A transcript of the hearing will be made, and the entire record of this 
rulemaking, including the transcript, will be retained by DOE and made 
available for inspection at the DOE Freedom of Information Reading Room as 
provided at the beginning of this notice. Any person may purchase a copy of 
the transcript from the transcribing reporter. 


d. Issues Requested for Comment 


 As discussed above in today's notice, DOE has identified a number of 
issues where comments are requested. These issues include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
 The baseline units and the base cases; 
 Consideration of incremental impacts of various standard levels; 
 Market share elasticities; 
 Usage elasticities, i.e., rebound effect; 
 Appropriate discount rates, including those for residential and 
 commercial consumer analyses (life-cycle cost and Lawrence Berkeley 
 Laboratory-Residential Energy Model) and the use of a social 
 discount rate (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy 
 Model); 
 Energy price forecasts; 
 The characterization of prototypical firms for the manufacturer 
 impact analysis (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact 
 Model); 
 Efficiency forecasts for these products; 
 Any lessening of product utility resulting from the addition of the 
 design options identified; 
 The effects on forecasts due to the use of national average energy 
 prices and usage rates; 
 The effects of standards on manufacturers' incentives to develop 
 innovative products and product features; 
 Any uncertainties in modeling, especially with regard to product 
 usage, e.g., changes in usage rates as shown by survey data or 
 changes in usage of features; 
 Location of water heaters with respect to conditioned space; 
 Lifetimes of appliances; 
 Maintenance costs and failure rates of appliances and components; 
 The possible expansion of DOE's economic analysis to include the 
 variable effects of standards on identifiable sub-groups of 
 consumers, and/or the incremental effects of standards relative to 
 lower or higher standard levels; and 
 Possible modifications or alternatives to LBL's Manufacturer Impact 
 Model.

 Many of these issues are not unique to this proposed rule and some, such 
as discount rates and modifications of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory 
Manufacturer Impact Model, have been raised in previous DOE public notice 
under the appliance conservation standards program or by public comments on 
these notices. Those issues and the possible expansion of DOE's economic 
analysis in several areas were raised in DOE's Advance Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking Regarding Energy Conservation Standards for Three Types of Consumer 
Products, published on September 8, 1993 (58 FR 47326). DOE hopes that its 
conclusions in these areas for this rulemaking will serve as the basis for the 
development and promulgation of future appliance conservation standards, 
unless comments in future rulemakings make a persuasive case to the contrary.

ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard proposes to require chemical testing for use of dangerous drugs of all applicants for issuance or renewal
of licenses, certificates of registry (CORs), or merchant mariner's documents (MMDs). This action is necessary
to implement the requirements of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90). Testing of applicants would increase maritime
safety by providing an additional tool in the effort to promote a drug-free work place in the maritime industry.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Request for Comments




The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views,
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this rulemaking (CGD
91-223) and the specific section of this proposal to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each
comment. The Coast Guard requests that all comments and attachments be submitted in an unbound format suitable for
copying and electronic filing. If not practical, a second copy of any bound material is requested. Persons wanting
acknowledgment of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope. The Coast
Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. It may change this proposal in view of the comments.

The Coast Guard plans no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Marine Safety Council
at the address under ADDRESSES

. The request should include reasons why a hearing would be beneficial. If it determines that the opportunity for oral
presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold a public hearing at a time and place announced by
a later notice in the 

Federal Register

.



Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Mr. James W. Cratty, Project Manager, and Jacqueline
L. Sullivan, Project Counsel, Oil Pollution Act (OPA 90) Staff.



Background and Purpose



In recent years, several major oil spills from ships have occurred in waters under the jurisdiction of the United States.
Among these were the EXXON VALDEZ in Prince William Sound, Alaska, and the AMERICAN TRADER in coastal waters of California.
These spills caused extensive damage, including the loss of fish and wildlife. In response to these disasters and
others, Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101-380).

Among other things, OPA 90 introduces new safety measures relating to vessel operations. This notice of proposed
rulemaking (NPRM) proposes regulations to implement sections 4101(a) and (b) of OPA 90, which amend 46 U.S.C. 7101
and 7302, respectively, to require every person who applies for the issuance or renewal of a license, certificate
of registry (COR), or merchant mariner's document (MMD) to have a test for dangerous drugs.

Under 46 CFR part 10, the Coast Guard issues licenses to qualified officers such as masters, mates, pilots, engineers,
operators, and radio officers, and issues CORs to qualified staff officers such as pursers, medical doctors, and
professional nurses.

Under the authority of 46 U.S.C. 7302, any person serving aboard most U.S.-flag merchant vessels of more than 100 gross
tons operating on other than rivers and lakes must be issued an MMD by the Coast Guard. This document serves as a certificate
of identification and service, authorizing work in different capacities on deck and in the engine and steward's departments.
The MMD, with an appropriate endorsement, is also the credential issued to a qualified tankerman.

The statutory language of OPA 90 refers to the testing of an individual for the use of dangerous drugs in violation of
law or Federal regulation. Existing Coast Guard regulations are framed around the phrase ``chemical test,'' which
is already defined in 46 CFR 16.105. For the purposes of this NPRM, the chemical testing required of applicants for
issuance or renewal of licenses, CORs, or MMDs relates only to the use of dangerous drugs.

Section 4103(a)(2) of OPA 90 amends 46 U.S.C. 2101 by adding ``dangerous drug'' to the list of general definitions
and removes the definition of dangerous drugs from 46 U.S.C. 7503(a) and 7704(a). The definition of ``dangerous drug''
in section 4103(a)(2) of OPA 90 includes the term ``controlled substance.'' Although ``marijuana'' is not specifically
mentioned in the new definition, marijuana is a controlled substance under 21 U.S.C. 802, and is therefore covered
by the definition of ``dangerous drug.'' This NPRM would revise the definition of ``dangerous drug'' in 46 CFR 16.105
to conform it to the definition in 46 U.S.C. 2101, as amended by section 4103(a)(2) of OPA 90. This change has no substantive
effect on the existing drug testing rules in 46 CFR part 16.

Currently, 46 CFR 16.220(b) provides exceptions to the periodic chemical test requirement when there has been a recent
test for dangerous drugs or participation in a random test program. These exceptions were revised by a final rule published
in the 

Federal Register

 on May 28, 1993 (58 FR 31104). The revised exceptions would apply to the new testing requirements.

Section 4102(b) and (c) of OPA 90 amends 46 U.S.C. 7107 and 7302 to limit the terms of CORs and MMDs to 5 years. On September
16, 1993 the Coast Guard published an NPRM in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 48572) entitled ``Five-year Term of Validity for Certificates of Registry and Merchant Mariner's Documents''
(CGD 91-211) to implement the provisions of section 4102. Although the NPRMs for chemical testing and terms
of validity both deal with the issuance and renewal of merchant mariner's credentials, two separate documents have
been issued for ease of review by the public. This NPRM proposes additional changes to update Coast Guard regulations,
but it does not affect the regulatory amendments contained in the ``Five-Year Term of Validity for Certificates of
Registry and Merchant Mariner's Documents'' NPRM. In two places, 46 CFR 10.805(g) and 12.02-9(f), this NPRM
contains proposed regulatory text that would follow after additions proposed in the ``Five-Year Term of Validity
for Certificates of Registry and Merchant Mariner's Documents'' NPRM. One final rule may be issued combining the
requirements for chemical testing and regulations for the terms of validity for CORs and MMDs.



Discussion of Proposed Amendments



OPA 90 requires all applicants for the issuance or renewal of licenses, CORs, or MMDs to have a chemical test for dangerous
drugs. The proposed rules would apply the requirement to (1) an original issuance or a renewal of a license, COR, or
MMD; (2) a raise in grade of a license or a higher grade of COR; and (3) the first endorsement on an MMD as an able seaman,
qualified member of the engine department, or tankerman. Applicants meeting either of the exceptions contained
in  16.220 would be exempt from the chemical testing requirements. A chemical test for dangerous drugs would
not be required for an MMD endorsement that does not require a new expiration date for the MMD or the duplicate issuance
or replacement of valid licenses, CORs, or MMDs. If an applicant applies for multiple documentation transactions
at one time, the application is treated as a single transaction and a single drug test will satisfy the drug testing
requirements for all documentation transactions covered by the application.

In a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 17, 1989 (54 FR 42624), the Coast Guard proposed to remove existing 46 CFR subpart 12.20 entitled ``Tankerman,''
and replace it with a new part 13, ``Tankermen and Persons in Charge of Transfer of Dangerous Liquid and Liquefied Gas.''
The Coast Guard is proposing to add chemical testing for dangerous drugs to the requirements for obtaining a tankerman
endorsement on an MMD. Because the ``Tankerman'' rulemaking has not been finalized, the proposal to add drug testing
requirements is set out as amendment to the existing requirements in 46 CFR subpart 12.20. The final rule will place
the drug testing requirements in subpart 12.20 or a new 46 CFR part 13, as appropriate.

Periodic chemical testing for dangerous drugs is currently part of the physical examinations required for some merchant
mariners. Entry-level ratings (46 CFR subpart 12.25), lifeboatmen (46 CFR subpart 12.10), and staff officers (46
CFR 10.801) do not require physical examinations. Existing  16.220(a) states that, if a physical examination
is required, the examination must include a chemical test for dangerous drugs. The applicant must provide the results
of the chemical test for dangerous drugs to a Coast Guard Regional Examination Center (REC) where licensing and documentation
transactions take place. The proposed rules would revise  16.220(a) to base testing requirements on issuance
or renewal transactions. Additionally, requirements for pilots who must undergo an annual physical examination
would be moved to a new  16.220(b) and a new reporting requirement is proposed for that section. Pilots who are
not excepted from taking a chemical drug test as part of their annual physical would be required to provide drug test
results to the REC where their license was last renewed.

The Coast Guard is soliciting comments specifically on two issues raised by this expansion of chemical testing requirements.
The first issue relates to an unemployed, nonunion applicant who is required to have a chemical test for dangerous
drugs. Under 46 CFR 16.370, which would not be amended by the proposed rules, individuals must have test results reviewed
by a Medical Review Officer (MRO) selected by the employer or sponsoring organization. However, if an applicant does
not hold a maritime-related job or belong to a union, there may be no MRO immediately available to the applicant for
reviewing test results and providing appropriate certification. The Coast Guard is interested in receiving comments
on whether this situation would pose a significant problem and requests suggestions on alternatives.

The second issue relates to inactive license renewals under 46 CFR 10.209(g). Under the proposed rules, applicants
for inactive license renewals would not be required to undergo a chemical test for dangerous drugs. The Coast Guard
seeks comments on the desirability of requiring applicants for inactive license renewals to meet the chemical testing
requirements.



Regulatory Evaluation



This proposal is not major under Executive Order 12866, but is considered significant under the ``Department of Transportation
Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979) because of controversy surrounding chemical
drug testing, substantial public interest, and the potential for litigation. A Regulatory Evaluation has been prepared
for this rulemaking and is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under 

ADDRESSES

.



Costs to Government



Federal Government costs attributable to implementation of these proposed regulations would be incurred by the
17 Coast Guard RECs. Each applicant is responsible for submitting chemical test results verified by a MRO during the
``evaluation'' phase of the merchant mariner credential transaction. The additional costs, for the ``evaluation''
phase, associated with receiving and handling test results on applicants for merchant mariner credentials will
be minimal. The costs incurred as a result of this rulemaking are a relatively small percentage of the total costs of
the ``evaluation'' phase, and do not warrant revision of the current fees for evaluation related to MMD, COR or licensing
transactions.



Costs to Public and Respondents



Firms in the maritime industry and some individual respondents (applicants) would bear the prospective incremental
costs of this rulemaking. These costs are addressed in the Regulatory Evaluation.

The cost projections assume that holders of MMDs will not apply for renewals and endorsements at the same time, and
that holders of licenses will not apply for renewals and raises in grade at the same time. This approach guards against
underestimating costs. However, the projections further assume that holders of licenses who also hold MMDs will
renew licenses and MMDs together, and that the few holders of CORs and MMDs will apply for and renew CORs and MMDs together.
The cost projections were adjusted to reflect the percentage of merchant mariners that will not have to take a drug
test for the documentation transaction because they already participate in a random chemical testing program for
dangerous drugs or they have passed a drug test within the previous 185 days. Computations show that the NPRM would
subject an estimated additional 7,258 applicants for credentials each year to chemical testing for dangerous drugs.
The annual cost to the public would total $439,000.

Benefits



The dollar value of direct and societal benefits derived from the proposed rule are not quantifiable, but may be substantial.

According to a 1987 report published by the National Institute of Drug Abuse, drug-free individuals_

(a) Suffer fewer accidents;


(b) File fewer workers' compensation claims;

(c) Use less sick leave; and

(d) Experience lower medical cost than drug users.

Historical data is insufficient to quantify benefits. However, should this program manage to save even one life per
year at $2.5 million per statistical life saved (which recent research shows is a reasonable estimate of people's
willingness-to-pay for safety), its benefits would exceed its costs. If maritime accidents were reduced even by
a small percentage, savings would accrue to the maritime industry through lower repair and medical costs and to the
public through environmental protection.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).

The costs to small entities will probably not be significant because the costs of the additional chemical testing
for dangerous drugs will be borne primarily by individual applicants, and is less than $100 per occasion. Because
it expects the impact of this proposal on small entities to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 15 U.S.C. 605(b)
that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews each proposed rule that contains a collection of information
requirement to determine whether the practical value of the information is worth the burden imposed by its collection.
Collection of information requirements include reporting, recordkeeping, notification, and other, similar requirements.
