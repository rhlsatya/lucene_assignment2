Each year during the anniversary month of the publication of an antidumping or countervailing duty order, finding,
or suspension of investigation, an interested party as defined in section 771(9) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended,
may request, in accordance with  353.22 or  355.22 of the Commerce Regulations (19 CFR 353.22/355.22
(1993)), that the Department of Commerce (``the Department'') conduct an administrative review of that antidumping
or countervailing duty order, finding, or suspended investigation.




OPPORTUNITY TO REQUEST A REVIEW: 

Not later than March 31, 1994, interested parties may request administrative review of the following orders, findings,
or suspended investigations, with anniversary dates in March for the following periods:

In accordance with   353.22(a) and 355.22(a) of the Commerce regulations, an interested party may request
in writing that the Secretary conduct an administrative review. For antidumping reviews, the interested party must
specify for which individual producers or resellers covered by an antidumping finding or order it is requesting a
review, and the requesting party must state why the person desires the Secretary to review those particular producers
or resellers. If the interested party intends for the Secretary to review sales of merchandise by a reseller (or a producer
if that producer also resells merchandise from other suppliers) which was produced in more than one country of origin,
and each country of origin is subject to a separate order, then the interested party must state specifically which
reseller(s) and which countries of origin for each reseller the request is intended to cover.

Seven copies of the request should be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, International
Trade Administration, room B-099, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington DC 20230. The Department also asks
parties to serve a copy of their requests to the Office of Antidumping Compliance, Attention: John Kugelman, in room
3069-A of the main Commerce Building. Further, in accordance with  353.31(g) or  355.31(g) of the
Commerce Regulations, a copy of each request must be served on every party on the Departments's service list.

The Department will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of ``Initiation of Antidumping (Countervailing) Duty Administrative Review'', for requests received
by March 31, 1994.

If the Department does not receive, by March 31, 1994, a request for review of entries covered by an order or finding
listed in this notice and for the period identified above, the department will instruct the Customs Service to assess
antidumping or countervailing duties on those entries at a rate equal to the cash deposit of (or bond for) estimated
antidumping or countervailing duties required on those entries at the time of entry, or withdrawal from warehouse,
for consumption and to continue to collect the cash deposit previously ordered.

This notice is not required by statute, but is published as a service to the international trading community.

<DOCTITLE>Antifriction Bearings From France; United States Court of International Trade Decision </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 International Trade Administration/Import Administration, Department of Commerce.

 
</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On November 30, 1993, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) rejected the Department of Commerce's
redetermination on remand of the final results of the first administrative review of the antidumping duty order on
antifriction bearings (other than tapered roller bearings) and parts thereof from France (56 FR 31748, July 11, 1991).


Federal-Mogul Corp.

 v. 

United States,

 (Slip Op. 93-224, November 30, 1993) (

Federal-Mogul

). Specifically, the CIT rejected the Department's methodology in the redetermination for calculating the amount
of the tax adjustment that was added to United States price. The CIT entered final judgment on all issues. The results
covered the period November 9, 1988, through April 30, 1990. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background


On June 3, 1993, the CIT in 

Federal-Mogul Corp.

 v. 

United States,

 (Slip Op. 93-94), remanded the final results of the first administrative review of the antidumping duty order
on antifriction bearings (other than tapered roller bearings) and parts thereof from France (56 FR 31748, July 11,
1991) to the Department for the reconsideration of a number of issues. For one of these issues, the Court ordered the
Department to determine the exact monetary amount of the value added tax (VAT) paid on each sale in the home market,
to make certain that the amount of the VAT adjustment added to the comparable U.S. sale is less than or equal to this amount,
and to add the full amount of the VAT in the home market to foreign market value (FMV) without adjustment. On September
1, 1993, the Department submitted to the CIT its redetermination on remand on the VAT and other issues. On November
30, 1993, the CIT ruled upon Commerce's redetermination in 

Federal-Mogul

. In this decision, the CIT rejected the Department's redetermination methodology for calculating the amount of
the VAT adjustment added to USP. 
In its decision in 

Timken Co.

 v. 

United States,

 893 F.2d 337 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (

Timken

), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1516a(e), the Department
must publish a notice of a court decision which is not ``in harmony'' with a Department determination, and must suspend
liquidation of entries pending a ``conclusive'' court decision. The CIT's decision in 

Federal-Mogul

 on November 30, 1993, which rejected the Department's redetermination methodology for calculating the amount of
the VAT adjustment added to USP, constitutes a decision not in harmony with the Department's final results. 
Pursuant to the decision in 

Timken,

 the Department must continue the suspension of liquidation of the subject merchandise pending the later of the expiration
of the period for appeal or the conclusion of any appeal. Further, absent an appeal, or, if appealed, upon a ``conclusive''
court decision affirming the CIT's opinion, the Department will amend the final affirmative results of antifriction
bearings (other than tapered roller bearings) and parts thereof from France to reflect the change in the VAT adjustment
calculation methodology which was ordered by the CIT and direct liquidation in accordance with the amended determination.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final results of countervailing duty administrative review.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On January 3, 1994, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its administrative review of
the countervailing duty order on cotton yarn from Brazil (59 FR 68). We have now completed that review and determine
the net subsidy to be 0.30 percent ad valorem for all firms during the period January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992.
In accordance with 19 CFR 355.7, any rate less than 0.50 percent ad 

valorem

 is 

de minimis

.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background 



On January 3, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 68) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the countervailing duty order on cotton yarn from
Brazil (42 FR 14089; March 15, 1977). The Department has now completed that administrative review in accordance with
section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). 



Scope of Review



Imports covered by this review are shipments of Brazilian yarn, carded but not combed, wholly of cotton. During the
review period, such merchandise was classifiable under item numbers 5205.11.10, 5205.11.20, 5205.12.10, 5205.12.20,
5205.13.10, 5205.13.20, 5205.14.10, 5205.14.20, 5205.15.10, 5205.15.20, 5205.31.00, 5205.32.00, 5205.33.00,
5205.34.00, and 5205.35.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience
and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. 

The review covers the period January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992, eight companies and the following seven programs:
(1) Income Tax Exemption for Export Earnings; (2) Reductions of Taxes and Import Duties through BEFIEX; (3) SUDENE
Regional Tax Exemption; (4) CACEX (Carteira de Comercio Exterior) Working Capital Financing for Exports; (5) Preferential
Export Financing under CIC-OPCRE of the Banco do Brasil; (6) Preferential Financing for Industrial Enterprises
by the Banco do Brasil (FST and EGF loans); and (7) IPI (Tax on Industrialized Products) for Imports of Machinery or
Equipment Under Decree Law 2324.



Calculation Methodology for Assessment and Cash Deposit Purposes



In calculating the benefits received during the review period, we followed the methodology described in the preamble
to 
19 CFR 355.20(d) (53 FR 52325; December 27, 1988). First, we calculated a country-wide rate, weight-averaging the
subsidy rates of the eight companies subject to review to determine the overall subsidy from all countervailing programs
benefitting exports of the subject merchandise to the United States. Because the overall weighted-average country-wide
rate was de minimis, as defined by 19 CFR 355.7, we did not proceed any further in our analysis. 



Analysis of Comments Received



We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received no comments. 



Final Results of Review



As a result of our review, we determine the net subsidy to be 0.30 percent 

ad valorem

 for all firms during the period January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992. In accordance with 19 CFR 355.7, any rate
less than 0.50 percent 

ad valorem

 is 

de minimis

. 

Therefore, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to liquidate, without regard to countervailing duties,
all shipments of this merchandise exported on or after January 1, 1992 and on or before December 31, 1992. 


The Department will instruct the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation on all shipments of this merchandise
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice. Because
the net subsidy is 

de minimis

, however, the cash deposit on such shipments will be zero. These instructions shall remain in effect until publication
of the final results of the next administrative review.

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 355.22.

Regulations Governing the Taking of Marine Mammals Incidental to Commercial Fishing Operations; Interim Exemption
for Commercial Fisheries 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed List of Fisheries for calendar year 1994; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS requests comments and further information on the proposed List of Fisheries for calendar year 1994 as well as
several other actions associated with the Interim Exemption for Commercial Fishing under the Marine Mammal Protection
Act (MMPA). 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 114 of the MMPA establishes an interim exemption for the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial
fishing operations and requires NMFS to publish and annually update a List of Fisheries, along with a list of the marine
mammals and the number of vessels or persons involved in each such fishery, in three categories, as follows: 



(I) A frequent incidental taking of marine mammals; 
(II) An occasional incidental taking of marine mammals; or 
(III) A remote likelihood of, or no known, incidental taking 
of marine mammals. 

Based on Congressional guidance, NMFS interpretation of the 1988 Amendments, public comment, and meetings and consultations
with state and Federal agencies, Regional Fishery Management Councils, and other interested parties, NMFS published
the original List of Fisheries on April 20, 1989 (54 FR 16072). NMFS also published an interim rule governing the taking
of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations on May 19, 1989 (54 FR 21910), and a final rule governing
reporting of the take of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations on December 15, 1989 (54 FR 51718).


On June 14, 1993 (58 FR 32905), NMFS published the interim final List of Fisheries for 1993 and requested comments and
information on the changes contained therein. All comments received were in support of the changes to the interim
final List of Fisheries. A summary of the comments received are provided in the following section. Proposed revised
changes for the 1994 List of Fisheries are based on the classification of fisheries as published in the 1993 interim
final List of Fisheries. 

The following criteria were used in classifying fisheries in the List of Fisheries: 



Category I. 

There is documented information indicating a ``frequent'' incidental taking of marine mammals in the fishery. ``Frequent''
means that it is highly likely that more than one marine mammal will be incidentally taken by a randomly selected vessel
in the fishery during a 20 day period. 



Category II. 

(1) There is documented information indicating an ``occasional'' incidental taking of marine mammals in the fishery,
or (2) in the absence of information indicating the frequency of incidental taking of marine mammals, other factors
such as fishing techniques, gear used, methods used to deter marine mammals, target species, seasons and areas fished,
and species and distribution of marine mammals in the area suggest there is a likelihood of at least an ``occasional''
incidental taking in the fishery. ``Occasional'' means that there is some likelihood that one marine mammal will
be incidentally taken by a randomly selected vessel in the fishery during a 20 day period, but that there is little likelihood
that more than one marine mammal will be incidentally taken. 



Category III. 

(1) There is information indicating no more than a ``remote likelihood'' of an incidental taking of a marine mammal
in the fishery, or (2) in the absence of information indicating the frequency of incidental taking of marine mammals,
other factors such as fishing techniques, gear used, methods used to deter marine mammals, target species, seasons
and areas fished, and species and distribution of marine mammals in the area suggest there is no more than a remote likelihood
of an incidental take in the fishery. ``Remote likelihood'' means that it is highly unlikely that any marine mammal
will be incidentally taken by a randomly selected vessel in the fishery during a 20-day period. 

Section 114(b)(1)(C) of the MMPA, requires the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, to annually publish
and request comments on proposed revisions to the List of Fisheries to be effective for the next calendar year.

Comments Received on the 1993 Interim Final List of Fisheries 



Thirteen comments were received in response to the request for comments on the interim final List of Fisheries for
1993. All of the comments received were in support of the changes published in the interim final List of Fisheries,
and are summarized below. 

Alaska Prince William Sound (Eshamy, Coghill, and Unakwik districts) Drift Gill Net Fishery and the Alaska Copper
River and Bering River (adjacent to Prince William Sound) Drift Gill Net Fishery 

Twelve comments were received supporting the split of the former Alaska Prince William Sound drift gill net fishery
into two separate fisheries, based on the difference in take rates in the two areas. All comments received also supported
the reclassification of the Alaska Prince William Sound (Coghill, Eshamy, and Unakwik districts) drift gill net
fishery from Category I to Category II. 



Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico Tuna, Shark, and Swordfish Pair Trawl Fishery 



One comment was received supporting the reclassification of the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico tuna, shark,
and swordfish pair trawl fishery from Category II to Category I. The individual making the comment also suggested
that all pair trawl fisheries be reclassified as Category I fisheries. NMFS is aware of only one other pair trawl fishery
which operated for a short time in the Gulf of Maine, targeting groundfish. This fishery has been inactive following
issuance of emergency regulations published on June 8, 1993 (58 FR 32062). Amendment 5 of the New England Groundfish
Fishery Management Plan, approved on 
January 3, 1994, contains measures to continue the ban on the use of pair trawl gear in this fishery indefinitely. If
new information is received regarding the use of pair trawl gear in other areas, further action will be taken on this
recommendation. 



Proposed Changes 



1. 

Recategorize

 the Alaska Copper River and Bering River (adjacent to Prince William Sound) salmon drift gill net fishery from Category
I (Table 1) to Category II (Table 2). 

Many of the comments received on the 1993 interim final List of Fisheries indicated that the take rates given for the
Alaska Copper River and Bering River (adjacent to Prince William Sound) drift gill net fishery were overestimated.
Take rates were based on the total number of interactions, which included momentary interactions with the nets, e.g.,
animals brushing up against the net or swimming over it, as well as serious injuries, and mortalities. Many individuals
submitting comments noted that if only those interactions resulting in serious injuries or mortalities were used
to calculate take rates, the take rate would be much less than that reported in the interim final List. Therefore, NMFS
has reviewed the observer data collected in this fishery and calculated a revised take rate of 0.56 marine mammal takes
per 20 days of fishing, based on an estimated 252 serious injuries, and kills in 8,883 fishing vessel days. Based on
the calculated take rate, NMFS proposes reclassification of the Alaska Copper River and Bering River (adjacent to
Prince William Sound) drift gill net fishery from Category I to Category II. 

2. 

Recategorize 

the WA, OR Lower Columbia River salmon drift gill net fishery from Category I (Table 1) to Category III (Table 3). 

Marine mammal/fishery interaction and incidental take data have been collected in this fishery since 1991 under
a marine mammal observer program that was completed at the end of calendar year 1993. Incidental take data have been
collected by observers from the two major fishing seasons (winter and fall) with approximately 6 percent coverage
of fishing effort in winter 1991, 4 percent in fall 1991, 10 percent in winter 1992, 7 percent in fall 1992, and 7 percent
in winter 1993. Percent observer coverage for the fall 1993 fishery is currently being estimated, and will be completed
after all landing data have been reviewed. Only one marine mammal mortality, a harbor seal, was observed in 3 years
of observations in the fall fisheries (1991, 1992, and 1993), while a total of 28 marine mammal serious injuries or
mortalities (24 harbor seals and four California sea lions) were observed over the course of 3 years of observations
in the winter fisheries (1991 through 1993). Based on the observer data from 1991-winter 1993 (fall 1993 data
analysis is underway), less than 0.5 marine mammals are taken per vessel 
per 20 days of fishing in this fishery. Based on this, NMFS proposes that the WA, OR Lower Columbia River salmon drift
gill net fishery be recategorized from Category I to Category III.

3. 

Recategorize 

the WA Willapa Bay salmon drift gill net fishery from Category I (Table 1) to Category III (Table 3). 
Marine mammal/fishery interaction and incidental take data have been collected in this fishery since 1991 under
a marine mammal observer program that was completed at the end of calendar year 1993. Incidental take data have been
collected by observers from about 2 to 13 percent of the fishing effort since 1991. No marine mammal mortalities have
been observed. Because the incidence of take is rare and does not meet the criteria for categorizing fisheries in Category
I or II, NMFS proposes that the WA Willapa Bay salmon drift gill net fishery be recategorized from Category I to Category
III. 
4. 

Recategorize 

the WA Grays Harbor salmon set and drift gill net fishery from Category I (Table 1) to Category III (Table 3). 
Marine mammal/fishery interaction and incidental take data have been collected in this fishery since 1991 under
a marine mammal observer program that was completed at the end of calendar year 1993. Incidental take data have been
collected by observers from about 4 to 10 percent of the fishing effort since 1991. Only one marine mammal mortality,
a harbor seal, has been observed. Because the incidence of take is rare and does not meet the one take per vessel per 20
days criteria for categorizing fisheries in Category I or II, NMFS proposes that the WA Grays Harbor salmon set and
drift gill net fishery be recategorized from Category I to Category III. 
5. 

Recategorize 

all California gill net fisheries (except the CA Klamath River gill net fishery, Table 2), based on mesh size of net,
by 

adding 

CA set and drift gill net fisheries that use a stretched mesh size of greater than 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) to Category I (Table
1), 

adding 

set and drift gill net fisheries that use a stretched mesh size of 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) or less to Category III (Table 3),


dropping 

all other CA set and drift gill net fisheries, including: the CA thresher shark and swordfish drift gill net fishery
(Table 1), the CA halibut set gill net fishery (Table 1), the CA soupfin shark, yellowtail, white sea bass set gill net
fishery (Table 1), the CA white croaker, bonito, and flying fish gill net fishery (Table 2), and 

redefining 

the WA, OR, CA herring, smelt, shad, sturgeon, bottom fish, mullet, perch, rockfish gill net fishery (Table 3) to include
only WA and OR. 
Since 1989, the categorization of gill net fisheries in California has been based on the species being targeted and
the frequency of marine mammal mortality. Reviews of information on the rate of marine mammal mortality in a range
of gill net mesh sizes indicate that larger mesh sizes (greater than 3.5 inches or 8.9 cm stretched mesh size) entangle
marine mammals at a much higher rate than smaller mesh sizes (less than 3.5 inches or 8.9 cm stretched mesh size) (Miller
1983, Vojkovich 1987, 1988, 1989, Barlow 

et al. 

1992). Observer placement in Category I fisheries, as required by the MMPA, could be achieved more effectively by
evaluating the type of gear that will be used instead of the intended target species. Therefore, NMFS proposes that
all California gill net fisheries (except the CA Klamath River fishery) be reclassified based on stretch mesh size,
rather than by target species. Set or drift gill net vessels that use mesh sizes greater that 3.5 inches (8.9 cm), such
as the CA thresher shark and swordfish drift gill net fishery (Table 1), the CA halibut set gill net fishery (Table 1),
the CA soupfin shark, yellowtail, white sea bass set gill net fishery (Table 1) would remain in Table 1 and be subject
to the requirements of a Category I fishery. Set or drift gill net vessels that use mesh sizes less than or equal to 3.5
inches (8.9 cm), such as the CA white croaker, bonito, and flying fish gill net fishery (Table 2), and the WA, OR, CA herring,
smelt, shad, sturgeon, bottom fish, mullet, perch, rockfish gill net fishery (Table 3) would be subject to the requirements
for a Category III fishery. 
6. 

Recategorize 

the GME Atlantic salmon aquaculture (net pen) fishery from Category III (Table 6) to Category II (Table 5).

Harbor seals and gray seals are known to interact with salmon net pens in the Gulf of Maine (GME), yet the rate at which
interactions occur may be increasing based on stranding reports and communication with net pen owners and their representatives.
Recently, the Maine Aquaculture Association appealed to NMFS to provide net pen owners with a means for limited intentional
lethal taking of seals, indicating a 10 percent loss of salmon due to predation by seals. In their appeal, they noted
that a ``Predator Control Seminar'' was held in Eastport, Maine, in April 1993 to discuss the effectiveness of non-lethal
means of deterring seals. The group determined that although non-lethal deterrence efforts are being employed,
``periodic intentional lethal take of individual seals is a necessary tool for the continued success of this industry.''

Owners of salmon net pens have been subject to the reporting requirements of a Category III fishery, which require
that all lethal takes of marine mammals be reported to NMFS within 10 days. However, only limited reports of seal mortalities
due to salmon net pen operations have been received by NMFS since 1989. NMFS is concerned that the take rate of marine
mammals in salmon net pen operations may be greater than previously estimated, and therefore proposes that the Gulf
of Maine salmon net pen fishery be reclassified from Category III to Category II.

 On December 17 and 27, 1993, January 3 and 7, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled

published notices (58 FR 65971, 68398, 59 FR 74 and 1002) of 
proposed additions to and deletions from the Procurement List. 



Additions 



After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
commodities and services, fair market price, and impact of the 
additions on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee 
has determined that the commodities and services listed below are 
suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 
46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 

I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
factors considered for this certification were: 

1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
other than the small organizations that will furnish the 
commodities and services to the Government. 

2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
current contractors for the commodities and services. 

3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the commodities and services to the Government. 

4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
U.S.C. 46-48c) in connection with the commodities and services 
proposed for addition to the Procurement List. 

Accordingly, the following commodities and services are hereby 
added to the Procurement List:

This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the 
effective date of this addition or options exercised under those 
contracts. 



Deletions 



After consideration of the relevant matter presented, the Committee 
has determined that the commodities listed below are no longer 
suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 
46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 

Accordingly, the following commodities are hereby deleted from the 
Procurement List:

<DOCTITLE>Procurement List; Addition </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or 
Severely Disabled.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Addition to the procurement list.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action adds to the Procurement List a service to be 
furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or 
have other severe disabilities. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 1, 1993, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are 
Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (58 FR 51319) of 
proposed addition to the Procurement List. 



Comments were received from the current contractor in response to 
a Committee request for sales data. The contractor claimed that 
addition of these services to the Procurement List would have a 
tremendous impact on its employees in the Burlington, Vermont area, 
on its Vermont operations, and on the company as a whole. It noted 
that unemployment is high in the Burlington area, making it 
unlikely that the displaced workers would find other employment, 
and that non-Government-contract wages are lower. The contractor indicated that the contracts at issue are a large
enough part of 
its Vermont operations that without them it would have to close its 
Vermont office and attempt to service its contracts in the area 
from its Massachusetts headquarters. It claimed that performance 
on those contracts would likely be impaired, and that performance 
problems would limit its ability to obtain Government contracts, 
which constitute the great majority of its business. 

The contracts for the services proposed to be added to the 
Procurement List are only a very small portion of the contractor's 
total sales. Accordingly, loss of these contracts would not cause 
a severe adverse impact on the contractor's sales. 

People with severe disabilities generally have unemployment rates 
exceeding 65 percent, considerably higher than the unemployment 
rate for people without disabilities in the Burlington, Vermont 
area. Consequently, the Committee believes that any potential loss 
of employment for the contractor's workers is outweighed by the 
actual creation of jobs for people with severe disabilities, who 
would have a much harder time finding other employment than the 
contractor's workers. 

The Committee has taken into account the contractor's claims 
concerning the possible closing of its Vermont office and the 
effects this might have on its ability to perform its Government 
contracts and acquire others. However, the Committee, noting the 
speculative nature of these claims, does not believe they increase 
the impact of the small loss in sales which addition of these 
services to the Procurement List would have on the contractor 
sufficiently to constitute severe adverse impact on the contractor. 
After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the service, 
fair market price, and impact of the addition on the current or 
most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the 
service listed below is suitable for procurement by the Federal 
Government under 41 U.S.C. 46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 

I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
factors considered for this certification were: 

1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
other than the small organizations that will furnish the service 
to the Government. 

2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
current contractors for the service. 

3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the service to the Government. 

4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
U.S.C. 46-48c) in connection with the service proposed for 
addition to the Procurement List. 

Accordingly, the following service is hereby added to the 
Procurement List: 




Janitorial/Custodial 
for the following locations: 



Federal Building, 
11 Elmwood Avenue, 
Burlington, Vermont 

Federal Building, 
11 Lincoln Street, 
Essex Junction, Vermont 

Social Security Administration Building, 
58 Pearl Street, 
Burlington, Vermont 




This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the 
effective date of this addition or options exercised under those 
contracts.

Turbine Industries, Inc.; Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment




February 28, 1994.






In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a minor license for the existing, unlicensed Coolemee Hydroelectric Project, located on the
South Yadkin River, in the Town of Coolemee, Davie County, North Carolina, and has prepared a Draft Environmental
Assessment (DEA) for the project. In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential environmental impacts
of the existing project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate mitigation or enhancement
measures, would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.



Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426.



Please submit any comments within 30 days from the date of this notice. Comments should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell,
Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Please affix
Project No. 11264 to all comments. For further information, please contact Mary Glato, Environmental Coordinator,

Take notice that on February 24, 1994, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (Colorado) amended the notice
of determination that was filed by the United States Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the
above-referenced proceedings on September 2, 1993, pursuant to  271.703(c)(3) of the Commission's regulations.
The February 24, 1994 notice determined that a portion of the Corcoran-Cozzette Formation in Garfield County, Colorado,
qualifies as a tight formation under section 107(b) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA).

The February 24, 1994, amended notice of determination reduces the geographical area recommended for a tight formation
designation. The amended area now covers only 48,274.78 acres; 23,974.20 acres or 49.66% are owned in Fee, and 24,300.58
acres or 50.34% are Federal Lands described as follows:

Sections 1-36: All




Township 6 South, Range 100 West




Sections 1-3, 10-15, 22-27, and 34-36: All




Township 7 South, Range 99 West




Sections 1-18: All




Township 7 South, Range 100 West




Sections 1-3, and 10-15: All






The notice of determination also contains Colorado's findings that the referenced portion of the Corcoran-Cozzette
Formation meets the requirements of the Commission's regulations set forth in 18 CFR part 271.

The application for determination is available for inspection, except for material which is confidential under
18 CFR 275.206, at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington DC 20426.
Persons objecting to the determination may file a protest, in accordance with 18 CFR 275.203 and 275.204, within 20
days after the date this notice is issued by the Commission.

<DOCTITLE>Delaware: Final Determination of Adequacy of the State's Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program </DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (Region III).

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final determination of full program adequacy for the State of Delaware's application. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires states to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will
comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether states have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate
issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation
Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill
permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are
submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the
STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, states/tribes
may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have
an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal permit programs provide interaction between the State/Tribe and the
owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in State/Tribes
with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal
permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the
permit status of any facility, the federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities.





The State of Delaware through the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) applied
for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA has reviewed Delaware's MSWLF application and proposed
a determination on November 15, 1993, that Delaware's MSWLF permit program is adequate to ensure compliance with
the revised MSWLF Criteria. As no comments or opposition to EPA's tentative determination were received, EPA is today
issuing a final determination that the State of Delaware's program is adequate.

<TEXT>
 

On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires states to develop permitting programs to ensure
that facilities comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA
determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply
with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing
a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs
must satisfy to be determined adequate. 
EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements
for states or tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval, as imposing several
minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that
are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue
a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also
must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA.
Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement
authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.

EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation
outlined above. 


B. State of Delaware 


On October 7, 1993, Delaware submitted an application for adequacy determination for Delaware's MSWLF permit program.
On November 15, 1993, EPA published a tentative determination of adequacy for all portions of Delaware's program.
Further background on the tentative determination of adequacy appears at 58 FR 60199-60201, November 15, 1993.

A public comment period began on November 15, 1993, and ended on December 27, 1993. In this notice of tentative determination,
EPA announced that if there was sufficient public interest, a public hearing would be held on December 27, 1993. EPA
Region III received no public comment or request for a public hearing, therefore, a public hearing was not held. 
In the State's final application for adequacy determination, Delaware proposed revisions to those portions of their
existing regulations which did not meet the Federal requirements in EPA's 40 CFR part 258. EPA tentatively determined
in the November 15, 1993 

Federal Register

 that once adopted as final regulation, Delaware's proposed regulations would ensure compliance with 40 CFR part
258. Delaware has made the regulatory changes specified in the November 15, 1993 

Federal Register

, and as listed below; the revised Delaware Regulations Governing Solid Waste (DRGSW) became effective on November
24, 1993. 


Subpart A_General 


Section 258.2 Definitions_Where appropriate, the State has adopted key terms and definitions which will
more clearly ensure compliance with the 40 CFR part 258 Criteria. These key definitions have been included in section
3 of the DRGSW. 


Subpart B_Location Restrictions 


Section 258.10 Airport Safety_The State has amended Section 5.A.3. of the DRGSW to require that the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) and affected airport(s) are notified of a proposed landfill located within 5 miles
of an airport. 
Section 258.11 Floodplains_Delaware has included the requirements and terms of this section in Section
5.A.4.a. of the DRGSW. 
Sections 258.13 Fault Areas, 258.14 Seismic Impact Zones, and 258.15 Unstable Areas_The State has included
the requirements and terms of these sections in Sections 5.A.4.h., 5.A.4.i., and 5.A.4.j., respectively, of the
DRGSW. 
Section 258.16 Closure of Existing MSWLF Units_Delaware has certified that no currently operating landfills
are sited in areas impacting airport safety ( 258.10), floodplains ( 258.11), or unstable areas ( 258.15),
as defined in these sections. 


Subpart C_Operating Criteria 


Section 258.20 Excluding Receipt of Hazardous Waste and  258.26 Run-on/Run-off Control Systems_The
State has amended Sections 5.I.2.l. and 5.F.2. of the DRGSW, to include the respective requirements of these sections.

Section 258.23 Explosive Gas Control_The State has amended Section 5.E.4. of the DRGSW to require the specific
response actions of this section when critical levels of explosive gas are exceeded. 


Subpart D_Design Criteria 


Section 258.40 Design Criteria_The State has adopted EPA's performance standard for landfill design as
specified in  258.40(a)(1), (c) and (d) by amending Section 5.B.2. of the DRGSW to include these requirements.



Subpart E_Groundwater Monitoring and Corrective Action 


Section 258.51 Groundwater Monitoring Systems_The State has adopted EPA's relevant point of compliance
(150 meters), within which the downgradient monitoring wells must be located. Sections 5.G.2.b. and 5.G.4.g. of
the DRGSW includes this requirement. 
Section 258.53 Groundwater Sampling and Analysis Requirements_The State now requires, through amended
DRGSW Section 5.G.3.a., that unfiltered groundwater samples be obtained except where turbidity cannot be controlled
through careful well construction, development, and sampling. In addition, the State has adopted the data evaluation
requirements found in subsections (e), (g), (h) and (i) of this section; these requirements are found in Section 5.G.4.
of the DRGSW. 
Section 258.54 Detection Monitoring_The State has adopted the requirements of this section into Sections
5.G.3.b. and 5.G.3.c. of the DRGSW, including the requirement that the owner/operators sample groundwater at least
semi-annually for Appendix I parameters. Based on the results of groundwater and leachate monitoring, the State
may modify the required list of groundwater monitoring parameters. In addition, the State has amended its regulations
at Section 5.D.4.c. of the DRGSW to require leachate sampling with monthly analyses for indicator parameters and
semi-annual analyses for Appendix II constituents. 
Section 258.55 Assessment Monitoring_The State will proceed directly from Detection Monitoring to Corrective
Measures Assessment. 
Section 258.56 Corrective Measures Assessment_The required list of parameters for groundwater monitoring
was expanded in the corrective measures assessment to include those Appendix II constituents deemed appropriate
from the leachate monitoring data (See Section 5.G.6. of the DRGSW). During the corrective measures process there
will be an opportunity for public input at the time of permit modification. A permit modification is required when
corrective measures are deemed necessary. 
Section 258.57 Selection of Remedy, and  258.58 Implementation of Corrective Action_The State has
adopted into regulation, the requirements of these sections into Section 5.G.8. of the DRGSW. 


Subpart F_Closure And Post-Closure Care 


Section 258.60 Closure Criteria_The State has amended their regulations at Section 5.H.2.b. to require
that a geomembrane cover be used as part of a capping system where a MSWLF has been constructed with a geomembrane liner.



Subpart G_Financial Assurance Criteria

<PARENT> FR940304-2-00028 </PARENT>

Section 258.70 Applicability and Effective Date_The State has amended their regulations to automatically
remove the current financial assurance exemption for the Delaware Solid Waste Authority (DSWA), which currently
manages all of Delaware's municipal solid waste. On April 9, 1995, the DSWA will be subject to the Federal financial
assurance requirements adopted at Section 4.A.6.a. of the DRGSW. 
Section 258.73 Financial Responsibility for Corrective Action_The State has adopted into regulation,
at Sections 4.A.11.f. and 4.A.11.g. of the DRGSW, the requirements of this section. 


C. Decision 


Lacking public comment or opposition to EPA's tentative determination, I conclude that the State of Delaware's application
for adequacy determination meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly,
Delaware is granted a determination of adequacy for all portions of its municipal solid waste permit program. 
Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained
in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal
program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October
9, 1991). 
Today's action takes effect on the date of publication. EPA believes it has good cause under section 553(d) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C 553(d), to put this action into effect less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. All of the requirements and obligations in Delaware's program are currently in effect as a matter of State law. EPA's
action today does not impose any new requirements with which the regulated community must begin to comply, nor do these
requirements become enforceable by EPA as federal law. Consequently, EPA does not find it necessary to give notice
prior to making its approval effective. 


Compliance With Executive Order 12866 


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order
12866. 


Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This notice,
therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. 





Authority:

 This notice is issued under the authority of section 4005 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended; 42 U.S.C. 6946.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of external review draft.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the availability of the external review draft of the ``Guidelines for Reproductive Toxicity
Risk Assessment'' (EPA/600/AP-94/001). In 1988, EPA published separate Proposed Guidelines for Assessing
Male Reproductive Risk (53 FR 24850-24869) and Proposed Guidelines for Assessing Female Reproductive Risk
(53 FR 24834-24847). Following public comment, the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) reviewed the proposed
guidelines and recommended several changes, including combining the two guidelines. These draft guidelines have
been prepared in response to the SAB and public comments and have been updated to reflect current scientific thinking
in this area. In particular, the female component was expanded substantially but the original basic concepts were
retained.



Since a number of changes have been made in this version of the guidelines from the original proposed guidelines, and
due to the time elapsed since the proposals, EPA is asking for review and comment. This notice makes these draft guidelines
available for public comment. Once comments are received, the guidelines will be reviewed by the EPA's Science Advisory
Board before final publication.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

EPA is making available for public comment an external review draft of the Guidelines for Reproductive Toxicity Risk
Assessment. Changes made based on previous public comment and SAB review include combining the separate guidelines
for assessing male and female reproductive risk into a single document, integrating the hazard identification and
dose-response sections, assuming as a default that an agent for which sufficient data are available on only one sex
may also affect reproductive function in the other sex, expansion of the section on interpretation of female endpoints,
and consideration of the benchmark dose approach for quantitative risk assessment.



Members of the public have the opportunity to submit written comments within the 45-day comment period. EPA will consider
all comments received within that period.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from American Institute of Habit
Control, Inc. (hereinafter ``AIHC'') and its President, Steven Present, marketers of the Present Seminar, a single,
two-and-a-half-hour, group hypnosis session program for smoking cessation and weight loss. The Present Seminar
is offered to the public nationwide by Steven Present at hotel locales.

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for the reception of comments by
interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After (60) days,
the Commission will again review the agreement and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make
final the agreement's proposed order.

The Commission's complaint charges that the proposed respondents deceptively advertised: (1) The likelihood of
success in achieving the and maintaining abstinence from smoking cigarettes and weight loss; and (2) the effectiveness
of proposed respondents' smoking cessation methods in leading consumers to abstain from smoking, including the
effectiveness of proposed respondents' programs compared to other smoking cessation programs.



Success



The complaint against AIHC and Steven Present alleges that the proposed respondents made false claims and failed
to possess a reasonable basis for other claims they made regarding the success of their seminar participants in quitting
smoking and achieving and maintaining weight loss.Through advertisements placed in various media in advance of
their seminars, proposed respondents represented that 97 percent of their seminar participants permanently abstain
from smoking after attending those seminars. The complaint alleges that this claim is false.

Proposed respondents further represented through their advertisements that seminar participants: (1) Are cured
of smoking addiction and permanently abstain from smoking cigarettes; (2) are cured of smoking addiction without
experiencing withdrawal, stress or weight gain; and (3) achieve and maintain weight loss.

The Commission believes that these success claims for seminar attendees' smoking cessation, weight loss and maintenance
of achieved weight loss are deceptive because proposed respondents at the time they made the claims did not possess
adequate substantiation for those claims.

The proposed consent order seeks to address the alleged success misrepresentations cited in the accompanying complaint
in three ways. First, the order (Part I.C.) requires proposed respondents to possess a reasonable basis consisting
of competent and reliable scientific evidence substantiating any claim about the performance or efficacy of any
smoking cessation or weight loss program.

Second, the proposed order (Part I.B.) prohibits proposed respondents from representing that 97 percent of their
seminar attendees permanently abstain from smoking after those seminars, unless that is the case.

Finally, the proposed order (Part I.E.) generally prohibits proposed respondents from misrepresenting the performance
or efficacy of any smoking cessation or weight loss program.



Efficacy



The Commission's complaint further alleges that proposed respondents made false claims and failed to possess a reasonable
basis for other claims they made regarding relative ability of their hypnosis program to lead consumers to quit smoking.
AIHC and Steven Present represented through their advertising that the U.S. Surgeon General, in the 1989 U.S. Surgeon
General's Report on Smoking, Reducing the Health Consequences of Smoking; 25 Years of Progress, states that the group
hypnosis method used by respondents is one of the most effective ways to stop smoking. The complaint alleges that this
claim is false, because the cited Report does not state that proposed respondents' hypnosis method is one of the most
effective ways to stop smoking.

Proposed respondents further represented through their advertisements that their single-session, group hypnosis
seminar is more efficacious for smoking cessation than other smoking cessation methods. The Commission believes
that this comparative efficacy claim for proposed respondents' hypnosis program is deceptive because proposed
respondents at the time they made the claim did not possess adequate substantiation for the claim.

To address these efficacy misrepresentations, the proposed order (Part I.A.) prohibits AIHC and Steven Present
from representing that the U.S. Surgeon General, in the 1989 U.S. Surgeon General's Report on Smoking, Reducing the
Health Consequences of Smoking: 25 Years of Progress, states that the group hypnosis method used by respondents is
one of the most effective ways to stop smoking. The proposed order (Part I.D.) further generally prohibits proposed
respondents from misrepresenting the existence, contents, validity, results, conclusions, or interpretations
of any test, study, survey, or report. Finally, the order (Part I.C.) requires proposed respondents to possess and
rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence substantiating any representation about the relative or absolute
performance or efficacy of any smoking cessation or weight loss program, before they make such a claim.

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order, or to modify in any way their terms.

Appendix I_Agreement to Hold Separate




This Agreement to Hold Separate (the ``Agreement'') is by and among Columbia Healthcare Corporation, a corporation
organized, existing and doing business under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Delaware, with its principal
place of business at 201 West Main Street, Louisville, Kentucky 40202, and HCA-Hospital Corporation of America,
a corporation organized, existing and doing business under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Delaware, with
its principal place of business at One Park Plaza, Nashville, Tennessee 37203 (collectively and individually referred
to as ``respondents''); and the Federal Trade Commission (the ``Commission''), an independent agency of the United
States Government, established under the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, 15 U.S.C. 41, 

et seq.

 (collectively, the ``Parties'').

Whereas, on or about October 2, 1993, Columbia Healthcare Corporation entered into an agreement to acquire all of
the voting stock of HCA-Hospital Corporation of America (hereinafter the ``Acquisition''); and

Whereas, the Commission is now investigating the Acquisition to determine if it would violate any of the statutes
enforced by the Commission; and

Whereas, if the Commission accepts the attached Agreement Containing Consent Order (``Consent Order'') which would
require divestiture of HCA Aiken Regional Medical Center (``ARMC'') in Aiken, South Carolina, the Commission must
place the Consent Order on the public record for a period of at least sixty (60) days and may subsequently withdraw such
acceptance pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.34 of the Commission's Rules; and

Whereas, the Commission is concerned that if an understanding is not reached, preserving the 

status quo ante

 of the assets and businesses of ARMC during the period prior to the issuance of the Consent Order by the Commission (after
the 60-day public notice period), divestiture resulting from any proceeding challenging the legality of the Acquisition
might not be possible, or might be less than an effective remedy; and

Whereas, the Commission is concerned that if the Acquisition is consummated, it will be necessary to preserve the
Commission's ability to require the divestiture of ARMC as described in Paragraph II of the Consent Order, and the
Commission's right to seek to restore ARMC as a viable independent acute care hospital; and

Whereas, the purpose of this Agreement and the Consent Order is to:

(i) Preserve ARMC as a viable independent acute care hospital pending its divestiture, and

(ii) Remedy any anticompetitive effects of the Acquisition; and

Whereas, respondents' entering into this Agreement shall in no way be construed as an admission by respondents that
the Acquisition is illegal; and

Whereas, respondents understand that no act or transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed immune
or exempt from the provisions of the antitrust laws or the Federal Trade Commission Act by reason of anything contained
in this Agreement.

Now, therefore, the parties agree, upon understanding that the Commission has not yet determined whether the Acquisition
will be challenged, and in consideration of the Commission's agreement that, unless the Commission determines to
reject the Consent Order, it will not seek further relief from respondents with respect to the Acquisition, except
that the Commission may exercise any and all rights to enforce this Agreement and the Consent Order to which it is annexed
and made a part thereof, and in the event the required divestiture is not accomplished, to seek divestiture of ARMC
as held separate pursuant to this Agreement, as follows:




1. Respondents agree to execute and be bound by the attached Consent Order.

2. Respondents agree that from the date this Agreement is accepted until the earliest of the dates listed in subparagraphs
2.a-2.c, they will comply with the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Agreement.

a. Three business days after the Commission withdraws its acceptance of the Consent Order pursuant to the provisions
of Section 2.34 of the Commission's Rules;

b. 120 days after publication in the Federal Register of the Consent Order, unless by that date the Commission has issued
such Order; or

c. The day after the divestiture required by the Consent Order has been completed.

3. Respondents will hold the assets and businesses of ARMC as they are presently constituted separate and apart on
the following terms and conditions:

a. ARMC, as it is presently constituted, shall be held separate and apart and shall be operated independent of respondents
(meaning here and hereinafter, respondents excluding ARMC) except to the extent that respondents must exercise
direction and control over ARMC to assure compliance with this Agreement.

b. Respondents shall not exercise direction or control over, or influence directly or indirectly, ARMC or any of its
operations or businesses; provided, however, that respondents may exercise only such direction and control over
ARMC as is necessary to assure compliance with this Agreement.

c. Respondents shall maintain the viability and marketability of ARMC and shall not sell, transfer, encumber (other
than in the normal course of business), or otherwise impair its marketability or viability. 

d. Except for the single respondent director, officer, employee, or agent serving on the ``New Board'' or ``Management
Committee'' (as defined in subparagraph 3..h), respondents shall not permit any director, officer, employee, or
agent of respondents to also be a director, officer or employee of ARMC. 

e. Except as required by law, and except to the extent that necessary information is exchanged in the course of evaluating
the Acquisition, defending investigations or litigation, or negotiating agreements to dispose of assets, respondents
shall not receive or have access to, or use or continue to use, any ``material confidential information'' of ARMC not
in the public domain. Any such information that is obtained pursuant to this subparagraph shall only be used for the
purpose set out in this subparagraph. (``Material confidential information,'' as used herein, means competitively
sensitive or proprietary information not independently known to respondents from sources other than ARMC, and includes
but is not limited to customer lists, price lists, marketing methods, patents, technologies, processes, or other
trade secrets.)

f. Respondents shall not change the composition of the management of ARMC except that the directors or members serving
on the New Board or Management Committee of ARMC (as defined in subparagraph 3.h) shall have the power to remove employees
for cause. 

g. All material transactions, out of the ordinary course of business and not precluded by subparagraphs 3.a-3.f
hereof, shall be subject to a majority vote of the New Board or Management Committee (as defined in subparagraphs 3.h).


h. Respondents shall either separately incorporate ARMC and adopt new Articles of Incorporation and By-laws that
are not inconsistent with other provisions of this Agreement or establish separate business ventures with articles
of agreement covering the conduct of ARMC in accordance with this Agreement. Respondents shall also elect a new three
person board of directors (``New Board'') or Management Committee (``Management Commenttee'') of ARMC. Respondents
may elect the directors to the New Board or select the members of the Management Committee; provided, however, that
such New Board or Management Committee shall include no more than one respondent director, officer, employee, or
agent. Except as permitted by this Agreement, the director of the New Board or member of the Management Committee who
is also a respondent director, officer, employee or agent, shall not receive in his or her capacity as a New Board director
or Management Committee member material confidential information and shall not disclose any such information received
under this Agreement to respondents or use it to obtain any advantage for respondents. Said director of the New Board
or member of the Management Committee who is also a respondent director, officer, employee or agent, shall enter a
confidentiality agreement prohibiting disclosure of material confidential information (as that term is defined
in subparagraph 3.e). Such New Board director or Management Committee member shall participate in matters which
come before the New Board or Management Committee only for the limited purpose of considering a capital investment
or other transaction exceeding $1,000,000 and carrying out respondents' responsibility to assure that ARMC is maintained
in such manner as will permit its divestiture as an ongoing, viable acute care hospital. Except as permitted by this
Agreement, such New Board director or Management Committee member shall not participate in any matter, or attempt
to influence the votes of the other directors or Management Committee members with respect to matters, that would
involve a conflict of interest if respondents and ARMC were separate and independent entities. Meetings of the New
Board or Management Committee during the term of this Agreement shall be stenographically transcribed and the transcripts
retained for two (2) years after the termination of this Agreement. 

i. All earnings and profits of ARMC shall be retained separately in ARMC. If necessary, respondents shall provide
ARMC with sufficient working capital to operate at its current rate of operation, and to carry out any capital improvement
plans for ARMC which have already been approved. 

j. Should the Federal Trade Commission seek in any proceeding to compel respondents (meaning here and hereinafter
respondents including ARMC) to divest ARMC, or to seek any other injunctive or equitable relief, respondents shall
not raise any objection based upon the expiration of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
waiting period or the fact that the Commission has permitted the Acquisition. Respondents also waive all rights to
contest the validity of this Agreement. 

4. For the purpose of determining or securing compliance with this Agreement, subject to any legally recognized privilege,
and upon written request with reasonable notice to respondents made to their principal officer, respondents shall
permit any duly authorized representative or representatives of the Commission:

officers or employees of respondents, who may have counsel present, regarding any such matters.

5. This agreement shall not be binding until approved by the Commission.




Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted, subject to final approval, and agreement to a proposed consent order from
Columbia Healthcare Corporation (``Columbia'') and HCA-Hospital Corporation of America (``HCA''). The agreement
would settle charges by the Federal Trade Commission that Columbia's proposed acquisition of 100 percent of the voting
stock of HCA would have violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act if it had
been carried out.

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or issue and serve the agreement's proposed order.

Both Columbia and HCA (the ``respondents'') own and operate acute care hospitals in various states, including acute
care hospitals in a three-county urban area that includes the cities of Augusta, Georgia, and Aiken, South Carolina
(``Augusta-Aiken''). The complaint accompanying the proposed consent order concerns the proposed acquisition's
impact upon competition for acute care hospital services in Augusta-Aiken. According to the complaint, Columbia
owns and operates Augusta Regional Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia. HCA owns and operates HCA Aiken Regional Medical
Center, located about 15 miles northeast of Augusta, Georgia in Aiken, South Carolina.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940304-2-00053 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940304-2-00034 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The consent order would, if finally accepted by the Commission, settle charges that the acquisition may substantially
lessen competition in the Augusta-Aiken hospital market. The complaint alleges that Columbia and HCA are competitors
in the market for acute care hospital services in Augusta-Aiken. The Augusta-Aiken hospital market, according to
the complaint, was already highly concentrated, and entry by new competitors would be difficult. The complaint alleges
that the Commission has reason to believe that the acquisition would have anticompetitive effects in the Augusta-Aiken
hospital market, in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, unless
an effective remedy eliminates such anticompetitive effects.

The order accepted for public comment contains provisions requiring the divestiture of HCA Aiken Regional Medical
Center in Aiken, South Carolina. The purpose of the divestiture is to ensure the continuation of HCA Aiken Regional
Medical Center as an ongoing, viable acute care hospital independent of Columbia, and to remedy the lessening of competition
in the Augusta-Aiken hospital market resulting from the acquisition.

The proposed order allows the respondents to divest HCA Aiken Regional medical Center to one or more acquirers with
the prior approval of the Commission. Under the terms of the order, the required divestiture would be completed within
twelve months of the date the order becomes final. If the required divestiture were not completed within the twelve-month
period, the respondents would consent to the appointment of a trustee, who would have eighteen additional months
to effect the divestiture. The hold separate agreement executed as part of the consent order requires the respondents,
until the completion of the divestiture or as otherwise specified, to hold separate and preserve all of the assets
and businesses of HCA Aiken Regional Medical Center.

The proposed order provides that approval by the Commission of the divestiture shall be conditioned upon the agreement
by the acquirer that, for ten years from the date of the divestiture, it will not sell, without the prior approval of
the Commission, HCA Aiken Regional Medical Center to another person operating (or in the process of acquiring) any
other acute care hospital in the area.

The order would prohibit the respondents from acquiring any acute care hospital in Augusta-Aiken without the prior
approval of the Federal Trade Commission. It would also prohibit the respondents from transferring, without prior
Commission approval, any acute care hospital they operate in Augusta-Aiken to another person operating (or in the
process of acquiring) an acute care hospital in the area. These provisions, in combination, would give the Commission
authority to prohibit any substantial combination of the acute care hospital operations of the respondents with
those of any other acute care hospital in Augusta-Aiken, unless the respondents convinced the Commission that a particular
transaction would not endanger competition in the Augusta-Aiken hospital market. The provisions would not apply
to acquisitions or sales where the value of the transferred assets is $1 million or less, and the provisions would expire
ten years after the order becomes final.

For ten years, the order would prohibit the respondents from transferring all or any substantial part of any hospital
in Augusta-Aiken to a non-respondent without first filing with the Commission an agreement by the transferee to be
bound by the order.

The purpose of this analysis is to invite public comment concerning the proposed order, to assist the Commission in
its determination whether to make the order final. This analysis is not intended to constitute an official interpretation
of the agreement and order or to modify their terms in any way.

The agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by the respondents that their proposed
acquisition would have violated the law, as alleged in the Commission's compliant.

Statement of Commissioner Mary L. Azcuenaga Concurring in Part and Dissenting in Part Columbia Healthcare Corp./HCA



Having reason to believe that the Columbia Healthcare Corporation's acquisition of HCA-Hospital Corporation of
America may substantially lessen competition in the Augusta, Georgia-Aiken, South Carolina market, I concur in
the decision to require divestiture of the Aiken Regional Medical Center. I dissent from the decision not to challenge
the transaction with respect to the Chattanooga, Tennessee market.

In Chattanooga, the merger will combine HCA's Parkridge Medical Center and Columbia's East Ridge Hospital in an already
highly concentrated market. In 1985, after a full administrative hearing, the Commission ordered HCA to divest certain
assets, including North Park Hospital, which has considerable similarity to East Ridge. Hospital Corporation of
America, 106 F.T.C. 361, aff'd, 807 F.2d 1381 (7th Cir. 1986). Although some characteristics of the Chattanooga hospital
market may have changed since 1985, I am not persuaded that the competitive situation is so fundamentally different
to justify abandonment of the Commission's earlier position.



Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Deborah K. Owen In the Matter of Columbia Healthcare Corporation, 

et al.



The Commission is today issuing for public comment a proposed consent agreement in connection with the merger of two
of the nation's largest hospital chains, Columbia Healthcare Corporation (``Columbia'') and HCA-Hospital Corporation
of America (``HCA''). The proposed consent agreement permits the merger to go forward, but requires the combined
firm to divest one of its two hospitals in the Augusta, Georgia/Aiken, South Carolina area. I dissent from the decision
to accept this consent agreement, principally because I do not find reason to believe that, after the merger, anticompetitive
effects are likely in that geographic market.

I cannot, however, conclude with reasonable confidence that the proposed merger has no anticompetitive effects
in any hospital market across the country. There is evidence (although incomplete) that in one market, the consolidation
of the Columbia and HCA hospitals may create a monopoly that could injure consumers.

In that matter, one of the hospitals satisfies the statistical criteria for the hospital merger ``safety zone'' as
set forth in the Statements of Enforcement Policy in the Health Care Area, adopted in September 1993 by the Department
of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (over my dissent).
 Based on its size alone, the acquisition of this hospital has been declared by the federal enforcement agencies to
be immune from antitrust review.







This is not to suggest that the Commission is indifferent to the monopolization of all hospital markets. Last week,
the Commission voted unanimously to authorize staff to file a preliminary injunction to prevent the merger to monopoly
of the only two acute care hospitals in Pueblo, Colorado.
 In Pueblo, the requirements of the hospital merger ``safety zone'' were not satisfied, so a full investigation and
analysis of the likely competitive effects of the merger were undertaken, in accordance with the 1992 Horizontal
Merger Guidelines.
 In such a traditional analysis, the Commission considers whether the merging hospitals are economically viable,
whether significant efficiencies may be achieved by combining the hospitals, whether these efficiencies are merger-specific,
and whether cost savings are likely to be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices or higher quality. Most critically,
whether the anticipated efficiency benefits outweigh the substantial anticompetitive risks associated with the
creation of a monopoly is also evaluated. Under a Guidelines analysis, the Commission's action in the Pueblo merger
suggests a conclusion that the likely anticompetitive effects outweigh the possible efficiencies stemming from
the merger.







The Commission did not, however, conduct a thorough investigation of the market in which the merger of Columbia and
HCA may have created a monopoly. The Commission abandoned its traditional approach to merger analysis upon determining
that the HCA hospital falls within the ``antitrust safety zone.''

In sum, the Antitrust Enforcement Policy Statements in the Health Care Area may have claimed their first casualty.
Perhaps a full investigation would have demonstrated that the merger, though creating a monopoly, posed no anticompetitive
problem. But we will never know at the level of confidence that consumers have a right to expect of us. I therefore dissent.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement, subject to final approval, to a proposed consent order from
respondents Sonic Technology Products, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and W. Lowell Robertson and Brian Phillip Jobe,
individually and as officers of the corporation.

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action or make final the agreement's proposed order.

This matter concerns the labeling and advertising of the PestChaser, a plug-in device that is designed to emit sound
in ultrasonic frequencies, 

i.e., 

frequencies inaudible to the human ear. The Commission's complaint charges that respondents' advertising contained
false and unsubstantiated representations concerning the PestChaser's alleged ability to affect rodents and fleas.
Specifically, the complaint alleges that respondents falsely claimed that the PestChaser: (1) Eliminates rodent
infestations; and (2) eliminates or reduces flea infestations, or repels fleas.

The complaint further alleges that respondents falsely represented that competent and reliable scientific tests
have established that the above efficacy claims are true. The complaint also alleges that respondents lacked substantive
for the claim that the PestChaser, when used in conjunction with other pest control methods, such as traps and poisons,
will increase the effectiveness of the user's efforts to eliminate or reduce infestations of rodents or other pests.

The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent respondents
from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future.

Part I of the proposed order prohibits respondents from claiming that their ultrasonic pest control devices can or
will: (1) Eliminate infestations of rodents; (2) eliminate or reduce infestations of fleas; or (3) repel fleas.

Part II of the proposed order prohibits respondents from misrepresenting the existence, validity, results, conclusions,
interpretations or purpose of any test, study or other scientific data.

Part III of the proposed order requires respondents to possess competent and reliable scientific evidence for: (1)
any claim that any ultrasonic pest control device will increase or assist the effectiveness of a user's efforts to
eliminate or reduce infestations of rodents or other pests when the device is used in conjunction with other pest control
methods; or (2) any representation referring or relating to the performance or efficacy of any ultrasonic pest control
device. Part III further provides that, notwithstanding this requirement, respondents may truthfully represent,
by use of the words ``Registered in Canada,'' that the Canadian Department of Agriculture has registered their ultrasonic
pest control device, and permitted the sale of such device in Canada.

The proposed order also requires respondents to maintain materials relied upon to substantiate claims covered by
the order, to notify the Commission of any changes in corporate structure that might affect compliance with the order,
and to notify the Commission of certain changes in the business or employment of the named individual respondents.

The proposed order also requires respondents to distribute copies of the order to any catalog company with whom respondents
have done business since January 1, 1992, to present and future resellers of their ultrasonic pest control devices,
and to their managerial employees and salespeople. Respondents must also file one or more reports detailing compliance
with the order.

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

Medical Devices; Reclassification of the Daily Wear Soft and Daily Wear Nonhydrophilic Plastic Contact Lenses;
Premarket Notification (510(k)) Guidance Document for Daily Wear Contact Lenses; Availability


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order reclassifying daily wear soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic
plastic contact lenses from class III (premarket approval) into class II (special controls). This reclassification
is required by the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (the SMDA). This reclassification only applies to daily wear soft
and daily wear nonhydrophilic contact lenses. Lenses intended for extended wear will remain in class III, as will
contact lens accessories. The SMDA also requires FDA to put into place any regulatory safeguards that are necessary
to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the reclassified lenses. Thus, FDA is announcing
the availability of a guidance document entitled ``Premarket Notification (510(k)) Guidance Document for Daily
Wear Contact Lenses.'' The guidance sets forth the evidence that should be submitted to FDA to demonstrate the substantial
equivalence of new daily wear soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lenses to lenses already marketed.
Elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, FDA is publishing a final rule to codify the reclassification of the daily wear contact lens from class III (premarket
approval) into class II (special controls).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



I. The Statutory Requirements


The SMDA (Pub. L. 101-629), which amended the medical device provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321-394) contained specific provisions on transitional devices (i.e., those devices
regulated as drugs before the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (Pub. L. 94-295) became law) (see section 520(l)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 360j(l))). In 1976, Congress classified all transitional products, including daily wear soft
and daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lenses, into class III (premarket approval). Essentially the SMDA,
reflecting congressional concern that many transitional devices were being over regulated in class III, directed
FDA to collect certain safety and effectiveness information from the manufacturers of transitional devices and
review the classifications of those transitional devices that still remained in class III to determine if the devices
could be down classified to class II (special controls) or class I (general controls).
Under section 520(l)(5)(B) of the act, FDA was to publish regulations by December 1, 1992, either leaving the transitional
class III devices in class III or revising their classifications down to class I or class II. However, as permitted
by section 520(l)(5)(c) of the act, the agency, in the 

Federal Register

 of November 30, 1992 (57 FR 56586), published a notice extending the period for issuing such regulations until December
1, 1993.
With respect to the reclassification of daily wear soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lenses, however,
the SMDA makes further provision. Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the SMDA provides that notwithstanding the provisions for
reclassification of other transitional devices, FDA shall not retain daily wear soft or daily wear nonhydrophilic
plastic contact lenses in class III unless the agency determines that the devices meet the statutory criteria for
a class III device. Moreover, if FDA has not determined that these contact lenses must remain in class III and published
its finding by November 28, 1993, in the 

Federal Register

, then under section 4(b)(3)(D) of the SMDA, FDA ``shall issue an order placing the lenses in class II.''
Both the language and legislative history of the SMDA make it clear that the reclassification of daily wear soft and
daily wear nonhydrophilic contact lenses shall occur as a matter of law unless FDA published a finding that the devices
should remain in class III. FDA has not made such a finding: FDA believes that the safety and effectiveness of daily
wear soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lenses can be ensured through specified ``special controls''
as authorized by the SMDA. Therefore, the agency has not made and published any finding that daily wear soft and daily
wear nonhydrophilic contact lenses must remain in class III. 


II. Order


Therefore, as required by section 4(b)(3)(D) of the SMDA, FDA is issuing this order to all manufacturers of daily wear
soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic contact lenses reclassifying their devices from class III (premarket approval)
into class II (special controls). The devices being reclassified are contact lenses intended for daily wear that
meet the following descriptions:


Rigid Gas Permeable Contact Lens

. A rigid gas permeable contact lens is a device intended to be worn directly against the cornea of the eye to correct
vision conditions. The device is made of various materials, such as cellulose acetate butyrate, polyacrylate-silicone,
or silicone elastomers, whose main polymer molecules generally do not absorb or attract water.


Soft (Hydrophilic) Contact Lens

. A soft (hydrophilic) contact lens is a device intended to be worn directly against the cornea and adjacent limbal
and scleral areas of the eye to correct vision conditions or to act as a therapeutic bandage. The device is made of various
polymer materials, the main polymer molecules of which absorb or attract a certain volume (percentage) of water.


III. Guidance


In addition to issuing this order as required by the SMDA, FDA is issuing a guidance document for premarket notifications
for the reclassified contact lenses entitled, ``Premarket Notification (510(k)) Guidance Document for Daily Wear
Contact Lenses.'' This guidance sets forth the special controls that FDA has determined are needed to ensure the safety
and effectiveness of daily wear plastic contact lenses. It also provides comprehensive directions to enable a manufacturer
of a daily wear soft or daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lens to submit a 510(k) premarket notification demonstrating
substantial equivalence of the device to a legally marketed daily wear plastic contact lens (predicate device).
Information on the battery of preclinical testing necessary to demonstrate substantial equivalence is included
in the guidance. If the results of preclinical testing demonstrate the device to have new characteristics, clinical
performance data may be needed to establish substantial equivalence. If clinical performance data are needed, the
guidance document provides suggested methodologies (e.g., size and scope of the study) to be included in an investigational
protocol.
The preclinical portion of the guidance document consists of manufacturing and chemistry, toxicology and microbiology
sections outlining the type of testing that should be completed. Each section includes a summary of the basic requirements
and suggested methods for meeting these requirements. Other elements of the guidance document include: (1) General
information on the regulations and requirements for labeling contact lenses; (2) requirements that must be met prior
to modifying a marketed contact lens; (3) suggested methodologies for meeting color additive requirements; (4)
procedures for adding lens finishing laboratories for manufacturing and marketing of class II rigid gas permeable
contact lenses; and (5) the procedure for implementing changes in packaging materials.
In the event that clinical trials are necessary, FDA emphasizes that manufacturers must conduct the trials in accordance
with the Investigational Device Exemption regulations in 21 CFR part 812. At this time, FDA considers clinical studies
of daily wear soft or daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lenses to be nonsignificant risk investigations.
FDA considers clinical studies of extended wear contact lenses to be significant risk investigations. Thus, for
daily wear soft or daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lenses, an institutional review board (IRB) approval
is always necessary before initiating a clinical study, and an investigational plan and informed consent document
must be presented to an IRB for review and approval. For extended wear contact lenses, the manufacturer must obtain
both IRB and FDA approvals in accordance with 21 CFR part 812 before clinical testing can be initiated.
 This guidance document will be discussed at the next meeting of the Ophthalmic Devices Panel of the Medical Devices
Advisory Committee. The date, time, and place of this meeting will be announced in a future issue of the 

Federal Register

.


IV. Transition Phase for Pending PMA's for Daily Wear Contact Lenses


Below, FDA discusses how it will deal with the pending original and supplemental PMA's involving daily wear soft or
daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lenses currently filed with the agency. As of today's date, all pending
PMA applications will need to be examined to identify: (1) Those that are no longer subject to PMA review and can be converted
to 510(k)'s or withdrawn and resubmitted to FDA by the applicant to be evaluated through the 510(k) process; and (2)
those which can be withdrawn by the applicant and are required to be resubmitted and evaluated as a 510(k) prior to implementing
the request. FDA will make all final decisions on converted PMA's based on 510(k) regulatory requirements as elaborated
in the ``Premarket Notification (510(k)) Guidance Document for Daily Wear Contact Lenses.''
To ensure expeditious conversions, sponsors should review their pending PMA's and advise the agency as to what administrative
action the sponsor believes needs to be taken regarding their pending applications affected by the automatic reclassification.
FDA is suspending the review of each pending original and supplemental PMA affected in whole or in part by this reclassification
order until the respective sponsor amends its application setting forth the status of the devices and the administrative
actions requested to be taken regarding its application.
These administrative actions can include the following:
(1) For a pending PMA that involves only contact lenses covered by this reclassification, the sponsor may ask that
its PMA application be converted, in total, to a 510(k) application.
The amendment to the PMA should include all of the necessary content requirements for a 510(k), thus making the application
as complete as possible when it is converted to a 510(k). For example, if an applicant has a pending PMA supplement for
a modification to a previously approved daily wear contact lens, and if this modification has been identified in the
``Premarket Notification (510(k)) Guidance Document for Daily Wear Contact Lenses'' as a change requiring submission
of a 510(k), the applicant can amend this PMA with a request to convert it into a 510(k). PMA's converted to 510(k)'s
under this order will retain their position in the review queue (if they are complete), and the review process will
continue without further delay.
(2) For a pending PMA that involves both lenses that are covered by this reclassification and those that are not, the
applicant should withdraw the portion of the application that addresses the reclassified lenses and resubmit it
as a 510(k) application.
For example, if a pending PMA contains a request for a new or modified lens material for both a daily and extended wear
contact lens, the applicant should withdraw the request for the daily wear lens and ask the agency to proceed with the
review of that portion of the PMA involving the extended wear contact lens only. Pending PMA's that must, in part, be
resubmitted as a 510(k) application will retain their position in the review queue if the applicant responds with
the appropriate amendment and clearly states in the amendment that the daily wear contact lens portion of the PMA will
be resubmitted as a 510(k) application.
Whichever option applies, the applicant should determine whether the previous request involving the daily wear
contact lens must be resubmitted and evaluated through the 510(k) process or be implemented without the need for submission
of a 510(k). To make this determination, the applicant should consult the 510(k) procedures (21 CFR part 807) and the
``Premarket Notification (510(k)) Guidance Document for Daily Wear Contact Lenses.'' If the applicant determines
that a 510(k) application is required, the sponsor should resubmit the application following the content and format
requirements for 510(k) applications. The agency notes that preclinical and clinical data formerly required in
the PMA may still be necessary to support a substantial equivalence determination. Preclinical and clinical data
which is also contained in a pending PMA may be incorporated by reference in a 510(k) application. The applicant should
include in the amendment the claim of substantial equivalence to their previously approved daily wear contact lens
and a summary of the safety and effectiveness information or a statement that the applicant will make the safety and
effectiveness information available to interested persons upon request. 
In addition, sponsors should determine if there is information in the pending PMA that would not be needed when resubmitted
as a 510(k) application. In making this determination, FDA cautions sponsors to review the regulations pertaining
to releasability of information in PMA's and 510(k) applications before simply converting PMA's to 510(k) applications
since the disclosure regulations may treat information in the applications differently. For this reason, a manufacturer
may choose not to have the pending PMA converted to a 510(k) application, but instead choose to withdraw the pending
application, purge it of unnecessary information that the sponsor might not want released, and resubmit the relevant
data in a new 510(k) application.
If an applicant fails to submit an amendment as outlined above within 180 days, FDA will consider the pending PMA or
PMA supplement to be voluntarily withdrawn. In such cases, the agency will notify the applicant by letter of the withdrawal.
All amendments to pending PMA's shall include the PMA or PMA supplement number and shall be addressed to the PMA Document
Mail Center (address above).
Additional questions regarding the administrative procedures resulting from this reclassification order should
be directed to the PMA Staff (Kathy Lundsten, 301-594-2186), or to the Division of Ophthalmic Devices,
Contact Lens Branch (David M. Whipple, 301-594-2205, or James F. Saviola, 301-594-1744).

Notice.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Health and Human Services notifies Federal agencies of the laboratories currently certified to
meet standards of Subpart C of Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (53 FR 11979, 11986).
A similar notice listing all currently certified laboratories will be published during the first week of each month,
and updated to include laboratories which subsequently apply for and complete the certification process. If any
listed laboratory's certification is totally 
suspended or revoked, the laboratory will be omitted from updated lists until such time as it is restored to full certification
under the Guidelines. 


If any laboratory has withdrawn from the National Laboratory Certification Program during the past month, it will
be identified as such at the end of the current list of certified laboratories, and will be omitted from the monthly
listing thereafter. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing were developed in accordance with 
Executive Order 12564 and section 503 of Public Law 100-71. Subpart C of the Guidelines, ``Certification of
Laboratories Engaged in Urine Drug Testing for Federal Agencies,'' sets strict standards which laboratories must
meet in order to conduct urine drug testing for Federal agencies. To become certified an applicant laboratory must
undergo three rounds of performance testing plus an on-site inspection. To maintain that certification a laboratory
must participate in an every-other-month performance testing program plus periodic, on-site inspections. 


Laboratories which claim to be in the applicant stage of certification are not to be considered as 
meeting the minimum requirements expressed in the HHS Guidelines. A laboratory must have its letter 
of certification from SAMHSA, HHS (formerly: HHS/NIDA) which attests that it has met minimum 
standards. 
In accordance with subpart C of the Guidelines, the following laboratories meet the minimum standards set forth in
the Guidelines:

Federal Property Suitable as Facilities To Assist the Homeless



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, HUD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice identifies unutilized, underutilized, excess, and surplus Federal property reviewed by HUD for suitability
for possible use to assist the homeless.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



 In accordance with 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991) and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42
U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property that
HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information provided
to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property controlled
by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property. This Notice is also published
in order to comply with the December 12, 1988 Court Order in 

National Coalition for the Homeless

 v. 

Veterans Administration,

 No. 88-2503-OG (D.D.C.)




Properties reviewed are listed in this Notice according to the following categories: Suitable/available, suitable/unavailable,
suitable/to be excess, and unsuitable. The properties listed in the three suitable categories have been reviewed
by the landholding agencies, and each agency has transmitted to HUD: (1) Its intention to make the property available
for use to assist the homeless, (2) its intention to declare the property excess to the agency's needs, or (3) a statement
of the reasons that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use as facilities to assist the homeless.



Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from
the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression
of interest to HHS, addressed to Judy Breitman, Division of Health Facilities Planning, U.S. Public Health Service,
HHS, room 17A-10, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443-2265. (This is not a toll-free number.)
HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the
application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their
written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications,
the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991).


For properties listed as suitable/to be excess, that property may, if subsequently accepted as excess by GSA, be made
available for use by the homeless in accordance with applicable law, subject to screening for other Federal use. At
the appropriate time, HUD will publish the property in a Notice showing it as either suitable/available or suitable/unavailable.

For properties listed as suitable/unavailable, the landholding agency has decided that the property cannot be declared
excess or made available for use to assist the homeless, and the property will not be available.

Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this Notice.
Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the
toll free information line at 1-800-927-7588 for detailed instructions or write a letter to Mark
Johnston at the address listed at the beginning of this Notice. Included in the request for review should be the property
address (including zip code), the date of publication in the 

Federal Register,

 the landholding agency, and the property number.

For more information regarding particular properties identified in this Notice (

i.e.,

 acreage, floor plan, existing sanitary facilities, exact street address), providers should contact the appropriate
landholding agencies at the following addresses: U.S. Navy: John J. Kane, Deputy Division Director, Dept. of Navy,
Real Estate Operations, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria, VA 22332-2300;
(703) 325-0474; (This is not a toll-free number).

<DOCTITLE>Intent To Amend the Northeast Resource Management Plan</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Land Management, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

The Bureau of Land Management, Ca&ntilde;on City District as a cooperating agency with the U.S. Forest Service has
prepared an environmental impact statement (EIS) for developing a management strategy on mountain plover. The EIS
strategy deals primarily with lands within the Pawnee National Grassland Administrative Boundary. BLM is considering
using information from the EIS to make decisions on lands outside the Administrative boundary for oil and gas leasing.
Such a decision would be considered an amendment of the Northeast Resource Management Plan, and is in accordance with
the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) and 43 CFR part 1600.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The EIS analyzed different management strategies for the protection of mountain plover. The mountain plover has
been nominated for listing as a threatened species under the Threatened and Endangered Species Act of 1973 as amended
in 1982. The EIS provides new information for making oil and gas decisions on Federal mineral estate within areas considered
to be important nesting and summer habitat of the mountain plover. Information in the EIS will be extended to cover
lands with BLM-administered mineral estate, beyond the U.S. Forest Service boundaries, that meet the criteria defined
in the EIS as mountain plover stronghold habitat. Stipulations for oil and gas leases on these lands will restrict
oil and gas drilling and development activities during the period of April 10 to July 10. Because surface ownership
of these lands is private, and the surface is subject to manipulation beyond the authority of the Bureau, a waiver will
be considered for each lease stipulated for mountain plover protection at the time of application for development.
The waiver will be granted if the lands have been rendered unsuitable habitat for plovers because of surface use by
the private landowner. A waiver of the mountain plover stipulation does not affect any other existing protection
stipulation that may apply to these lands.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Plan monitoring information and the EIS indicate a need for this action to protect mountain plovers. Implementation
of this decision is consistent with the Bureau goals of biological diversity and ecosystem management. BLM will work
with private landowners, local, state, and Federal government agencies, and other land managers to protect the mountain
plover. 




The area covered by this plan amendment will include all BLM managed lands within Adams, Larimer, Logan, Morgan, Washington
and Weld counties in the State of Colorado.

Public notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Public notice is hereby given that the National Park Service proposes to award a concession contract authorizing
the development and operation of a new marina and related facilities and services for the public at Crescent Bay on
Lake Roosevelt at Coulee Dam National Recreation Area, for a period of 15 years from July 1, 1994, through June 30, 2009.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



This proposed contract requires/authorizes a construction and improvement program. The proposed development
was previously addressed in the Environmental Assessment for the park's General Management Plan approved in May,
1980. An Environmental Assessment describing alternatives for developing a marina at Crescent Bay, Coulee Dam National
Recreation Area was released in December, 1984. A subsequent Environmental Assessment (approved June 1988) augmented
the existing Environmental Assessment for the General Management Plan by analyzing the effects of rental boats on
Lake Roosevelt. Additional environmental documents, if required, will be the responsibility of the concessioner.




The Secretary will consider and evaluate all proposals received as a result of this notice. Proposals must be received
by the Superintendent not later than on the one hundred and twentieth (120th) day following publication of this notice
to be considered and evaluated.

<DOCTITLE>Availability of Draft Wild and Scenic River Eligibility Report and Environmental Assessment for the Upper Klamath
River, OR</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Park Service, USDOI.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Publication of draft report and environmental assessment for public comment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Park Service is publishing for public review and comment a draft study report and environmental assessment
on designating the upper Klamath River, Oregon, into the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The National Park
Service has found that the upper Klamath River is eligible for the national system and is recommending as the preferred
alternative that the river be designated.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On April 22 of 1993, Earth Day, Oregon Governor Barbara Roberts petitioned the Secretary of the Interior to add an 11-mile
reach of the upper Klamath River to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The section of river under consideration
extends from the John C. Boyle Hydroelectric Powerhouse (river mile 220.3) downstream to the Oregon-California
border (river mile 209.3). Under section 2(a)(ii) of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (P.L. 90-542, as
amended), the Secretary has the authority to add a river to the national system at the request of a state provided the
state has met certain conditions and the river meets eligibility criteria. These preconditions are:



(1) The river is already designated into a state river protection system.

(2) The state has the ability to manage the river at no cost to the federal government, except for those lands already
in federal ownership.

(3) The river has resources of regional or national significance and is free-flowing as defined by the Departments
of the Interior and Agriculture.

(4) The state has adequate mechanisms in place to protect the resources for which the river is eligible in the first
place.

Upon the request of a state governor to the Secretary, the National Park Service, acting for the Secretary, undertakes
an evaluation of the state's request. The National Park Service requested the assistance of the Bureau of Land Management
in the preparation of the report and environmental assessment. This was done for two reasons: (1) The Bureau manages
75% of the area under consideration and (2) the Bureau has conducted two previous assessments of the river_one for
a congressionally authorized wild and scenic river study, and one as part of its normal resource management planning
process. The Bureau of Land Management agreed to act as a cooperator in the preparation of the assessment.

As a result of the evaluation, the National Park Service has concluded that the state of Oregon has met all requirements
to include the upper Klamath River in the national system and the river itself meets all eligibility criteria. The
National Park Service is recommending as the preferred alternative that the Secretary designate the upper Klamath
as a National Scenic River.

<USBUREAU>Employment Standards Administration Wage and Hour Division</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions</DOCTITLE>




General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.


The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.


Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.


General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.


Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

<DOCTITLE>Determinations Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA Transitional Adjustment
Assistance </DOCTITLE>

 

In accordance with section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Labor herein presents summaries
of determinations regarding eligibility to apply for trade adjustment assistance for workers (TA-W) issued
during the period of February, 1994. 

 In order for an affirmative determination to be made and a certification of eligibility to apply for worker adjustment
assistance to be issued, each of the group eligibility requirements of section 222 of the Act must be met: 

 (1) That a significant number or proportion of the workers in the workers' firm, or an appropriate subdivision thereof,
have become totally or partially separated, 

 (2) That sales or production, or both, of the firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely, and 

 (3) That increases of imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by the firm or appropriate
subdivision have contributed importantly to the separations, or threat thereof, and to the absolute decline in sales
or production. 

 

Negative Determinations for Worker Adjustment Assistance 

 

In each of the following cases the investigation revealed that criterion (3) has not been met. A survey of customers
indicated that increased imports did not contribute importantly to worker separations at the firm.

specified.

The workers' firm does not produce an article as required for certification under section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974.


 

TA-W-29,336; Willamette Industrial Forms Div., Beaverton, OR 

 

Layoffs at the subject firm are attributable to a corporate decision to consolidate its operations resulting in the
transfer of production from the subject plant in Beaverton, OR to another domestic plant.

Increased imports did not contribute importantly to worker separations at the firm.

 TA-W-29,149A; Endevco, Inc., Houston, TX 

 TA-W-29,150; Duback Gas Co., (Clairborne Gas Plant), Lisbon, LA 

 

The investigation revealed that criterion (2) and criterion (3) have not been met. Sales or production did not decline

<DOCTITLE>North American Philips Lighting Co.; Fairmont, WV; Termination of Investigation</DOCTITLE>



Pursuant to Title V of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Public Law 103-182) concerning
transitional adjustment assistance, hereinafter called (NAFTA-TAA), and in accordance with section 250(a),
subchapter D, chapter 2, title II, of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2273), an investigation was initiated
on February 4, 1994 in response to a petition filed by the International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers
on behalf of the workers at North American Philips Lighting Company in Fairmont, West Virginia. The workers produce
home and auto lighting products.

On January 31, 1994, all workers at North American Philips Lighting Company, Fairmont, West Virginia engaged in employment
related to the production of home and auto lighting products who became totally or partially separated from employment
on or after December 9, 1992 were certified as eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the
Trade Act of 1974.

In a letter dated February 15, 1994, the petitioner requested that the petition for NAFTA-TAA be withdrawn.
Consequently, further investigation in this case would serve no purpose, and the investigation has been terminated.




Signed at Washington, DC, this 22nd day of February, 1994.

ACTION: 

Application of TUV Rheinland of North America, Inc. for recognition as a nationally recognized testing laboratory;
extension of comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces an extension of the comment period on the application of TUV Rheinland of North America, Inc.
for recognition as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) under 29 CFR 1910.7.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On November 19, 1993, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) published in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of the application of TUV Rheinland of North America, Inc. for OSHA recognition as a nationally recognized
testing laboratory pursuant to 29 CFR 1910.7 (58 FR 61101). The notice included a preliminary finding that TUV Rheinland
of North America, Inc. (the applicant) could meet the requirements for recognition detailed in 29 CFR 1910.7 and it
invited public comment on the application. Comments were requested by January 18, 1994.



On January 12, 1994, the American Council of Independent Laboratories, Inc. (ACIL) requested an extension of time
in which to submit comments on the application of TUV Rheinland of North America, Inc. for recognition as an NRTL (Ex.
4-2). The ACIL claimed that its preliminary investigation had uncovered ``substantial deficiencies'' in
the application and that more time was necessary to submit pertinent documentation related to the instant application.
Issues raised by the ACIL include whether the applicant is completely independent from its parent organization and
the nature of the applicant's operation. According to the ACIL, the resolution of the questions raised would require,
among other things, the study and analysis of relevant German laws and requested some additional time, until March
18, 1994, to file its comments on the application of TUV Rheinland of North America, Inc.

The OSHA/NRTL staff has carefully reviewed the request for additional time in which to prepare comments on the issue
of the applicant's independence. The concerns of the commentator may have merit; in any event the request for additional
time appears to be reasonable under the circumstances and will be granted, although the length of time granted has
been modified from the original request.

Therefore, the time in which to file comments on the application of TUV Rheinland of North America, Inc. to be recognized
as an NRTL is hereby extended until April 4, 1994.

Copies of the TUV application, the laboratory survey report, and all submitted comments, as received, (Docket No.
NRTL-3-92), are available for inspection and duplication at the Docket Office, room N 2634, Occupational
Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, at the above address.

<DOCTITLE>New Mexico State Standards; Approval</DOCTITLE>



1. Background



Part 1953 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, prescribes procedures under section 18 of the Occupational Safety
and Health Act of 1970 (hereinafter called the Act), by which the Regional Administrator for Occupational Safety
and Health (hereinafter called Regional Administrator), under a delegation of authority from the Assistant Secretary
of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health (hereinafter called the Assistant Secretary) (29 CFR 1953.4), will review
and approve standards promulgated pursuant to a State Plan, which has been approved in accordance with section 18(c)
of the Act and 29 CFR part 1902. On December 10, 1975, notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 (40 FR 57455) of the approval of the New Mexico State Plan and the adoption of subpart DD to part 1952 containing the decision.

The New Mexico State Plan provides for the adoption of Federal standards as State standards after:

1. Notice of public hearing published in a newspaper of general circulation in the State at least sixty (60) days prior
to the date of such hearing.

2. Public hearing conducted by the Environmental Improvement Board. 

3. Filing of adopted regulations, amendments, or revocations under the State Rules Act.

The New Mexico State Plan provides for the adoption of State standards which are at least as effective as comparable
Federal standards promulgated under section 6 of the Act.

By letter dated January 20, 1994, from Sam A. Rogers, Bureau Chief, to Gilbert J. Saulter, Regional Administrator,
and incorporated as part of the plan, the State submitted State standards identical to Federal standards as follows:
Amendment to  1910.146, Permit-Required Confined Spaces (58 FR 34845-34851, dated June 29, 1993); Amendment
to 1910 General Industry Standards (58 FR 35308-35310, dated June 30, 1993); Amendment to 1926 Construction
Standards (58 FR 35077-35306 and 35310-35311, dated June 30, 1993); Amendment to 1926 Construction Standards
(58 FR 40468, dated July 28, 1993); and Amendment to 1928 Agricultural Standards to add and reserve new subparts J and
L, and add a new subpart M, Occupational Health, consisting of  1928.1027, Cadmium (58 FR 21787-21850,
dated April 23, 1993).

These standards, contained in New Mexico Occupational Health and Safety Regulations OHSR 200, OHSR 300 and OHSR 400,
were promulgated on December 10, 1993, in accordance with applicable State law.

The subject standards become effective February 18, 1994, and February 19, 1994, pursuant to New Mexico State Law,
section 50-9-1 through 50-9-25.



2. Decision



Having reviewed the State submission in comparison with the Federal standards, it has been determined that the State
standards are identical to the Federal standards, and are accordingly approved.



3. Location of Supplement for Inspection and Copying



A copy of the standards supplement, along with the approved plan, may be inspected and copied during normal business
hours at the following locations: Office of the Regional Administrator, U.S. Department of Labor-OSHA, 525 Griffin
Street, room 602, Dallas, Texas 75202; Office of the Secretary, New Mexico Environment Department, 1190 St. Francis
Drive, Santa Fe, New Mexico 87501; and the Office of State Programs, 200 Constitution Ave., NW., room N3700, Washington,
DC 20210.



4. Public Participation



Under 29 CFR 1953.2(c), the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternative procedures to expedite the review process
or for other good cause which may be consistent with applicable laws. The Assistant Secretary finds that good cause
exists for not publishing the supplements to the New Mexico State Plan as proposed changes and making the Regional
Administrator's approval effective upon publication for the following reason.

1. These standards are identical to the Federal standards which were promulgated in accordance with Federal law including
meeting requirements for public participation. The decision is effective March 4, 1994.






Authority: 

Sec. 18, Public Law 91-596, 84 Stat. 1608 (29 U.S.C. 667).

<DOCTITLE>Oregon State Standards; Approval</DOCTITLE>



1. Background



Part 1953 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, prescribes procedures under section 18 of the Occupational Safety
and Health Act of 1970 (hereinafter called the Act) by which the Regional Administrator for Occupational Safety and
Health (hereinafter called Regional Administrator) under a delegation of authority from the Assistant Secretary
of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health (29 CFR 1953.4) will review and approve standards promulgated pursuant
to a State plan which has been approved in accordance with section 18(c) of the Act and 29 CFR part 1902. On December 28,
1972, notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 (37 FR 28628) of the approval of the Oregon plan and the adoption of subpart D to part 1952 containing the decision.

The Oregon plan provides for adoption of State standards which are at least as effective as comparable Federal standards
promulgated under section 6 of the Act. Section 1953.20 provides that where any alteration in the Federal program
could have an adverse impact on the at least as effective as status of the State program, a program change supplement
to a State plan shall be required. The Oregon plan also provides for the adoption of Federal standards as State standards
by reference.


In response to Federal standards amendments, the State has submitted by letters dated April 16, and October 16, 1992,
from John A. Pompei, Administrator, to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, and incorporated as part of the plan,
State standard amendments comparable to 29 CFR 1910.1048, Formaldehyde, as published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 2681) on January 23, 1992, (57 19262) on May 5, 1992, (57 FR 22290) on May 27, 1992, (57 FR 24701) on June 10, 1992,
and (57 FR 27160) on June 18, 1992. The State's rules pertaining to Formaldehyde, contained in OAR 437-02-360(28),
were adopted by reference on April 16, 1992, and October 13, 1992, pursuant to ORS 654.025(2), ORS 656.726(3), and
ORS 183.335, as ordered and transmitted under OR-OSHA Administrative Orders 4-1992 and 12-1992.
On March 24, 1991, and July 16, 1991, the State mailed the Notice of Proposed Amendment of Rules to those on the Department
of Insurance and Finance Mailing list, established pursuant to OAR 431-01-000 and to those on the Department's
distribution list as their interest appeared. No written requests for a public hearing were received. The State's
rules pertaining to Formaldehyde, contained in OAR 437-02-360(28), were originally adopted by reference
and approved in the 

Federal Register

 on January 13, 1989 (54 FR 1461), with other amendments approved on April 26, 1991 (56 FR 19382).

By letter dated January 6, 1993, from John A. Pompei, Administrator, to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, and
incorporated as part of the plan, the State on its own initiative submitted a repeal of OAR 437-02-370,
and adopted by reference  1910.1025(e)(1), table 1, Lead Implementation Schedule. The State standard was
adopted and became effective on December 7, 1992, pursuant to ORS 654.025(2), ORS 656.726(3), and ORS 183.335, as
ordered and transmitted under OR-OSHA Administrative Order 14-1992. The State's Lead standard was originally
approved in the 

Federal Register

 (54 FR 38300) on September 15, 1989. The change became necessary when on July 19, 1991, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia lifted the judicial stays of the Lead standard for all industries, except brass and bronze
ingot production.

On its own initiative, the State has submitted by letter dated October 19, 1993, from John A. Pompei, Administrator,
to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, and incorporated as part of the plan, a revision to State rules comparable
to 29 CFR 1910.134, Respiratory Protection, as published in the 

Federal Register

 (39 FR 23671) on June 27, 1974. The State's original adoption of Respiratory Protection was promulgated as OAR 437,
Chapter 22-69, and received 

Federal Register

 approval at 40 FR 50583 on October 30, 1975. The State's standard was subsequently recodified as OAR 437, Division
129, with 

Federal Register

 approval at 52 FR 27026 on July 17, 1987. The State has repealed OAR 437, Division 129, in its entirety, and has incorporated
29 CFR 1910.134, Respiratory Protection, by reference as OAR 437-02-1910.134. The State's readoption
by reference also deleted General and Special Industry Safety and Health Standards, Revocation, as published in
the 

Federal Register

 (43 FR 49748) on October 24, 1978, and Revocation of Advisory and Repetitive Standards as published in the 

Federal Register

 (49 FR 5322) on February 10, 1984. The State has also adopted one State-initiated rule at OAR 437-02-133
on air quality in respirators in lieu of 29 CFR 1910.134(d)(1), which updates the Compressed Gas Association Commodity
Specification from G-7.1-1966 (as in the Federal rule) to G-7.1-1989. During the early period
of Oregon's program, the State elected not to adopt by reference standards comparable to 29 CFR 1910.137, Electrical
Protective Devices, 1910.138, Effective Dates,  1910.139, Sources of Standards, and 1910.140, Standards
Organizations. (These standards are at the end of 29 CFR 1910 subpart I, Personal Protective Equipment.) With this
notice the State has chosen to do so, at OAR 437-02, Subdivision I. On March 22, 1993, the Notice of Proposed Revision
of Rules was mailed to those on the Department of Insurance and Finance mailing list established pursuant to OAR 436-90-505
and to those on the Department's distribution mailing list as their interest appeared. Both actions failed to elicit
a request for hearing; however, two written comments were received which recommended that the State retain its more
specific language in some areas of the standard. The State's revision was adopted on July 29, 1993, with an effective
date of September 15, 1993, through OR-OSHA Administrative Order 9-1993.

The State submitted by letter dated October 19, 1993, from John A. Pompei, Administrator, to James W. Lake, Regional
Administrator, and incorporated as part of the plan, a State standards revision comparable to 29 CFR 1910.133, Eye
and Face Protection, as published in the 

Federal Register 

(39 FR 23670) on June 27, 1974. The Oregon Eye and Face Protection Standard is contained in OAR 437-02-1910.133.
The State's original standard was adopted as OAR 437 chapter 7, section 3, rules 5 through 12 on March 19, 1974, and received


Federal Register 

approval (39 FR 38036) on October 25, 1974. The State standard was subsequently recodified without change as OAR 437
Division 50-025 and received 

Federal Register

 approval (52 FR 27077) on July 17, 1987. OAR 437, Division 50 has been repealed in its entirety. On March 22, 1993, the
Notice of Proposed Revision of Rules was mailed to those on the Department of Insurance and Finance mailing list established
pursuant to OAR 436-90-505 and to those on the Department's distribution mailing list as their interest
appeared. Both actions failed to elicit a request for hearing; however, two written comments were received which
recommended that the State retain its more specific language in some areas of the standard. The State's revision was
adopted on July 29, 1993, with an effective date of September 15, 1993, through OR-OSHA Administrative Order
9-1993. The State has retained one State-initiated standard requiring eye protection for employees exposed
to laser beams which was previously approved by OSHA. The renumbering changes for the State-initiated rule are as
follows: Originally adopted as OAR 437-7-3-2, recodified as OAR 437-50-025(12), and
readopted as OAR 437-02-130(2). The State's more stringent rule received 

Federal Register

 approval (39 FR 38036) on October 25, 1974 as part of Oregon's response to Federal OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.133, Eye and Face
Protection, as published in the 

Federal Register

 (39 FR 23670) on June 27, 1974. The State has also retained a minor State-initiated rule at OAR 437-02-130(1),
previously OAR 437-50-025(3), which requires eye and face protection equipment to be designed and used
in accordance with ANSI Z87.1-1989.


2. Decision


Having reviewed the State submissions in comparison with the Federal standards, amendments and corrections, it
has been determined that the State standard amendments for Formaldehyde, Lead, and Personal Protective Equipment
are identical to the Federal standards. OSHA therefore approves these amendments. OSHA has also determined that
the Respiratory Protection amendments are at least as effective as the comparable Federal amendments, as required
by section 18(c)(2) of the Act. In addition, OSHA has determined that the differences between the State and Federal
Respiratory Protection amendments are minimal and that the standards are thus substantially identical. OSHA therefore
approves these amendments; however, the right to reconsider this approval is reserved should substantial objection
be submitted to the Assistant Secretary.
Regarding the Eye and Face Protection amendments, OSHA has determined that these amendments are at least as effective
as the comparable Federal amendments, as required by section 18(c)(2) of the Act. With the adoption by reference of
 1910.133, the State's standard is now identical to the Federal, except for the retention of two State-initiated
rules. One of these rules was approved in the 

Federal Register

 in 1974, and the other rule is minor. OSHA therefore approves the standard; however, the right to reconsider this approval
is reserved should substantial objections be submitted to the Assistant Secretary.

4. Public Participation


Under 29 CFR 1953.2(c), the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternative procedures to expedite the review process
or for other good cause which may be consistent with applicable laws. The Assistant Secretary finds that good cause
exists for not publishing the supplement to the Oregon State Plan as a proposed change and making the Regional Administrator's
approval effective upon publication for the following reasons:
1. The standard amendment is as effective as the Federal standard which was promulgated in accordance with the Federal
law including meeting requirements for public participation.
2. The standard amendment was adopted in accordance with the procedural requirements of State law and further public
participation would be repetitious.
This decision is effective March 4, 1994.

Part 1953 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, prescribes procedures under section 18 of the Occupational Safety
and Health Act of 1970 (hereinafter called the Act) by which the Regional Administrator for Occupational Safety and
Health (hereinafter called Regional Administrator) under a delegation of authority from the Assistant Secretary

The Vermont State Plan provides for the adoption of State standards which are at least as effective as comparable Federal
standards promulgated under section 6 of the Act. By letter dated December 2, 1993, from Barbara G. Ripley, Commissioner,
Vermont Department of Labor and Industry, to John B. Miles, Jr., Regional Administrator; and incorporated as part
of the plan, the State submitted updated State standards identical to 29 CFR parts 1910, 1915, 1926 and 1928, and subsequent
amendments thereto, as described below: 

(1) Correction to 29 CFR parts 1910, 1915, 1926 and 1928, Occupational Exposure to Cadmium; Correction; Final Rule

2. Decision 



The above State standards have been reviewed and compared with the relevant Federal standard. It has been determined
that the State standard is identical to the Federal standard, and is accordingly approved. 



3. Location of Supplement for Inspection and Copying 



A copy of the standards supplements, along with the approved plan, may be inspected and copied during normal business
hours at the following locations: Office of the Regional Administrator, 133 Portland Street, Boston, Massachusetts

Under 29 CFR 1953.2(c), the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternative procedures to expedite the review process
or for other good cause which may be consistent with applicable laws. The Assistant Secretary finds that good cause
exists for not publishing the supplement to the Vermont State Plan as a proposed change and making the Regional Administrator's
approval effective upon publication for the following reason: 

1. The standards were adopted in accordance with the procedural requirements of the State Law which included public
comment, and further public participation would be repetitious. 

This decision is effective March 4, 1994. 






Authority: 

Sec. 18, Public Law 91-596, 84 Stat. 1608 (29 U.S.C. 667).

National Environmental Policy Act; Lidar In-space Technology Experiment 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Finding of no significant impact.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq,), the Council
on Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500-1508),
and NASA policy and regulations (14 CFR part 1216 Subpart 1216.3), NASA has made a Funding of No Significant Impact
(FONSI) with respect to the proposed Lidar In-space Technology Experiment (LITE) be managed by the NASA Langley Research
Center, Hampton, VA. LITE involves testing the capabilities of a lidar (LIght Detection And Ranging) system to monitor
atmospheric conditions from space. LITE hardware would be carried into orbit by a Space Shuttle mission launched
from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

NASA has reviewed the EA prepared for the proposed LITE and has determined that it represents an accurate and adequate
analysis of the scope and level of associated environmental impacts. The EA is incorporated by reference in this FONSI.


NASA is proposing to test a lidar system in space for use in a global atmospheric monitoring program. The principal
components of a lidar system are the laser transmitter module (LTM) and the telescope-receiver. The LTM shoots a pulsed
laser beam into the atmosphere where much of the laser energy is absorbed by the atmosphere. Some of the energy is reflected
back toward the telescope-receiver, while a small fraction passes through the atmosphere and reaches the Earth's
surface. The energy reflected toward the telescope-receiver is used to assess meteorological conditions (e.g.,
cloud conditions) and atmospheric aerosols (e.g., atmospheric contaminants), and to monitor the ozone layer. NASA
proposes to fly a lidar system as an attached payload on the Space Shuttle. The first flight is scheduled for the fall
of 1994 as a 9-day mission to gain experience in operating a lidar system in a space environment and to evaluate the sensitivity
of the lidar instrument for monitoring atmospheric conditions.
The proposed action and the No-Action Alternative (i.e., no space-based testing of a lidar system) were considered
in the EA. The No-Action Alternative will not fulfill NASA's objective to advance atmospheric monitoring capabilities.
Under the No-Action Alternative, it will not be possible to develop the technology for a space-based lidar atmospheric
monitoring system, and it will be necessary to continue to rely on existing passive monitoring instruments which
have limitations in assessing the vertical distribution of atmospheric constituents.
The proposed action is the normal operation of the LITE payload from within the Space Shuttle cargo bay. The LITE payload
will remain in the Shuttle cargo bay and will not produce any effluent which could escape the cargo bay during mission
operations. The only feature of the LITE payload which will emerge from the cargo bay will be the laser beam.
The LITE LTM will produce laser energy in three wavelengths, one of which will be visible (pale green). The portion
of the laser energy which will pass through the atmosphere will reach the Earth's surface in a series of circular ``laser
spots'' as the Shuttle moves across the Earth's surface. The diameter of the spots will vary from 265 meters (870 feet)
to 483 meters (1,585 feet). Exposure will occur only to persons who are within a laser spot. Each laser pulse will last
for 20 nanoseconds. The planned mission orbits will be between 57 degrees north latitude and 57 degrees south latitude.
Given the laser pulse rate and the Shuttle's orbiting velocity, a person cannot be within two consecutive laser spots.
A comprehensive safety analysis performed for the proposed LITE found minimal risk of skin or eye injury from operation
of the LITE LTM. The maximum Radiant Exposure (RE) to a person within a laser spot was calculated to be more than a million
times lower than the Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) for skin exposure and at least two orders of magnitude lower
than the MPE for eye exposure for each of the three laser energy wavelengths. The cumulative effect or simultaneous
exposure to multiple wavelengths was calculated to be at least two orders of magnitude lower than the MPE. RE to persons
using binoculars to view the Shuttle from within a laser spot was calculated to be lower than the MPE. While RE to persons
using a 165-mm (6.5-inch) telescope to view the Shuttle from within a laser spot was calculated to be equal to the MPE,
there is still considerable safety factor in the MPE, since MPE's are established at exposures which are one to two
orders of magnitude lower than the level of any known hazard.
A Phase I Flight Safety Review found that the LITE LTM lasers will not be hazardous to persons in aircraft and will not
interfere with microwave, very-high-frequency, or ultra-high-frequency communications. A review by the U.S.
Space Command Laser Clearinghouse found that the LITE lasers will not exceed the damage threshold to space systems.
No other potential environmental impacts were identified as a result of the environmental assessment. On the basis
of the LITE EA and underlying reference documents, NASA has determined that the environmental impacts associated
with this project will not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the quality of the environment.
NASA will take no final action prior to the expiration of the 30-day comment period.

<DOCTITLE>Baltimore Gas and Electric Co., Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit No. 2</DOCTITLE>



Exemption

I



The Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BG&E/licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR-69,
which authorizes operation of the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit No. 2 (the facility). The license provides,
among other things, that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations and Orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter in effect.

The facility is a pressurized water reactor located at the licensee's site in Calvert County, Maryland.

The licensee is implementing upgrades to the existing safety-related emergency diesel generators (EDGs) to increase
their load capacity. The first part of this effort will be to upgrade Unit 1 EDG No. 11 during the upcoming Unit 1 refueling
outage (RFO-11). This outage commenced on February 8, 1994, and is scheduled to be completed in early May 1994.
To support this initial portion of the upgrades, the licensee has identified one temporary exemption required at
this time. The exemption is specified below.



II



The Code of Federal Regulations at 10 CFR part 50, appendix A, General Criterion-2 (GDC-2), requires that: Structures,
systems and components important to safety shall be designed to withstand the effects of natural phenomena such as
* * * tornadoes, * * * without loss of capability to perform their safety functions.

The licensee has requested the temporary exemption from GDC-2 because of the planned upgrade of the Unit 1 EDG
No. 11. The effort will require temporary removal of a steel missile door which will expose portions of the support
systems of EDG Nos. 12 and 21. These EDGs are required to be operable to support the operation of Unit No. 2 and require
protection from the potential effects of postulated missiles generated by natural phenomena. The licensee indicates
that the steel missile door will be removed 4 times during RFO-11. The licensee estimates that each of the missile
door removals will last for about 24 hours which will result in a total removal time of about 100 hours during the scheduled
89 day outage.

The licensee is providing compensatory action to assure the safe operation of Unit No. 2 for the short periods of time
during which the steel missile door will be removed. To encompass all severe weather conditions as defined in the plant
site Emergency Response Plan Implementing Procedures 3.0, Attachment 18, a concerted effort will be made to reinstall
the missile door if a tornado or hurricane watch is issued or if sustained winds are predicted to be greater than 35 miles/hour
at the site. The only factor which would impede the reinstallation of the missile door would be to ensure the safety
of the individuals performing the reinstallation.

Considering the existing design features and compensatory measure proposed by the licensee, the likelihood of damage
to the exposed EDG support systems from postulated missiles generated by natural phenomena is minimal for the short
periods of time that the protective door will be removed. Also, based on the compensatory measure provided, reasonable
assurance exists that the ability to reinstall the missile door will be maintained prior to any severe weather which
could result in airborne missiles. Therefore, there is reasonable assurance that the proposed GDC-2 exemption
will present no undue risk to public health and safety.



III



The Commission has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), that special circumstances as set forth in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v)
exists. The exemption would provide only temporary relief from the applicable regulation (GDC-2). The exemption
is requested for a specific time period after which the facility would again be in conformance with all the requirements
of GDC-2. The licensee has made good faith efforts in considering alternatives to the exemption request and
has concluded that the EDG upgrades can only be conducted without the subject exemption during a period when both units
are shut down.

Based on the above and on review of the licensee's submittal, as summarized in the Safety Evaluation, dated February
23, 1994, the NRC staff concludes that the likelihood of unacceptable damage to the exposed portions of the Unit No.
2 EDG support systems due to weather-induced missiles during the short duration exposures occurring in the exemption
period is low.

Based on the low probability of unacceptable events, coupled with the compensatory measure which the licensee has
committed to, the NRC staff finds the proposed exemption from GDC-2 to be acceptable.

IV



Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the subject exemption is authorized by
law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common defense and security.
The Commission further determines that special circumstances, as provided in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v), are present
justifying the exemption; namely, that the exemption would provide only temporary relief from the applicable regulations
and that the licensee has made good faith efforts to comply with the regulations. 

Therefore, the Commission hereby approves the following exemption: Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit No.
2, may operate without conforming to the requirements of GDC-2 as they apply to the exposed portions of the support
systems for EDG Nos. 12 and 21 providing that the compensatory measure as described herein is in place for the period
of the exemption. 

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that granting the above exemption will have no significant
impact on the quality of the human environment (February 17, 1994, 59 FR 8033). 

The subject Unit No. 1 EDG No. 11 upgrade GDC-2 exemption if effective from its date of issuance through May 15,
1994.

<DOCTITLE>Public Service Electric and Gas Co.; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing </DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. DPR-70 and DPR-75 issued to the Public Service Electric and Gas Company (the licensee) for
operation of the Salem Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Salem County, New Jersey. 

The proposed amendment would increase the storage capacity of the spent fuel pool (SFP) from its current 1170 storage
cells to 1632 storage cells. This would be accomplished by replacing 9 out of twelve of the existing high density fuel
racks with 9 maximum density rack modules constructed of stainless steel and a neutron absorber material (boron carbide
and aluminum-composite sandwich, product name ``boral''). The proposed change would extend the date when full core
discharge capacity is no longer available for Salem 1 from 1998 to 2008, and for Salem 2 from 2002 to 2012. 

In addition, the proposed amendment would extend the decay time for refueling operations from 100 hours to 168 hours.


Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. 

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 

 


1. Do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.


[Public Service Electric and Gas Company] PSE&G has evaluated the following postulated accident scenarios:


1. A spent fuel assembly drop in the SFP. 

2. Loss of SFP cooling. 

3. A seismic event. 

4. An installation accident during reracking. 

The Salem SFP has been analyzed considering fuel handling equipment, operating procedures, SFP cooling system,
and seismic events. Reracking involves replacing 9 out of the 12 existing high density racks with 9 new maximum density
racks. It does not require any system modifications or modifications to the cask handling crane, which by its physical
location and design is prevented from moving over the SFP. Results confirm that the proposed modification does not
increase the probability of the first three postulated accident scenarios. 

NUREG-0612, ``Control of Heavy Loads at Nuclear Power Plants,'' sections 5.1.1, 5.1.2, and 5.1.6, provide
guidance for heavy load handling operations during spent fuel storage rack replacement. Section 5.1.2 lists (4)
alternatives for assuring safe heavy load handling during a fuel storage rack replacement. Alternative (1) satisfies
the control of heavy loads guidelines through the implementation of defense-in-depth measures. These measures
ensure that the potential for a heavy load drop is extremely small. PSE&G intends to utilize the defense-in-depth
concept during reracking activities.

<DOCNO> FR940304-2-00153 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940304-2-00080 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

NUREG-0554, ``Single Failure Proof Cranes for Nuclear Power Plants,'' provides guidance for the design, fabrication,
installation, and testing of highly reliable new cranes. NUREG-0612, Appendix C, ``Modification of Existing
Cranes,'' provides guidance for the implementation of NUREG-0554 at operating plants. We have evaluated anticipated
fuel handling crane movements for compliance with the guidelines specified in alternative (1) of Appendix C, and
determined that alternative (1) was satisfied based on the extremely small probability of a storage rack drop. The
maximum weight of any storage rack and its associated handling tool is 17 tons. The fuel handling crane will be upgraded
to a 20 ton lifting capacity and a design safety factor, with respect to ultimate strength, of five times the lifting
capacity (i.e., 100 tons). The uprated fuel handling crane has ample safety factor margin for storage rack movement.
This applies to non-redundant load-bearing components. Special redundant lifting devices, which have a rated capacity
sufficient to maintain safety factors, will be utilized for storage rack movements. Per NUREG-0612, Appendix
B, the substantial safety factor margin ensures that the probability of a load drop is extremely low. Additionally,
a load drop analysis was performed to ensure the integrity of the pool structure. The analysis results were acceptable.

Based on the actions discussed above, the proposed modification does not increase the probability of an installation
accident.

PSE&G evaluated the consequences of a spent fuel assembly drop in the SFP and determined that the criticality
acceptance criterion, Keff less than or equal to 0.95, was not exceeded. The radiological consequences of a fuel assembly
drop did not change significantly from those previously analyzed. The calculated doses are well within 10 CFR 100
requirements. A spent fuel assembly dropped on the racks, will not cause rack distortion that would prevent the performance
of their safety function. Thus, the consequences of this postulated accident are not significantly changed from
those previously evaluated.

The consequences of a loss of SFP cooling were evaluated. The evaluation concluded that sufficient time is available
to establish an alternate means of cooling following a complete failure of the normal SFP cooling system. Calculations
show that under a normal discharge scenario, if all indirect forced cooling paths (i.e., heat removal by heat exchangers)
are lost at the instant the pool water reaches its maximum value, the pool will not begin bulk boiling for at least 4.61
hours. This time interval is sufficient to allow plant personnel to establish alternate heat removal methods. A piped
cross-connection exists between Unit 1 and Unit 2's SFP heat exchangers. This allows for use of the opposite Unit's
heat exchanger during emergencies, or when a given Unit's Service Water header or Component Cooling System are out-of-service.
Thus, the consequences of this postulated accident are not significantly changed from those previously evaluated.

The new racks are designed and fabricated to meet applicable NRC requirements and industry standards. Seismic analyses
were performed on the new racks and the existing racks using 3-D single rack (opposed phase motion) and Whole
Pool Multi-Rack (WPMR) models. Kinematic and shear analyses conclude the existence of large margins of safety. The
kinematic margin against rack-to-rack or rack-to-wall impact is at least 1.5 for all SFP racks. Maximum rack primary
stresses, under [Safe Shutdown Earthquake] SSE conditions, are less than 50% of the allowable ASME Code value. Maximum
supporting pool structure bending moments and thru-thickness shear, under factored load conditions, are less than
80% of the allowables. All racks (new and existing) are designed as free-standing racks, to ensure that rack and pool
structure integrity is maintained during and after a seismic event. Thus, the consequences of a postulated seismic
event are not increased from previously evaluated events.

The consequences of an installation accident were considered. All fuel in the SFP will have decayed for a minimum of
(3) months prior to any heavy load movement in the SFP area. This allows sufficient time for decay of gaseous radionuclides
in the fuel (gap activity). A postulated accidental gaseous release from all stored fuel assemblies would result
in a potential offsite dose less than 10% of 10CFR100 limit. No equipment essential to safe reactor shutdown or employed
to mitigate the consequences of an accident is located beneath, adjacent to, or within the area of influence of any
load handling to support the SFP modification. Thus, the consequences of a postulated installation accident are
not significantly increased from those previously evaluated.

The only postulated accident affected by decay time is a Loss of SFP cooling. The proposed increase in decay time prior
to refueling operations is conservative and decreases the decay heat removal requirements. All thermal-hydraulic
calculations used 168 hours as the assumed decay time and concluded that adequate heat removal capability existed.
Thus, the probability and consequences of a loss of SFP cooling accident are not significantly increased from those
previously evaluated.

Therefore, it may be concluded that the proposed changes do not increase the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

2. Do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The proposed modification has been reviewed and analyzed for possible accidents. The criteria used in the analyses,
design, and installation of the new spent fuel racks account for anticipated loadings and postulated conditions
that may be imposed upon the structure during its lifetime, and is in conformance with established codes, standards,
and specifications acceptable to the NRC.

Factors that could affect the SFP neutron multiplication factor have been addressed conservatively. PSE&G
concluded that the maximum SFP neutron multiplication, with the addition of the maximum density racks, will not exceed
the subcritically limit of Keff less than or equal to 0.95.

The increase in decay time prior to refueling operations reduces the initial heat load and SFP cooling equipments.
The addition of new racks and associated spent fuel will produce an incremental heat load in the SFP. However, analysis
has shown that the existing SFP cooling system is sufficient to absorb this incremental heat load. The peak bulk pool
temperature will be maintained below the threshold value to preclude bulk boiling. The incremental heat load does
not alter SFP cooling safety considerations from those previously reviewed and found acceptable.

Rack impact analysis was performed to investigate possible impact during seismic events (i.e., rack-to-rack and
rack-to-wall impacts). The analysis concluded that the proposed SFP modification does not result in rack-to-rack
impact in the cellular region or rack-to-wall impact during postulated seismic events.

The basic SFP reracking technology has been reviewed and approved by the NRC in numerous applications for spent fuel
capacity increases. The safety function and operation of the SFP cooling system, makeup, and structural systems
are unchanged by the modification. No new failure modes are created.

Therefore, it may be concluded that the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of
accident from any previously evaluated.

3. Do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The safety function of the SFP and the racks is to preclude inadvertent criticality in a safe, specifically designed,
underwater storage location for spent fuel assemblies that require shielding and cooling during storage and handling.
The NRC Staff has established that the issue of margin of safety, when applied to reracking modifications, should
address the following areas:

1. Nuclear criticality considerations.

2. Thermal-hydraulic considerations.

3. Mechanical, material, and structural considerations.

Assessment in these areas assures that the SFP and racks will withstand specified design conditions, without impairment
of the structural integrity or performance of required safety functions.

The criticality analysis confirms that the new and existing rack designs meet the NRC acceptance criterion of Keff
less than or equal to 0.95 under all conditions. The criticality analysis methods conform to applicable industry
codes, standards, specifications and NRC guidance.

Keff calculations include uncertainties at a 95%/95% probability confidence level. Thus, the proposed amendment
does not involve a significant reduction in the nuclear criticality margin of safety.
Conservative methods and assumptions were used to calculate the maximum fuel temperature and the increase in SFP
water temperature. The thermal-hydraulic evaluation employed methods previously used to evaluate existing spent
fuel racks. The results demonstrate that the temperature margins of safety are maintained. The proposed modification,
with the fuel inventory, will increase the heat load in the SFP. However, the decay time prior to refueling operations
was increased from 100 to 168 hours to reduce the initial SFP cooling requirements. Evaluation results indicate that
the existing SFP cooling system can maintain the bulk pool water temperature at or below 149 F under normal discharge
scenarios. The maximum allowable temperature for bulk boiling is not exceeded for the calculated increase in pool
heat load. Maximum local water temperatures, along the hottest fuel assembly, remain below the nucleate boiling
condition. While no nucleate boiling is indicated for the standard storage condition, an assumption of 50% cell blockage
results in a possible highly localized two-phase condition near the top of the fuel. Fuel clad thermal stresses remain
less than 7000 psi, which is considerably lower than the endurance limit of the clad material. Thus, there is no significant
reduction in the margin of safety for thermal-hydraulic or SFP cooling.
Maintaining the spent fuel assemblies in a safe configuration during normal and abnormal loadings is the primary
safety function of the SFP and racks. Abnormal loading associated with an earthquake, a spent fuel assembly drop,
or the drop of any other heavy object were considered. The mechanical, material, and structural design of the new spent
fuel racks complies with applicable portions of the NRC OT Position Paper. Rack materials are compatible with the
spent fuel pool environment and the spent fuel assemblies. The structural assessment of the new racks concluded that
tilting and deflection or movement will not result in impact in the active fuel region during postulated seismic events.
In addition, the spent fuel assemblies remain intact with no criticality concerns. Thus, there is no significant
reduction in the margin of safety for mechanical, material and structural considerations.
Therefore, it may be concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By April 4, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Salem Free Public Library, 112 West Broadway, Salem, New
Jersey 08079. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before issuance of any amendment.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d)

The Commission hereby provides notice that this is a proceeding on an application for a license amendment falling
within the scope of section 134 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA), 42 U.S.C. 10154. Under section 134 of
the NWPA, the Commission, at the request of any party to the proceeding, must use hybrid hearing procedures with respect
to ``any matter which the Commission determines to be in controversy among the parties.'' The hybrid procedures in
section 134 provide for oral argument on matters in controversy, preceded by discovery under the Commission's rules,
and the designation, following argument, of only those factual issues that involve a genuine and substantial dispute,
together with any remaining questions of law, to be resolved in an adjudicatory hearing. Actual adjudicatory hearings
are to be held on only those issues found to meet the criteria of section 134 and set for hearing after oral argument.

The Commission's rules implementing section 134 of the NWPA are found in 10 CFR part 2, subpart K, ``Hybrid Hearing
Procedures for Expansion of Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage Capacity at Civilian Nuclear Power Reactors'' (published
at 50 FR 41662, October 15, 1985) to 10 CFR 2.1101 

et seq. 

Under those rules, any party to the proceeding may invoke the hybrid hearing procedures by filing with the presiding
officer a written request for oral argument under 10 CFR 2.1109. To be timely, the request must be filed within 10 days
of an order granting a request for hearing or petition to intervene. (As outlined above, the Commission's rules in
10 CFR part 2, subpart G, and 2.714 in particular, continue to govern the filing of requests for a hearing or petitions
to intervene, as well as the admission of contentions.) The presiding officer shall grant a timely request for oral
argument. The presiding officer shall grant an untimely request for oral argument only upon showing of good cause
by the requesting party for the failure to file on time and after providing the other parties an opportunity to respond
to the untimely request. If the presiding officer grants a request for oral argument, any hearing held on the application
shall be conducted in accordance with hybrid hearing procedures. In essence, those procedures limit the time available
for discovery and require that an oral argument be held to determine whether any contentions must be resolved in adjudicatory
hearing. If no party to the proceedings requests oral argument, or if all untimely requests for oral argument are denied,
then the usual procedures in 10 CFR part 2, subpart G, apply.

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated April 28, 1993, and revisions
to this submittal dated August 12, 1993, November 17, 1993 and February 2, 1994, which are available for public inspection

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>







Self-Regulatory Organization; The Depository Trust Company; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change Relating
To the Implementation of the Standing Instruction Database Feature of the Enhanced Institutional Delivery System



February 24, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
 notice is hereby given that on January 31, 1994, The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared primarily by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice
to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change consists of procedures for the Standing Instructions Database (``SID'') feature of DTC's
enhanced Institutional Delivery (``ID'') system.






II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, DTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. DTC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



SID is a central repository for customer account and settlement information furnished by institutions, agents,
and broker-dealers. The information includes items such as the agent for an institutional customer, the agent's
internal account number for the institutional customer, and interested parties. A broker-dealer can link its internal
account numbers for its institutional customers to the internal account numbers at the institutions. When entering
trade data into the ID system, a broker-dealer can simply refer to its internal account number in SID, and the ID system
will extract the necessary information from SID (such as customer name, agent, interested parties, and settlement
related information) and automatically will add the information to the confirmation. SID will eliminate the need
for the broker-dealer to provide all such information each time that the broker-dealer enters trade data into the
ID system.

SID is an optional feature for ID users. However, once a broker-dealer links its internal customer account number
with account information furnished to SID by the institutional customer, data in SID will be used for certain fields
in ID system processing, regardless of whether the broker-dealer submits data for those fields, when the broker-dealer
submits trade data for that institutional customer's trades.

The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder because the proposed rule change will further automate the process by which securities transactions
are cleared and settled.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



DTC perceives no impact on competition by reason of the proposed rule change.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



SID has been developed through widespread consultations with securities industry members. Written comments from
DTC participants or others have not been solicited or received on the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within thirty-five days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to ninety days of such date if it finds such longer
period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization
consents, the Commission will:





(a) By order approve such proposed rule change or 

(b) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of DTC. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-DTC-94-01
and should be submitted by March 25, 1994.




For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Government Securities Clearing Corporation; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change
Relating to Conditions for the Release of Confidential Data</DOCTITLE>



February 23, 1994.



I. Introduction



On June 18, 1993, pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 the Government Securities Clearing Corporation (``GSCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'')
a proposed rule change relating to the release of confidential data. Notice of the proposed rule change was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on August 10, 1993.
 On December 30, 1993, GSCC filed with the Commission an amendment (``Amendment No. 1'') to the proposed rule change.
Notice of Amendment No. 1 was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 20, 1994.
 No comments were received. This order approves the proposed rule change.







II. Description



Currently, GSCC Rule 29 provides that, absent valid legal process, GSCC will release clearing data
 that is identifiable as to a member only to (1) that member, (2) the Commission upon request, (3) another self-regulatory
organization, and (4) an ``appropriate regulatory agency'' as defined in Section 3(a)(34) (C) of the Act with regard
to a member that is primarily regulated by such agency. The proposed rule change amends GSCC Rule 29 to permit GSCC to
release clearing data to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (``FRBNY'') and to other third parties that perform a
regulatory or oversight function related to the government securities marketplace.





An agreement between GSCC and the FRBNY controls the release of data to the FRBNY. The FRBNY has agreed to maintain member
specific information in confidence, subject to certain exceptions. The FRBNY may share GSCC data with the members
of the Interagency Working Group on Market Surveillance
 and may release GSCC data as required by law. The FRBNY also has agreed to follow certain procedures should third parties
attempt to obtain release of GSCC data through the FRBNY.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940304-2-00162 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940304-2-00084 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Before releasing data to third parties that perform a regulatory or oversight function related to the government
securities market, GSCC must determine, and the Membership and Standards committee of the Board of Directors of GSCC
must concur, that the following five conditions have been met. The requesting party must show a legitimate need for
such data related to its market regulatory or oversight function. The data released by GSCC will be used solely for
market regulatory or oversight purposes. The requesting party must make the request in writing and with sufficient
specificity. With respect to member specific data, the member must be notified of the request and be given the opportunity
to present GSCC with any objections to the release of data.
 Finally, with respect to member specific data, the requesting party must show that it unsuccessfully attempted to
obtain the data directly from the member.







III. Discussion



Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act
 requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to protect investors and the public interest. The proposed
rule change serves this goal by enhancing the surveillance of the government securities market.





As discussed in the Joint Report on Government Securities (``Joint Report''),
 adequate surveillance of the government securities market is necessary to detect manipulation and address disorderly
market conditions. In order to provide coordinated surveillance, the FRBNY was selected to collect and analyze a
range of market data, which is transmitted promptly to the Federal Reserve Board, the Treasury, and the Commission.
The FRBNY collects information from a variety of sources, including automated systems operated by vendors, daily
telephone surveys of primary dealer operations, and weekly and daily reports of dealers. Their efforts provide additional
safeguards to the government securities market. In addition, other government organizations have had the need to
study the government securities market in order to evaluate suspicious activity in the market. GSCC, by providing
data necessary to evaluate market activity, assists these organizations in the performance of their functions.
Thus, the amendment furthers the protection of investors and the public interest.





IV. Conclusion



For the reasons discussed above, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the
Act, and particularly with Section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.



It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR-GSCC-93-05)
be, and hereby is, approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change; Correction</DOCTITLE>



February 28, 1994.



In FR Document No. 93-18600, beginning on page 41539 for Wednesday, August 4, 1993, several sentences were incorrectly
stated. The sentences below should be changed to clarify that the Series 7A Examination is applicable to floor members
whose public business is limited to accepting orders from professional customers for execution on the trading floor.
The first change below, however, should be made so that the sentence correctly cites the language deleted from the
proposal.

The first sentence of footnote 3 in Column 1 on page 41540 is corrected to read `` The NYSE deleted ``generally'' from
Rule 345, Interpretation .02 in order to clarify that the intent of the proposed interpretation is that the Series
7(a) Examination is applicable to floor members engaged in public business with professional customers.''

Column 1, page 41540, 8th line after the heading ``I. Proposal'' insert the word ``public'' after the word ``accept''.

Column 2, page 41540, the 13th line add the word ``public'' to the end of the line after the word ``whose''.

Column 1, page 41541, 23rd of line of the second full paragraph remove the word ``solely'' from the last sentence before
the heading ``IV. Conclusion''.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change Relating
to Specialist Post Wires</DOCTITLE>



February 25, 1994.



I. Introduction



On April 25, 1988, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to permit a specialist unit, with Exchange approval, to use the telephone line at its trading
post location to enter options or futures hedging orders through a member on the floor of an options or futures exchange.
The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25694 (May 12, 1988), 53
FR 17812 (May 18, 1988). No comments were received on the proposal.






II. Description of the Proposal



The Exchange proposes to amend NYSE Rule 36.30 which currently permits a specialist unit, subject to Exchange approval,
to maintain a telephone line at its trading post location on the Floor to enable the unit to communicate with its off-Floor
office or clearing firm. In addition the Rule prohibits the use of such telephones for the purpose of transmitting
to the NYSE Floor orders for the purchase or sale of securities, but permits the use of the telephones to enter options
or futures hedging orders (

i.e., 

orders entered to offset the risk of making a market in the underlying speciality stock) through the specialist unit's
off-Floor office or clearing firm. The proposed amendment will add language to the Rule to expand permitted usage
of telephone lines at the specialist posts to include, with Exchange approval, the entry of a specialist unit's options
or futures hedging orders ``through a member (on the floor) of an options or futures exchange.''



III. Discussion



The adoption by the NYSE of subsection .30 to rule 36, along with other amendments to the rule, codified the Exchange's
policy concerning members' use of telephones on the Floor that can be used to communicate with non-members located
off-floor.
 Such communication is permitted with certain specifically enumerated restrictions.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940304-2-00165 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940304-2-00086 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The instant proposed rule change will amend subsection .30 by adding language that will enable a specialist unit to
use a telephone linkage at the specialist post to enter options or futures hedging orders through a member (on the floor)
of an options or futures exchange. This would be in addition to the current language of subsection .30 which permits
entry of such orders through a telephone linkage to the specialist unit's off-floor offices or its clearing firm.
The NYSE states that the purpose of this amendment is to provide a faster means for specialists to enter options or futures
hedging orders and to expand a specialist's ability to enter such orders from its post location on the Exchange floor
directly with a member on the floor of an options or futures exchange.



The Commission, in originally approving the use of options by specialists for hedging their specialty stocks, was
sensitive to concerns over the potential for specialist frontrunning,
 tape racing, or other abuses arising from the specialist's informational advantage.
 In order to allay these concerns, the NYSE rule permitting options hedging by specialists places restrictions on
the size, timing and purpose of the options transactions.
 The proposal being approved does not affect the restrictions currently in place for placing options orders. The proposal
only provides a more efficient means for specialists to relay hedging orders to options and futures exchanges. Further,
the NYSE has implemented surveillance procedures to monitor specialists' use of options to ensure they are consistent
with these restrictions. For example, specialists are required to submit Form 81-O to report their options
transactions.
 With respect to futures hedging orders, the NYSE through an agreement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which
currently trades futures on the Standard & Poor's (``S & P'') 500, Midcap 400 and the Major Market Index, exchange
information relating to futures transactions on these indexes in addition to options on any of the aforementioned
index futures and stock programs.










IV. Conclusion



The Commission has reviewed closely the proposed NYSE rule change and believes that it is consistent with the requirements
of the Act and, accordingly, should be approved. In particular, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change
is consistent with the requirement of section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it will facilitate transactions in securities
by providing specialists with the ability to hedge their positions more rapidly by enabling them to communicate directly
with a member on the floor of an option or futures exchange. The current process, which forces the specialist to route
a hedging order through an off-floor office or clearing firm, can make the execution of the hedging order more cumbersome
and less timely. By improving the process by which specialists can transfer the risk of their market making responsibilities,
specialists would be better able to fulfill these responsibilities. 

Finally, the Commission believes that any potential for frontrunning, tape racing, or other abuses by specialists
that may be created by the proposed rule change is minimal, due in most part to the restrictions placed on the specialists'
options activity and the NYSE surveillance. In addition, as noted above, the NYSE has some access through its agreement
with the CME, and as an ISG member, to receive information on orders entered by the specialist on stock index futures
and options on stock index futures that should allow it to surveil for potential abuses.



It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-NYSE-88-14) is approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.
Amending the Net Capital Requirements in Rule 703</DOCTITLE>



February 28, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on January 28, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the Phlx. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Phlx proposes to amend Rule 703 (Financial Responsibility and Reporting) to correspond to recent Commission
amendments to SEC Rule 15c3-1 (``SEC Net Capital Rule'').
 Pursuant to these amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule, all specialists, except options market makers, who are currently
exempt from the net capital requirements of Rule 703, will be subject to a minimum net capital requirement of $100,000.
 As a result, the Exchange believes that the amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule require the deletion of Phlx Rule
703(a) (iii), (iv), and (v). Currently Rule 703 (a) (iii), (iv), and (v) impose a minimum net liquid asset
 requirement of $50,000 for equity specialists, $75,000 for options specialists, and $100,000 for firms which are
both equity and options specialists.







The Exchange also proposes to amend Rule 703 to require each member organization and participant organization to
notify the Exchange if it fails to maintain the minimum net capital required by the SEC Net Capital rule or it fails to
maintain liquid assets in accordance with Phlx Rule 703. Specifically, the Exchange is proposing to add a new paragraph
(v) to Phlx Rule 703(a) which would require a member organization or participant organization to promptly notify
the Exchange if it ceases to be in compliance with the SEC Net Capital Rule or Phlx Rule 703(a) (iii) or (iv) (

i.e.,

 former sections (a)(vi) or (a)(vii)).

Lastly, the Phlx proposes to amend paragraph (c)(vi) of Rule 703 to add the requirement that a floor broker's clearing
agent guarantee orders entrusted on the floor with that floor broker, in addition to transactions and balances carried
in the account.

The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Phlx, and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments to received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A),
(B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



On August 11, 1993, the Commission adopted amendments to its rules regarding minimum net capital requirements for
broker-dealers. Specifically, the amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule make all specialists, except options market
makers, that previously were exempt from this rule under subparagraph (b)(1), subject to the rule. The amendments
to the SEC Net Capital Rule will become effective on April 1, 1994.

The Phlx represents that the amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule will have the following effects on Phlx specialists:
instead of the current minimum net liquid assets requirements under Phlx Rule 703(a) of $50,000 for equity specialists,
$75,000 for options specialists, and $100,000 for firms that act as both equity and options specialists, the SEC's
minimum net capital requirement of $100,000 for dealer's would apply. As a result, existing paragraphs (iii)-(v)
of Phlx Rule 703(a) are proposed to be deleted. Certain aspects of both the SEC Net Capital Rule and Rule 703 remain unchanged.
Options market makers, who remain exempt from the net capital rule, continue to be subject to the financial requirements
of Phlx Rule 703. New paragraph (a)(iii), which was previously paragraph (a)(vi), requires $25,000 in net liquid
assets for market makers without a letter of guarantee; and new paragraph (a)(iv), which was previously paragraph
(a)(vii), requires market makers with a letter of guarantee issued by a clearing member organization to maintain
positive equity. In addition, Rule 703(a)(ii) continues to require net liquid assets of $25,000 upon admission.

With respect to the proposed notification requirement, new paragraph (v) of Rule 703(a) would require notification
to the Exchange if a member organization or participant organization falls below the net capital requirement of the
SEC Net Capital Rule or paragraphs (iii) or (iv) of Phlx rule 703(a).
 Currently, Commission Rule 17a-11 requires, among other things, prompt telegraphic notice to a broker-dealer's
designated examining authority, as well as the SEC, when a broker-dealer falls below its minimum net capital requirement
pursuant to the SEC Net Capital Rule. This rule does not apply to options market makers, because they are exempt from
the SEC Net Capital Rule. The Exchange's proposed notification provision would apply to all member organizations
and participant organizations, including options market makers. 




The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in that it is designed to
promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, and to
protect investors and the public interest, by amending Phlx Rule 703 to correspond to the Commission's recent amendments
to the SEC Net Capital Rule. The Exchange also believes that the requirement that a floor brokers' clearing agent guarantee
orders entrusted on the floor with that floor broker should promote just and equitable principles of trade as well
as protect investors and the public interest by promoting liquidity and confidence in the credibility of floor broker
orders, consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. In addition, the Exchange believes that the proposed notification
requirement should prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and protect investors and the public
interest by providing the Exchange with the ability to respond promptly to such notification, especially respecting
options market makers. 


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 


The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received. 


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action 


Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will: 




(a) By order approve such proposed rule change, or 
(b) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. 


IV. Solicitation of Comments 


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to the File No. SR-Phlx-94-04 and should be submitted by March 25, 1994.

Energy Initiatives, Inc. (70-8179)



Energy Initiatives, Inc., One Upper Pond Road, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054 (``EII''), an indirect subsidiary of
General Public Utilities Corporation, a registered holding company, has filed a post-effective amendment under
sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), and 10 of the Act and rule 50(a)(5) thereunder to its application-declaration filed under
sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, and 12(b) of the Act and rule 45 thereunder. 

By order dated September 7, 1993 (HCAR No. 25876) (``Order''), the Commission authorized EII to, among other things,
acquire up to 3,000 shares of common stock (``Stock''), for a purchase price of $2,500 per share, of a nonassociate
corporation (``Cogen Corp'') engaged in the business of developing, owning and operating power projects in the United
States and in foreign countries. Power projects may be qualifying facilities, exempt wholesale generators, or foreign
utility companies. 

In accordance with the Order, EII entered into a stock purchase agreement (``Stock Purchase Agreement'') and related
agreements and acquired 824 shares of class D voting common stock and 176 shares of class C nonvoting common stock from
Cogen Corp. The Stock Purchase Agreement also provides that, subject to receipt of further Commission authorization,
EII would purchase up to an additional 400 shares of Cogen Corp. class C nonvoting common stock, in order to provide
Cogen Corp. with additional equity capital.

EII now seeks to acquire, from time to time through July 1, 1996, the additional 400 shares of class C nonvoting common
stock (``Additional Shares''), $2,500 per share, for $1 million. The proceeds of the sale of the Additional Shares
would be used by Cogen Corp. to fund ongoing project development expenses. EII's ownership of the Additional Shares
would, together with the 3,000 shares of Stock authorized in the Order, be subject to terms and conditions of a stockholders
agreement that delineates the powers of the shareholders of Cogen Corp. 
As described in the Order, EII has an obligation to acquire, from time to time through July 1, 1996, an additional 2,000
shares of Stock. As security for that obligation, EII has deposited $2.5 million in cash into an escrow account. However,
under the Stock Purchase Agreement, EII may substitute an irrevocable bank letter of credit (``LOC'') for the cash
escrow. EII represents that use of an LOC for this purpose may be less expensive than cash collateral. 
Accordingly, EII proposes to enter into a letter of credit reimbursement agreement with a bank, which would provide
an LOC to Cogen Corp. The reimbursement agreement would obligate EII to repay the issuing bank in the event of any draw
on the LOC. The LOC would have a maximum fact amount of $2.5 million. Drawings on the LOC would bear interest at a rate
not more than 5% above the prime rate as in effect from time to time. EII may be also required to pay fees not to exceed 1%
annually of the LOC face amount. The LOC would have a final maturity of not later than July 1, 1996. 


Ohio Valley Electric Corporation, et al. (70-8337)


Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (``OVEC'') and Indiana-Kentucky Electric Corporation (``Indiana-Kentucky''),
both located at P.O. Box 468, Piketon, Ohio 45661 and both electric public-utility subsidiary companies of American
Electric Power Company, Inc., a registered holding company, have filed a declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, and
12(b) of the Act and Rules 45 and 50(a)(5) thereunder. 
Indiana law requires that permitees of a solid waste landfill in the state satisfy certain financial responsibility
standards. To satisfy such standards for its fly ash landfill at the Clifty Creek Plant, Indiana-Kentucky proposes
to enter into a reimbursement agreement in connection with the issue of a letter of credit. The letter of credit would
not exceed $10 million and would be for a one year term then renewable annually. Drawings under the letter of credit
would bear interest at not more than two percent above the bank's prime rate. Indiana-Kentucky may pay an annual fee
which would not exceed one percent of the face amount of the letter of credit. 
OVEC proposes to indemnify the bank issuing such letter of credit for any payments, or to guarantee the obligation
of Indiana-Kentucky to reimburse the bank of such payments. OVEC's obligation to the bank would be on the same terms
as Indiana-Kentucky's obligation to the bank. OVEC would charge no fee to Indiana-Kentucky for such indemnity or
guaranty. 


EUA Energy Investment Corporation (70-8351) 


EUA Energy Investment Corporation (``EEIC''), P.O. Box 2333, Boston, Massachusetts 02107, a non-utility subsidiary
of Eastern Utilities Associates, a registered holding company, has filed an application under Sections 9(a) and
10 of the Act. 
By order dated December 4, 1987 (HCAR No. 24515), as amended by order dated January 11, 1988 (HCAR No. 24515A) (collectively,
``Orders''), EUA was authorized to organize and finance a new subsidiary corporation (named NewCo in the Orders,
but chartered as EEIC) primarily for the purpose of participating in cogeneration and small power production facilities
and in related activities. EEIC also was authorized to conduct certain energy or energy conservation research and
to invest up to $2 million in the aggregate on such activities. Prior to acquiring an interest in any new business, EEIC
is required to seek further Commission authorization.

EEIC proposes to invest a total of $275,000 to be paid as consideration for the acquisition of 9.9% of the common stock
of Quality Power Systems, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation engaged in the manufacture, marketing and sale of uninterruptible
power systems, utility interface front-end power supplies and other electric and electronic devices and equipment.
EEIC further requests authorization to acquire without additional consideration such additional shares of the
common stock of QPS as EEIC from time to time may be entitled to receive to maintain a 9.9% ownership interest in QPS.

EEIC also proposes to provide consulting services directly to QPS.

In accordance with a stock purchase agreement (``Stock Purchase Agreement'') entered into on January 24, 1994, EEIC's
investment would be used by QPS for the development and marketing of low harmonic distortion Uninterruptible Power
Systems (``UPS'') manufactured by QPS under a license to QPS by Digital Equipment Corporation (``DEC'') pursuant
to a license agreement between QPS and DEC. The Stock Purchase Agreement also imposes several affirmative obligations
upon QPS to provide EEIC with certain financial and other reports, and it includes several negative covenants restricting
the ownership and control of QPS.

The primary purpose of the UPS is to improve the quality of power supplied by an electric utility provider to its customers
by reducing harmonic distortion at the interconnection between the utility and its customers. QPS achieves such
quality enhancement using DEC's HA6000 product, a system developed by DEC to satisfy new requirements being imposed
on power line conditioning equipment and uninterruptible power supplies by International Safety and Electrical
Manufacturing Compliance Standards.

It is stated that use of the HA6000 technology will permit electric utilities in the New England region to reduce harmonic
distortion in an extremely cost efficient manner by directing corrective attention specifically to customers whose
equipment contributes to harmonic distortion at utility interconnections and by providing such customers with
the lowest available rates on low maintenance modular units customized to such customers' respective needs. Customers
who have no power quality complaints will not be required to contribute to such corrective efforts, yet will benefit
from improved power servicing due to anticipated reductions in electric utilities' capacity requirements costs
upon implementation of the HA6000 systems.

It is also stated that EEIC and QPS believe that the increasing use of automation for demand side and load management
of energy needs and the proliferation of computers and other sensitive electronic equipment used by customers of
electric utilities will necessitate enhanced reduction of harmonic feedback into the distribution systems of electric
utilities.

Upon Commission approval of the proposed transactions, EEIC will enter into a stockholders agreement with QPS providing
for EEIC's designation of one out of six director positions on the board of directors of QPS, with any vacancy in such
position to be filled only by a subsequent designee of EEIC.

Extension of the Restriction on the Use of United States Passports for Travel To, In, or Through Iraq



On February 1, 1991, pursuant to the authority of 22 U.S.C. 211a and Executive Order 11295 (31 FR 10603), and in accordance
with 22 CFR 51.73(a) (2) and (3), all United States passports, with certain exceptions, were declared invalid for
travel to, in, or through Iraq unless specifically validated for such travel. The restriction was originally imposed
because armed hostilities then were taking place in Iraq and Kuwait, and because there was an imminent danger to the
safety of United States travellers to Iraq. American citizens then residing in Iraq and American professional reporters
and journalists on assignment there were exempted from the restrictions on the ground that such exemptions were in
the national interest. The restriction was extended for additional one year periods on February 18, 1992 and February
23, 1993.

Although armed hostilities have ended, conditions in Iraq remain unsettled and hazardous. Regional conflicts continue
in northern Iraq between Kurdish ethnic groups and Iraqi security forces. In southern Iraq, military repression
of the Shia communities is severe, rendering conditions unsafe. Iraq's economy was severely damaged during the Gulf
War and continues to be affected by the U.N. economic sanctions. Basic modern medical care and medicines may not be
available to our citizens in case of emergency. 

U.S. citizens and other foreigners working inside Kuwait near the Iraqi border have been detained by Iraqi authorities
in the past and sentenced to lengthy jail terms for illegal entry into the country. Although our interests are represented
by the Embassy of Poland in Baghdad, its ability to obtain consular access to detained U.S. citizens and to perform
emergency services is constrained by Iraqi unwillingness to cooperate. 

In light of these circumstances, I have determined that Iraq continues to be a country ``* * * where
there is imminent danger to the public health or physical safety of United States travelers.''

Accordingly, United States passports shall continue to be invalid for use in travel to, in, or through Iraq unless
specifically validated for such travel under the authority of the Secretary of State. The restriction shall not apply
to American citizens residing in Iraq on February 1, 1991 who continue to reside there, or to American professional
reporters or journalists on assignment there. 

The Public notice shall be effective upon publication in the 

Federal Register

 and shall expire at the end of one year unless sooner revoked or extended by Public notice.

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Impact Statement: Cities of Aberdeen and Hoquiam, WA</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared for a proposed
highway construction project in Grays Harbor County, Washington.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA in cooperation with the Washington State Department will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS)
on a proposal to improve State Route 101 (SR 101) in Grays Harbor County, Washington. The proposed project would select
and adopt a new highway alignment through the cities of Aberdeen and Hoquiam. The new alignment would begin at the intersection
of State Route 12 (SR 12) and terminate at the intersection with State Route 109 (SR 109), a distance of approximately
8 miles.


This highway improvement is considered necessary to alleviate congestion, decrease delays, and improve safety.
The SR 101 corridor through Aberdeen and Hoquiam is the main route between the metropolitan Puget Sound region, the
Pacific Ocean beaches and the western Olympic Peninsula, leading to extremely high traffic volumes during peak tourist
periods. Due to poor roadway geometrics, inadequate signal coordination, high volumes of port related truck traffic,
and under utilization of the designated truck by-pass through the port industrial area, operational conflicts between
heavy trucks and other vehicles result in severe congestion and delays. Accident rates are abnormally high through
the Central Business District due to conflicts between through traffic and vehicles utilizing on-street parking.
There are no alternate routes through the corridor. The proposed improvement would resolve congestion and safety
concerns by improving truck access to Grays Harbor port facilities and providing an alternate corridor for through
traffic.
Alternatives currently under consideration include (1) no action; (2) limited improvements to the existing alignment,
(3) two which would construct a new Hoquiam River Bridge crossing with limited improvements to the existing alignment,
(4) three separate new alignment alternatives, and (5) a multi modal alternative. Incorporated into and studied
with the various alternatives will be design variations for new bridges over the Wishkah and Hoquiam Rivers and completion
of the SR 101/SR 12 Interchange.
Announcements describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State
and local agencies. These will also be sent to affected Indian Tribes, private organizations and citizens who have
previously expressed or are known to have interest in this proposal. Scoping meetings will be held in Aberdeen on March
23rd and 24th, 1994. Additional public meetings will be held prior to the release of the Draft EIS on the project. In
addition, a public hearing will be held after the release of the Draft EIS to receive public and agency comments on the
EIS. Public notice will be given of the time and place of these future meetings and the hearing. The Draft EIS will be
available for public and agency review and comment prior to the public hearing.
It is important that the full range of issues related to this proposed action be addressed and that all significant
issues be identified. To ensure this, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments
or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address and phone number
provided above.

Improvements to the corridor are considered necessary to provide for the existing and projected traffic demand.
Also, included in this proposal is the replacement of an existing deficient bridge across the Missouri River and the
construction of a new interchange with U.S. Route 24. Alternatives under consideration include (1) taking no action;
(2) using alternate travel modes; (3) improvement of the existing two-lane roadway to four lanes; (4) constructing
a four-lane limited access highway on new location, and (5) constructing a four-lane fully access controlled highway
on new location. Incorporated into and studied with the various build alternatives will be design variations of grade
and alignment.

A scoping process has been initiated that is involving all appropriate Federal, State and local agencies and private
organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have interest in this proposal. A series
of public meetings are being held to obtain comments from the local and regional community. The first meeting was held
in Lexington in early January and was followed by a second meeting in early February, 1994. In addition, a public hearing
will be held. Public notice will be given of the time and place of the meetings and hearing. The draft EIS will be available
for public and agency review and comment prior to the public hearing.

To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments, and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed
action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA or MHTD at the addresses provided above.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an Environmental Impact Statement will be prepared for a proposed
highway project in Sumter County, Alabama.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the Alabama Department of Transportation, will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) on a proposal to improve a segment of U.S. Highway 80 in Sumter County, Alabama. The improvements begin near the
Alabama/Mississippi State Line at an existing four-lane road and extend approximately 33 kilometers (20.5 miles)
to Alabama State Route (SR) 28 west of the Tombigbee River. U.S. 80 east of SR 28 is a two-lane facility on existing four
lane right-of-way.





The improvements to the travel corridor are considered necessary to provide for the existing and projected traffic
demand. The type of roadway being considered is a four-lane controlled access freeway. Alternatives under consideration
include: (1) Alternate route locations, (2) taking no action, and (3) postponing the action.

Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local
agencies and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have an interest
in this proposal. A scoping meeting will be held in the Hightower Community Center, 615 Second Avenue, York, Alabama.
The program will begin at 1:30 p.m. Central Standard Time on Thursday, March 3, 1994. A public involvement meeting
will follow the scoping meeting. In addition, a public hearing will also be held. Public notice will be given of the
time and place of the meetings and hearings. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement will be available for public
and agency review and comment prior to the public hearings.


To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed
action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above.

Am-Safe, Inc.; Grant of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance


Am-Safe, Inc. (Am-Safe) of Phoenix, Arizona, determined that some of its replacement seat belt assemblies fail to
comply with 49 CFR 571.209, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 209, ``Seat Belt Assemblies,'' and
filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Am-Safe also petitioned
to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act
(15 U.S.C. 1381 

et seq.

) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety.
Notice of receipt of the petition was published on April 29, 1993, and an opportunity afforded for comment (58 FR 26032).
This notice grants that petition.
Between January 1985 and the date it filed its petition, Am-Safe produced and distributed approximately 100,000
replacement seat belts which did not include the installation and maintenance instructions required by Standard
No. 209.
Paragraph S4.1(k) of Standard No. 209, requires that:



A seat belt assembly or retractor shall be accompanied by an instruction sheet providing sufficient information
for installing the assembly in a motor vehicle except for a seat belt assembly installed in a motor vehicle by an automobile
manufacturer. The installation instructions shall state whether the assembly is for universal installation or
for installation only in specifically stated motor vehicles * * * .



In addition, section S.4.1(1) requires that:



A seat belt assembly or retractor shall be accompanied by written instructions for the proper use of the assembly,
stressing particularly the importance of wearing the assembly snugly and properly located on the body, and on the
maintenance of the assembly and periodic inspection of all components. The instructions shall show the proper manner
of threading webbing in the hardware of seat belt assemblies in which the webbing is not permanently fastened.



Am-Safe supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following:



No Evidence of Incorrectly Installed Seat Belts


[Am-Safe believes] the simplistic mounting design of these seat belts make [sic] it improbable that any incorrect
installations exist. Am-Safe, Inc. is unaware of any suggestions or allegations, in regards to motor vehicle safety,
concerning seat belts that were incorrectly installed.


[Am-Safe Sophisticated Part Numbering System


Seat belts are identified by a nine or ten digit part number. A typical seat belt part number is 502293-401-6.
The 502293 defines the basic belt configuration such as a retractable or nonretractable lap belt. The -401 specifies
the dimensions of [the] web and component cover lengths. The -6 is the color code when applicable. Permanently
affixed labels have pertinent information to ensure the proper seat belt is ordered for replacement. This label includes
the part number, manufacturing date, and name and phone number of the manufacturer. This accurate numbering system
can be confidently used for proper seat belt replacement.


Simple Installation Procedures


The seat belts in question are attached to the vehicle anchorage holes with existing mounting hardware. These assemblies
require only one bolt for attachment of the buckle half and one bolt for the attachment of the connector half. The accomplish
the installation of a replacement seat belt, the existing seat belt must first be removed from the vehicle. These steps
are then reversed for proper installation of the replacement seat belt. The majority of these replacements are performed
by individuals acquainted with seat belt installation, i.e.; seat manufacturers, transit but operators, and associated
companies [which] perform seat belt installation on a regular basis. In addition, the design and construction characteristics
of these seat belts reflect universal practices of operation and maintenance procedures.


Conclusion 


There is no evidence that any of the subject seat belts are incorrectly installed. These seat belts have been installed
and are currently in service without incident making a recall impractical. The complex part numbering system used
by Am-Safe, Inc. leaves little chance for error when ordering a replacement seat belt. In the majority of cases, installation
was performed by companies with experienced [personnel] familiar with correct procedures. [In i]nstances where
seat belts are knowingly distributed to the general public, Am-Safe, Inc. has always supplied appropriate instructions.
[As a] result of this noncompliance, Am-Safe, Inc. now includes these instructions with all seat belts unless otherwise
instructed by the vehicle manufactures. In conclusion, Am-Safe, Inc. believes that lack of instructions for seat
belts that are currently in service is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety.



No comments were received on the petition.
With respect to the failure to provide installation instructions, the petitioner has argued that its parts ordering
and shipping procedures ensure that the correct replacement parts are received by the dealer. Installation of the
belts is a simple procedure, requiring only one bolt for the attachment of the buckle half and one bolt for the attachment
of the connector half. These restraints are typically installed by persons who perform replacements on a regular
basis. After reviewing these arguments, NHTSA concurs with them.

With respect to the failure to provide usage and maintenance instructions, the petitioner has argued that this information
has always been provided with belts distributed to the general public. As for the belts covered by the petition, Am-Safe
has concluded that since they are currently in service, lack of instructions for maintenance and use at this point
is inconsequential as it relates to safety. With respect to this argument, NHTSA believes it more likely than not that
instructions accompanying packaged belts will be discarded once the belts are installed. In addition, similar petitions
from vehicle manufacturers have stated that maintenance and use instructions for belts are included in the operator's
manuals of the vehicles in which the replacement belts have been installed. Given the fact that all seat belts must
conform to Standard No. 209, NHTSA believes that there is such a sufficient similarity between belts of all manufacturers,
whether used as original or replacement equipment, that the maintenance and use instructions in any specific vehicle
operator's manual will be of general applicability.


For the foregoing reasons, the petitioner has met its burden of persuasion that the noncompliances herein described
are inconsequential as they relate to motor vehicle safety, and its petition is granted.

<DOCTITLE>Treasury Advisory Committee on Commercial Operations of the U.S. Customs Service</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Departmental Offices, Treasury.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of meeting.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the dates and locations of the next meetings and the agendas for consideration by the Treasury
Advisory Committee on Commercial Operations of the U.S. Customs Service.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I hereby determine pursuant to 5 U.S.C. app. 2, 10(d) and Treasury Order No. 101-05 that the premature disclosure
of the pending study and any proposals regarding the Customs Service's reorganization, would be likely to significantly
frustrate the implementation of a proposed plan to reorganize the Customs Service. Therefore, it is in the public's
interest that specific portions of the Committee's next meetings regarding the study and any proposals be closed
as permitted by 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(9)(B).


The Customs Reorganization Team has been soliciting and analyzing ideas for reorganizing the Customs Service to
improve its efficiency and the quality of its service. These ideas are highly inchoate and have not received the endorsement
of the Commissioner of Customs or the Treasury Department. The premature disclosure of this information would likely
initiate speculation about site closings or site reductions resulting in precipitous actions by Customs Service
employees and contractors as well as local residents and businesses. The premature disclosure of a proposal to close
a site may cause site employees to relocate or resign and local contractors to eliminate services, thus frustrating
the Customs Service's ability to later keep a site open when a reorganization plan is implemented.
The preliminary agenda to be considered during the meetings on April 7 and 8, 1994 is as follows:


April 7, 1994: 3:30 p.m.: Customs Reorganization Team Findings (Closed Session).
April 8, 1994.
I. Closed Session (9 a.m.).
1. Customs Reorganization Team Findings.
II. Open Session (Approximately 11 a.m.).
1. North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation.
2. Customs Modernization Act Implementation.
2. Briefing and Discussion of U.S. Textile Program after the Uruguay Round with Ms. Rita Hayes, Deputy Assistant Secretary
for Textiles, Apparel and Consumer Goods Industries, U.S. Department of Commerce.
With the exception of the closed portion indicated, the April 8 meeting is open to the public. However, it is necessary
for any person other than an Advisory Committee member who wishes to attend the meeting to give advance notice. In order
to be admitted to the meeting, contact Ms. Theresa Manning at (202) 622-0220 no later than April 1, 1994. Details
and confirmation of meeting room and time may be obtained from Ms. Manning.

 Notice of availability of funds.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) announces the availability of funds for
planning and demonstration projects to promote the goals of development and widespread availability of advanced
telecommunications technologies; to enhance the delivery of social services and generally serve the public interest;
to promote access to government information and increase civic participation; and to support the advancement of
an advanced nationwide telecommunications and information infrastructure.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Authority



The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), Department of Commerce, serves as the
President's principal adviser on telecommunications and information policy. NTIA's functions were codified as
part of the Telecommunications Authorization Act of 1992, Public Law 102-538, 106 Stat. 3533, 47 U.S.C. 901-04
(1993).

The Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1993,
Public Law 103-121, 107 Stat. 1153 (1993), provides the Department of Commerce $26 million in assistance for
public telecommunications facilities under 47 U.S.C. 390-393A (1991), to be used for the planning and construction
of telecommunications networks for the provision of educational, cultural, health care, public information, public
safety or other social services (notwithstanding the requirements of 47 U.S.C. 392 (a) and (c)).



Program Description



NTIA announces a competitive grant program, the TIIAP, created to advance the goals of the Administration's National
Information Infrastructure (NII) initiative. Major goals of the NII initiative include: The promotion of private
sector investment through appropriate tax and regulatory policies; the extension of universal service so that information
is available to all at affordable prices, using the widest variety of appropriate technologies; the promotion of
technological innovation and new applications; wider access to government information; and guarantees of information
security and network reliability.

The TIIAP will provide matching grants to state and local governments, non-profit health care providers, school
districts, libraries, universities, public safety services, and other non-profit entities. Grants will be awarded
after a competitive merit review process and will be used to fund projects to connect institutions to existing networks
and systems, enhance communications networks and systems that are currently operational, establish new network
capabilities, permit users to interconnect among different networks and systems, and bring more users on-line.
Equally important, they will help leverage the resources and creativity of the private sector to devise new applications
and uses of the NII. The success of these pilot projects will create an ongoing process that will generate more innovative
approaches each year.



Funding Availability



Congress appropriated $26 million for competitive information infrastructure grants in fiscal year 1994 for the
planning and construction of telecommunications networks for the enhancement of equal opportunity and the provision
of educational, cultural, health care, public information, library, public safety or other social services. NTIA
expects that the level of competition will be extremely high. The overall level of funding will place obvious limits
on the amount of funding available for individual grants, although NTIA anticipates receiving a wide range of grant
proposals.

Currently, there is pending legislation to authorize an infrastructure grant program for fiscal years 1995 and 1996
that would continue to advance the goals of the grant program described in this Notice for fiscal year 1994 funds. NTIA
anticipates that the pending authorization legislation will, if enacted, prescribe standards fully consistent
with the criteria set forth in this Notice (criteria that are set as a matter of NTIA's administrative discretion,
consistent with NTIA's existing statutory authorities; see 47 U.S.C. 392 (1991)). Nevertheless, it must be emphasized
that, until new authorizing legislation is enacted, NTIA cannot unequivocally state what specific criteria it will
apply in evaluating grant applications for fiscal years 1995 and 1996. Accordingly, the criteria described below
apply only to fiscal year 1994 project proposals.



Matching Requirements



Grant recipients under this program will be required to provide matching funds toward the total project cost. NTIA
will provide up to fifty per cent (50%) of the total project cost, unless extraordinary circumstances warrant a grant
of up to seventy-five per cent (75%). A project will not be considered grantable unless the applicant can document
a capacity both to supply matching funds, and to sustain the project beyond the period of the award. Cash matching is
highly desirable; however, NTIA will allow in-kind matching on a case-by-case basis. Federal funds may not be used
as matching monies. Grant funds under this program will be released in direct proportion to local matching funds raised
and/or documented.



Type of Funding Instrument



The funding instrument for awards under this program shall be a grant.



Eligibility Criteria



The fiscal year 1994 grant cycle of the TIIAP is divided into two separate categories. Category One supports the efforts
of all eligible applicants (state and local governments, as well as non-profit entities) to develop their information
infrastructures through demonstration projects. NTIA considers this to be the principal funding category. Category
Two focuses on planning grants, and is further divided into two subcategories. The first subcategory supports planning
efforts that project a statewide, multi-state, or national impact. The second subcategory supports the planning
efforts with an intrastate or local impact. State and local governments, as well as multi-state and/or non-profit
entities are eligible to apply in all categories.



Award Period



Successful applicants will have between six and eighteen months to complete their projects. The actual time will
vary depending on the complexity of any particular project. During the award period, NTIA has a duty to monitor and
evaluate the projects it funds through the TIIAP. Typically, monitoring will involve site visits by NTIA staff and
designated evaluators, informal telephone contact, and evaluation of the grantees' written reports. NTIA also
expects that grantees, working with NTIA, will evaluate the results of their projects, and formalize and disseminate
information about the lessons learned therefrom. Further information on NTIA's duty to monitor funded projects,
as well as NTIA's evaluation expectations, is contained in the grant application kit.

Indirect Costs



The total dollar amount of the indirect costs proposed in an application under this program must not exceed the indirect
cost rate negotiated and approved by a cognizant Federal agency prior to the proposed effective date of the award or
one hundred per cent (100%) of the total proposed direct costs dollar amount in the application, whichever is less.




Application Forms and Kit



 Standard Forms 424, Application for Federal Assistance; 424A, Budget Information_Non-Construction Programs;
and 424B, Assurances_Non-Construction Programs, (Rev 4-88), shall be used in applying for financial assistance.
The forms used in the Application are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, and have been cleared by the Office of
Management and Budget under Control Numbers 0348-0043, 0348-0044, and 0348-0040. Application
kits may be obtained by writing to the address listed in the 

ADDRESSES

 section above. 



Project Funding Priorities



Funding under the TIIAP will be awarded to support projects that most effectively enhance economic opportunity,
the provision of education, culture, health care, public information, library, public safety, social services,
or other efforts to meet public needs; and that support the further development of a nationwide, high-speed, interactive
infrastructure, incorporating the widest variety of information technologies. The number of proposals that will
receive funding in each of the two categories will depend, in large measure, on the total number of applications that
NTIA receives. Because the aggregate funding level of individual grants cannot be determined in advance, applicants
must justify the amounts requested. 

NTIA anticipates that approximately sixty per cent (60%) of the funds appropriated for this grant program will be
devoted to demonstration projects, with approximately forty per cent (40%) of the funds devoted to planning grants
for states, local governments, regional entities, and non-profit entities. Details of funding priorities within
these categories are as follows: 



Priority in Category One_Demonstration Projects 



A priority for demonstration project grants is that the project develop a model that others can follow. An important
element of this model is a plan for disseminating the knowledge gained as a result of carrying out the project. In NTIA's
view, this nation's telecommunications infrastructure should reinforce the values of American democracy, and
the TIIAP should support projects that empower citizens, promote equal opportunity, protect individuals' rights,
and strengthen democratic institutions. 

Therefore, within the context of this category, all applications in the public interest are candidates for support;
however, principal consideration will be given to telecommunications and information applications that promote
economic opportunity and the effective provision of education, health care, public safety, libraries, community
information services, creation of information empowerment zones, and other approaches that foster public participation
in the political process and civic life. 



Priorities in Category Two_Planning Grants 



Statewide, Regional, and National Planning Grants 



Priority consideration will be given to projects whose impact will be statewide, regional (multi-state), or national.
A component of this category will be support for states to engage in comprehensive telecommunications infrastructure
planning, particularly those states that have not yet developed detailed strategies for their respective information
infrastructures. NTIA will also consider, but with a lower priority, applications from states that have developed
comprehensive plans, but seek further improvement in these plans. NTIA also encourages proposals from multi-state
consortia, as well as from organizations, or coalitions of organizations, for regional or national telecommunications
infrastructure planning. 



Local and Intrastate Planning Grants 



NTIA will deem most competitive those projects that clearly and demonstrably further the goals of this program at
a community, county, or multi-county level. While the focus of this subcategory is local, NTIA encourages collaborations
among counties, communities, and public and private organizations at the local or regional level, as well as coordination
with state agencies involved with telecommunications infrastructure planning and implementation. 



Evaluation Criteria
 


A. General Criteria 



As a network of networks, the telecommunications component of the National Information Infrastructure will never
be a single entity. In fact, telecommunications networks and systems in the United States have been growing and evolving
for more than a century. This trend will continue (and supporting it is a primary policy goal of the NII initiative),
driven by technological innovation, market forces, and the elaboration of increasingly sophisticated and varied
information delivery systems throughout the world. Applicants should be aware of this trend, and configure their
proposed projects to take advantage of existing and emerging standards for interoperability. 

The success of any grant program depends upon its ability to fund only those projects that are well thought out and comprehensively
planned. Therefore, no funds will be expended under this program unless the project demonstrates the most economic
and efficient use of scarce Federal resources. Other general criteria that all applicants should address are:

<PARENT> FR940304-2-00114 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. Technical Considerations 



A major goal of the NII is the integration of networks. The TIIAP will not foster stand-alone, ``dedicated networks,''
that are incapable, for either technical or practical reasons, of interconnecting with other networks and systems.
In part, applicants will be judged on the extent to which they plan to coordinate information infrastructure activities
in their state, in neighboring states, or in the region. Applicants should address the technical aspects of their
information infrastructure projects. Proposals should address interconnectivity, the capacity of one system
to easily transfer digital information to another system, at the state, regional, national, and international level,
as appropriate. Whether the information infrastructure will be expandable is another important issue. The standards,
codes, and protocols that will allow for interoperability should be addressed in this section. Finally, the capacity
for interactivity should be described in detail. 



2. Partnerships 



NTIA will look favorably on joint applications from partnerships of two or more entities. For this reason, applicants
should be aware of other relevant information infrastructure projects in the state or region. To the extent possible,
applicants should plan to coordinate their projects with other relevant projects. 



3. Innovation and Experimentation 



An overriding goal of the TIIAP is to foster innovation and experimentation in the uses and benefits that accrue from
information infrastructure, while at the same time rewarding those projects which display innovative approaches
to the problem of ensuring individual privacy. For this reason, the program will carefully assess projects from the
perspective of technology or technologies deployed, current applications supported, and the potential for growth
in the range of services provided. As noted above, NTIA expects applicants to consider carefully the status of the
existing infrastructure; however, applicants should be willing, when appropriate, to experiment with new uses
and applications of the information infrastructure supported under this program. 



4. Privacy 



As noted above, NTIA expects applicants to consider carefully safeguards for the privacy of the information flowing
through the information infrastructure funded through this grant program. While not mandating specifics, NTIA
expects applicants to demonstrate a high level of respect for the privacy of users' information and data. Applicants
proposing projects dealing with individually identifiable information will be required to prescribe mechanisms
for protecting individual privacy. In addition, NTIA expects applicants to comply fully with all applicable privacy
laws. 



5. Eliminating Disparity of Access 



One of the key roles for government in the NII is to promote equity of access, so that the information age does not create
information ``haves'' and ``have nots.'' Applicants should address how they intend to support the goal of promoting
widespread access, and eliminating or reducing disparities in access, to the information infrastructure, consistent
with the scope of the project. For purposes of this grant cycle, NTIA will look favorably on proposals that enable ordinary
Americans to learn how to use, or benefit from, information infrastructure, without unreasonable burden or expense.
Applicants should also consider how to train end-users in the use of information technologies. This section should
address questions such as: 




How will the applicant's proposal help ensure end-user ease of access to the telecommunications infrastructure?


How will the planning or implementation process encourage community development? 

How will the planning or implementation process address the issue of access to the information infrastructure by
minorities, disadvantaged, or otherwise under-served populations?

6. Role of Existing Information Infrastructure 


By a variety of measures, the United States' existing information infrastructure is the most advanced in the world.
Therefore, if an applicant requests support to construct new transmission capacity, there should be a clear discussion
of why utilization of existing networks and systems cannot be relied upon efficiently and economically to meet the
project's needs. A proposal should address whether incorporation of existing information infrastructure into
the overall plan is feasible. Under this section, applicants should address questions such as: 



What information infrastructure is currently available to the applicant? 
How can commercial and non-commercial providers of telecommunications and information services help the applicant
meet its information needs? 


7. Accommodation of Future Technology and Flexibility 


As communications and information technologies rapidly evolve and improve, existing technology can quickly become
obsolete. For this reason, all applicants should consider how they intend to address this issue. The capacity for
upgrades and improvements, as well as the flexibility to accommodate changes in the volume or types of uses, should
be considered from the beginning of any planning or development process. 


8. Contribution to the Formation of the National Information Infrastructure 


Applicants should explain how their proposed projects can make a contribution to the development of the National
Information Infrastructure. Some questions that an applicant could consider are: 




What applications and services are being provided through the existing information infrastructure? 
How will the project ensure connectivity to other systems outside the immediate state or community? 
What monitoring or evaluation plan will be utilized? 


B. Specific Evaluative Criteria 


1. Category One_Demonstration Projects 


a. 

Eligibility.

 
This category is open to any state or local government, or any non-profit entity. For purposes of this notice, a ``local
government'' is any branch of government below the state level. This term also includes special purpose subdivisions,
or government-funded entities that have responsibilities beyond the political boundaries of a single state, and
Indian Tribal governments. A ``non-profit'' entity is any foundation, association, or corporation, no part of the
net earnings of which inures, or may lawfully inure, to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual. This
is the same definition used in 47 U.S.C. 397 (1991). 
b. 

Evaluative criteria.

 
A major criterion under this category will be the capability of the applicant actually to carry out the proposed project
and/or the applicant's ability to deliver the proposed service or services. In addition to the general evaluative
criteria set forth above, applicants for demonstration projects should address the following criteria in their
applications: (1) 

Connection to end-users.

 In formulating their proposals, applicants should be mindful of the needs of eventual end-users. Any system or network
proposed for NTIA funding should include capacity for providing a range of information services, consistent both
with the mission of the entity and the present and future requirements of end-users. Questions applicants might address
are:




To what degree does the project duplicate other services available to users in the projected service area? 
To what degree does the project include provisions for multifunctional activities_such as education, health care,
community information services, etc._and access to related information sources? 
Will the project be structured to respond to increased demands for services from users? 



(2) 

Efficiency and economy.

 In this era of limited fiscal resources, it is essential that each dollar be spent in the most efficient and economical
manner possible. Some questions that the applicant might consider under this criterion are: 



Is the proposed acquisition of information infrastructure, with NTIA grant funds, the most efficient and economical?

Why is the applicant's choice of technology the most appropriate to the proposal? 
How will the system or equipment funded by NTIA be maintained? Is its operation assured for a reasonable amount of time
after installation?

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940304-2-00202 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940304-2-00114 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

How does the applicant intend to deal with rapidly changing technology and issues of obsolescence? 
What role will available commercial services play in the proposed project? 




(3) 

End-user support. 

A large barrier to more successful utilization of information infrastructure is the end-user's inability to employ
it. Therefore, applicants should consider how end-users will be trained to use the equipment and network. Some questions
that the applicant might address are: 




Are there specialized training requirements for the system? 
Who is best qualified to provide the training? 
Can end-users use the system to produce and disseminate information, as well as gain access to information? 
Is the system or network user friendly, so that it does not discourage new users, or those who are not ``computer literate?''




c. 

Financial information. 

Grant funds may be spent on purchase of telecommunications infrastructure equipment, long-term lease of services,
end-user support, and other expenses reasonably related to the project. 


2. Category Two_Planning Grants 


Statewide, Regional, and National Planning Grants 


a. Eligibility 


For purposes of this section_Statewide, Regional, and National Planning Grants_eligible applicants are any of
the fifty states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, America Samoa, and the Marianas
Islands, as well as multi-state consortia, coalitions of organizations, or national entities. 


b. Evaluative Criteria 


In addition to the general evaluative criteria set forth above, applicants for planning projects should address
the following criteria in their applications: (1) 

Objectives.

 Proposals should be consistent with the long range NII objective of fostering seamless, multi-functional networks.
Accordingly, applicants should consider the concept of ``interoperability,'' the view that every system, no matter
its level of sophistication or geographic extent, is part, ultimately, of a global communication system that allows
one end-user to communicate ``transparently'' with another end-user, irrespective of distance or time. 
(2) 

End-users.

 In their proposals, applicants should identify the end-users of the information infrastructure. Considerations
of numbers of users, the diversity of anticipated end-users, and what social good the applicant expects from implementation
of its plan may help determine what strategies states will adopt. Under this section, applicants could address questions
such as:

 

How will the widespread availability of telecommunications and information infrastructure capabilities be promoted
within the proposal? 
How should the costs of ensuring adequate access be allocated? 
Will the plan stimulate demand for new telecommunications services? 
How will the plan address the needs of previously disenfranchised potential users? 
What steps are necessary to ensure end-user ease of access? What are the respective roles of the state and private sector
in taking these steps? 



(3) 

Incorporation of broad input. 

There are many individuals and sectors of society with a stake in the information infrastructure. How an applicant
intends to incorporate their opinions and concerns into the final plan is crucial to the eventual successful implementation
of the plan. Applicants should address how they intend to incorporate comments from the public into the planning process.
The breadth and depth of representation, including a balanced representation of rural and urban, professional,
socioeconomic, ethnic, cultural and other relevant interests, is important. Some questions for an applicant to
address under this section are: 



To what extent will the applicant work to promote public/private partnerships? 
What procedures will ensure that individuals and entities can provide input? 
What state and national agencies and private sector entities will be involved, and at what levels? 
What monitoring or evaluation plan will be utilized? 




c. 

Financial information.

 Grant funds may be spent on information collection, salaries, travel, lodging, and other expenses reasonably related
to planning activities.

Local and Intrastate Planning Grants 



a. Eligibility 



This section supports development of planning and/or implementation strategies of local governments, intrastate
multi-community or multi-county entities, and local non-profit organizations. 



b. Evaluative Criteria 



Many of the evaluative criteria applied to the previous planning grant category_questions of interoperability,
identification of end-users, and incorporation of broad input_are germane to Local and Intrastate Planning Grant
applications. 



(1) Objectives 



Although the focus of this subcategory is considerably less ``global'' than for Statewide, Regional, and National
Planning Grants, proposals in this subcategory should nevertheless exhibit the same consistency with the long range
NII objective of fostering seamless, multi-functional networks. Accordingly, questions of interoperability
and connectivity should be carefully considered. 

Within the context of this subcategory, a number of questions become especially relevant:




What provisions in the plan have been made to address crucial ``last mile'' connectivity questions? 

Is sufficient technical and operational expertise available at the local level to ensure efficient planning and
subsequent implementation? 

Will service provider and/or end-user acceptance of new or expanded telecommunications services present any special
difficulties? 



(2) Formation of Partnerships 



NTIA will consider favorably applications that demonstrate a partnership among groups of communities or entities
for the purpose of pooling and leveraging resources. This does not mean that these groups should come together merely
for the purpose of obtaining a federal grant. This partnership or coalition should demonstrate that it will continue
to function and operate effectively once the NTIA grant is concluded.




Can the local resources of national or regional organizations, both public and private, be enlisted in support of
the planning effort? 

What unique linguistic, social, cultural, political, or economic impediments exist locally that might hinder the
planning effort? 



(3) Innovation and Experimentation 



Information infrastructure has evolved and been use
