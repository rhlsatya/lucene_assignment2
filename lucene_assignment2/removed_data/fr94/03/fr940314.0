Special Pay Entitlements for Law Enforcement Officers



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in conformance with amendments to the Federal Employees Pay Comparability
Act of 1990 (FEPCA) made by the Technical and Miscellaneous Civil Service Amendments Act of 1992, is issuing final
regulations to amend the definition of ``law enforcement officer'' for certain pay purposes and expand coverage
of the special maximum limitation on relocation bonuses for law enforcement officers to five additional categories
of law enforcement employees.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On January 8, 1993, OPM published interim regulations to implement certain provisions of the Technical and Miscellaneous
Civil Service Amendments Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-378, October 2, 1992). These provisions include (1) an expanded
definition of ``law enforcement officer'' in section 5541 of title 5, United States Code (with conforming amendments
in 5 U.S.C. 4521, 5542, and 5547, and section 402 of FEPCA); (2) an amendment to section 404 of FEPCA to provide OPM with
the authority to determine the extent to which a special pay adjustment for law enforcement officers may be paid to
an employee receiving a special salary rate under 5 U.S.C. 5305 or similar provision of law; and (3) an amendment to
section 405 of FEPCA to extend application of the special maximum limitation on relocation bonuses for law enforcement
officers to the categories of law enforcement employees listed in section 405 of FEPCA_i.e., Park Police officers,
Secret Service Uniformed Division officers, special agents in the Diplomatic Security Service, and probation and
pretrial services officers.





The 60-day public comment period ended on March 9, 1993. Comments were received from one Federal agency, one employee
organization, and one individual. These comments are summarized below.



Expanded Definition of ``Law Enforcement Officer''



An agency commented that the provisions in the technical amendments to FEPCA providing special pay adjustments for
supervisory and administrative law enforcement employees who are not eligible for special law enforcement retirement
coverage are confusing and that the criteria should be applied consistently across the board. These provisions are
in law, and OPM does not have the authority to change them. The law provides four definitions of ``law enforcement officer''
for purposes of special pay adjustments that differ according to an employee's retirement coverage and whether his
or her position is or is not supervisory or administrative.

An employee who meets the definition of ``law enforcement officer'' in section 5541(3) of title 5, United States Code,
must also be subject to the provisions of chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code (Classification), in order to be
entitled to a special pay adjustment provided by section 404 of FEPCA. To meet the definition, an employee must be a
``law enforcement officer'' who_

(1) Is subject to the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), is
in a primary (nonsupervisory) or secondary (supervisory or administrative) law enforcement position, and is actually
covered by the corresponding special law enforcement retirement provisions of CSRS or FERS;

(2) Is subject to (CSRS), is in a secondary (supervisory or administrative) position that has been approved for law
enforcement retirement purposes, but is not eligible for law enforcement retirement coverage;

(3) Is subject to FERS and, as in (2), is in an approved secondary position, but is not eligible for law enforcement retirement
coverage; or

<PARENT> FR940314-0-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) Is not subject to either CSRS or FERS and is in a position that OPM determines would satisfy one of the other three
conditions cited above.

In addition, an employee who has had law enforcement retirement coverage granted retroactively for service while
subject to 5 U.S.C. chapter 51 is entitled to the special pay adjustment retroactively.

An agency commented that there is a lack of congruence between the definitions of ``law enforcement officer'' under
CSRS and FERS and that the classification standards should provide specific guidance for linking law enforcement
duties to the definition of ``law enforcement officer'' for retirement purposes. Questions that arise concerning
law enforcement duties for the purpose of determining an employee's entitlement to these special pay adjustments
must be handled within the context of the technical amendments to FEPCA and law enforcement retirement law and regulations.
Such issues are not within the scope of a classification standard. Adding a discussion of these issues to classification
standards would add unnecessarily to the complexity of the standards without adding materially to the quality of
information already provided.

An employee organization commented that the definitions of ``law enforcement officer'' in these regulations should
provide guidance on specific positions, job series, or duties. Such guidance is beyond the scope of these regulations.
The criteria for approval of a position as a primary or secondary law enforcement position are in 5 CFR part 831, subpart
I, for employees subject to CSRS, and in 5 CFR part 842, subpart H, for employees subject to FERS. Most employees who
are covered by law enforcement retirement provisions are criminal investigators, Border Patrol Agents, Deputy
U.S. Marshals, correctional officers, or support personnel in correctional institutions who have frequent and
direct contact with inmates. Most Federal police officers are not covered by law enforcement retirement provisions.



Basic Pay for Computation of Special Pay Adjustments



An agency commented that some of its attorneys and accountants are on nationwide special rates under 5 U.S.C. 5305
that are not specifically related to law enforcement duties. Some of these attorneys and accountants have been granted
retroactive coverage under the law enforcement retirement provisions. The agency believes special pay adjustments
for LEO's should not be based on nationwide special rates unless the special rates are directly related to law enforcement
duties.

The interim regulations for special pay entitlements for law enforcement officers published on January 8, 1993,
provided for computation of special pay adjustments on the basis of a nationwide or worldwide special salary rate
under 5 U.S.C. 5305. Such a rate was included in the definition of ``scheduled annual rate of pay'' in  531.301
of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations.

In developing regulations for the implementation of locality-based comparability payments under 5 U.S.C. 5304,
OPM determined that a special law enforcement adjusted rate of pay should not be based on a nationwide or worldwide
special salary rate under 5 U.S.C. 5305. The final regulations for locality-based comparability payments published
on December 30, 1993, [58 FR 69169] removed special rates of pay under 5 U.S.C. 5305 from the definition of ``scheduled
annual rate of pay'' in  531.301. It should be noted that special pay adjustments continue to be based on the special
rates for law enforcement officers provided by section 403 of FEPCA. For law enforcement officers who were receiving
special pay adjustments on top of special rates under 5 U.S.C. 5305, the regulations established a continued rate
of pay equal to the rate received before this change became effective so that there would be no loss in pay.



Miscellaneous



The Office of Management and Budget changed the title of the Boston CMSA to the Boston-Worcester-Lawrence, MA-NH-ME-CT
CMSA, effective on June 30, 1993. (Although the title of the Boston CMSA changed, the geographic coverage did not change).
Also, section 628 of the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1994 (Pub. L. 103-123,
October 28, 1993), amended section 404 of FEPCA by striking ``Washington, DC-MD-VA Metropolitan Statistical
Area'' and inserting in its place ``Washington-Baltimore, DC-MD-VA-WV Consolidated Metropolitan
Statistical Area.'' This amendment became effective on October 28, 1993. Accordingly, OPM is revising the titles
of the Boston and Washington metropolitan statistical areas in paragraph (a) of the definition of ``special pay adjustment
area'' ( 531.301) and in the chart in  531.302(a).

An individual called OPM staff by telephone and pointed out that an incorrect citation for the definition of ``law
enforcement officer'' was used in 5 CFR 575.302. OPM is revising  575.302 to substitute the correct reference.

OPM is taking this opportunity to make technical corrections to two additional regulatory sections to conform with
changes in law. The Technical and Miscellaneous Civil Service Amendments Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-378, October
2, 1992) revised the divisor for computing overtime pay for certain prevailing rate employees (i.e., those employees
whose pay is fixed on either a monthly or annual basis) from 2,080 to 2,087. The amendment became effective on the first
day of the first pay period beginning on or after October 2, 1992. OPM is revising 5 CFR 550.113 accordingly.

In addition, OPM is correcting erroneous citations in 5 CFR 531.205(a) (3) and (4) by removing the reference to ``5
U.S.C. 5305'' and inserting ``5 U.S.C. 5303.'' Prior to enactment of FEPCA, annual adjustments to pay schedules were
covered under section 5305 of title 5, United States Code. As a result of the FEPCA amendments, annual adjustments
are now covered under section 5303. The references in  531.205(a) must be changed accordingly.



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because they apply only to Federal agencies and employees.

Prevailing Rate Systems; Champaign, Illinois, NAF Wage Area



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a final regulation to abolish the Champaign, IL, Federal Wage
System nonappropriated fund (NAF) wage area for pay-setting purposes. With the closing of Chanute Air Force Base
in August 1993, the only NAF employees remaining in the Champaign wage area are those located in Vermilion County,
IL. This regulation assigns Vermilion County to the Marion, IN, NAF wage area.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On November 10, 1993, OPM published an interim rule abolishing the Champaign, IL, Federal Wage System NAF wage area
and assigning Vermilion County, IL, to the Marion, IN, wage area (58 FR 59639). OPM received no comments during the
30-day comment period. However, the interim regulation gave a March 4, 1994, effective date coinciding with the anticipated
effective date of the Marion wage schedule (reflecting the 90-day delay required by law since 1984). Since the publication
of the interim rule, Public Law 103-123, which phases out the 90-day delay, was enacted. The new law provides
that wage adjustments will be effective on the later of the normal wage adjustment date for the wage area or the first
day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1, 1994. The normal wage adjustment dates for both the Champaign
and Marion wage areas were in December 1933. Hence under the new law, wage adjustments for both of these wage areas would
be effective on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1, 1994. Because of the interim rule
abolishing the Champaign NAF wage area, there is no new wage schedule for Champaign. In order that Vermilion County
employees may receive a pay adjustment in January 1994, as required by Public Law 103-123, the effective date
of the wage area redefinition must be changed from March 4, 1994, to January 1, 1994.



Waiver of 30-Day Delay in Effective Date of Final Regulation 



Pursuant to section 553(d)(3) of title 5 of the United States Code, I find that good cause exists to make this amendment
effective in less than 30 days. The regulation is being made effective retroactively to January 1, 1994, so that Vermilion
County employees may receive the pay adjustment required by Public Law 103-123.





Regulatory Flexibility Act




I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because they will affect only Federal agencies and employees.

Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program; Grants 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Rural Electrification Administration, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) hereby amends its regulation on the Rural Economic Development
Loan and Grant Program. This amended regulation establishes procedures for approving and administering grants,
clarifying the eligible uses of grant funds, supplemental funds requirements, and administrative requirements
for grant funds. The amendments contained in this final rule will facilitate the process whereby REA borrowers can
apply to REA for community development grant funding. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Executive Order 12866 



This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been
reviewed by OMB. 



Executive Order 12778 



This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Will not preempt any
State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule; (2)
will not have any retroactive effect; and (3) will not require administrative proceedings before parties may file
suit challenging the provisions of this rule. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Administrator certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). Based on current and historical funding levels for this program and a projected average size loan and/or grant in
the range of $300,000 to $400,000, it is estimated that 50 to 60 loans and/or grants will be made nationwide each year.
It is projected that the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program will have a limited impact upon small businesses
because of the program's unique delivery system; i.e., loans and grants will be made through REA financed electric
and telephone cooperatives or companies. These entities do not operate as credit institutions, thus they do not seek
funds for the expressed purpose of loan portfolio expansion. Rather, REA financed entities request REA funding through
this program to enhance economic development in rural areas by funding a limited number of selected development projects.
Since credit is channeled to areas which are generally underdeveloped and financially depressed, job creation and
economic development resulting from newly emerging businesses and community facilities funded by REA does not pose
undue competition or other adverse effects upon existing businesses. Therefore, this final rule will have no effect
upon businesses or entities other than those to be funded through this program. 



National Environmental Policy Act Certification 



The Administrator has determined that this final rule will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment
as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

). Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment. 



Intergovernmental Review 



The program is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials, with the exception of applications for Project Feasibility Studies. A notice informing
the public of the intergovernmental review coverage was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 20, 1989, at 54 FR 11426. 



Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance 



This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.854, Rural Economic Development
Loans and Grants. This catalog is available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, the United
States Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402-9325. 



Information Collection and Recordkeeping Requirements 



In compliance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations (5 CFR part 1320) which implement the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 9609511) and section 3504 of that Act, the information collection and recordkeeping
requirements contained in this final rule have been approved by OMB under control number 
0572-0090. Comments concerning these requirements should be directed to the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for USDA, room 3201, NEOB, Washington, DC 20503. 



Background 



On February 15, 1989, REA published the final rule, 7 CFR 1709, subpart B, in the 

Federal Register

 (54 FR 6867), implementing the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program to provide funds to REA Borrowers
under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (7 USC 901 

et seq.

) (Act). This program provides zero-interest loans to REA Borrowers for the promotion of rural economic development
and job creation projects. On September 27, 1990, REA changed the designation of this rule from 7 CFR part 1709 to part
1703 (55 FR 39394). On September 25, 1992, REA published a final rule in 7 CFR 1703 subpart B (57 FR 44317) to revise the
loan program. The revision provided additional information to potential applicants on the selection factors and
rating criteria, allowed monthly submittal of applications and established a maximum amount of project funding
as a fixed percentage of allocated funds. Subsequently, a proposed rule was published on October 12, 1993 (58 FR 52688),
to establish procedures for approving and administering grants and make minor changes to enhance the overall program
delivery for the zero-interest loan and grant program. This final rule contains the provisions set forth in the proposed
rule published October 12, 1993.

This rule contains provisions for grant funds to be used for the following purposes: 
1. The establishment and/or operation of a revolving loan fund by REA Borrowers; and, 
2. Pass-through grants in conjunction with loans for: (a) Project feasibility studies and technical assistance
for community development, business start-ups, business planning, and market research, (b) business incubators
established by non-profit organizations, (c) community development assistance by non-profit organizations,
(d) projects operated on a profit or non-profit basis that enhance the overall quality of medical care of rural residents,
and (e) projects by profit or non-profit organizations which encourage the use of advanced telecommunications for
educational and medical services. 
Several conditions for grant making have been established under this program in order to maximize the benefits of
the grant program, conserve the limited funds available, and provide for the efficient administration of grant making
by REA: 
1. With the exception of the establishment and/or operation of a revolving loan program, grants will be made only in
conjunction with rural development loans. For grants to REA Borrowers to establish revolving loan funds, REA Borrowers
will be required to commit their funds in an amount no less than 20 percent of the REA grant. For all other projects eligible
for loan and grant funding, that portion of project cost eligible for REA funding may be funded up to 20 percent with
grant funds. 
2. As with zero-interest loans, all REA projects funded with grants will require a minimum of 20 percent supplemental
funding for project costs. Supplemental funds may come from the project owner in the form of equity funds, private
sources, state and local government sources, other Federal Government sources, the borrower, or other sources.

3. For grants made in conjunction with zero-interest loans, grant funding will be provided only in sufficient amount
necessary for a feasible project. A project which generates sufficient revenue to show feasibility without grant
funds is not eligible for a grant. 
4. In determining the eligible amount of a grant, REA will base the appropriate amount of grant funding on a typical
year of operation, when the project has generally reached its target income earning potential. 
5. Grant funding will be channeled, to the extent practicable, to non-profit entities which have a broad impact on
rural economies. However, grant funding will be available for project feasibility studies and technical assistance
irrespective of entity status. Also, grant funding will be provided irrespective of entity status for enhancement
of medical care and advanced telecommunications for educational and medical services.

In addition to grant making provisions, several changes have been made to the loan provisions of the Rural Economic
Development Loan and Grant Program. These changes, addressed in detail in the proposed rule published on October
12, 1993, are as follows:

(1) Paragraph (d) of  1703.21 has been revised to require Borrowers to deposit zero-interest loan funds into
their construction accounts.

(2) Paragraph (b) of  1703.28 has been revised to eliminate the $400,000 limitation on the size of zero-interest
loans and grants and set the maximum amount not to exceed 3 percent of the projected amount of zero-interest loan and
grant funds available each year. However, the REA Administrator will retain the authority to limit funding below
the 3 percent level, and a decision in this regard will be published in the 

Federal Register

 for each fiscal year. For fiscal year 1994, the REA Administrator has determined the maximum amount of a loan and grant
to be $400,000.

(3) To provide REA Borrowers additional flexibility to fund worthwhile community development projects, paragraph
(e) of  1703.46 has been eliminated to remove the prohibition against funding recreational facilities unless
they convincingly demonstrate that they would be an integral part of a tourism industry in their area.

(4) Paragraph (b) of  1703.61 has been amended to clarify that the grant portion of the zero-interest loan and
grant will be disbursed to the borrower only upon completion of the project. This will ensure that grant funds are handled
so as to minimize the time between disbursement and authorized use to comply with USDA's Federal Assistance Uniform
Regulation, 7 CFR parts 3015 and 3016.

(5) Paragraph (b) of  1703.66 has been revised to require the recipients of pass-through loans and grants to
furnish a record of receipts showing total project costs to verify that no greater than 80 percent of project costs
have been funded with REA zero-interest loan and grant funds.

(6) Paragraph (e) of  1703.66 has been revised to allow REA field accountants to provide a rural economic development
review of zero-interest loans and grant funds. This revision will, in many cases, save REA Borrowers thousands of
dollars by eliminating costs of formal audits which were previously required in accordance with the provisions of
7 CFR part 1773, ``REA Policy on Audits of Electric and Telephone Borrowers.''

(7) Paragraph (g) of  1703.66 has been revised to clarify that for pass-through zero-interest loans and grants,
REA Borrowers must require project owners to provide sufficient financial, accounting and budget information,
and other records deemed necessary to facilitate audits in accordance with 7 CFR part 3015 and 7 CFR part 3016, as appropriate
for non-profit entities, and REA rural economic development loan reviews for projects in a for-profit status. Likewise,
paragraph (g) has been revised to require REA Borrowers receiving grants for establishment of revolving loan funds
to furnish information to allow audits in accordance with USDA departmental grant regulations. Copies of these grant
regulations are available to REA Borrowers by request.

The comments from various organizations including REA Borrowers, electric and telephone utility trade organizations,
economic development organizations and state governments reflected broad support for the proposed rule. 

Most of the organizations made specific recommendations on the proposed rule. REA has considered all comments in
finalizing this regulation. 

A number of the comments were from entities that administer existing Revolving Loan Funds (RLFs) or organizations
representing entities that administer revolving loan programs. These organizations feel that grants should not
be directed to REA Borrowers exclusively, but also to existing organizations not financed by REA that operate RLFs,
since REA Borrowers do not serve all of rural America. They also are concerned that they would be unable to compete with
the REA Borrowers' revolving funds zero-interest rate loans. 

First, grants, as well as zero-interest loans administered exclusively through REA Borrowers are in accordance
with directives established in the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987, (Pub. L. 100-102, 101 Stat. 1330-20).
This law was created in a context where electric and telephone Borrowers who had made prepayments on loans into cushion
of credit accounts could utilize a Rural Development Subaccount to collectively draw from the interest earnings
from the Borrowers' cumulative credit resources to reinvest into local economic development projects. The provisions
of the proposed rule making grant funds available exclusively to REA Borrowers, as a result of their prepayments,
are governed by legislation. 

REA acknowledges, however, that many rural development organizations are well qualified to administer grant funds,
and they provide a valuable resource for local or regional rural economic development efforts. REA will strongly
encourage Borrowers operating revolving loan funds to collaborate with existing organizations involved in rural
development activities, and those organizations are urged to work with REA Borrowers in facilitating rural development
projects. This collaboration and assistance could include performing local or regional studies to identify area
economic development needs, assisting community leaders and other project owners in planning and implementing
projects, loan packaging, technical assistance to REA Borrowers in reviewing loan applications and administering
the revolving loan fund, and coordinating efforts between other entities, including public and private lending
institutions, that provide assistance and/or funding to rural development projects. REA also encourages state
Rural Development Councils to become active participants in planning rural development projects and coordinating
activities between local governments, economic development districts, REA Borrowers and other entities operating
RLFs. However, although collaboration between REA Borrowers and other enitities is strongly encouraged, legislation
requires that REA Borrowers retain the ultimate decision-making authority and responsibility for REA rural development
loan and grant funds. 

Regarding possible competition between REA Borrowers and other lenders, it should be emphasized that REA does not
intend for REA Borrowers to compete with or replace existing services of RLFs, or other public or private lenders,
but merely to augment or supplement those sources of funds. To clarify this policy, and ensure effective implementation,
 1703.22(b) has been revised to require Borrowers, within their RLF rural development plan, to document coordination
of lending activities with local organizations operating RLFs and other area lenders. The rule requires such documentation
to indicate that Borrowers will not compete with, but will supplement other legal sources of financing. Rural development
plan documentation which complies with REA policy will be stipulated in RLF agreements between Borrowers and REA.


Some commenters expressed concern that the administrative burden for operating RLFs would be too great and REA Borrowers
may choose not to participate. REA has minimized administrative requirements; thus the burden should be no greater
for the RLFs than for zero-interest loans. Although the REA Borrowers will decide whether or not to establish RLFs,
REA believes the potential of significant benefits to rural residents through the RLF provisions will encourage
participation.

There were a number of recommendations concerning purposes eligible for funding, including comments that REA should
make grant funds available for businesses in a for-profit status. REA believes there is adequate flexibility with
the rule as written regarding eligible projects. The quality of the proposal and the degree of benefit to the rural
community or the potential for economic development are determining factors in application approval. It should
be noted that rural for-profit and non-profit projects alike may be able to obtain grant funds in conjunction with
zero-interest loans for feasibility studies and technical assistance. In addition, for-profit as well as non-profit
entities that enhance the overall quality of medical care or provide advanced telecommunications services or computer
networks for medical and educational services may be considered for grants because they may facilitate projects
which will improve the rural communities overall and provide needed services to rural America. However, generally,
REA desires to fund non-profit entities, since grants to for-profit entities for direct business start-up costs
could result in the possibility or perception that grants would provide certain for-profit entities an unfair competitive
advantage over those entities not receiving REA funding. 

It was also suggested that housing be included as eligible for funding under the regulation. REA recognizes the value
of adequate housing in developing rural areas. However, REA believes other federal programs are available to provide
housing, and grant funds will be better utilized to provide broader community-wide facilities and infrastructure
improvements. REA Borrowers may, in accordance with a rural development plan for a revolving loan fund, provide housing
assistance from those funds classified as non-Federal. 

Further, it was suggested that grant funds be used for venture capital purposes. The focus of the rural economic development
loan and grant program is to allow REA Borrowers to assist projects that will promote rural development. REA intends
to be flexible in meeting this objective; thus, applications will be evaluated on a case by case basis. 

There were several objections to linking grants to zero-interest loans. Some comments urged direct grants for feasibility
studies and technical assistance be provided to non-profit entities and that grants be made outright, without loans,
to economically distressed local governments. REA feels that grants for feasibility studies or technical assistance
will most likely be effectively used in conjunction with loans. Grants in conjunction with loans strengthen the loan
program and maximize the benefits derived from the limited amount of grant funding available. No change is being made
to allow direct grants to economically distressed local governments; however, provisions of the program as written
will enable REA Borrowers to facilitate economic development in distressed rural areas by funding worthwhile community
development and job creation projects. 

Two commenters suggested that the 10 percent limitation for using grant funds for administrative costs of the RLFs
be revised to provide more flexibility in determining these costs. No change is being made to the program at this time.
REA feels that limiting the funds used for administrative costs will be an incentive to encourage REA Borrowers to
stress prudent management of the funds and maximize the benefits for rural development. REA encourages interested
rural development organizations to work with REA Borrowers to minimize overhead costs. 

Some commenters felt REA's grant funding limitation of 80 percent of the cost of establishing the revolving fund,
which will require 20 percent supplemental funding to the revolving loan fund by the Borrower, is overly restrictive.
These organizations stated that this Borrower supplemental funding requirement, and the supplemental funding
requirement for individual projects, was too burdensome. Additionally, commentors objected to requiring projects
be funded by REA Borrowers ``up-front.'' This requirement was set forth in the proposed rule's preamble paragraph
entitled ``The establishment and/or Operation of a Revolving Loan Fund by REA Borrowers'',  1703.22(a)(3)
relating to supplemental funding requirements, and  1703.22(h)(2), ``Requisition requirements'', which
requires Borrowers be reimbursed 80 percent of funds expended for approved projects. REA believes the supplemental
funding requirement should remain applicable for Borrowers establishing revolving loan funds, as well as supplemental
funding for individual projects presently required for zero-interest pass-through loans. REA has found that the
supplemental funding requirement specified in  1703.23 of the regulation, as applied to individual projects,
has been beneficial for the zero-interest loan program by maximizing the use of outside funds. Likewise, REA believes
the Borrower supplemental funding requirement for the revolving loan fund will be equally beneficial for the grant
selection process by evidencing a degree of Borrower support and commitment to the revolving loan fund, and it will
provide REA adequate assurance of effective project review and oversight resulting in projects having a high probability
of success.

However, REA recognizes that reimbursing Borrowers only 80 percent of funds expended ``up front'' for community
development projects, in order to achieve Borrowers' 20 percent required contribution to RLFs, may place an undue
financial burden upon some Borrowers and discourage program participation. In addition, REA recognizes that requiring
Borrowers to initially exhaust their financial resources, as well as the REA grant funds, will result in no available
funds for Borrowers' revolving funds during the first year or two of operation until payments from the funded community
development projects are received. Therefore, REA has modified the proposed rule in  1703.22(h)(2), ``Requisition
requirements'', to remove the 80 percent reimbursement provision and allow for full reimbursement of Borrowers'
expended funds for approved projects funded. However, consistent with the supplemental funding requirements for
individual projects, as well as revolving loan funds set forth in the proposed rule, Borrowers' supplemental funding
requirements to the revolving loan fund will be maintained. Accordingly, paragraph (a)(5) in  1703.22 of the
final rule has been added to require REA Borrowers establishing RLFs to submit a commitment, in the form of a board resolution,
to provide supplemental funding, referred to as ``additional funding'' in an amount no less than 20 percent of the
REA grant approved. The Borrower will be required to provide documentation that the additional funding has been deposited
in the appropriate account in  1703.22(h)(1) of this final rule prior to grant disbursement. This paragraph
also reiterates the requirement in  1703.22(g)(2) in the proposed rule requiring additional funding be retained
within the revolving loan fund. Additional funding for revolving loan funds may be retained initially as non-Federal
funds for any rural economic development project(s), subject to the normal requirements outlined in  1703.22(g).
For example, for a $400,000 revolving loan fund grant from REA, the Borrower may requisition 100 percent of REA's portion
of eligible project costs. However, the REA Borrower will commit at least $80,000 (20 percent of $400,000) of additional
funds to be used for rural economic development projects in accordance with an approved rural development plan for
non-Federal funds. Since the Borrower's funds provided as additional funds may be considered non-Federal monies
and not subject to ``Federal monies'' restrictions for the Rural Economic Loan and Grant Program as outlined in the
regulation, the REA Borrower can retain a worthwhile degree of flexibility to fund projects during the first year
of the revolving loan fund. It should be noted, however, that as with pass-through zero-interest loans and grants,
projects funded with Federal grant funds under the revolving loan provision will be subject to the supplemental funding
requirements as outlined in  1703.23 of the Rural Economic Loan and Grant Program regulation. As pointed out
in the comments, REA recognizes that many projects may have limited sources of supplemental funding available. In
this regard, therefore, REA has provided a provision in  1703.22(a)(5), whereby Borrowers, with prior approval
from REA, may use all or a portion of their additional funding to assist project owners receiving funding through the
revolving loan provisions to meet their supplemental funding requirements required by  1703.23. In this case,
such additional funding will be considered as Federal funds and subject to the requirements and restrictions of the
regulation. 

Finally, several technical changes have been made to the proposed regulation for clarification as follows: (1) Section
1703.21(d) has been revised to clarify that excess interest returned to REA will not be used to reduce principal indebtedness.
(2) For revolving loan funds,  1703.22(a)(4) has been revised to clarify that reasonable servicing fees may
be charged regardless of whether Federal or non-Federal funds are involved. (3) Section 1703.20(a)(8) has been revised
to clarify that the overall restriction for using zero-interest loan and grant funds for payment of Borrower salaries
is subject to the operating expense allowance for revolving loan funds. (4) Section 1703.22(h)(1) has been revised
to add to the accounting requirements, additional ledger accounts to record interest income. (5) Section 1703.22(g)(2)
has been clarified to require Borrowers to retain interest earned from non-Federal funds within the revolving fund
to be used in accordance with their approved Rural Development Plan and Scope of Work Plan. (6) Section 1703.22(g)(3)
has been revised to require REA Borrowers that terminate the revolving loan program without obtaining approval by
the REA Administrator to return the amount of the original grant to REA. (7) Section 1703.22(h)(2) has been revised
to delete the requirement for account ledgers to be submitted as a prerequisite for requisitioning grant funds for
revolving loan funds. (8) Section 1703.66(g) has been revised to require REA Borrowers to include in their legal documents
the requirement for project owners to provide sufficient financial, accounting and budget information and other
records deemed necessary to facilitate audits in accordance with 7 CFR part 3015 and 7 CFR part 3016 for non-profit
entities, and REA rural economic development loan reviews for projects in a for-profit status.

4. Sections 1703.18 and 1703.19 are added to read as follows: 



 1703.18 

Types of projects eligible for grant funding. 



Grants may be made for the following purposes: 

(a) The establishment and operation of a revolving loan program by Borrowers in accordance with  1703.22; 

(b) Project feasibility studies to assist for-profit and non-profit entities in conjunction with a loan for an authorized
project. Feasibility studies will include management assistance, consultation, and research for planning individual
projects that the Borrower has determined will benefit the rural community. Feasibility studies which may be financed
under this section must be performed by qualified entities subject to  1703.19(i), General requirements for
grant funding. Feasibility studies must address the important aspects of project assessment and planning to ensure,
to the extent practicable, the success of projects. These include the market, technical, economic, financial, and

 1703.19 

General requirements for grant funding. 


(a) Grants made under  1703.18(a), establishment and operation of a revolving loan program by Borrowers, will
be limited to Borrowers and can be made without zero-interest loans. Grants made under  1703.18 (b) through
(h) will be made only in conjunction with zero-interest loans, and on a pass-through basis. 
(b) Pass-through grant funding for projects under  1703.18 (b), (c), (f), (g) and (h) will be available for non-profit
and for-profit entities. Pass-through grant funding for projects under  1703.18 (d) and (e) will be available
only for non-profit entities. 
(c) All projects funded with zero-interest loans and grants will require supplemental funding in accordance with
 1703.23. For grants made under  1703.18(a), the portion eligible for REA funding may be fully funded
with grant funds. For all other grants funded under 1703.18, the portion of project costs eligible for REA funding
may be funded up to 20 percent with grant funds. 
(d) Grant funding will be provided only to the extent necessary for a feasible project. A feasible project is a project
which expects to generate sufficient income to pay operating expenses and debts and compensate for depreciation
of equipment and facilities for the project which is to be funded by REA. Depreciation must be based on allowable depreciation
schedules as set forth by the United States Internal Revenue Service. Borrowers whose analyses of projects show feasibility
without grant funds should not apply for grant funding. Borrowers requesting pass-through grant funds will base
grant funding requests on borrower projected income and expense projections for the project, and documentation
regarding depreciation of the equipment and facilities for the project. The Administrator will determine whether
the Borrower's projections of income, expenses and depreciation are reasonable. 
(e) For projects that project insufficient operating revenue the first two years to show feasibility, borrowers
should first consider the deferral provisions set forth in  1703.29(b) before determining the appropriate
level of requested grant funding. Zero-interest loan and grant funding will be approved in accordance with paragraph
(d) of this section based on the option which results in the lowest required grant percentage. 
(f) The owner of the pass-through project that receives grant funds will be encouraged to commit that the project will
be a demonstration project. 
(g) Borrowers or project owners must demonstrate the availability and commitment of other sources of funding needed
to complete a project in addition to REA loan and/or grant funds, prior to the first advance of REA funds. 
(h) Feasibility studies and/or technical assistance funded with grants under  1703.18 (b) and (c) must be performed
by entities which are independent of the Borrower and qualified to provide such services. The project owner, if deemed
qualified in accordance with this paragraph, may furnish a feasibility study under  1703.18(b). Entities
furnishing technical assistance under  1703.18(c), must be independent of the project owner. To be deemed
qualified, entities providing feasibility studies and/or technical assistance must: 
(1) Provide sufficient documentation evidencing their proven ability, background and experience to furnish such
services; and 
(2) Provide sufficient documentation evidencing their legal authority and capacity to furnish such services. 
5. Section 1703.20 is revised to read as follows: 


 1703.20 

Ineligible uses of zero-interest loans and grants. 


(a) Zero-interest loans and grants must not be used: 
(1) To fund or assist projects of which any director, officer, general manager or significant stockholder of the Borrower,
or close relative thereof, is an owner, stockholder, partner or director, or which would, in the judgment of the Administrator,
create a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. The Borrower must disclose to the Administrator
information regarding any conflict of interest, potential conflict of interest or any appearance of a conflict of
interest. The Administrator will determine whether there is a conflict of interest or whether any potential conflict
of interest or appearance of a conflict of interest may adversely affect REA's interests. A Borrower organized as,
or consisting of a cooperative, widely held mutual corporation, tribal government, municipal power corporation,
public power district, or a similar widely held organization would ordinarily be able to have an ownership interest
in or manage a project operated on either a for-profit or non-profit basis. A Borrower organized as a closely held,
for-profit corporation with more than 5 percent of its stock held by one legal person, its subsidiary or an affiliate,
would ordinarily be able to own or manage a project operated on a non-profit basis only;

(2) For any costs incurred on the project: (i) Prior to receipt of the Borrower's completed application by REA during
an application period unless the Administrator has specifically approved such usage in writing; or 

(ii) For site development, the destruction or alteration of buildings, or other activities that would adversely
affect the environment or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives prior to satisfying the requirements of  1703.32;


(3) By the Borrower to purchase or lease any real property, materials, equipment, or services from its subsidiary,
an affiliate, or significant stockholders, officers, managers or directors of the Borrower, or close relatives
thereof, where the purchase or lease has not been fully disclosed to the Administrator and received the Administrator's
prior written approval; 

(4) By the recipient of a pass-through-loan or pass-through-grant to purchase or lease any real property, materials,
equipment, or services from the Borrower, its subsidiary, an affiliate of the Borrower, or significant stockholders,
officers, managers or directors of the Borrower, or close relatives thereof, where the purchase or lease has not been
fully disclosed to the Administrator and received the Administrator's prior written approval; 

(5) To pay off or refinance existing indebtedness incurred prior to receipt of the Borrower's completed application
by REA or for refinancing or repaying a loan made under the Act or a program administered by the Administrator; 

(6) For any electric or telephone purpose, as determined by the Administrator; 

(7) For the Borrower's electric or telephone operations or for any operations affiliated with the Borrower unless
the Administrator has specifically informed the Borrower in writing that the operations are part of the approved
purposes; 

(8) To pay the salaries of any employee or owner of the Borrower, its subsidiaries, or affiliates. This restriction
does not prohibit the use of loan or grant funds for printing and similar costs for project feasibility studies it has
prepared, commissioned or purchased if specifically approved by the Administrator. This restriction is subject
to the operating expense allowance for revolving loan funds set forth in  1703.22 (a)(6); 

(9) To fund feasibility studies and technical assistance as set forth in  1703.18 independently of projects
which are funded under the zero-interest loan and grant program; 

(10) For proposed projects located in areas covered by the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (16 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

); or 

(11) For anything other than an approved purpose. 

(b) [Reserved] 

6. Section 1703.21 is amended by adding a sentence at the end of paragraph (b) and revising paragraph (d) to read as follows:




 1703.21 

Limitations on the use of zero-interest loan and grant funds. 



* * * * *



(b) * * * Grant funds will be disbursed to the Borrower in accordance with  1703.61(b).



* * * * *



(d) The Borrower may not requisition zero-interest loan funds unless those funds are deposited into the Borrower's
REA construction fund trustee account. The Borrower will be required to set up a separate Federally insured account
called the Rural Economic Development Account, if loan funds are not expected to be disbursed within two months after
receipt from REA. All interest earned on temporarily deposited zero-interest loan funds in excess of $500 per 12-month
period must be used for approved purposes or returned to REA. Interest earned in excess of $500 per 12 month period and
returned to REA will not be used to reduce the Borrower's principal indebtedness. Grant funds will be disbursed by
REA in accordance with 7 CFR parts 3015 and 3016, and  1703.61 (b).



* * * * *



7. Section 1703.22 is added to read as follows: 



 1703.22 

Revolving loan program. 



Grant funds under this section will be provided only to REA Borrowers on a non pass-through basis. REA Borrowers will,
in turn, provide loans to foster rural economic development in accordance with this subpart and the specific requirements
of this section. 

(a) 

General.

 Grant funds disbursed to REA Borrowers to establish revolving loan programs under this section are subject to the
following requirements: (1) The uses, restrictions and limitations for zero-interest loans set forth in   1703.17,
1703.20 and 1703.21 respectively; 

(2) Loans made by REA Borrowers initially lending grant funds disbursed by REA are limited to types of projects specified
in  1703.18 (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h). Loans may also be made for feasibility studies and technical assistance
in accordance with  1703.18 (b) and (c), respectively, but only for those types of projects specified in this
paragraph (a)(2). Loans made from repayments of the initial loans made by REA Borrowers may be used for any rural economic
development purpose in accordance with a prior agreement between the Borrower and REA; 

(3) All other requirements relevant to zero-interest pass-through loans and grants outlined in this subpart, except
the minimum size of a zero-interest loan as specified in  1703.28(f); 

(4) The initial loans made from the revolving loan fund using the grant funds must carry an interest rate of zero percent;
however, loans made from repayments of the initial loan may carry an interest rate in accordance with prior agreement
with REA. In either case, the Borrower may charge reasonable loan servicing fees;

(ii) Individual projects funded under this section are subject to supplemental funds requirements set forth in  1703.23;


(iii) At the Borrower's option with REA concurrence, all or a portion of the additional funding may be used to assist
project owners receiving funding from Federal grant funds under this section to meet their supplemental funding
requirements set forth in  1703.23 of this subpart. Such additional funding will be deemed as Federal funds
and accounted for in accordance with paragraph (h)(1)(i)(A) of this section for electric borrowers or paragraph
(h)(1)(ii)(A) of this section for telephone borrowers, as appropriate;

(iv) At the Borrower's option, all or a portion of the additional funding may be retained as non-Federal funds, for
any rural economic development project(s), subject to paragraph (g) of this section and REA concurrence. Additional

for electric borrowers or paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(E) of this section for telephone borrowers, as appropriate;

(6) Grant funds will only be provided to an REA Borrower for a revolving loan program when a proposed budget submitted
to REA demonstrates and the Borrower agrees in writing that no more than 10 percent of grant funds received are used
to cover operating expenses of the revolving loan program. Operating expenses include the costs of administering
the revolving loan fund and the provision of technical assistance to project owners. All proceeds in excess of those
needed to cover authorized expenses, as described above, must revert to the revolving fund and be available for re-lending
for eligible projects. Budgets which reflect expenses incurred in operating the fund must be submitted to REA annually;


(7) The Borrower may charge reasonable loan servicing charges. For purposes of this section, loan servicing charges
must not exceed an amount equal to the sum of one percent per year of the outstanding principal on the first day of each

(8) The Borrower will submit documentation indicating that potential projects which are eligible for funding have
sufficiently progressed in the planning stage to allow grant funding approved for a revolving loan program to be requisitioned
by the Borrower, disbursed by REA, and loaned to recipients within 3 years of the date of grant approval by REA. Grant
funds that have not been requisitioned within 3 years will be cancelled, unless the Administrator has approved an
extension in writing. Grant funds will be disbursed by REA in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section;


(9) If the revolving loan program is terminated, further disbursement of grant funds will be cancelled. Repayments

plan; 

(10) Payment of creditors which provide interim or construction financing to a viable project for eligible purposes
as set forth in  1703.17 of this subpart may be authorized. Refinancing for the sole purpose of replacing higher
interest conventional financing with zero-interest revolving loan funds is not authorized. 

(b) 

The Borrower's rural development plan.

 REA requires that the revolving loan program be administered in accordance with a rural development plan, developed
by the Borrower and approved by REA. The plan must be of sufficient detail to provide REA with a complete understanding
of what the Borrower intends to accomplish by administering a revolving loan program. The rural development plan
will provide the mechanics of how the revolving loan funds will be disbursed to the project owner. The rural development
plan must outline the Borrower's plans for administering the revolving loan program, during the initial period when
REA grant funds are lent by the Borrower and after the revolving fund becomes non-Federal in accordance with paragraph
(g) of this section. The plan must outline the following: (1) Specific objectives for the revolving loan program,
revolving loan operating procedures, lending parameters, maximum and minimum loan amount, and types of projects
to be funded;

funds. The Borrower must identify a sufficient number of rural development projects of the type specified in  1703.18
(d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) which are currently being planned requiring zero-interest loans equal to the amount of
grant assistance requested from REA. These projects may be supported with a community facilities plan, or other development
plan, prepared by local community leaders in cooperation with the Borrower. For each project, the Borrower will submit
information required under  1703.34;

(2) Documented authority and ability of the Borrower to administer a revolving rural development loan program in
accordance with the provisions of this subpart. The Borrower must provide a complete listing of all personnel responsible
for administering this program along with a statement of their qualifications and experience; 

(3) Documented ability of the Borrower to commit financial resources under the control of the Borrower to assist in
the establishment of a rural development revolving loan program. This should include a statement of the sources of

and/or grant must contain certain provisions giving the Administrator discretionary rights and remedies in the
event a Borrower fails to comply with this subpart, other Federal regulations and statutes, or the terms, conditions
and requirements of the executed legal documents. Regardless of any right or remedy the Administrator chooses to
assert, if the Borrower uses any zero-interest loan and/or grant funds other than for approved purposes, the Borrower

objectives are being achieved. The Borrower must submit an original and one copy of each report to REA on an annual basis.
The project performance reports shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 

(1) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives established for that period; 


(2) Reasons why any established objectives were not met; 


(3) A description of any problems, delays, or adverse conditions which have occurred, or are anticipated, and which
may affect the attainment of overall project objectives, prevent meeting of time schedules or objectives, or preclude
the attainment of particular project work elements during established time periods. This disclosure shall be accompanied
by a statement of the action taken or planned to resolve the situation; and 


(4) Objectives and timetable established for the next reporting period. 


(i) For pass-through loans and grants, a final project performance report will be required with the last SF 269, ``Financial
Status Report,'' available from REA in Washington, DC. The final report also must provide an evaluation of the success
of the project in meeting the objectives of the program. The final report may serve as the last annual report. 


(j) Monitoring requirements for Borrowers receiving grants for revolving loan funds are specified in  1703.22.



14. Sections 1703.67 and 1703.68 are added to read as follows: 






 1703.67 

Changes in project objective or scope. 




For loans and grants awarded under this subpart, the Borrower must obtain prior approval for any material change to
the scope or objectives of the approved project, including changes to the scope of work or budget. Failure to obtain
prior approval of changes can result in suspension or termination of grant funds. 






 1703.68 

Loan and grant termination provisions. 






(a) 

Termination for cause. 

The Administrator may terminate any loan and/or grant in whole, or in part, at any time before the date of completion
of loan and/or grant disbursement, whenever the Borrower has failed to comply with the conditions of the loan and/or
grant. The Administrator will promptly notify the Borrower in writing of the determination and the reasons for the
termination, together with the effective date. The termination date will be no less than 30 days following receipt
of the termination notice. The Borrower will have such time to cure the default, or to state why it feels the loan and/or
grant should not be terminated. The Administrator will stay the termination upon the curing of the default, and may
delay termination if, sufficient cause has been given by the Borrower. 


(b) 

Termination for convenience. 

The Administrator or the Borrower may terminate a loan and/or grant in whole, or in part, when both parties agree that
the continuation of the project would not produce beneficial results commensurate with further expenditure of funds.
The two parties will agree upon termination conditions, including the effective date, and in the case of partial terminations,
the portion to be terminated. The Borrower will not incur new obligations for the terminated portion after the effective
date, and will cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible. The Administrator will allow full credit to the
Borrower for the Federal share of unfulfilled contractual obligations which were incurred in good faith by the Borrower
prior to grant termination.

Airworthiness Directives; Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 Series Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes, that requires certain maximum 
brake wear limits to be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection 
program. This amendment also requires that the Airplane Flight Manual be revised to 
include certain procedures concerning operations in the event of a rejected takeoff (RTO). 
This amendment is prompted by an accident in which a transport category airplane 
executed an RTO and was unable to stop on the runway due to worn brakes; and the 
subsequent review of allowable brake wear limits for all transport category airplanes. The 
actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent the loss of brake effectiveness during 
a high energy RTO. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to 
certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal 
Register

 on November 1, 1993 (58 FR 58307). That action proposed to require that 
certain maximum brake wear limits be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance 
inspection program; and that the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) be revised to include 
certain procedures concerning operations in the event of a rejected takeoff (RTO). 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 

One commenter supports the proposal. 

Another commenter, the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, questions 
the need for the proposed AD. This commenter is aware of the FAA's efforts to review 
and determine allowable aircraft brake wear limits, since those efforts prompted the 
issuance of a series of AD's, applicable to U.S.-manufactured airplanes, to mandate 
maximum brake wear limits. While those U.S.-manufactured airplanes were certified to 
new brake criteria, the commenter points out that airplanes such as the Fokker Model F28 
Mark 0100, which were certified under the Joint Airworthiness Regulations (JAR) criteria, 
are certified to worn brake standards. In light of this, the commenter questions why the 
FAA indicated that the proposed AD was prompted by the 1988 accident involving worn 
brakes on a McDonnell Douglas Model DC-10 airplane. This commenter states that U.S. 
operators of Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes, at the time of airplane 
delivery, implemented within their maintenance programs the same worn brake criteria as 
proposed in the notice; additionally, these operators' FAA-approved AFM's already reflect 
this criteria. Therefore, this commenter argues that there is no basis for adopting the 
proposed rule unless it can be shown that U.S. operators cannot safely administer to 
certified brake wear criteria within their approved maintenance programs.

The FAA does not concur with this commenter's suggestion that this AD action is 
not appropriate. The accident involving the Model DC-10 was the primary reason 
prompting this AD and the previously-issued AD's to mandate specific maximum brake 
wear limits on transport category airplane. During the process of promulgating those 
AD's, the FAA became aware that not all operators were following the manufacturer's 
recommended brake wear limits. For example, in one case, three different operators of the 
same model of airplane were found to be observing three different maximum brake wear 
limits. Further, the FAA is aware that, until recently, not all manufacturers had provided 
brake wear limits that met the FAA criteria, e.g., landing distance predicated upon single 
engine-out, maximum takeoff weight, and fully worn brakes. The purpose of this AD is in 
no way an attempt to question the ability of U.S. operators to safely administer to brake 
wear limits criteria; its purpose is to establish what those brake wear limits are. 

Several commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to eliminate the 
requirement to replace the landing gear sliding member after an RTO event. One of these 
commenters suggests that, instead of requiring replacement, the proposed rule could 
require inspections of the sliding member, using procedures that are currently included in 
the Fokker F28 Mark 0100 Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) 05-51-01. This 
commenter states that similar inspection procedures exist for most other commercial 
aircraft, and those procedures have proven to be a safe and effective method of evaluating 
landing gears for the effects of high brake heat. This commenter also suggests that 
additional procedures could include inspection of the axles for evidence of discolored or 
peeling paint with cadmium plating that is blistered, wrinkled, or mottled (signs of 
cadmium melting and resolidifying). Cadmium melts at 610 
 F, which is very close to the 
tempering temperature of ultra-high strength steels; therefore, if the cadmium is not 
melted, it is unlikely that any heat damage has been done to the steel sliding member axle. 
This commenter notes that this criteria has been used for other aircraft, and this 
commenter plans to contact Fokker to request that this type of inspection criteria be added 
to the Fokker F28 Mark 0100 AMM. Further, another commenter states that, on other 
aircraft models in its fleet, it regularly performs a visual inspection of the pistons following 
an RTO to determine the amount of heat that the piston has been subjected to; the degree 
of discoloration of the paint on the axle and the amount of damage to the hydraulic hoses 
are evidence of the amount of heat. This commenter also plans to contact Fokker to 
request the inclusion of this inspection in the AMM. 

The FAA does not concur with the suggestion to revise the proposed rule, at least 
at this time. The FAA has queried Fokker directly about the inspection procedures 
suggested by these commenters; however, Fokker was not aware of any effective 
nondestructive inspection technique that can be used to establish whether cadmium 
embrittlement has taken place on the axle after an RTO. Fokker did indicate that it is 
currently working with the manufacturer of the brakes to devise a way to limit the 
exposure of the sliding member to heat from the brakes, which in turn would limit the 
need to replace the sliding member. Once an inspection or other procedure is developed 
that would preclude the necessity of replacing the sliding member, the FAA would 
consider further rulemaking on this issue. In the meantime, under the provisions of 
paragraph (d) of the final rule, the FAA would consider requests for the use of alternative 
methods of complying with this rule, provided sufficient data are presented to justify such 
requests. 

One commenter requests that the proposed entry in the maintenance program [as 
specified in paragraph (b) of the proposal] and the proposed entry in the AFM [as 
specified in paragraph (c) of the proposal] be revised. This commenter states that 
calculations have shown that only when ``flap 0'' is selected, there is a possibility to reach 
an energy level that can cause the axle to overheat. Therefore, those entries should 
include a statement that, during the RTO scenario, the flaps would have to be at 0 
degrees. The commenter suggests that the wording of both entries be changed to read as 
follows: 




``

If flap 0 is selected, 

and if a takeoff is rejected at a speed greater than 
90 percent of * * *'' 




The FAA concurs and has revised paragraphs (b) and (c) of the final rule accordingly. 



This same commenter suggests that the AFM entry proposed in paragraph (c) be 
reworded to include language that is more familiar to pilots, who will be the primary users 
of this information in the Limitations Section. Specifically, the commenter suggests that 
pilots would be more familiar with the term ``V

1

'' (takeoff decision speed) than with 
``V

MBE

'' (maximum brake energy limit speed). The commenter states that use of V

1

 as a 
reference is more appropriate than V

MBE

 in this context, as well, since it is more 
conservative with respect to the axle overheat problem. Along this same line, the 
commenter suggests that the AFM wording be revised to indicate that ``the rejected 
takeoff conditions should be reported to maintenance personnel prior to the next takeoff'' 
and that ``further dispatch may be affected.'' The FAA concurs with all of these 
suggestions and has revised paragraph (c) of the final rule accordingly.






Note:

 If a pilot 
were to report a rejected takeoff event to maintenance personnel and refer the V

1

 speed 
involved, maintenance personnel can recalculate the V

1

 figure to a V

MBE

 figure by means 
of a graph incorporated into the AMM. 




This commenter also suggests that proposed paragraph (b) be revised to specify 
the part numbers of the main landing gears (MLG) equipped with the sliding members that 
need to be replaced. Adding a reference to the MLG part numbers would avoid any 
relationship between the currently-installed Dowty MLG's and other brands of MLG's that 
are expected to be certified and installed in the near future. The FAA concurs with this 
suggestion and has revised paragraph (b) of the final rule accordingly.

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the 
FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule 
with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will 
neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 

The FAA estimates that 83 airplanes of U.S. registry and 2 U.S. operators will be 
affected by this AD. 

Although the rule requires the incorporation of maximum brake wear limits into 
the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program, no other specific additional action, 
inspection, or part replacement costs relative to that requirement are involved; such 
actions are currently a part of the normal maintenance program. However, it is estimated 
that it will require 20 work hours, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour, for each 
operator to incorporate the brake wear limitations into its FAA-approved maintenance 
inspection program. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that requirement on 
U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,200, or $1,100 per operator. 

Additionally, the FAA estimates that it will take approximately 1 work hour per 
airplane to accomplish the required AFM revision, and that the average labor rate is $55 
per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that requirement on U.S. 
operators is estimated to be $4,565, or $55 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figures discussed above are based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Airworthiness Directives; Hamilton Standard 14RF Series Propellers 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Hamilton Standard 14RF series propellers.
This action adopts new torquing procedures for the propeller hub retaining nuts, requires initial and repetitive
torque checks of propeller hub retaining nuts using those new procedures. In addition, this AD requires repetitive
visual inspections for external propeller oil, investigation, and removal from service of propellers hubs found
cracked or with undetermined leakage. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracks in propeller hubs that initiate
in hub dowel pin holes at the connection of the hub to the engine flange. The actions specified in this AD are intended
to prevent propeller hub cracking and loss of engine oil, and possible loss of a propeller blade or hub. 





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received reports of cracks found in some Hamilton Standard Model 14RF-9,
14RF-19, and 14RF-21 propeller hubs. Through testing and field investigation the FAA has determined
that insufficient torque of the propeller hub retaining nuts has resulted in damage by fretting within the dowel holes
and subsequent cracks initiating in the hub dowel pin holes at the connection of the hub to the engine flange. The FAA
has also determined that the present torquing procedures for propeller hub retaining nuts on this model propeller
are insufficient to control fretting during the conditions experienced in service. Therefore, through engineering
analysis, the FAA has determined that new, more stringent torquing procedures must be applied to this propeller model
to mitigate this fretting condition. Cracks that may be caused by this condition can be detected by oil leakage not
explained by other conditions such as leaks in the blade seal, the pressure relief valve, or actuator assembly. Since
undetermined oil leakage is a good indication of cracks in the propeller hub, the FAA has also determined that propellers
hubs with unexplained oil leakage must be removed from service and inspected for cracks prior to return to service.
This fretting condition, if not corrected, could result in propeller hub cracking and loss of engine oil, and possible
loss of a propeller blade or hub.

The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of Temporary Revision (TR) No. 61-6, dated March 15,
1993, and TR No. 61-7, dated July 27, 1993, to Hamilton Standard Maintenance Manual (MM) P5186, applicable to
Model 14RF-9 propellers; TR No. 61-6, dated April 8, 1993, and TR No. 61-7, dated July 27, 1993, to
Hamilton Standard MM P5199, applicable to Model 14RF-19 propellers; and TR No. 61-4, dated March 15, 1993,
and TR No. 61-5, dated July 27, 1993, to Hamilton Standard MM P5189, applicable to Model 14RF-21 propellers.
These TR's describe the new torquing procedures for torque checks of propeller hub retaining nuts, and procedures
for inspecting propeller hubs for cracks. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Hamilton Standard 14RF series
propellers of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent propeller hub cracking and loss of engine oil,
and possible loss of a propeller blade or hub. This 
AD requires an initial torque check of the propeller hub retaining nuts within 30 days after the effective date of this
AD, the implementation of a new, more stringent hub retaining nut tightening procedure, and repetitive torque checks
of the hub retaining nuts. If the torque checks of the hub retaining nuts do not meet the acceptance critieria of the
applicable TR's during the initial or subsequent repetitive checks, then the propeller hub must be removed from service
and inspected for cracks prior to return to service. Propeller hubs with crack indications must be removed from service
and replaced with a serviceable propeller hub prior to further flight. The FAA's analysis indicates that 30 days will
be sufficient to schedule the torque checks without adversely affecting flight safety. 

Subsequent to an acceptable initial torque check and the implementation of the new hub retaining nut tightening procedure,
this AD requires a one-time entry in the propeller maintenance records that the new tightening procedure was incorporated.
In addition, all future propeller installations should follow the new installation and hub retaining nut tightening
procedure. 

The AD will thereafter require repetitive torque checks at intervals not to exceed 500 hours time in service since
the last inspection. In addition, this AD requires repetitive visual inspections for external propeller oil, investigation,
and removal from service of propellers hubs found cracked or with undetermined leakage. These inspections must be
performed at intervals not to exceed 70 hours time in service (TIS) since the last inspection, or at line checks, whichever
occurs first. If the leakage is found to be caused by other than a leak in the blade seal, the pressure relief valve, or
actuator assembly, the leakage may be due to a propeller hub crack and the propeller must be removed from service and
replaced with a serviceable propeller prior to further flight. The actions would be required to be accomplished in
accordance with the applicable TR's to the MM's described previously. 

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 



Comments Invited 



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption


``ADDRESSES.'' 

All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-ANE-09.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Listing of Color Additives for Coloring Sutures; D&C Violet No. 2


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the color additive regulations to provide for the safe use of D&C
Violet No. 2 to color poly(

e

-caprolactone) absorbable sutures for general surgery. This action responds to a petition filed by Concept, Inc.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Introduction


In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of August 6, 1990 (55 FR 31897), FDA announced that a color additive petition (CAP 0C0224) had been filed by Concept,
Inc., 11311 Concept Blvd., Largo, FL 34643. The petition proposed that the color additive regulations in  74.3602


D&C Violet No. 2

 (21 CFR 74.3602) be amended to provide for the safe use of D&C Violet No. 2 as a color additive in poly(

e

-caprolactone) absorbable sutures for general surgery. Since the publication of the filing notice, Concept, Inc.,
has changed its name to Linvatec Corp. The petition was filed under section 706 (currently section 721) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 376) (currently 21 U.S.C. 379e).


II. Regulatory History


The regulatory history of D&C Violet No. 2 is summarized in a final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 7, 1990 (55 FR 18865). In the May 1990, final rule FDA permanently listed D&C Violet No. 2 for use in coloring
polymethylmethacrylate intraocular lens haptics ( 74.3602) in response to a color additive petition (CAP
9C0216). In that final rule, FDA also transferred the listings for the use of the color additive in sutures from  74.1602
(21 CFR 74.1602) under Subpart B_Drugs to  74.3602 under Subpart D_Medical Devices. Since the publication
of the May 7, 1990, final rule,  74.3602 has been amended to provide for the safe use of D&C Violet No. 2 as a
color additive in poliglecaprone 25 (

e

-caprolactone/glycolide copolymer) absorbable sutures.


III. Applicability of the Act


With the passage of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (Pub. L. 94-295), Congress mandated the listing of
color additives for use in medical devices when the color additive in the device comes into direct contact with the
body for a significant period of time (21 U.S.C. 379e(a)). D&C Violet No. 2 is added to the poly(

e

-caprolactone) absorbable sutures in such a way that at least some of the color additive will come into contact with
the body when the sutures are in place. In addition, the sutures are intended to be absorbed by the body, and during the
absorption, the color additive will be deposited in body tissue. Thus, the color additive will be in direct contact
with the body for a significant period of time. Consequently, the use of the color additive currently before the agency
is subject to the statutory listing requirement.


IV. The Color Additive


D&C Violet No. 2 is principally 1-hydroxy-4-[(4-methylphenyl)amino]-9,10-anthracenedione (CAS Reg. No.
81-48-1). It is manufactured by either condensation of quinizarin with 

p

-toluidine or by condensation of 1-hydroxy-halogenoanthroquinone with 

p

-toluidine. Because no chemical
reaction consumes all the starting materials and yields only the desired product, both the resulting reaction mixture
and commercial product will contain residual amounts of the starting materials, including 

p

-toluidine. This fact is significant because Weisburger et al. have demonstrated that 

p

-toluidine is a carcinogen in mice (Ref. 1).
Residual amounts of reactants, such as 

p

-toluidine and other manufacturing aids, are commonly found among the impurities of many color additives. The presence
of such impurities is not unique to color additives. Numerous minor impurities are present in all chemical products,
even in highly purified reagent-grade chemicals.


V. Determination of Safety


Under section 721(b)(4) of the act (21 U.S.C. 379e(b)(4)), the so-called ``general safety clause'' for color additives,
a color additive cannot be listed for a particular use unless a fair evaluation of the data and information available
to FDA establish that the color additive is safe for that use. FDA's color additive regulations (21 CFR 70.3(i)) define
``safe'' as ``a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under
the intended conditions of use.''
The anticancer or Delaney clause of the Color Additive Amendments (section 721(b)(5)(B) of the act) provides that
a noningested color additive shall be deemed unsafe and shall not be listed if, after tests that are appropriate for
evaluating the safety of the additive for such use, it is found to induce cancer in man or animal. Importantly, however,
the Delaney clause applies to the additive itself and not to constituents of the additive. That is, where an additive
itself has not been shown to cause cancer, but contains a carcinogenic impurity, the additive is properly evaluated
under the general safety clause using risk assessment procedures to determine whether there is a reasonable certainty
that no harm will result from the proposed use of the additive, 

Scott

 v. 

FDA

, 728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984).


VI. Safety of the Petitioned Use of the Additive


FDA estimates that the upper limit of lifetime exposure to D&C Violet No. 2 from its use in coloring poly(

e

-caprolactone) absorbable sutures is 3.7 milligrams (mg) per person (0.15 micrograms ( u g) per person per day).
The agency calculated this upper limit of lifetime exposure based on several factors. First, the color additive will
be used at a level of 0.1 percent by weight of the poly(

e

-caprolactone) absorbable sutures. Second, the agency made four assumptions: (1) Five meters is the maximum total
length of suture likely to be used in a single surgical operation, and 10 meters of suture would be used in multiple operations
over a person's lifetime; (2) a lifespan of 70 years follows initial suture implantation; (3) a size 2 suture is used
for general surgery; and (4) 100 percent of the color additive migrates from the suture into the body. Because these
are conservative assumptions, the lifetime exposure to D&C Violet No. 2 from its use in coloring poly(

e

-caprolactone) absorbable sutures is likely to be far less than 3.7 mg per person (0.15  u g per person per day).
FDA does not ordinarily consider chronic toxicological testing to be necessary to determine the safety of an additive
whose use will result in such low exposure levels (Ref. 2), and the agency has not required such testing in this case.
Although the agency does not normally require such testing, chronic studies supporting current listings for the
use of D&C Violet No. 2 are available in the agency's files, and FDA's safety evaluation of the proposed use of the
color additive in absorbable sutures included a consideration of these studies. Two-year carcinogenicity studies
of dyed sutures implanted in rats and a lifetime skin-painting study in mice showed no indication of carcinogenicity.
Additionally, teratology studies of sutures implanted in rats and rabbits exhibited no evidence of teratogenic
effects.
In its evaluation of the safety of the proposed use of the subject additive, FDA has also considered other safety data
submitted previously to support current listings for the use of D&C Violet No. 2. These toxicity studies of D&C
Violet No. 2 included acute oral toxicity studies in rats and dogs, acute toxicity studies of dyed sutures and suture
components in rats and mice, an evaluation of the tissue response to dyed sutures implanted intramuscularly in rats,
a biological evaluation of dyed sutures implanted in rabbit's eyes, a study of the tissue reaction to the color additive
injected into rabbit muscle, in vitro cytotoxicity studies, a pyrogenicity study of sutures, 7-month toxicity studies
of implanted sutures in rats and dogs, a 119-day evaluation of dyed sutures implanted intramuscularly in rats, and
six mutagenicity studies, including one 

Salmonella

/reverse mutation test (Ames test) using extracts of dyed sutures, one study of chromosomal aberrations using dyed
suture in Chinese hamster ovary cells, one study of in vitro transformation using dyed suture in Balb/c-3T3 cells,
two mouse lymphoma forward mutation assays using dyed suture, and one mouse lymphoma toxicity assay of dyed suture.
In addition, FDA evaluated the toxicity studies that the petitioner provided to support the proposed use of D&C
Violet No. 2 in poly(

e

-caprolactone) absorbable sutures for general surgery. These studies included a hemolysis test by direct contact,
a direct contact cytotoxicity test on mouse fibroblast cells using extracts of dyed sutures, a systemic toxicity
test in mice using extracts of dyed sutures, a guinea pig sensitization maximization test using extracts of dyed sutures,
a test of intracutaneous toxicity in rabbits using extracts of dyed sutures, implantation tests (7, 32, and 89 days,
and 6 and 9 months) in rabbits, a 

Salmonella

/mammalian mutagenicity test using extracts of dyed sutures, 52- and 32-week implantation tests in rats, and 60-
and 62-day evaluations of absorbable suture following abdominal wound closure in rabbits. 
There were no significant adverse effects from D&C Violet No. 2 in any of the studies evaluated by the agency. Therefore,
the agency has concluded that these studies in conjunction with previously submitted studies establish the safety
of the proposed use of D&C Violet No. 2 as a color additive in poly(

e

-caprolactone) absorbable sutures.
FDA has evaluated the safety of this additive under the general safety clause, considering all available data. The
agency has also used risk assessment procedures to estimate the upper-bound limit of risk presented by 

p

-toluidine, a carcinogenic chemical that may be present as an impurity in the additive. The risk evaluation of 

p

-toluidine has two aspects: (1) Assessment of the exposure to the impurity from the proposed use of the additive and
(2) extrapolation of the risk observed in the animal bioassays to the conditions of probable exposure to humans.


A. p-Toluidine


Using risk assessment procedures, FDA estimates that the maximum total lifetime exposure to 

p

-toluidine that will result from the use of poly(

e

-caprolactone) absorbable sutures colored with D&C Violet No. 2 that complies with the applicable specifications
is 0.3 nanograms (ng) per person per day. The agency used data reported by the National Cancer Institute, which demonstrated
that 

p

-toluidine was carcinogenic for male and female Charles River CD-1 (HaM/ICR derived) mice, causing an increased
incidence of hepatomas (liver tumors) (Ref. 1), to estimate the upper-bound limit of lifetime human risk from exposure
to this chemical stemming from the proposed use of D&C Violet No. 2 as a color additive in poly(

e

-caprolactone) absorbable sutures (Ref. 3).
Based on a potential exposure of 0.3 ng per person per day, the upper-bound limit of individual lifetime risk from the
potential exposure to 

p

-toluidine from the proposed use of D&C Violet No. 2 as a color additive in poly(

e

-caprolactone) absorbable sutures is 2x10

-11

, or 2 in 100 billion (Ref. 3). Because of the numerous conservatisms in the exposure estimate, actual lifetime-averaged
individual exposure to 

p

-toluidine is expected to be substantially less than the worst-case estimated daily exposure. Therefore, the actual
risk would be less than 2x10

-11

. Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from exposure to 

p

-toluidine that might result from the proposed use of D&C Violet No. 2 for coloring poly(

e

-caprolactone) absorbable sutures.


B. Specifications 


D&C Violet No. 2 is currently produced as a certifiable color additive for use in externally applied drugs and
cosmetics, in sutures, and in contact lenses in accordance with 21 CFR part 80. Based upon the low level of exposure
to 

p

-toluidine that results under the current specifications for D&C Violet No. 2 in  74.1602, the agency concludes
that the specifications listed in  74.1602 are adequate to ensure the safe use of this color additive and to control
the amount of 

p

-toluidine that may exist as an impurity in the color additive when used in poly(

e

-caprolactone) absorbable sutures.


VII. Conclusions


Based upon the available toxicity data and the other relevant considerations discussed above, FDA concludes that
there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the petitioned use of D&C Violet No. 2 for coloring
poly(

e

-caprolactone) absorbable sutures when it is used at a level not to exceed 0.1 percent by weight of the suture material.
The agency also concludes on the basis of available data that the color additive will perform its intended coloring
effect in poly(

e

-caprolactone) absorbable sutures and, thus, is suitable for this use. The agency, therefore, is amending  74.3602
of the color additive regulations to provide for use of the color additive at a maximum level of 0.1 percent by weight
in poly(

e

-caprolactone) absorbable sutures.


VIII. Inspection of Documents


In accordance with  71.15 (21 CFR 71.15), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied upon
in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and Applied
Nutrition (address above) by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in  71.15,
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.


IX. Environmental Impact


The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.

U. S. EPA_San Luis Obispo County APCD Agreement for Delegation of Authority for Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations
(40 CFR Part 55) 



The undersigned, on behalf of the San Luis Obispo County Air Pollution Control District (``SLOCAPCD'' or ``the District'')
and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA''), hereby agree to the delegation of authority from
EPA to SLOCAPCD to implement and enforce the requirements of the Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations (``OCS'')
(40 CFR part 55) within 25 miles of the state's seaward boundary, pursuant to section 328(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act
(``the Act''), subject to the terms and conditions below. EPA has reviewed SLOCAPCD's request for delegation and
has found that SLOCAPCD's regulations meet the requirements for delegation set forth at 40 CFR 55.11. 
This delegation includes authority for the following sections of the Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations: 






EPA is not delegating the authority to implement and enforce   55.5 (Corresponding onshore area designation),
55.11 (Delegation), and 55.12 (Consistency updates), as authority for these sections is reserved to the Administrator.
In addition, SLOCAPCD does not have SIP-approved Prevention of Significant Deterioration (``PSD'') regulations,
nor has it received delegation of authority from EPA for implementation and enforcement of the federal PSD program.
Therefore, EPA shall retain authority for the PSD provisions of part C of the Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder
at 40 CFR 52.21. 
Under section 328(a)(3) of the Act, EPA may delegate authority to implement and enforce the OCS air regulations to
a state if that state is adjacent to an OCS source and the Administrator determines that the state's regulations are
adequate. The State of California is adjacent to a number of OCS sources. For the OCS sources for which the San Luis Obispo
County has been designated the corresponding onshore area (COA), the State has submitted SLOCAPCD's regulations
to EPA and requested that EPA delegate to SLOCAPCD authority to implement and enforce the OCS air regulations. SLOCAPCD's
regulations have been reviewed by EPA and determined to be adequate for implementing and enforcing the delegable
sections of 40 CFR part 55. 
The OCS air regulations set forth the following criteria for delegation at 40 CFR 55.11: 
(1) The state has adopted the appropriate portions of 40 CFR part 55 into state law_SLOCAPCD adopted Rule 215, Outer
Continental Shelf Air Regulations, on November 17, 1992. This rule incorporates the provisions of 40 CFR part 55 that
EPA is delegating to the District. (NOTE: Section 55.5, corresponding onshore area designations, was adopted by
SLOCAPCD but EPA will not delegate authority for this section, as provided by  55.11(a)).

(2) The state has adequate authority under state law to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55_According
to a letter dated January 25, 1993 and forwarded to EPA from the State Attorney General, SLOCAPCD has the authority
to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55. 
(3) The state has adequate resources to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55_SLOCAPCD has submitted
information documenting that the District has adequate resources to implement and enforce the requirements of part
55. 
(4) The state has adequate administrative procedures to implement and enforce the requirements of this part, including
public notice and comment procedures_SLOCAPCD's administrative procedures have been reviewed by EPA and found
to be adequate. The following rules were submitted by SLOCAPCD for review to meet this requirement: 



Rule 110 Enforcement (Adopted 8/2/76) 
Rule 111 Arrests and Notices to Appear (Adopted 8/2/76)

Rule 302 Schedule of Fees (Adopted 9/15/92)

APCD has been designated the corresponding onshore area (COA), the State has submitted VCAPCD's regulations to EPA
and requested that EPA delegate authority to VCAPCD to implement and enforce the OCS air regulations. VCAPCD's regulations
have been reviewed by EPA and determined to be adequate for implementing and enforcing the delegable sections of 40
CFR part 55. 


The OCS regulations set forth the following criteria for delegation at 40 CFR 55.11:

(4) The state has adequate administrative procedures to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55, including
public notice and comment procedures_VCAPCD's administrative procedures have been reviewed by EPA and found to
be adequate. The following rules were submitted by VCAPCD for review to meet this requirement: 





Rule 8 Access to Facilities (Adopted 5/23/72, renumbered 11/21/78)

List of Communities Eligible for the Sale of Flood Insurance 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule identifies communities participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These communities
have applied to the program and have agreed to enact certain floodplain management measures. The communities' participation
in the program authorizes the sale of flood insurance to owners of property located in the communities listed. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return,
communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management aimed at protecting lives and new construction
from future flooding. Since the communities on the attached list have recently entered the NFIP, subsidized flood
insurance is now available for property in the community. 



In addition, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified the special flood hazard areas
in some of these communities by publishing a Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The
date of the flood map, if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth column of the table. In the communities listed
where a flood map has been published, Section 102 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, 42 U.S.C.
4012(a), requires the purchase of flood insurance as a condition of Federal or federally related financial assistance
for acquisition or construction of buildings in the special flood hazard areas shown on the map. 

The Director finds that the delayed effective dates would be contrary to the public interest. The Director also finds
that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary. 



National Environmental Policy Act




This rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR part 10, Environmental Considerations. No environmental
impact assessment has been prepared. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act




The Associate Director certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 
U.S.C. 601 et seq., because the rule creates no additional burden, but lists those communities eligible for the sale
of flood insurance. 



Regulatory Classification




This final rule is not a significant regulatory action under the criteria of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866
of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735. 



Paperwork Reduction Act




This rule does not involve any collection of information for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq. 



Executive Order 12612, Federalism




This rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism, October
26, 1987, 3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 252. 



Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform




This rule meets the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778, October 25, 1991, 56 FR 55195,

Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Aircraft Fuel Cells


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Defense (DoD).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule with request for public comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Defense has amended the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to prohibit the use
of Fiscal Year 1994 Department of Defense appropriated funds for acquisition of aircraft fuel cells unless such cells
are manufactured in the United States.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background


Section 8090 of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Appropriation Act (Pub. L. 103-139) prohibits use of Fiscal Year
1994 appropriated funds for acquisition of aircraft fuel cells unless such cells are manufactured in the United States.
The Director, Defense Procurement, issued Departmental Letter 94-003, March 7, 1994, to implement the restriction
on acquisition of aircraft fuel cells in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement. 


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Regulatory Flexibility Act applies but is not expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of
small entities because the revisions are limited to acquisition of aircraft fuel cells, and limit such acquisitions
to U.S. manufacturers. 


C. Paperwork Reduction Act


The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the revisions in this rulemaking notice do not contain 




and/or affect information collection requirements which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq. 


D. Determination To Issue an Interim Rule


A determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary of Defense to issue this rule as an interim rule.
Urgent and compelling reasons exist to promulgate this rule before affording the public an opportunity to comment.
This action is necessary because section 8090 became effective upon enactment of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Appropriations
Act (Pub. L. 103-139), on November 11, 1993. However, pursuant to Public Law 98-577 and Federal Acquisition
Regulation 1.501, public comments received in response to this interim rule will be considered in formulating the
final rule.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS amends the regulations governing the harvesting of Antarctic marine living resources and/or other associated
activities by persons subject to jurisdiction of the United States by adding regulations for the protection of land-based
ecosystem monitoring sites designated within Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Living Marine Resources
(CCAMLR) waters. The regulations implement conservation and management measures promulgated by the Commission
for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (Commission) and accepted in whole by the Government of
the United States to regulate activities within Convention waters. The Commission, at its ninth meeting in 1990,
established a procedure for protecting sites within the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP). Long-term
investigations of selected sites within CEMP will be conducted to monitor changes in the ecosystem. The Commission
determined that these sites are in need of the status of ``Specially Protected Sites'' similar to the program established
under the Antarctic Treaty. The intent of these regulations is to implement the agreed to procedures for CEMP.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


At its ninth annual meeting in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, in 1990, the Commission, of which the United States is
a member, adopted detailed procedures for according protection to sites within the CEMP. This protection, extended
pursuant to site-specific management plans, is intended to prevent adverse impacts to these sites resulting from
certain forms of human activities. Once approved, management plans will be reviewed every 5 years to determine whether
they require revision and whether continued protection is necessary. Section 307 of the Antarctic Living Marine
Resources Convention Act of 1984 (the Act) states that the Secretary of Commerce, after consultation with the heads
of appropriate agencies, shall promulgate such regulations as are necessary to implement the provisions of the Act
and the Conservation Measures adopted by the Commission. This notice adds regulatory text for previously reserved
 380.28 of 50 CFR part 380 to implement CEMP procedures and the Commission's approved CEMP management plans.
One part of the section requires individuals seeking permits in order to enter a CEMP site to apply either to NMFS or
the National Science Foundation (NSF) as follows: 
A. If the CEMP protected site is not also a site specially protected under the Antarctic Treaty, or the Protocol on Environmental
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, the individual must apply to NMFS for a CEMP entry permit. 
B. If the CEMP protected site is also a site specially protected under the Antarctic Treaty or the Protocol on Environmental
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, and, thus, a site requiring a permit under the Antarctic Conservation Act (ACA)
(and any superseding legislation), the individual must apply to NSF for a single CEMP/ACA permit. 


Classification 


The Secretary of Commerce has determined that this rule is necessary to implement the Act and to give effect to the conservation
and management measures adopted by the Commission and agreed to by the United States. 
This rule contains a collection-of-information requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. The collection
of information has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Approval Number 0648-0194). 
The annual reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1 hour per application, and
one half hour for preparation of a final report on the permitted activities. All reporting burden estimates include
the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed
and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any
other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Thomas J. McIntyre,
National Marine Fisheries Service, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management
and Budget (see 

ADDRESSES).

 
This rule is exempt from review under E. O. 12866.

Preparation Requirements for Letter-Size ZIP+4 and Barcoded Rate Mailings 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Postal Service.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule amends the Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) requirements governing the preparation of the residual portion
of second- and third-class letter-size automation rate mailings. This rule also includes an optional procedure
for preparing the residual portion of First-Class ZIP+4 and barcoded letter-size mail and changes to Line 2 of AADC
tray labels for letter-size mail.


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On September 22, 1993, the Postal Service published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 49402-49415) to require that the residual portion of second- and third-class letter-size automation
rate mailings be sorted to the automated area distribution center (AADC) level. 

As explained in the proposed rule, this change was needed to correct the processing problem that resulted when the
requirement for a states and mixed-states presort of second- and third-class residual mail was eliminated as part
of a larger change in preparation requirements that took effect March 21, 1993. At the time, the Postal Service did
not anticipate the magnitude of the resulting increase in residual mail that must be processed at origin. This increase
in non-presorted residual mail has exceeded the Postal Service's processing capabilities at many facilities, leading
to considerable problems. 

The proposed rule also introduced an additional preparation option for the residual portion of First-Class letter-size
automation rate mailings and changed the tray labeling requirement for Line 2 of AADC trays of letter-size mail. 

This final rule is intended to address the specific processing problem discussed in the proposed rule. As part of the
ongoing process of re-examining the mailing standards in the DMM, the Postal Service plans to take a more comprehensive
look at the standards for automation rate mail later this year, with a view to simplifying those standards. 



Evaluation of Comments Received 



The Postal Service received eight comments on the proposed rule, including five from mailing-related businesses,
two from companies or corporations, and one from an individual. These comments are discussed below. 



Package Size 



Four commenters raised concerns relative to the preparation and processing of small packages. The original proposal
did not contain a minimum package size for presortation of the residual portion of the mailing. Instead, it stated
that residual packages must be prepared if two or more pieces in a mailing destinate to an AADC area. The commenters
claimed that the creation of such small packages was burdensome to mailers and inefficient for the Postal Service.
One mailer also stated that banding small packages results in damage to the mailpieces that may render them unsuitable
for automated processing.

<TEXT>
 

The Postal Service shares the commenters' concerns about package size. After consideration of the comments received,
a decision was reached to require packaging of residual pieces only if 10 or more pieces destinate to an AADC area. The
10-piece minimum (which was formerly the minimum for state packages) balances concerns about extremely small packages
against the Postal Service's need to reduce piece handlings of residual mail at origin. Residual pieces not meeting
the 10-piece package minimum are to be placed in a working tray in AADC sequence. 



Processing Efficiency of Packages 



Three comments were received concerning the relative efficiency of processing residual AADC packages instead of
full, unpackaged residual trays. The commenters suggested that the costs associated with unbanding residual packages
prior to processing on automated equipment may outweigh any benefits the Postal Service receives through presorting.
These mailers stated that mail in full trays is more suitable for induction into high-speed automated equipment than
is mail in bundles. The commenters argued that the Postal Service might actually realize increased processing costs
for the residual portion of mailings as a result of the proposed preparation changes. 

The Postal Service has determined that presortation of the residual portion of a mailing will improve overall operating
efficiency for the Postal Service relative to nonpresorted residual trays. Mixed-AADC trays will contain AADC packages
that must be distributed at origin. However, no piece processing will be performed on this mail at the origin facility.
Piece processing of residual mail at origin will be limited to working trays containing pieces that do not meet the
10-piece minimum to an AADC area. Thus, presortation of residual mail will virtually eliminate piece processing
of this mail at the origin facility. Although there is some cost to handle packages, the Postal Service has concluded
that this cost is outweighed by the need to correct the processing problems currently presented by piece handling
of residual mail, as described in the proposed rule. Moreover, a significant proportion of the packages will not be
handled at origin; for example, all residual mail in AADC trays will be routed directly to destination. Also, the new
requirements allow for the creation of full AADC trays of residual mail that is not packaged. 



Additional Mailer Operating Costs 



Five commenters stated that the proposed changes would increase their operating costs. Two of these mailers remarked
that the Postal Service is essentially transferring costs from mail processing plants to mailer plants. Two of the
commenters expressed concerns about the costs of training their workers on the new requirements. One mailer commented
that the proposed changes were incompatible with his operation and would require substantial and costly changes
to his production processes. 

The residual preparation requirements in this rule are comparable to those in effect prior to March 21, 1993, for automated
rate second- and third-class letters prepared in sacks, and those still in effect for nonautomated presort second-
and third-class letters. Prior to the March 21, 1993, change, mailers were required to prepare packages of residual
second- and third-class automated rate letters and place them in state and mixed-states sacks. State sacks were then
routed to a destination SDC for processing while mixed-states sacks were, in most cases, processed at the origin SCF.


This rule will require similar presortation of the residual portion of second- and third-class automated rate letter
mailings. Like state packages and sacks, residual AADC packages and trays involve presortation of the residual portion
of a mailing in order to bypass outgoing processing operations at the origin facility. Only mail in working trays will
be processed at the origin SCF, as was mixed-states mail under the previous preparation requirements. 

Requiring this presortation of the residual portion of a second- or third-class mailing is justified by the fact that
some degree of worksharing is assumed in the basic rate paid for second- and third-class residual letters, a rate that
is substantially reduced from the single-piece rate. 

One commenter expressed concern about being required to prepare a large number of less-than-full residual AADC trays,
which would be a waste of time and space. This final rule, which permits AADC packages of 10 or more pieces to be placed
in a mixed-AADC tray if a full AADC tray cannot be prepared, and allows groups of fewer than 10 pieces to an AADC to be placed
in working trays, avoids the potential problem raised by this commenter. 



Creation of Nonuniform Preparation Standards for Different Classes of Automated Mail 



One commenter stated that the proposed changes represented a retreat from the Postal Service's declared goal of simplified
and standardized mail preparation requirements. This mailer remarked that adopting the proposed changes would
necessitate the retraining of his workforce and lead to verification problems for the Postal Service. 

Although the changes in this rule will make the required preparation of the residual portion of second- and third-class
automated rate letters different from that for First-Class Mail, the Postal Service believes these changes are appropriate
given the processing problems that led to the proposed rule and the discount mailers receive for basic rate mail in
second- and third-class mailings. Furthermore, the final regulations are modified to allow First-Class mailers
the option of preparing residual mail according to the residual sortation options required for second- and third-class
mail. This modification will allow mailers the opportunity to presort first-, second-, and third-class mailings
in a uniform manner. 



Lower Minimum for 3-Digit Packages

One commenter recommended that the Postal Service reduce or eliminate the 50-piece minimum for qualifying 3-digit
mail as a way to reduce the residual volume. This mailer proposed that the Postal Service eliminate the 3-digit qualifying
minimum for automated mail if it is prepared in trays on SCF pallets and reduce the minimum to 10 pieces for mail that
is 100 percent delivery point barcoded. The result, according to this mailer, would be a significant reduction in
the amount of residual mail requiring processing at the origin plant. 


Relaxation of the 50-piece minimum for qualifying 3-digit mail under package-based preparation is not being considered
at the present time. Under tray-based preparation options, second- and third-class mail in SCF trays is not required
to meet a 50-piece minimum for a 3-digit area. However, this rule gives mailers an option to prepare the residual portion
of package-based mailings by 3-digit area with no minimum package size. 





Limit Residual Preparation to Full AADC Trays 




One commenter suggested that the Postal Service test the feasibility of limiting the preparation of residual mail
to full AADC trays. Residual mail that remained after full AADC trays were prepared would not require sortation. The
commenter contended that this limited approach might solve the processing problems caused by residual mail volumes.



Limiting residual preparation to full AADC trays would not adequately address the problem of excessive volumes of
working residual mail at origin. Most AADC areas contain five or fewer 3-digit ZIP Code areas, making it very unlikely
that full trays of residual mail could be prepared for these AADCs given that 3-digit packages must be prepared at 50
pieces. In order to relieve the problems associated with processing residual mail at origin, a more substantial presortation
of the residual portion of a mailing than that suggested by this commenter is necessary. 



Allocate Barcode Sorters to Residual Mail Processing 




One commenter suggested that each of the 10 processing and distribution areas set up a centralized facility for processing
residual mail. Under this scenario, origin processing plants would divert the residual portion of automation rate
mailings to this centralized site for processing. 


Equipment deployment decisions are based on originating and destinating volumes for all classes of mail within a
processing and distribution plant's service area. Allocating equipment based on originating residual volumes
of second- and third-class letters would result in sub-optimal utilization of automated equipment. The Postal Service
believes that presortation of residual volumes, as described in this rule, is a reasonable and effective way to deal
with the processing problems caused by piece processing of residual mail. 



Summary of Changes 




The following is a summary of the changes, by preparation option in DMM Module M. 



ZIP+4 Presort and Barcoded Tray-Based Mailings (DMM M812 and M814) 



This rule will require presortation of the residual portion of second- and third-class mailings by AADC area. These
changes are optional for First-Class mailings. Changes in residual preparation are as follows: 

 Full AADC trays must be prepared if enough pieces exist to fill a tray. Packaging is not required in full AADC
trays. 

 AADC packages must be prepared if 10 or more residual pieces destinate to an AADC area. 

 Less-than-full AADC trays are not permitted except for optional overflow trays. 

 AADC packages of 10 or more pieces not placed in a full AADC tray must be banded, labeled, and placed in a mixed-AADC
tray. 

 AADC packages must bear a pink Label A or optional endorsement line (OEL).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940314-0-00054 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940314-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 AADC packages must be banded, except when placed in full AADC trays. Separator cards are not allowed in overflow
AADC trays or in mixed-AADC trays. 

 Mail remaining after preparing AADC packages must be placed in working trays in AADC sequence. 



ZIP+4 Presort and Barcoded Package-Based Mailings (DMM M813, M815, and M816) 



This rule will require that the residual portion of second- and third-class package-based mailings be prepared under
one of the two options described below. Both options require presortation of residual pieces by AADC area. First-Class
mailings may be prepared under either of these options, which together will replace the current AADC tray option,
or under the existing ZIP Code sequencing and listing option or the physical separation option. 



SCF/AADC Preparation Option 



Under this option, the residual and qualifying portions of the mailing may be combined in SCF and AADC trays. Residual
pieces must be sorted into AADC packages if 10 or more pieces destinate to an AADC area. All pieces that do not meet the
10-piece minimum are placed in working trays. In addition, mailers have the option of preparing residual mail into
3-digit packages prior to preparing required AADC packages. Three-digit residual packages must be labeled (green
Label 3 or OEL or separator card label) and placed in SCF trays. AADC packages must be packaged and labeled (pink Label
A or OEL) and placed in AADC trays and mixed-AADC trays, except that pieces in full AADC trays containing only residual
mail need not be packaged and labeled. AADC trays must be prepared if enough pieces exist to fill a tray. Less-than-full
AADC trays are permitted. Mixed-AADC trays must be prepared unless all residual mail is trayed to the AADC level. Mixed-AADC
trays are limited to AADC packages of residual mail. Pieces remaining after preparing and traying AADC packages are
working mail and must be placed in working trays in AADC sequence. In barcoded three-tier package-based mailings
prepared under M816, residual mail is not permitted in the 5-digit tier. 



Separate AADC Sortation 



Under this option, the residual portion of the mailing is presented separately from the qualifying portion in AADC,
mixed-AADC, and working trays. AADC packages must be prepared if 10 or more pieces destinate to an AADC area, except
that pieces in full AADC trays need not be packaged. AADC trays must be prepared if enough pieces exist to fill a tray.
Less-than-full AADC trays are permitted. Remaining AADC packages must be placed in mixed-AADC trays. AADC packages
must be labeled with a pink Label A or OEL. All pieces that do not meet the 10-piece minimum per AADC are placed in separate
working trays in AADC sequence. 


Labeling Changes 



The AADC tray label for two-tier package-based preparation under DMM M815 is revised to change the position of the
term ``LTRS'' on the second line so that it is consistent with other tray labels. The AADC tray label for 3-tier package-based
preparation under DMM M816 is revised to delete the term ``3D'' when SCF/AADC residual preparation is used. Since
these trays will contain both 3-digit and AADC packages, the description ``3D'' is no longer appropriate. 

In addition, the labeling format for mixed-AADC and working trays is as follows: 

 ZIP+4 mixed-AADC trays: On Line 1 use ``MXD'' followed by the applicable origin SCF name, state, and ZIP Code
from L002, Column A (facilities identified with three bullets), or Column B, except use L805 for second- and third-class
mail entered by the mailer at a BMC/ASF. On Line 2 use class followed by ZIP+4 PRESORT PKGS. 

 ZIP+4 working trays: On Line 1 use ``MXD'' followed by the applicable origin SCF name, state, and ZIP Code from
L002, Column A (facilities identified with three bullets), or Column B, except use L805 for second- and third-class
mail entered by the mailer at a BMC/ASF. On Line 2 use class followed by ZIP+4 WORKING or ZIP+4 WKG. 

 Barcoded mixed-AADC trays: On Line 1 use ``MXD'' followed by the applicable origin SCF name, state, and ZIP
Code from L002, Column A (facilities identified with three bullets), or Column B, except use L805 for second- and third-class
mail entered by the mailer at a BMC/ASF. On Line 2 use class followed by LTRS BARCODED PKGS. 

 Barcoded working trays: On Line 1 use ``MXD'' followed by the applicable origin SCF name, state, and ZIP Code
from L002, Column A (facilities identified with three bullets), or Column B, except use L805 for second- and third-class
mail entered by the mailer at a BMC/ASF. On Line 2 use class followed by LTRS BARCODED WKG.

5.0 Residual Mail 
5.1 Definition 


Pieces remaining after packages and trays are prepared under 2.0 through 4.0 are residual (nonqualifying) mail.
Residual second- and third-class mail must be prepared under an option in 5.2 and 5.3. Residual First-Class Mail must
be prepared under 5.2 and 5.3, or 5.4, or 5.5, except that preparation may be finer than those standards, by agreement
between the mailer and the entry post office for multiple acceptance times. Residual mail from automated site mailings
under 4.0 is subject to specific instructions where applicable. All residual mail must be presented under 5.6. 


5.2 AADC Residual Preparation Options 


Residual second- and third-class mail must be prepared under one of these options and in accordance with 5.3. First-Class
Mail may be prepared under one of these options and 5.3 if not prepared under 5.4 or 5.5. 
a. Separate AADC Preparation. Residual mail is trayed separately from qualifying mail. Groups of 10 or more residual
pieces to an AADC area in L804 (or L803 or automated site preparation) are placed in AADC trays and mixed-AADC trays.
AADC trays are required if there are enough pieces to fill a tray, but less-than-full AADC trays are permitted. Residual
pieces in mixed-AADC trays and in less-than-full AADC trays must be prepared and labeled as AADC packages. Remaining
groups of fewer than 10 pieces to an AADC are placed in separate working trays. Packages and trays must be prepared under
5.3. 
b. Intermixed SCF/AADC Preparation. Some residual mail is trayed with qualifying mail. Groups of 10 or more residual
pieces to the same AADC area in L804 (or L803 for automated site preparation) are packaged by AADC and placed in AADC
trays (with qualifying mail) and in mixed-AADC trays. AADC trays are required if there are enough pieces to fill a tray,
but less-than-full AADC trays are permitted. AADC trays containing only residual AADC packages are allowed. Mixed-AADC
trays are limited to residual AADC packages. At the mailer's option, residual mail may be packaged by 3-digit ZIP Code
and placed in SCF trays (remaining pieces sorted by AADC). A less-than-full tray for the origin SCF containing only
residual packages is allowed. Remaining groups of fewer than 10 pieces to an AADC are placed in separate working trays.
Packages and trays must be prepared under 5.3. First-Class automated site mailings in which the residual portion
contains pieces not listed in L801 must not use this option. 


5.3 AADC Residual Preparation 


Subject to 5.1 and 5.2, residual mail must be prepared as follows: 
a. Package size: 
(1) 3-digit (option 5.2b only): optional with no minimum for residual pieces in single- or multi-3-digit SCF trays.

(2) AADC: required at 10 pieces for residual pieces in mixed-AADC trays, in less-than-full AADC trays, and in AADC
trays (under option 5.2b) that also contain qualifying mail. Packages of fewer pieces not permitted. Use L804 (or
L803 for automated site preparation). 
(3) Working: required grouping of pieces by AADC in working trays. Use L804 (or L803 for automated site preparation).
Packaging required only in a less-than-full working tray as follows: Prepare as few packages as possible, each not
more than 6 inches thick, without regard to AADC breaks. 
b. Package presort and labeling: 
(1) Optional 3-digit (only for option 5.2b): use green Label 3 or OEL. 
(2) AADC (required, except in full residual AADC trays): use pink Label A or OEL. 
(3) Working (required in less-than-full working tray): use facing slip marked ``WORKING'' or ``WKG'' or the optional
endorsement line ``WORKING.''

option 5.2b): required full trays; less-than-full and overflow trays prohibited, except for one less-than-full
tray for the single 3-digit origin SCF. This tray is not available for residual of automated site mailings. 
(2) Optional SCF (only for option 5.2b): required full trays; less-than-full and overflow trays prohibited, except
for one less-than-full tray for the origin SCF. (For automated site mailings, one less-than-full tray for the origin
SCF is permitted only if the origin SCF is listed in L802; see 4.5b.) 
(3) AADC: required if enough pieces to fill tray; less-than-full and overflow trays permitted. 
(4) Mixed-AADC: required full trays; one less-than-full tray permitted. 
(5) Working: required full trays; one less-than-full tray permitted. 
d. Tray presort sequence and Line 1 labeling: 
(1) Optional 3-digit (only for single 3-digit SCFs under option 5.2b); use L002, Column A (facilities identified
with three bullets), on Line 1. This tray is not available for the residual mail of automated site mailings. 
(2) Optional SCF (only for option 5.2b); use L802 on Line 1 for automated site mailings; for other mailings use L002,
Column B, on Line 1 for 3-digit areas listed in Column C. 
(3) AADC (required); use L803 on Line 1 for automated site mailings; for other mailings, use L804 on Line 1. 
(4) Mixed-AADC (required); on Line 1 use ``MXD'' followed by the applicable origin SCF name, state, and SCF code from
L002, Column A (facilities identified with three bullets), or Column B, except use L805 for second- and third-class
mail entered by the mailer at an ASF or BMC. 
(5) Working (required); on Line 1 use ``MXD'' followed by the applicable origin SCF name, state, and SCF code from L002,
Column A (facilities identified with three bullets), or Column B, except use L805 for second- and third-class mail
entered by the mailer at an ASF or BMC. 
e. Line 2: class (FCM, 2C, NEWS, or 3C), followed by:

mail.



6.0 Documentation



* * * * *



6.3 Standards



Documentation must meet the basic standards in P012 and those below. Residual mail is included in the documentation
if prepared under 5.2 and 5.3, or 5.4, or in the summary alone if prepared under 5.5. Abbreviated documentation may
be provided under M817. Combined mailings of second-class publications must be documented under E238.



6.4 Segmentation, Labeling



Documentation must be segmented and labeled by qualification tier (e.g., presort and residual). A residual segment
is not required for First-Class Mail prepared under 5.5. Each tier must be further segmented by type of package/grouping
(5-digit, 3-digit, AADC, as applicable) under 6.5, or have all represented 3- and 5-digit ZIP Codes (and AADC codes
for residual mail under 5.2 and 5.3) reported in a continuous sequential list under 6.6 within each tier listing. Under
either option, data must be presented as shown in 6.7 and 6.8.



6.5 Type of Package Option



If the report is segmented by type of package, for each type, individual entries for each destination must be ordered
sequentially by ZIP Code: by 5-digit ZIP Code for 5-digit packages; by lowest assigned 5-digit ZIP Code for city packages
(second-class only); by 3-digit ZIP Code for 3-digit packages and First-Class residual mail prepared under 5.4;
and, for AADC packages and AADC groups (in working trays) under 5.2 and 5.3, by the applicable 3-digit AADC code in L803
(for automated site mailings) or L804 (AADC entries must be preceded by ``AADC'').



6.6 Sequential List Option



If the report is a sequential list, individual entries for each destination must be ordered sequentially by ZIP Code
within each tier, regardless of package type: by 5-digit ZIP Code for 5-digit packages; by lowest assigned 5-digit
ZIP Code for city packages (second-class only); by 3-digit ZIP Code for 3-digit packages and First-Class residual
mail prepared under 5.4; and, for AADC packages and AADC groups (in working trays) under 5.2 and 5.3, by the applicable
3-digit AADC code in L803 (for automated site mailings) or L804. AADC entries must be preceded by the prefix ``AADC.''
For second-class only, listings for 5-digit, city, and 3-digit packages must be preceded by the prefixes 5DG, CTY,
and 3DG, respectively.

4.0 Residual Mail
4.1 Definition 


Pieces remaining after packages and trays are prepared under 2.0 and 3.0 are residual (nonqualifying) mail. Residual
second- and third-class mail must be prepared under an option in 4.2 and 4.3. Residual First-Class Mail must be prepared
under 4.2 and 4.3, or 4.4, or 4.5, except that preparation may be finer than those standards, by agreement between the
mailer and the entry post office for multiple acceptance times. All residual mail must be presented under 4.6. 


4.2 AADC Residual Preparation Options 


Residual second- and third-class mail must be prepared under one of these options and in accordance with 4.3. First-Class
Mail may be prepared under one of these options and 4.3 if not prepared under 4.4 or 4.5.

pieces to an AADC area in L804 are placed in AADC trays and mixed-AADC trays. AADC trays are required if there are enough
pieces to fill a tray, but less-than-full AADC trays are permitted. Residual pieces in mixed-AADC trays and in less-than-full
AADC trays must be prepared and labeled as AADC packages. Remaining groups of fewer than 10 pieces to an AADC are placed
in separate working trays. Packages and trays must be prepared under 4.3. 
b. Intermixed SCF/AADC Preparation. Some residual mail is trayed with qualifying mail. Groups of 10 or more residual
pieces to the same AADC area in L804 are packaged by AADC and placed in AADC trays (with qualifying mail) and in mixed-AADC
trays. AADC trays are required if there are enough pieces to fill a tray, but less-than-full AADC trays are permitted.
AADC trays containing only residual AADC packages are allowed. Mixed-AADC trays are limited to residual AADC packages.
At the mailer's option, residual mail may be packaged by 3-digit ZIP Code and placed in SCF trays (remaining pieces
sorted by AADC). A less-than-full tray for the origin SCF containing only residual packages is allowed. Remaining
groups of fewer than 10 pieces to an AADC are placed in separate working trays. Packages and trays must be prepared under
4.3. 


4.3 AADC Residual Preparation
