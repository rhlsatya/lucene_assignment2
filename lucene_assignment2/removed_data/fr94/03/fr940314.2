<DOCTITLE>Pilot Programs Allowing More Than One Official Agency To Provide Official Services Within A Single Geographic Area</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS).






</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice With Comment Period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Amendments in 1993 changed the United States Grain Standards Act, as amended (Act). One of these changes provides
that the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) may conduct pilot programs allowing more than one official agency
to provide official services within a single geographic area. FGIS is announcing its intent to conduct one or more
such pilot programs. FGIS is requesting comments on the specific pilot programs described below, and FGIS also is
requesting suggestions for other possible pilot programs in lieu of or in addition to those listed below.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Sections 7(f) and 7A of the Act were amended by the U.S. Grain Standards Act Amendments of 1993 (Public Law 103-156)
on November 24, 1993, to authorize FGIS' Administrator to conduct pilot programs allowing more than one official
agency to provide official services within a single geographic area without undermining the declared policy of the
Act. The purpose of the pilot programs is to evaluate the impact of allowing more than one official agency to provide
official services within a single geographic area. FGIS is considering several possible pilot programs and may conduct
one or more pilot programs. Official agencies selected by FGIS to participate in a pilot program would be allowed to
provide official services in specified areas during the test period, and these agencies would provide FGIS with information
on such official services. Following the pilot programs, FGIS would evaluate the impact of allowing more than one
official agency to provide service within a single geographic area. FGIS is considering the following possible pilot
programs and may select one or more of these or other suggested pilot programs for a test.



1. Barges on selected rivers or portions of rivers as defined by FGIS. Agencies would be allowed to provide official
services for barges at these locations in addition to the agency already designated to serve these locations.

2. Exceptions. Agencies having exceptions to their assigned geographic areas would be allowed to provide official
services at these specified locations in addition to the official agency already designated to serve these points.

3. Commercial inspection services. Agencies would be allowed to provide official commercial inspection services
outside their assigned geographic areas.

4. Submitted samples. Agencies would be allowed to enter another agency's assigned area to pick up submitted samples.

5. Timeliness of service. If an official agency can not provide the requested services within 12 hours of the request,
the applicant may request such services from another official agency.

Commenters are encouraged to submit reasons and pertinent data for support or objection to the pilot programs described
above. FGIS is also requesting suggestions regarding other possible pilot programs in addition to or in lieu of those
listed above. All comments and suggestions must be submitted to the Compliance Division at the above address.

Comments and other available information will be considered in determining which pilot programs to conduct. FGIS
will publish notice of any pilot programs to be conducted.

Food Stamp Program: Maximum Allotments for Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin Islands



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Nutrition Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 General Notice






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 By this notice, the Department of Agriculture is updating the maximum food stamp allotments for participating households
in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. These annual adjustments, required by law, take into account changes
in the cost of food and statutory adjustments.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Publication



As required by law, State agencies implemented this action on October 1, 1993 based on advance notice of the new amounts.
Based on regulations published at 47 FR 46485 (October 19, 1982) annual statutory adjustments to the maximum allotment
levels, income eligibility standards, and deductions are issued by General Notices published in the 

Federal Register

 and not through rulemaking proceedings.



Classification



Executive Order 12866 



The Food and Nutrition Service is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and has determined
that it is not a ``significant regulatory action.'' Based on information compiled by the Department, it has been determined
that this action: (1) Would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; (2) would not adversely affect in
a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; (3) would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise
interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (4) would not materially alter the budgetary impact of
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof; and (5) would
not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set
forth in Executive Order 12866.



Executive Order 12372




The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551. For the reasons set
forth in the Final rule and related Notice to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V (48 FR 29116, June 24, 1983), this program is excluded
from the scope of Executive Order No. 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.



Regulatory Flexibility Act




William E. Ludwig, the Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service, has certified that this action will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The action will increase the amount of money
spent on food through increases in food stamp benefits issued to participating households. However, this money will
be distributed among the nation's food vendors as the food stamps are used by households, so the effect on any one vendor
will not be significant.

This action does not contain reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to review by the Office of Management

Background



Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) and Allotments



The TFP is a plan for the consumption of foods of different types (food groups) that families might use to provide nutritious
meals and snacks for family members. The plan suggests amounts of food for men, women, and children of different ages,
and it meets most dietary standards. The cost of the TFP is adjusted monthly to reflect changes in the costs of the food
groups.

TFPs for Alaska and Hawaii are based upon an adjusted average for the six-month period that ends with June 1993. Since
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (the source of food price data) no longer publishes monthly information to compute
Alaska and Hawaii TFPs, the adjusted average provides a proxy for actual June 1993 TFP costs. The adjusted average
is equal to January-June 1993 TFP costs for Alaska and Hawaii increased by the average percentage difference
between the cost of the TFP in Alaska and Hawaii in June and the January-June average from 1976 through 1986 (a
1.53 percent increase over January-June costs in Alaska and a 1.82 percent increase in Hawaii).

For the period January through June 1993, the average cost of the TFP was $467.70 in Alaska and $596 in Hawaii. The proxies
for actual June 1993 TFP costs were $474.86 in Alaska and $606.85 in Hawaii. The June 1993 cost of the TFP was $587.70
in Guam and $469.10 in the Virgin islands.

The TFP is also the basis for establishing food stamp allotments. Food stamp allotments are adjusted periodically
to reflect changes in food cost levels. Section 3(o)(11) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2012(o)(11))
provides for an adjustment on October 1, 1993, based upon 103 percent of the June 1993 cost of the TFP for a family of four
persons consisting of a man and woman ages 20-50 and children ages 6-8 and 9-11.

The maximum food stamp benefit or allotment is paid to households which have no net income. For households which have
some income, their allotment is determined by reducing the maximum allotment for their household size by 30% of the
household's net income. To obtain the maximum food stamp allotment for each household size, the TFP costs for the four-person
household were increased by 3 percent, divided by four, multiplied by the appropriate household size and economy
of scale factor, and the final result was rounded down to the nearest dollar.

Pursuant to section 3(o)(3) of the Food Stamp Act (7 U.S.C. 2012(o)(3)), maximum food stamp benefits for Guam and the
Virgin Islands cannot exceed those in the 50 States and D.C., so they are based upon the lower of their respective TFPs
or the TFP for rural II Alaska. In addition, the urban Alaska allotment is the higher of the allotment that was in effect
in urban areas on October 1, 1985 or 100.79 percent of the adjusted Anchorage TFP (see 50 FR 18456, dated May 1, 1984,
and 51 FR 16281, dated May 2, 1986).

According to regulations published at 51 FR 16281, on May 2, 1986, the allotment for rural I areas is the higher of the
allotment that was in effect in each rural I area on October 1, 1985 or 128.52 percent of the Anchorage TFP (as adjusted).
The rural II allotment is 156.42 percent of the adjusted Anchorage TFP (Alaska TFP). For further information concerning
the allotments for urban Alaska, rural I Alaska, and rural II Alaska, see 51 FR 16281, dated May 2, 1986.

The following table shows new allotments for urban Alaska, rural I Alaska, rural II Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin
Islands.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Publication



As required by law, State agencies must implement this action on October 1, 1993 based on advance notice of the new amounts.
In accordance with regulations published at 47 FR 46485-46487 (October 19, 1982), annual statutory adjustments

 and not through rulemaking proceedings.



Classification



Executive Order 12866



The Food and Nutrition Service is issuing this notice in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and has determined
that it is an ``economically significant regulatory action.'' Based on information compiled by the Department,
it has been determined that this action will increase Food Stamp Program's cost by more than $100 million. It will not
result in a major increase in costs or prices except to the Federal Government, nor will it affect competition, productivity,
employment, investment or innovation.



Executive Order 12372



The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551. For the reasons set
forth in the final rule related notice to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V (48 FR 29116, June 24, 1983), this program is excluded
from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



William E. Ludwig, the Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service, has certified that this action will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The action will increase the amount of money
spent on food through food stamps. However, this money will be distributed among the nation's food vendors, so the
effect on any one vendor will not be significant.



Paperwork Reduction Act



This action does not contain reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to approval by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB).

Need for Action



This action is required by sections 3(o) (1) and (11), 5(c), and 5(e)(4) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended (7 U.S.C.
secs. 2012(o) (1) and (11), 2014(c), and 2014(e) the ``Food Stamp Act''). Section 3(o)(11) requires that the October
1, 1993 change in food stamp allotments be based upon 103 percent of the June 1993 cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP)
for a family of four persons consisting of a man and woman ages 20-50 and children ages 6-8 and 9-11.
Adjustments are made to take into account household size, economies of scale and a requirement to round the final results
down to the nearest dollar increments. Section 5(c) requires that the income eligibility standards for the program
be adjusted on October 1, 1993 based on changes in the Federal income poverty guidelines. Section 5(e)(4) requires
that the standard deductions and the maximum amounts for the excess shelter expense deductions be adjusted on October
1, 1993 to the nearest lower dollar increments to reflect certain changes for the 12 months ending June 30, 1993. Section
13912 of the Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act, chapter 3 of P.L. 103-66, the Omnibus Reconciliation
Act of 1993, amends section 5(e) by further raising the excess shelter expense deduction cap effective July 1, 1994.



Benefits



This action increases maximum food stamp allotments, income eligibility standards, and deductions based on the
changing cost of living.



Costs



It is estimated that this action will increase the cost of the Food Stamp Program by approximately $652.6 million in
Fiscal Year 1994.



Background



Income Eligibility Standards



The eligibility of households for the Food Stamp Program, except those in which all members are receiving public assistance
(PA) or supplemental security income benefits (SSI), is determined by comparing their incomes to the appropriate
income eligibility standards (limits). Households containing an elderly or disabled member need to have net incomes
below the net income limits, while households which do not contain an elderly or disabled member must have net incomes
below the net income limit and gross incomes below the gross income limit. Households in which all members are receiving
PA or SSI are categorically eligible; their incomes do not have to be below the income limits.

In addition, elderly individuals (and their spouses) who are unable to prepare meals because of certain disabilities,
may be considered separate households, even if they are living and eating with another household. 7 U.S.C. Sec. 2012(i).
The Food Stamp Act limits separate household status to those persons who meet both of the following requirements:

(1) Their own income may not exceed the net income eligibility standards, and 

(2) The income of those with whom they reside may not exceed 165 percent of the poverty line.

The net and gross income limits are derived from the Federal income poverty guidelines. The net income limit is 100
percent of the guidelines; the gross income limit is 130 percent of the guidelines. The guidelines are updated annually.
Based on that update, the Food Stamp Program's income eligibility standards are updated annually. The effective
date of October 1 is required by the Food Stamp Act.

The revised income eligibility standards are as follows:

Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) and Allotments 



The TFP is a plan for the consumption of foods of different types (food groups) that households might use to provide
nutritious meals and snacks for 
household members. The plan suggests amounts of food for men, 
women, and children of different ages, and it meets dietary 
standards. The cost of the TFP is adjusted annually to reflect 
changes in the costs of the food groups. 
 
The TFP is also the basis for establishing food stamp allotments. 
Nationally, food stamp allotment levels are adjusted periodically 
to reflect changes in food cost levels. Section 3(o)(11) of the 
Food Stamp Act (7 U.S.C. Sec. 2012(o)(11)), provides for an 
adjustment on October 1, 1993, based upon 103 percent of the June 
1993 cost of the TFP for a family of four persons consisting of a 
man and woman ages 20-50 and children ages 6-8 and 9-11. In June 
1993, the cost of the TFP was $364.90 in the 48 States and D.C. 
 
To obtain the maximum food stamp benefit for each household size, 
June 1993 TFP costs for the four-person household (of $364.90) 
were increased by 3 percent, divided by four, multiplied by the 
appropriate household size and economy of scale factor, and the 
final result was rounded down to the nearest dollar. The maximum 
benefit, or allotment, is paid to households which have no net 
income. For households which have some income, the individual 
household's allotment is determined by reducing the maximum 
allotment for the household's size by 30 percent of the 
individual household's net income. 
 
The following tables show the new allotments for the 48 States 
and DC. 
 
 
 

 
 
 

Minimum Benefit. 
 


Pursuant to Section 8(a) of the Food Stamp Act, 
the $10 minimum monthly benefit provided to all one- and two-person households must be adjusted on each October 1 to
reflect 
the percentage change in the TFP for the 12-month period ending 
the preceding June, with the result rounded to the nearest $5. 
In order to implement this provision of the law, the minimum 
benefit is adjusted each year as follows: (1) The percentage 
change in the TFP from June of the previous year to June of the 
current year (prior to rounding) is calculated; (2) this 
percentage change is multiplied by the previous ``unrounded'' 
minimum benefit to obtain a new unrounded benefit amount; and (3) 
the new unrounded minimum benefit is then rounded to the nearest 
$5 in accordance with the statutory provisions.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940314-2-00011 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940314-2-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The unrounded cost of the TFP was $355.55 in June 1992 and $364.895 in June 1993. The change from June 1992 to June 1993
is 102.6284%, which when multiplied by $10.96, the unrounded minimum benefit in Fiscal Year 1993, results in a new
unrounded minimum benefit of $11.25. Rounded to the nearest $5, the minimum benefit for Fiscal Year 1994 is $10.



Deductions



Food stamp benefits are calculated on the basis of an individual household's net income. Deductions serve to lower
household net income and thus to increase household benefits. When a household's net income decreases, its food stamp
benefits increase. 

The standard deduction is available to all households. The excess shelter expense deduction is available to households
with extremely high shelter costs. There is a maximum amount for the excess shelter deduction for households with
no elderly or disabled members but no maximum for households with elderly or disabled members. The standard deduction
and the maximum amount for the excess shelter expense deduction for households with no elderly or disabled members
are being adjusted by this Notice. 

This Notice is also adjusting the homeless household shelter expense. The homeless household shelter expense is
a standard estimate of the shelter expenses of homeless households and is available to households in which all members
are homeless and are not receiving free shelter throughout the month. 



Adjustment of the Standard Deduction



Section 5(e) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended, provides that, in computing household income, households shall
be allowed a standard deduction. (7 U.S.C. Sec. 2014(e)). Section 5(e) also requires that the standard deduction
be adjusted periodically. The deduction for the 48 States and DC was last adjusted effective October 1, 1992. Section
5(e)(4) requires that the adjustment in the level of the standard deduction shall take into account changes in the
Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for items
other than food (7 U.S.C. Sec. 2014(e)(4)). The adjustments are rounded to the nearest lower dollar pursuant to the
requirements of Section 5(e). There are separate standard deductions for the 48 States and DC, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam,
and the Virgin Islands. 




The following table shows the deductions resulting from the last adjustment, the unrounded results of this adjustment,
and the new deduction amounts that go into effect on October 1, 1993. 






Adjustment of the Shelter Deduction



Section 5(e) of the Food Stamp Act also provides that, in computing household income, households shall be allowed
a deduction for certain excess shelter expenses. 
7 U.S.C. Sec. 2014(e). There is a maximum amount for the excess shelter expense deduction, unless the household has
an elderly or disabled member, in which case there is no maximum. The maximum amount for the excess shelter expense
deduction is adjusted each October 1 based on changes in the shelter, fuel and utilities components of housing costs
in the  CPI-U published by BLS. 
Moreover, Section 13912 of the Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act amends 5(e) by raising the excess shelter
expense deduction cap over a period of three years before removing it altogether. The first increase is effective
July 1, 1994. 
Shelter deductions for the 48 States and DC are at one level while shelter deductions for Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and
the Virgin Islands are set separately.

resulting from the last adjustment, the unrounded results of this 
adjustment, and the new maximum excess shelter deductions that went 
into effect October 1, 1993, as well as the new maximum excess 
shelter deduction that is required by statute to go into effect 
July 1, 1994.
 







Adjustment of the Homeless Household Shelter Expense



Section 11(e)(3)(E) of the Food Stamp Act requires the Secretary 
to prescribe rules requiring state agencies to develop standard 
estimates of the shelter expenses that may reasonably be expected 
to be incurred by households in which all members are homeless 
but which are not receiving free shelter throughout the month. 7 
U.S.C. Sec. 2020(e)(3)(E). In recognition of the difficulty 
State agencies may face in gathering the necessary information to 
compute standard shelter estimates for their States, the 
Secretary offered a standard estimate which may be used by all 
State agencies in lieu of their own estimates. 

In the Deduction and Disaster Provisions from the Mickey Leland 
Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act final rule, published at 56 
FR 63613 (December 4, 1991), the Department stated that it would 
annually adjust the homeless household shelter expense each 
October 1 using the same changes in the shelter, fuel and 
utilities component of the CPI used in indexing the shelter cap. 
This year's homeless household shelter expense is $137.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to document
the analysis of the effects of alternatives for management of white fir timber stands infested with fir engraver beetles
(Scolytus Ventralis) within the Nebo Management Area of the Spanish Fork Ranger District of the Uinta National Forest.
The proposed action is to implement management activities that will support the desired future condition for the
Nebo Management Areas outlined in the Uinta National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) in accordance
with the requirements of 36 CFR 219.17 and 219.27.



The project area is located south of Payson, Utah, and northeast of Nephi, Utah, on lands accessible from the Mt. Nebo
Loop Scenic Byway. The largest concentration of infected timber stands are in the Sheepherder Hill area (Sections
15, 22-24, 28, 29, T10S, R2E, Salt Lake Meridian). The purpose of this proposed management action is to save the
remaining healthy trees by removing the competition that may be posed by dead and dying conifer trees and planting
seedlings to accelerate the recovery time for reestablishing a healthy forest.

Implementation of activities to restore a healthy forest condition may require entry into areas designated as roadless
in the 1980 RARE II inventory.

The agency invites comments and suggestions on the scope of the analysis. In addition, the agency gives notice of the
full environmental analysis and decisionmaking process that will occur on the proposal so that interested and affected
people are aware of how they may participate and contribute to the final decision.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Because much of this project area is within view of a designated Scenic Byway and in the vicinity of the Mt. Nebo Wilderness
Area, the nature and scope of the decision to be made is affected.



Aerial surveys indicate more than 15,000 acres of timber stands were infested in the Nebo Management Area by the summer
of 1993. A biological evaluation of current stand conditions was conducted on 350 acres to assess the magnitude of
the problem and potential management options. The biological evaluation indicated that management actions should
be considered to reduce the volume of dead and dying trees in the more concentrated, infested timber stands in the area,
specifically Sheepherder Hill. In the spring of 1993, an emergency timber sale, the Payson Canyon Salvage Sale, was
approved for harvesting approximately 141 acres of highly visible dead and dying timber within the proposed project
area, but not within an inventoried roadless area. The emergency sale is adjacent to the Sheepherder Hill area. Since
the Payson Canyon Salvage Sale was initiated, many additional fir beetle infestations have been identified and concern
about forest health has increased throughout the area.

Scoping of public issues were initiated as part of the Payson Canyon Salvage Sale, which is applicable to this project.
The preliminary list of issues identified to be addressed by this project analysis include:




_Forest health

_Impacts on the roadless characteristics of the project area

_Cumulative impacts of alternatives to this action

_Visual impacts to the Scenic Byway

_Fuel build-up/fire and insect disease hazards

_Economic feasibility of implemented management actions

_Implications to wetlands, floodplains and riparian vegetation

_Possible impacts to threatened, endangered and/or sensitive species

_Land/slope stability

_Forest user safety

_Water quality

_Elk calving vs. the timing of management activities

A wide range of alternatives will be considered in managing the insect impacted timber stands. A preliminary list
of alternatives includes:




_No change to current management

_Harvest the dead and dying trees


_Burning of infested areas


_Stand treatment based on its visibility from the Scenic Byway


_A combination of any or all of the above


_Other considerations identified in the analysis process




There are no known permits or licenses required to implement any of the proposed alternatives.

The comment period on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency's notice of availability appears in the 

Federal Register

. It is very important that those interested in the proposed action participate at that time. To be most helpful, comments
on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement should be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy of the statement
or the merits of the alternatives discussed (see The Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing
the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3).


In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of Draft Environmental Impact Statements
must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts
an agency to the reviewers' position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v. 

NRDC , 

435 U.S. 519, 533 (1978). Environmental objectives that could have been raised at the draft stage may be waived if not
raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement.

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. 

v. 

Harris, 

490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). The reason for this is to ensure that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final.

It is estimated that the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) will be released for public review in August
1994. The Final EIS is scheduled to be released in November 1994. Implementation of the project could occur by late
fall of 1994 or the Spring of 1995.


After the 45 day comment period ends on the Draft EIS, the comments will be analyzed and considered by the Forest Service
in preparing the Final EIS. The Forest Service is required to respond to the comments received in the Final EIS. The
responsible official is the District Ranger. The responsible official will consider the comments, responses and
environmental consequences discussed in the EIS and applicable laws, regulations and policies in making a decision
regarding this proposal. The responsible official will document the decision and reasons for the decision in the
Record of Decision. That decision will be subject to review under 36 CFR part 215.

Forest Service, USDA.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; adoption of interim policy; request for public comment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service gives notice that it is issuing interim policy on the agency's role in regulating the placement
of bait on National Forest System lands. The intended effect is to clarify the agency's role in relation to the role
of the States and, thus, to provide a consistent approach to the regulation of baiting resident game. Public comment
is invited and will be considered in the adoption of a final policy, notice of which will be published in the 

Federal Register

.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

State fish and wildlife agencies have the primary responsibility for protection and management of wildlife populations
on National Forest System lands, including adoption of State fish and wildlife laws and regulations affecting the
taking of resident game animals. The Forest Service enters into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with each State
which governs Forest Service/State cooperation on matters of Statewide fish and wildlife policy or procedure affecting
the National Forest System. See FSM 2611.1. The States issue regulations regarding hunting licenses, methods, seasons,
locations, and bag limits for resident game and have the primary responsibility for enforcement of fish and wildlife
laws and regulations on National Forest System lands. Federal land management statutes acknowledge the States'
traditional role in managing fish and wildlife; 

see

 the National Forest System Organic Administration Act at 16 U.S.C. 480, the Multiple Use-Sustained Yield Act at 16
U.S.C. 528, the Sikes Act at 16 U.S.C. 670h, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, at 43 U.S.C. 1732. The Forest
Service therefore is generally reluctant to override State fish and wildlife regulation, except where federal interests,
such as protection of forest land, resources, and users require federal intervention.

The practice of placing bait (food or scent to attract wildlife) is a hunting activity allowed by some State laws and
regulations. The baiting of bears is particularly controversial. While the total number of States allowing bear
baiting has declined, State fish and wildlife agencies permit the baiting of black bear as a hunting activity in Alaska,
Idaho, Oregon, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The Forest
Service intends to work diligently through its ongoing cooperative efforts to encourage the States to evaluate their
regulation of the practice of baiting bears. In the meantime, the agency is issuing interim policy regarding the use
of bait on National Forest System lands. 

In the past, some national forests have regulated the placement of bear baits by requiring hunters and commercial
guides to obtain special use authorizations in order to prevent conflicts with other users or other problems associated
with the location and removal of bait. Additionally, some Forest Service Regions have issued orders under 36 CFR Part
261 to control litter, as well as to close certain areas to bear baiting where the practice would create unacceptable
adverse effects on other resources or forest users. In early 1992, the Forest Service's role in the regulation of bear
baiting on the national forests in Wyoming became an issue. Special use authorizations for bear baiting had been issued
on a number of national forests in that State. Typically, those special use authorizations included conditions with
which the holder had to comply to minimize adverse effects created by placement of bear bait.

In March 1992, the Regional Foresters for the Rocky Mountain and Intermountain Regions issued a joint closure order
prohibiting bear baiting in the national forests in Wyoming, unless the baiting activity was conducted in compliance
with the requirements of the order pertaining to the placement and disposal of baits. Like the conditions that previously
had been included in special use authorizations, the requirements of the order were intended too minimize adverse
effects on forest resources and users. 

The Fund for Animals and the Friends of the Bow brought suit to challenge the Forest Service's closure order and to challenge
what Plaintiffs considered a shift in established policy, that is, no longer requiring special use authorizations
for bear bait placement and using closure orders instead (

The Fund for Animals 

v. 

Robertson,

 (D.D.C. Civ. No. 92-1694-TPJ)). These groups perceived this shift in method as a diminution in the level
of Forest Service regulation and wildlife protection. The parties settled the case upon the Forest Service's decision
to rescind the closure order and, in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, to analyze the effects
of eliminating the practice of issuing special use authorizations for the placement of bear bait on National Forest
System lands in Wyoming. The Regions then prepared an Environmental Assessment to disclose effects on the proposed
action and alternatives to the proposal. 

Upon completion of the Environmental Assessment and issuance of a Decision Notice by the Rocky Mountain and Intermountain
Regional Foresters in April 1993, there were new challenges to the agency's position. Subsequently, the Deputy Chief
for the National Forest System decided that national direction was needed to end the conflict and controversy. Accordingly,
the Decision Notice was rescinded, and bear baiting in national forests in Wyoming was prohibited pending issuance
of national direction. However, because the spring hunting season will begin before a final policy can be adopted,
the agency has determined that in fairness to outfitters, guides, and individual hunters, an interim policy should
be issued to ensure consistency and uniformity of policy and practice by the Forest Service. State agency regulations
have been developed and published in Wyoming and other States governing the use of bait in spring hunts for 1994. These
new Wyoming regulations were developed in close coordination with the Forest Service to be in concert with federal
regulation and law on the national forests involved and to be protective of National Forest System resources. In addition,
hunters, outfitters, and guides in Wyoming have moved forward with the normal practice of planning and booking hunting
activity based on the expectation that the Forest Service would have a final policy in place for the spring hunting
season. It is unfair to continue the bear baiting prohibition in Wyoming when such a prohibition is not in effect on
other National Forest System lands in other States where the practice is permitted, because of the agency's delay
in adopting a final policy. Therefore, the agency has issued an interim directive to Forest Service Manual Chapter
2640, which is set out at the end of this notice. 

The Forest Service special use authorization regulations at 36 CFR 251.50 exempt noncommercial use and occupancy,
including ``hunting,'' from the special use authorization requirement. Since hunting methods subject to State
regulation are included within the term ``hunting,'' the interim directive makes explicit that where State regulations
permit baiting, the Forest Service will not require a special use authorization for the practice of baiting connected
with hunting on National Forest System lands. Outfitter and guide activities require a special use authorization.
Outfitters and guides must comply with applicable State laws and regulations, and Forest Service closure orders
as a condition of special use authorizations.

However, if the placement of bait should become a land or resource management issue and it is determined that the State
regulations governing baiting would not protect resources in an area adequately or would otherwise be inconsistent
with the applicable forest plan or conflict with federal laws such as the Endangered Species Act, then the authorized
officer will issue an order to close the area to baiting. The authorized officer also may close an area to baiting considering
the likely impact on a site-specific basis on water quality, public health and sanitation, or the potential threat
to the viability of wildlife. Finally, the policy would explicitly prohibit the issuance of a special use authorization
to individuals for the specific act of placing bait on National Forest System lands for hunting purposes.

The approach adopted in the interim policy maintains protection of national forest resources. First, under the terms
of the Memorandums of Understanding with the State fish and wildlife or game agencies, the Forest Service continuously
participates in the review and adoption of State game regulations as they affect National Forest System land or resources.
Second, the interim policy provides the Regional Forester or Forest Supervisor with the flexibility and discretion
to determine if baiting should be prohibited in a specific location. Finally, if a hunter, in placing bait to attract
resident game creates litter through improper placement or untimely removal of bait in violation of State regulations
or Forest Service closure orders, the agency has the authority under its regulations at 36 CFR 261.11 to cite the hunter
for violating the prohibition on litter. If such bait results in violation of State regulations, the agency has authority
to cite the hunter for violation of 36 CFR 261.8, and agency employees routinely do so where such violations occur.
In short, the agency's approach (1) relies on existing relationships with each State, (2) prevents duplicative regulation
by Federal and State agencies, and (3) provides site-specific environmental safeguards to address those situations
where baiting would have an adverse site-specific effect on National Forest System land or resources.

Pursuant to the rules at 36 CFR part 316, the text of the baiting policy as it has been issued in Interim Directive No.
2640-94-1 to the Forest Service Manual is set out at the end of this notice. Public comment is invited and
will be considered in adoption of a final policy.



Environmental Impact



Section 31.1b(2) of Forest Service Handbook 1909.15 (57 FR 43180, September 18, 1992) excludes from documentation
in an environmental assessment or impact statement ``rules, regulations, or policies to establish Servicewide
administrative procedures, program processes, or instructions.'' This interim directive would provide administrative
instructions to Forest Service field offices on the procedures and processes to follow in the case of baiting resident
game. Accordingly, the agency's preliminary assessment is that this policy falls within this category of actions
and that no extraordinary circumstances exist which would require preparation of an environmental assessment or
environmental impact statement. A final determination will be made upon adoption of the final policy.



Controlling Paperwork Burden on the Public



This policy will not result in additional paperwork. Therefore, the review provisions of the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507) and implementing regulations at 5 CFR Part 1320 do not apply.



Regulatory Impact



This interim policy has been reviewed under USDA procedures and Executive Order 12866 on Federal Regulations. It
has been determined that this is not a significant rule.

2643_Applicability of State Fish and Wildlife Laws and Regulations


The Forest Service actively cooperates in the development of State fish and wildlife laws and regulations and may
assist in the enforcement of State fish and wildlife laws on National Forest System lands. Pursuant to FSM 2610, Regional
Foresters shall ensure that memorandums with State fish and wildlife agencies recognize the role of the Forest Service
in cooperating in the development of State fish and wildlife laws and regulations, especially those addressing hunting,
fishing, and trapping as they would apply to occupancy and use of National Forest System lands.


2643.1_Hunting, Fishing, and Trapping Regulations 



Hunting, fishing, and trapping of fish and wildlife and associated practices are permitted on National Forest System
lands subjects to State fish and wildlife laws and regulations, unless one or both of the following apply:
1. State fish and wildlife laws and regulations conflict with federal laws; or
2. State laws and regulations would permit activities that conflict with the land and resource management responsibilities
of the Forest Service or that are inconsistent with forest plans.


2643.12_Trapping Furbearers




Use of Bait for Resident Game Hunting. 

The use of bait as a lure or attractant for the purpose of taking resident game on National Forest System lands is considered
a hunting practice subject to State regulation.
Where State hunting regulations prohibit the use of bait, the practice is prohibited on National Forest System lands.
Where States permit the use of bait for attracting resident game, this activity is allowed on National Forest System
lands, subject to State hunting laws and regulations, unless the authorized officer determines on a site-specific
basis that there is a need to prohibit or restrict the practice of baiting because one or more of the following circumstances
exist:
1. The State laws and regulations on placement of bait are inadequate to protect forest land or other resources or users
in a particular location and/or to prevent trespass or litter;
2. Baiting is inconsistent with the applicable forest plan; or
3. The State law and regulations conflict with Federal law, such as the Endangered Species Act.
In addition to the mandatory causes for prohibiting or restricting baiting, the authorized officer also may prohibit
baiting, regardless of the adequacy of State regulations, based on consideration of the likely impact of baiting
on such matters as water quality, public health and sanitation, the potential for litter, or the potential to threaten
the viability of wildlife.
Where the authorized officer determines that baiting is a significant problem and should be restricted or prohibited:
1. The officer shall notify State fish and wildlife officials and provide them the opportunity to resolve the issue
through further restrictions or the prohibition through State regulation rather than for the Forest Service to issue
the restriction or prohibition.
2. If the State does not revise its regulations to adequately regulate or restrict baiting, the Forest Service authorized
officer shall, time permitting, close the area or otherwise restrict baiting by issuing an order pursuant to 36 CFR
part 261.
Where time does not permit closure of an area to baiting because the hunting season is underway and it would be impracticable
to issue a closure order, the Regional Forester or Forest Supervisor shall take such mitigation and/or enforcement
measures as are appropriate and practicable to ensure consistency with forest plan management direction and compliance
with Federal laws, orders, and regulations, and protection of forest users and resources. For example, the agency
may close a road or gate, or cite violations of other State or Forest Service regulations.
Closure is not the only way to address the practice of baiting. It is expected that land managers as part of their day-to-day
management of National Forest System lands and resources will be cognizant of the effects of hunting activities and
take such proactive measures, after consultation with the responsible fish and wildlife agency, such as hunter education,
as may be necessary to ensure resource protection consistent with forest plan management direction.
This policy, in and of itself, does not compel an authorized officer to undertake a specific decision or to make a determination
of whether baiting is allowed in those States where the practice is permitted.
Special use authorization shall not be issued for placing bait on National Forest System lands for hunting purposes
(36 CFR 251.50(c)).
For the purposes of this section and to assure consistency in coordination of national forest wildlife matters with
State agencies, the authorized officer is the Regional Forester or Forest Supervisor responsible for executing
memorandums of understanding with the State wildlife agency.

In its final determination, the Department found that critical circumstances existed with respect to exports from
Brazil by Italmagnesio S.A. Industria e Comercio (Italmagnesio). However, on January 24, 1994, the ITC notified
the Department that retroactive assessment of antidumping duties was not necessary to prevent recurrence of material
injury from massive imports over a short period. As a result of the ITC's negative critical circumstances determination,
pursuant to section 735(b)(4) of the Act, we shall order Customs to terminate the retroactive suspension of liquidation
and to release any bond or other security and refund any cash deposit required under section 733(e)(2) with respect
to Italmagnesio's FeSi entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption prior to August 16, 1993. 

This notice constitutes the antidumping duty order with respect to FeSi from Brazil, pursuant to section 736(a) of
the Act. Interested parties may contact the Central Records Unit, Room B-099 of the Main Commerce Building,
for copies of an updated list of antidumping duty orders currently in effect.

Note: Temporary Restraining Order Regarding Ferrosilicon Imports from Companhia Brasileira Carbureto de Calcio

On February 23, 1994, the Court of International Trade (CIT) entered a temporary restraining order prohibiting the
Customs Service from collecting deposits of the estimated antidumping duty margin for CBCC at a rate higher than that
published in the original final determination. Thus, notwithstanding the language of the antidumping duty order
(above), the Department will not, until permitted to do so by the CIT, instruct Customs to collect cash deposits equal
to the amount of the antidumping duty margin calculated in the Department's amended final determination for imports
of ferrosilicon from CBCC. Until we are notified differently by the Court, we are instructing Customs to collect cash
deposits on imports of ferrosilicon from CBCC equal to 2.23 percent, the amount of the antidumping duty margin calculated
in the Department's final original determination.

Notice of preliminary results of antidumping finding administrative review.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In response to a request by Yamaji Fishing Net Co., Ltd. (the respondent), the Department of Commerce (the Department)
has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping finding on fishnetting of man-made fiber from Japan. This
review covers one company and the period June 1, 1992 through May 31, 1993. For these preliminary results, we applied
the best information available (BIA). The review indicates the existence of dumping margins during the period.



We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background



On June 6, 1972, the Department of Treasury published in the 

Federal Register

 (37 FR 11560) the antidumping finding on fishnetting of man-made fiber from Japan. On June 7, 1993, the Department
published a notice of opportunity to request review for the period June 1, 1992 through May 31, 1993 (58 FR 31941). The
respondent requested, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a) that we conduct an administrative review. We published
the notice of initiation on July 21, 1993 (58 FR 39007). The Department has now conducted that administrative review
in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act).



Scope of the Review



Imports covered by the review are shipments of fishnetting of man-made fibers, not including salmon gill netting,
from Japan. The merchandise is currently classified under item numbers 5608.11.00, 5608.19.10, and 5608.90.10
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and customs purposes.
The written product description remains dispositive.

This review covers entries of the subject merchandise by Yamaji Fishing Net Co., Ltd., during the period June 1, 1992
through May 31, 1993.



Analysis



Although Yamaji attempted to respond to all Department requests for information, the data submitted was unverifiable.
In particular, at verification in Japan we discovered that approximately 40 percent of total home market sales had
not been reported. Furthermore, because Yamaji did not prepare adequate source documentation, the Department was
unable to complete sales traces to its satisfaction. Finally, significant discrepancies and errors in Yamaji's
sales listings were identified, thereby making it impossible to verify several of Yamaji's claimed adjustments.
For further information on the deficiencies in the respondent's questionnaire response, see the verification report
filed on the record of this case.

Because we have no data upon which we can reliably base our analysis, the Department must use BIA for its preliminary
results of review.



Best Information Available



In accordance with section 776(c) of the Tariff Act, we rely upon BIA in cases where a party refuses or is unable to produce
information requested in a timely manner and in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes proceedings.
The Department generally uses a two-tiered approach in its choice of BIA. For uncooperative respondents or respondents
which substantially impede the proceedings (``first tier''), the Department uses the higher of (1) the highest rate
for any company from the original investigation or prior administrative review or (2) the highest rate found in the
current review for any company. For respondents which attempt to cooperate (``second tier''), the Department uses
the higher of (1) the highest rate ever applicable to the firm for the subject merchandise or (2) the highest calculated
rate in the current review for any firm (see Antifriction Bearings (Other than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts
Thereof from France, et al., 58 FR 39729, July 26, 1993).

As outlined above, the second-tier BIA rate should be applied, since Yamaji was essentially cooperative. Accordingly,
we will continue to apply Yamaji's previous rate of 18.30 percent, which is both the highest rate ever applicable to
the firm for the subject merchandise and the highest rate in the proceeding (see Fishnetting of Man-Made Fibers from
Japan; Final Results of Administrative Review of Antidumping Finding, 56 FR 49457, September 30, 1991).

Preliminary Results of the Review


As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine that a margin exists for the period June 1, 1992 through May 31,
1993, as follows:








Interested parties may request disclosure within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice and may request a
hearing within 10 days of publication. Any hearing, if requested, will be held 44 days after the date of publication
or the first business day thereafter. Case briefs and/or written comments from interested parties may be submitted
no later than 30 days after the date of publication. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttals to written comments, limited to
issues raised in those comments, may be filed not later than 37 days after the date of publication of this notice. The
Department will publish the final results of this administrative review, including the results of its analysis of
issues raised in any such written comments or at a hearing.
The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
The Department will issue appraisement instructions on each exporter directly to the Customs Service.
Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective, upon publication of the notice of final results
of this administrative review, for all shipments of the subject merchandise from Japan that are entered, or withdrawn
from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of review, as provided by section
751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed company will be that established in the final
results of this administrative review; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above,
the cash deposit rate will continue to be their company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if
the exporter is not a firm covered in this review or the original investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit
rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) if neither
the exporter nor the manufacturer is a firm covered in this or any previous review, and, because the proceeding is governed
by an antidumping finding, the cash deposit rate will be set equal to the ``new shipper'' rate established in the first
administrative review, as discussed below.
On May 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade, in 

Floral Trade Council 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-79, and 

Federal-Moqul Corporation and the Torrington Company 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed through
an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate
to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation (or that rate
as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping
duty orders. In proceedings governed by antidumping findings, unless we are able to ascertain the ``all others''
rate from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the Department has determined that it is appropriate to adopt the ``new
shipper'' rate established in the first final results of the administrative review published by the Department (or
that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) as the ``all others'' rate for the
purpose of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews.
Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping finding, and we are unable to ascertain the ``all others'' rate
from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of the review will be 1.94 percent,
the ``new shipper'' rate established in the first final results of the administrative review published by the Department
(47 FR 28978, July 2, 1982).
These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review.
This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file
a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during
this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.
This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22(c).

Allegations of Sales Below Cost of Production 



Petitioners allege that Forges de Thy-Marcinelle, a potential respondent in the Belgium investigation, is selling
the subject merchandise in the home market at prices below its COP. This allegation is based on a comparison of company-specific
home market prices with the COP. COP was based on the costs of a comparable U.S. producer adjusted for known differences
in the country of production. 

Based on the information presented, we have reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that the home market sales of
Forges de Thy-Marcinelle are being made at less than COP. See Memorandum to Marie E. Parker from C.M. Miller dated March
4, 1994, which is on file in the Import Administration Central Records Unit. Accordingly, pursuant to section 773(b)
of the Act and 19 CFR 353.51, we will initiate a COP investigation with respect to this company if it is named as a respondent
in the investigation. 

Petitioners also allege that specific potential respondents in the German investigation are selling the subject
merchandise in the home market at prices below their COP. These allegations are based on a comparison of company-specific
home market prices with the COP. COP was based on the costs of a comparable U.S. producer adjusted for known differences
in the country of production, and/or company-specific information, and on the company's financial statements,
when applicable.

Based on the information presented, we have reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that the home market sales of
the following German producers are being made at less than COP: Stahl-und Walzwerk Brandenburg GmbH, Saarstahl AG,
and Thyssen Stahl AG. See Memorandum to Marie E. Parker from C.M. Miller dated March 4, 1994, which is on file in the Import
Administration Central Records Unit. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 773(b) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.51, we will
initiate COP investigations with respect to each of these companies if they are named as a respondent in the investigation.




Alleged Dumping Margins 



The range of positive dumping margins of SWR from Belgium based on price-to-price and price-to-CV comparisons of
USP to FMV alleged by petitioners, corrected for minor errors, is 5.69% to 52.34%. 

The range of positive dumping margins of SWR from Germany based on price-to-price and price-to-CV comparisons of
USP to FMV alleged by petitioners, corrected for minor errors, is 2.77% to 72.09%. 



Initiation of Investigations 



We have examined the petitions for SWR from Belgium and Germany, as amended, and have found that the petitions meet
the requirements of section 732(b) of the Act. Therefore, we are initiating antidumping duty investigations to determine
whether imports of SWR from Belgium and Germany are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than
fair value. If these investigations proceed normally, we will make our preliminary determinations by July 25, 1994.




ITC Notification 



Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the International Trade Commission (ITC) of these actions and we have
done so. 



Preliminary Determinations by the ITC 



The ITC will determine by March 31, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of SWR from Belgium
and Germany are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. A negative ITC determination
in any of these investigations will result in its termination; otherwise, the investigations will proceed according
to statutory and regulatory time limits. 

This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b).

Initiation of Investigation


The Department has examined the petition on steel wire rod from Germany and found that it complies with the requirements
of section 702(b) of the Act. Therefore, in accordance with section 702 of the Act, we are initiating a countervailing
duty investigation to determine whether manufacturers, producers or exporters of steel wire rod receive countervailable
subsidies. The following programs are included in our investigation.



1. ``R&uuml;ckzahlungsverpflichten'' (RZVs)
2. Government Assumption of Debt
3. Debt Forgiveness by Private Banks
4. Worker Assistance under the European Coal and Steel Community's Article 56(2)(b).



We are not including the following program which was alleged to be benefiting producers of the subject merchandise
in Germany.


The Government of Saarland's Capital Contribution to DHS of DM 145.1 Million


Petitioners alleged that a DM 145.1 million payment by the Government of Saarland (GOS) constitutes a countervailable
equity infusion. Petitioners base this allegation on their claim that the shares which the GOS received in exchange
for this payment had a value of only DM 82.5 million, DM 62.5 million less than what the GOS paid.
The question of whether this transaction constitutes a countervailable equity infusion was addressed in Certain
Hot Rolled Lead and Bismuth Carbon Steel Products From Germany (58 FR 6233, January 27, 1993). The Department determined
that the funds were provided on terms consistent with commercial considerations because at the same time that the
GOS invested, two private investors also invested in DHS on the same terms. Petitioners have provided no new information
in this petition indicating that this determination was incorrect. Therefore, the Department does not intend to
re-investigate whether the investment was consistent with commercial considerations.


ITC Notification


Pursuant to section 702(d) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of this initiation.


Preliminary Determinations By the ITC


The ITC will determine by March 31, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that a United States industry is
being materially injured, or threatened with material injury, by reason of steel wire rod imports from Germany. If
the ITC makes a negative determination, we will terminate this proceeding; otherwise, the investigation will proceed
according to statutory and regulatory time limits.
This notice is published pursuant to 702(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 355.13(b).

8. Restricted Information Exchanges 



In the case of engine bearings, any exchange or discussion of, as well as any meeting pursuant to paragraph 6 to exchange
or discuss, the types of information set forth in paragraph 4 (not including subparagraphs (f) and (g) thereof) shall
be subject to the following restrictions: 

a. Participation in any price discussion is limited to those instances in which the prices are discussed and determined
solely in the following manner: a Neutral Third Party, hereinafter defined, acting independently, will obtain price
information concerning engine bearings from the Members which intend to participate in a joint bid and will incorporate
that price information into the joint bid or other sales agreement. For purposes of this provision, ``acting independently''
means that the Neutral Third Party who obtains from and negotiates price information on behalf of the Members will
not disclose the price information of one Member to any other Member intending to participate in a joint undertaking
with regard to engine bearings.

b. The limitation set forth in (a) above shall also apply to instances where more than one Member intends to participate,
but the participation of a Member is solely as an Export Intermediary for the Export Trade Activity or Method of Operation.


c. Neither ASIA nor any Member participating in the Export Trade Activity or Method of Operation shall disclose the
engine bearing price information of one Member to any other Member that produces engine bearings.

<DOCTITLE>Information Relating to Bowhead Whales; U.S. Implementation of Bowhead Whale Strike Quota for 1994 </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), NOAA, Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of information and request for public comment.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Information is published by NOAA for use in the development of the U.S. position before the International Whaling
Commission (IWC) on the aboriginal/subsistence take of bowhead whales and in the domestic allocation of the existing
IWC quota for bowhead whales to U.S. natives. NOAA is soliciting public comment on the proposed allocation of the IWC
bowhead whale catch limit in 1994.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 NOAA is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 1361-1407),
the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C 1531-1543) and the Whaling Convention Act 16 U.S.C. 916-916l). In
addition, it provides staff support to the U.S. Commissioner to the IWC and to the IWC Interagency Committee. Consistent
with these responsibilities, NOAA develops positions for implementation of the aboriginal/subsistence harvest
of bowhead whales under Paragraph 13 of the Schedule to the International Convention on the Regulation of Whaling,
December 2, 1946, 62 Stat. 1716, T.I.A.S. No. 1849 (entered into force, November 10, 1948). 




In order to provide for review and comment by the public of the data upon which the U.S. positions are based, the following
information is provided: (1) The IWC catch level available for the U.S. aboriginal/subsistence bowhead whale harvest
for 1992-1994; (2) a summary of available bowhead scientific information, including estimates of current
population level and annual recruitment rates; (3) a summary of information on the nature and extent of aboriginal/subsistence
need; (4) the level of aboriginal/subsistence harvest limits which could be implemented domestically; and (5) notice
of the availability of those documents reviewed by NOAA and relied on by the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere
in making his finding on the range of harvest limits. NOAA is soliciting public comment on the proposed domestic implementation
of the IWC bowhead whale catch limit for 1994. 




1. Catch Level 



At the 43rd Annual Meeting of the IWC, Reykjavik, Iceland, May 27-31, 1991, the following catch limit was established
for aboriginal/subsistence whaling:





``The taking of bowhead whales from the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas stock by aborigines is permitted, but only
when the meat and products of such whales are to be used exclusively for local consumption by the aborigines and further
provided that: For each of the years 1992, 1993, and 1994 combined, the total number of whales struck shall not exceed
141, except that: (A) Any unused strikes up to ten percent of the total strikes allowed in the years 1989, 1990, and 1991
combined shall be carried forward from those years and added to the combined total of strikes for the years 1992, 1993,
and 1994; and (B) in any one year no more than 54 whales shall be struck and no more than 41 shall be landed. (Schedule to
the Convention, Paragraph 13(b)(1)(i).) 




2. Scientific Information 




At the 1991 IWC meeting, the Scientific Committee agreed that the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Sea population of bowhead
whales is between 6,400 and 9,200 animals, with a most likely estimate of 7,500 whales. A minimum estimate of the replacement
yield (RY) was calculated to be 92 whales per year, and the most likely replacement yield for the population size of
7,500 is 254 whales per year. The replacement yield defines the number of new whales annually joining the adult population,
and it is assumed that, all other things being constant, up to this number could be taken from the population without
causing it to decline. 




3. Aboriginal/Subsistence Need 





The Department of the Interior (DOI) conducted its analysis of the nature and extent of aboriginal/subsistence need
for bowhead whales and whaling in 1983, and the IWC adopted this method for quantifying need in 1986. DOI contracted
for a new study on the quantification of subsistence and cultural need for bowhead whales in 1987, which was presented
at the 1988 meeting. The new study presented the cultural and subsistence need of nine Alaska Eskimo whaling villages
to take 41 landed bowhead whales. This quantification of need used the same method of calculation accepted by the IWC
in 1986. This method derives the mean annual number of bowhead whales landed per capita during a specified historical
period and multiplies this mean by the current Eskimo population of nine Alaska Eskimo whaling villages. The result
of this calculation is the total number of bowhead whales these Eskimo whaling villages need to land each year in order
to meet their cultural and subsistence need.

<PARENT> FR940314-2-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

When the IWC adopted this method of quantifying need, members of the IWC Aboriginal Subsistence Subcommittee noted
that the quantification was based on a large but incomplete series of data on historical bowhead landings. It was also
noted that the quantification used an inconsistent data base period. The DOI study was initiated to correct these
deficiencies. To complete the series of data on historical bowhead whale landings to the extent possible, the study
undertook a comprehensive review of available published and unpublished sources of bowhead landings. Remaining
gaps are unlikely to be significantly reduced with further searches for historic data on bowhead landings. The data
resulting from this study also permitted the use of a consistent historical base period for the calculation of need.
In the prior analysis, the base periods varied from 1940 to 1970 and 1950 to 1970. The base period now begins in 1910,
the year following the cessation of commercial whaling in the Arctic, and ends in 1969, prior to the period of unusually
high bowhead harvests in the unique economic circumstances of the 1970s. Therefore, applying the additional landed
bowhead data and the longer period to the accepted method of quantifying need, results in a current cultural and subsistence
need of 41 landed whales. 



4. Domestic Harvest Range 



The IWC management scheme for aboriginal/subsistence whaling provides (in Schedule paragraph 13(a)(2)): ``For
stocks below the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) level but above a certain minimum level, aboriginal/subsistence
catches shall be permitted so long as they are set at levels which allow whale stocks to move to the MSY level.'' Given
the above-stated estimates of replacement yields of 92 (lower bound) to 254 whales for the point estimate recruited
into the population annually, an aboriginal/subsistence catch can be permitted in 1994. 

The catch limit for bowhead whales for the years 1992-1994, established by the IWC, is 141 strikes plus 13 strikes
carried over from the previous block quota with no more than 54 whales struck and no more than 41 landed in any one year.
Of the 154 total strikes for 1992-1994, 50 bowhead whales were struck and 38 were landed in 1992, and 52 were struck
and 41 landed in 1993. Therefore, the number under consideration for allocation to the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission
for the 1994 catch limit is 52 strikes or 41 landed whales. 



5. Documents Reviewed 



A list of the documents reviewed for this action may be obtained on request (see 

ADDRESSES

). The documents are available for public inspection during the 30-day public comment period at the same address.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On March 4, 1994, the Department of Defense published a notice announcing the meeting of the Advisory Board on the Investigative
Capabilities of the Department of Defense (59 FR 10378). This notice is published to announce a change in the status
of the meeting. All sessions on March 17, 1994 will be open. Portions of the meeting on March 18, 1994 will be closed.
This determination is based upon the consideration that it is expected that the discussions will involve classified
matters of national security. Such classified material is so intertwined with the unclassified material that it
cannot reasonably be segregated into separate discussions without defeating the effectiveness and meaning of the
closed portion of the meeting. To permit all of this Advisory Board meeting to be open to the public would prevent discussion
of such matters and would greatly diminish the Board's findings or recommendations to the Secretary of Defense.

Intent to Prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) in Conjunction With Proposed Maintenance Dredging
of the Indiana Harbor and Canal, and the Construction of a Confined Disposal Facility (CDF) at East Chicago, in Lake
County, IN




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Chicago District, DOD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The proposed project involves maintenance dredging of the Federal navigation channel in Indiana Harbor and Canal,
and construction and operation of a confined disposal facility (CDF) for containment of contaminated sediments
dredged from the harbor and canal. Approximately 4.7 million cubic yards of sediment could be dredged and confined
during a 30-year maintenance period (1998 to 2027). Alternatives include (but are not limited to) dredging/disposal,
no action, and innovative treatment technologies; alternative CDF locations include the ECI, J-Pit, and Inland
Steel sites. Major features of the recommended plan include dredging the authorized Federal navigation channel
and certain berthing areas/dockfaces adjacent to the channel, and construction of a CDF. The proposed CDF would be
constructed at the site of the former Energy Cooperative, Inc. (ECI). The ECI site is located along the north bank of
the Lake George Branch of the Indiana Harbor Canal, immediately west of Indianapolis Boulevard.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 






1. The project would provide both commercial navigation and environmental benefits. The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency is a cooperating agency.





2. Coordination regarding the assessment of impacts of the project is being undertaken with the concerned agencies,
including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, and local
communities.





3. Issues to be addressed in the DEIS will include impacts of dredging, impacts of CDF construction and operation,
feasibility of innovative treatment technologies, protection of Lake Michigan water quality and fisheries, protection
of groundwater, impacts on local communities and industry, and future use of the facility.





4. The scoping process has been undertaken as part of a program on-going public participation and interagency coordination
begun in the late 1970s. A public meeting to discuss a previous draft EIS on Indiana Harbor and Canal was held in East
Chicago on 18 March 1986. Interagency scoping meetings were held on 19 May 1986, 22 April 1987, and 25 October and 12
December 1988.





5. A public meeting will be held during the 90-day public review and comment period for the DEIS.





6. The DEIS is expected to be available to the public in late March or early April 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Floodplain Involvement for the Proposed East Fork Poplar Creek Flow Management Project at the Oak Ridge
Reservation, Oak Ridge, TN</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Energy (DOE).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of floodplain involvement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 DOE proposes to install an energy dissipation chamber and a raw water line in the Y-12 Plant within the East Fork
Poplar Creek (EFPC) floodplain which is located in Anderson County, in the city of Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In accordance
with 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), part 1022, DOE will prepare a Floodplain Assessment and perform this proposed
action in a manner so as to avoid or minimize potential harm to or within the affected floodplain.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
DOE proposes to install a concrete box with 2 weirs (obstructions placed in a stream, diverting water for measuring
the rate of flow) and a raw water line to manage the flow of the EFPC. The action would take place at the headwaters of the
creek, which are located within the boundaries of the Y-12 Plant. The open box would be approximately 12 by 14
feet and emplaced at the edge of the creek bank to allow for proper diffusion and mixing of the added water with creek
headwaters. Additional water would be provided by extending the existing raw water line from the Clinch River. As
part of the proposed action, a Best Management Practices Plan will be prepared to identify the necessary steps to minimize
potential impacts to the creek. 



The addition of Clinch River water to the creek is required by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation
in order to guarantee a minimum base flow as the limitations established in the Y-12 Plant National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System permit are based on management of the flow in the EFPC. Additional water will not be added
when the flow in the creek is above this established minimum flow, such as during storm events. 
In accordance with DOE regulations, ``Compliance with Floodplains/Wetlands Environmental Review Requirements,''
10 CFR part 1022, DOE will prepare a Floodplain Assessment for this proposed DOE action. After DOE issues the assessment,
a Floodplain Statement of Findings will be published in the 

Federal Register

.

<DOCTITLE>Morgantown Energy Technology Center Financial Assistance Award (Potential Sources Sought)</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Energy (DOE), Morgantown Energy Technology Center.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Expressions of interest.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy is seeking expressions of interest for the Office of Environmental Management Technology
Leveraging Initiative. The Office of Environmental Management was established in November 1989 and was tasked with
cleaning up the legacy of environmental pollution at DOE weapons complex facilities, preventing further environmental
contamination, and instituting responsible environmental management. The magnitude and complexity of many aspects
of this mission are such that it cannot be achieved using existing technology without incurring high costs. The technology
leveraging initiative is to transfer into practice technologies developed by DOE in its national laboratories or
in other agreements. It will also be beneficial to the nation if the new or improved technologies developed to clean
up the DOE weapons complex facilities can be used by other government agencies and for other industrial cleanup applications.
Considering that DOE and the world market needs for environmental cleanup are immense, there is a large potential
market for technology transfer. Consequently, cost sharing will be a key consideration. It is anticipated that this
activity will be partially DOE funded at initiation, and will mature to self sufficiency with little or no Government
funding.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

It is envisioned that the work scope will address methods for environmental technology integration and transfer,
which means facilitating the licensing of DOE funded technologies, guiding the startup of new venture companies
with DOE developed technologies, identifying markets and assessing the commercial potential of the DOE developed
technologies, and promoting coordination between DOE and U.S.-based industry to address environmental cleanup
technology development issues of mutual interest. The developed technologies are in the following focus areas:
(1) Contaminant Plume Containment and Remediation, (2) Mixed Waste Characterization, Treatment, and Disposal,
(3) High-Level Waste Tank Remediation, (4) Landfill Stabilization, and (5) Facility Transitioning, Decommissioning,
and Final Disposition.




Interested parties should provide: statements of experience and capabilities in both the technical and business
aspects specifically associated with the focus areas and work scope; your perception of the discussed activity;
a name and telephone number for a point of contact; and be limited to 5 pages. Statements should be submitted to the attention
of D. Denise Riggi, U.S. Department of Energy, Morgantown Energy Technology Center, P.O. Box 880, Morgantown, WV
26507-0880. Closing date for the submission of statements of interest is fifteen (15) days from the publication
date of this notice.

This notice is for information and planning purposes, does not constitute a request for proposal and is not to be construed
as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or enter into an award.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Public Meeting to Discuss the Environmental Assessment for Proposed Interim Storage of Highly Enriched
Uranium Above the Maximum Historic Level at the Y-12 Plant, Oak Ridge, TN</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Energy (DOE).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of public meeting.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

DOE has scheduled a public meeting in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on Thursday, March 24, 1994, to provide a public briefing,
receive comments, and answer questions from the State of Tennessee and stakeholders on the predecisional draft Environmental
Assessment (EA) for the Proposed Interim Storage of Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) above the maximum historic levels
at the Y-12 Plant, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The Y-12 Plant, which is part of the DOE-owned Oak Ridge Reservation,
located 20 miles west of Knoxville, Tennessee, has had a mission to store HEU since the World War II era. Since 1964,
HEU used in the production of nuclear weapons was recycled from HEU stockpiled at the Y-12 Plant. Because the
United States has now ceased production of nuclear weapons, DOE must hold its excess HEU in storage until a decision
on long-term disposition is made by an interagency task force recently formed by President Clinton. The Department
of Energy will also discuss its overall nuclear materials storage and disposition planning activities.


The purpose of this meeting is to provide the State of Tennessee and other stakeholders an opportunity to discuss the
EA and the Department's long-term plans for disposition of special nuclear materials. All interested and affected
individuals are invited to participate in the public meeting which will be held at the Pollard Auditorium, Oak Ridge
Associated Universities, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Thursday, March 24, 1994. During the morning
and afternoon sessions (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) the Department proposes to discuss the EA and its nuclear materials disposition
activities. During the evening session (6 p.m. to 9 p.m.) the morning and afternoon sessions will be summarized and
the public will have further opportunity to ask questions and discuss the EA. Department of Energy officials from
Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Headquarters in Washington, DC, will be present at each of the sessions to answer questions.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under the Department of Energy National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Procedures (10 Code of Federal Regulations
1021.301), the Department is required to provide EAs to the host State for review prior to issuing its decision. A copy
of this predecisional EA was provided to the State of Tennessee on March 2, 1994.


Notices were placed in local newspapers inviting the general public to review and provide comments to DOE on the EA.
Copies of the EA were placed in the following DOE Reading Rooms:



U.S. Department of Energy, Public Reading Room, Federal Office Building, 200 Administration Road, Oak Ridge, Tennessee
37831.
The DOE Freedom of Information Room, Room 1E-190, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington,

Wisconsin Electric Power Co.; Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment



March 8, 1994.



In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a new license for the existing Pine Hydroelectric Project, located on the Pine River in Florence
County, Wisconsin, and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for the project. In the DEA, the Commission's
staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts of the project and has concluded that
approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protective or enhancement measures, would not constitute
a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of the human environment.

Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, NW., Washington, DC 20426.

Any comments should be filed within 45 days from the date of this notice and should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary,
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. For further information,
contact Tom Camp at (202) 219-2832.

Ozone Design Value Study of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of draft report on the Clean Air Act Ozone Design Value Study for public review and comment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Section 183(g) of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 requires the Administrator to conduct a study of whether
the methodology in use by the EPA, as of the date of enactment, for establishing a design value for ozone, provides a
reasonable indicator of the ozone air quality of ozone nonattainment areas. The EPA is directed to obtain public review
of the study report prior to submitting the report to Congress.





The focus of the Ozone Design Value Study is EPA's ozone design value methodology. A design value may be viewed intuitively
as a concentration value used to quantify the degree to which the level of an air quality standard has been exceeded.
With the wording of the ozone standard, the appropriate design value is the concentration with expected number of
exceedances equal to 1. These ozone design values were used to classify areas as marginal, moderate, serious, severe,
or extreme in accordance with the provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.

This notice announces the availability of a draft report of the Clean Air Act Ozone Design Value Study for public review
and comment.

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This is a notice of the Presidential declaration of a major disaster for the State of Alabama (FEMA-1013-DR),
dated March 3, 1994, and related determinations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Notice is hereby given that, in a letter dated March 3, 1994, the President declared a major disaster under the authority
of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 

et seq.

), as follows:



I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of Alabama, resulting from severe winter storms, freezing,
and flooding on January 16-February 14, 1994, is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant a major disaster
declaration under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford Act''). I,
therefore, declare that such a major disaster exists in the State of Alabama.
In order to provide Federal assistance, you are hereby authorized to allocate from funds available for these purposes,
such amounts as you find necessary for Federal disaster assistance and administrative expenses.
You are authorized to provide Public Assistance in the designated areas. Consistent with the requirement that Federal
assistance be supplemental, any Federal funds provided under the Stafford Act for Public Assistance will be limited
to 75 percent of the total eligible costs.





The time period prescribed for the implementation of section 310(a), Priority to Certain Applications for Public
Facility and Public Housing Assistance, 42 U.S.C. 5153, shall be for a period not to exceed six months after the date
of this declaration.

Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the authority vested in the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
under Executive Order 12148, I hereby appoint J. Rolando Sarabia of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to act
as the Federal Coordinating Officer for this declared disaster.

I do hereby determine the following areas of the State of Alabama to have been affected adversely by this declared major
disaster: Colbert, Cullman, Dekalb, Franklin, Lauderdale, Lawrence, Limestone, Marshall and Winston Counties
for Public Assistance.

<DOCTITLE>Shawmut National Corporation, Hartford, Connecticut, and Boston, Massachusetts; Petition for Reconsideration
of the Board's decision</DOCTITLE>


Shawmut National Corporation, Hartford, Connecticut, and Boston, Massachusetts (Shawmut), has filed a Petition
for Reconsideration of the Board's decision dated November 15, 1993, not to approve its application to acquire New
Dartmouth Bank, Manchester, New Hampshire. The Board's Rules of Procedure provide that a request for reconsideration
of a Board decision must present relevant facts that for good cause shown were not previously presented to the Board.
Shawmut represents in its request that relevant facts not previously considered by the Board are now available. In
particular, Shawmut refers to its settlement with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission of charges
of illegal discrimination by Shawmut Mortgage Company; its improved lending record as reflected by 1993 data filed
under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA); the results of its efforts to ensure that HMDA data are accurate; managerial
and organizational changes designed to strengthen compliance; and the results of steps initiated to improve its
lending to minority and low- and moderate-income communities. In light of these facts, Shawmut maintains that the
Board should grant the petition and approve the proposed acquisition. Notice of the filing of the petition is published
in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the petition. The Board expects to act on
the petition no later than May 2, 1994.
Comments may be mailed to William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington,
DC 20551. Comments addressed to Mr. Wiles may also be delivered to the Board's mail room between 8:45 a.m. and 5:15 p.m.,
and to the security control room outside of those hours. Both the mail room and control room are accessible from the
courtyard entrance on 20th Street between Constitution Avenue and C Street, NW. Comments must be received not later
than March 31, 1994.
The Petition for Reconsideration may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank
of Boston.

Revision of the Food Chemicals Codex Policy on Arsenic Specifications; Opportunity for Public Comment


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing an opportunity for public comment on the revised Food Chemicals
Codex policy on arsenic specifications. This new policy was recently approved by the National Academy of Sciences/Institute
of Medicine (NAS/IOM) Committee on Food Chemicals Codex (the committee). This revised policy is intended to be implemented
in the fourth edition of the Food Chemicals Codex, scheduled for release in early 1996.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 FDA provides research contracts to NAS/IOM to support the preparation of the Food Chemicals Codex, a compendium of
specifications for substances used as food ingredients. In the 

Federal Register

 of July 15, 1993 (58 FR 38129), FDA announced an opportunity for public comment on the committee's revised policy on
lead and heavy metals.


FDA now gives notice that the committee is soliciting comments and information on a revised policy on arsenic specifications
and its proposed implementation. The revised policy is intended for implementation in the fourth edition of the Food
Chemicals Codex, which is scheduled for release in early 1996. FDA emphasizes, however, that it will not consider
adopting new Food Chemicals Codex monographs and monograph revisions until the public has had ample opportunity
to comment on them. The opportunity for public comment on new and revised monographs will be announced in a notice published
in the 

Federal Register

.
The committee regards the safety of properly used food chemicals as one of its goals. This means that Food Chemicals
Codex specifications will respond to advances in new manufacturing methods, analytical techniques, toxicology,
and safety issues. At the same time, where possible, the committee will reduce unnecessary burdens on manufacturers
and users of food ingredients. Currently, most monographs for Food Chemicals Codex substances include an arsenic
limit that requires testing to ensure compliance. The committee believes that arsenic is no longer a contemporary
concern in many Food Chemicals Codex substances for the following reasons: (1) The use of arsenic-containing materials
in agriculture and manufacturing has declined sharply and registrations for many arsenic-containing pesticides
have been revoked; (2) the heavy metals limit for many Food Chemicals Codex substances has been significantly reduced.
Because arsenic is one of the nine elements detected as a heavy metal, the test indirectly provides a safety net in those
rare cases where arsenic is present; and (3) arsenic has not been associated with or detected in most Food Chemicals
Codex substances with a long history of use. Therefore, the committee believes that the inclusion of arsenic limits
in Food Chemicals Codex monographs should not be routine, but that inclusion of such limits should be considered on
an ``as needed'' basis. The committee has adopted the following general policy: 


The general policy for arsenic specifications in Food Chemicals Codex monographs is that an arsenic specification
be included in the requirements only when there is specific reason to believe that arsenic constitutes a significant
portion of the heavy metals limit.



To implement this policy in the fourth edition, the committee proposes deleting the arsenic specification from all
current monographs, except for the following substances where the arsenic specification will be retained. 
1. The top 25 high-volume usage ingredients, based on the 1987 NAS/NRC Food Additives Survey: 


Calcium carbonate
Calcium oxide
Caramel color
Citric acid
Coconut oil
Corn oil
Corn syrup
Corn syrup solids (glucose syrup, dried)
Cottonseed oil
Cottonseed oil, partially hydrogenated
Dextrose
Diatomaceous earth
D-sorbitol
Food starch, modified
High fructose corn syrup
Lactose 
Mono- and diglycerides
Sodium bicarbonate
Sodium chloride
Sodium hydroxide
Soybean oil
Soybean oil, hydrogenated
Sucrose
Sucrose, liquid
Whey


2. Ingredients that are obtained from natural sources, such as gums and mineral phosphates, including:

3. Ingredients where information and/or data exist to support the inclusion of an arsenic specification.
The committee requests data and information from all interested parties suggesting other Food Chemicals Codex monographs
that, for safety reasons, should retain the arsenic specification.
Two copies of written comments and information regarding this notice are to be submitted to NAS (address above). Comments
may also be submitted electronically to the Food Chemicals Codex bulletin board, 202-334-1738, or transmitted
by facsimile, 202-334-2316. Each submission should include the statement that it is in response to this


Federal Register

 notice. NAS will forward a copy of each comment, submitted either electronically or in writing, to the Dockets Management
Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, to
be placed under Docket No. 94N-0007 for public review.

<DOCTITLE> Soya Oligo Japan, Inc.; Filing of Petition for Affirmation of GRAS Status</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that Soya Oligo Japan, Inc., has filed a petition (GRASP 1G0369)
proposing to affirm that soybean oligosaccharide syrup is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) when used as an ingredient
in foods. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 348(b)(5))) and the regulations for affirmation
of GRAS status in  170.35 (21 CFR 170.35), notice is given that Soya Oligo Japan, Inc., c/o 1001 G St. NW., suite
500, Washington, DC 20001, has filed a petition (GRASP 1G0369) proposing that soybean oligosaccharide syrup be affirmed
as GRAS when used as an ingredient in foods.


 The petition has been placed on display at the Dockets Management Branch (address above).
 Any petition that meets the requirements outlined in   170.30 (21 CFR 170.30) and 170.35 is filed by the
agency. There is no prefiling review of the adequacy of data to support a GRAS conclusion. Thus, the filing of a petition
for GRAS affirmation should not be interpreted as a preliminary indication of suitability for GRAS affirmation.
 The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. If the agency finds that an environmental impact
statement is not required and this petition results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding
of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the 

Federal Register

 in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c).
Interested persons may, on or before May 30, 1994, review the petition and/or file comments with the Dockets Management
Branch (address above). Two copies of any comment should be filed and should be identified with the docket number found
in brackets in the heading of this document. Comments should include any available information that would be helpful
in determining whether soybean oligosaccharide syrup is, or is not, GRAS for the proposed use and whether it should
be listed for use as an ingredient in foods. In addition, consistent with the regulations promulgated under the National
Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency encourages public participation by review of and comment
on the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice. A copy of the petition
(including the environmental assessment) and received comments may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between
9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

A. General Primary Care Services Delivery 



Grant Amounts



It is estimated that approximately $521 million in discretionary continuation grants for CHC activities (i.e.,
approximately $478 million for general primary care services delivery and $43 million for CPCP and SIMRI activities)
and approximately $59 million in discretionary grants for continuation of MHC activities (i.e., approximately
$57 million for general primary care services delivery and $2 million for CPCP and SIMRI activities) will be available
under sections 330 and 329 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 254c and 254b, respectively). Of the total
$45 million available for CPCP and SIMRI activities, approximately $10 million will be for SIMRI. 
In addition, approximately $16 million will be available for existing C/MHCs to support the increased cost of providing
services to their current patients. Within the $16 million, approximately $10 million will be available for current
service adjustments, including support for the recruitment and retention of health care providers in C/MHCs, service
education linkages with academic institutions, school-based or school-linked programs, and activities to address
high prevalence morbidity and mortality (e.g., HIV/AIDS). Current service adjustments, where applicable, enable
C/MHCs to show the need for additional funds to maintain the existing range of services for the current number of patients
when existing levels of service cannot be supported with the total Federal and non-Federal revenue. The remaining
$6 million will be used for C/MHC improvement proposals to enhance the provision of required services. Such improvement
proposals should be presented in priority order. The improvement proposals for which funding may be made available
include the following required services: dental, pharmacy, culturally sensitive/ translation services, and case
management. 



Number of Awards



A total of approximately 600 C/MHC grants will be made available, of which approximately 223 ($216 million) will be
for competing continuation grants and approximately 377 ($364 million) will be for non-competing continuation
grants. Approximately 300 of these grants will include CPCP and SIMRI activities. Grants will range from approximately
$200,000 to approximately $2 million for general primary care services delivery (C/MHC). Grants will range from
approximately $24,000 to approximately $450,000 for CPCP and SIMRI activities in C/MHCs. Awards will be made for
a one year budget period. SIMRI grantees will continue to have budget periods beginning September 30 for FY 1994. Project
periods will be for up to three years. Requests for current service adjustments and improvement proposals will be
included in the continuation grant application.

Eligible Applicants


It is the intent of HRSA to continue to support health services in the service areas of currently funded C/MHCs, given
the unmet need inherent in their designation as medically underserved. Within their project periods, only present
grantees may apply for sections 329 and 330 awards to continue to provide health services in medically underserved
areas. However, any nonprofit private and public entities may apply to serve the geographic areas where project periods
are expiring. For a list of service areas with expiring project periods, see 

Federal Register

 notice published on May 3, 1993, 58 FR 26328 

et seq.


Review Criteria


When determining whether Federal support will be made available for continuing awards, the Department will review
C/MHCs for compliance with standard criteria stipulated in the program regulations (42 CFR part 51c for CHC and part
56 for MHC activities) and for how effectively they have used previously awarded sections 330 and 329 funds. This year's
reviews will continue to emphasize need and community impact, health services, management and finance, and governance.
Specifically, applications will be evaluated based on: (1) The demonstrated need for services based on geographic,
demographic, and economic factors, resources in the area, and health status; (2) the capacity to provide primary
health services as appropriate to meet the needs of the community, as evidenced by such attributes as an adequate medical
provider staff (e.g., number, specialty mix, and qualifications), critical linkages to other relevant entities
(e.g., State or local health departments, State Medicaid agencies, health professions training programs), and
coordination with other levels of care; (3) appropriate leadership, management structures and financial systems
to enable delivery of health services efficiently and effectively; (4) appropriateness of governing board composition,
committee structure, and performance to enable the board to function fully and effectively in its fiduciary role;
and (5) how the applicant integrates services supported by this grant with health services provided under other federally
assisted programs.


B. Capital Improvements


Approximately $4.5 million will be available to support new major and minor capital improvements. Major capital
requests are requests for Federal grant support in excess of $100,000 and will fall into one of two categories: (1)
Proposals to correct major fire and life safety code violations; and (2) proposals to expand facilities to eliminate
overcrowding associated with an increased demand for services. Major capital improvements include: facility acquisition,
construction, alteration, renovation, expansion and modernization.
Minor capital improvements are requests for Federal grant support of less than $100,000. Minor capital proposals
submitted in continuation applications for FY 1994 should address the same categories of projects as those to be considered
for major capital projects, i.e., to correct fire and life safety code violations and to relieve overcrowding.
Emphasis will be given to capital proposals that correct existing fire and life safety code violations, particularly
violations that disrupt the delivery of primary care services and may pose a danger to health center patients and staff.
Fire and life safety code violations include those that are cited or clearly documented.


Review Criteria


Applications for major capital will be reviewed against the following criteria: (1) Documented community need for
continued service delivery; (2) extent of the facility need; (3) appropriateness of site selection; (4) availability
of other sources of proposed financing; and (5) soundness of the proposal. Awards will be issued by September 30, 1994,
except for minor capital improvements which may be made sooner, depending on the nature of the building deficiency.

C. Comprehensive Perinatal Care Program and Special Infant Mortality Reduction Initiative


Eligible Applicants


All CPCP and SIMRI awards are expected to be made as continuation awards to current recipients of CPCP and SIMRI funding
which are performing satisfactorily.


Review Criteria


The review criteria for CPCP continuations, including SIMRI, are: (1) The extent to which the current and proposed
basic center operations are sound; (2) the extent to which infants born to the center's perinatal users are at high
risk for mortality and/or morbidity; (3) the extent to which the previous CPCP funding has been used to enhance the
basic perinatal services of the center, such as by provision of case management (risk assessment, coordination and
referral, follow-up and tracking, crisis intervention and documentation), outreach to targeted special populations
(e.g., homeless, HIV-infected, substance abusing, teenaged populations), patient education and counseling,
and home visiting; (4) the capability of the center to improve perinatal health as demonstrated through various process
and outcome measures of progress, such as increased perinatal caseload, increased first trimester enrollment,
reduced late or absent entry into care, increased post partum return rate, reduced incidence of low birth weight,
and increased newborn visits (an increase in perinatal caseload may also be a process indicator of progress in reaching
out to women to get them into care early); (5) the extent to which the plan is reasonable in that it: (a) addresses the
specific perinatal care needs of the community, focusing on women and infants at high risk of poor health status; (b)
further develops an appropriate system of care which includes collaboration with other resources; (c) contains
specific time-framed, measurable objectives, responsive to the CPCP and SIMRI expectations and the clinical measures;
and (d) contains an associated budget which is appropriate for the proposal in that it is in accordance with Federal
cost principles and corresponds to the proposed activities.
Additional review criteria for SIMRI applicants include: (1) For those SIMRI grantees in Healthy Start target areas,
the extent and effectiveness of collaborative efforts with the Healthy Start consortium; (2) the extent of collaborative
efforts with other Federal, State and local programs to develop integrated systems of perinatal care that address
the needs of the community; and (3) the extent to which the grantee's plan and progress demonstrate that SIMRI funds
are being used to effectively address gaps in perinatal services throughout the community.


Other Award Information


All grants to be awarded under this notice are subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, as implemented by
45 CFR part 100, which allows States the option of setting up a system for reviewing applications from within their
States for assistance under certain Federal programs. The application kits will contain a listing of States which
have chosen to set up such a review system and will provide a point of contact in the States for that review. Applicants
(other than Federally recognized Indian Tribal governments) should contact their State Single Points of Contact
(SPOCs) as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions
on the State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to contact the SPOC
of each affected State. State process recommendations should be submitted to the appropriate Regional Office (see
Appendix). The due date for State process recommendations is 60 days after the appropriate application deadline
date. The Bureau of Primary Health Care does not guarantee that it will accommodate or explain its response to State
process recommendations received after this date.


Public Health System Reporting Requirement


Section 329 and section 330 programs are subject to the Public Health System Reporting Requirement, PHS Circular
92.01. Reporting requirements have been approved by the OMB under control numbers 0937-0195. Under this requirement,
the community-based nongovernmental applicant must prepare and submit a Public Health System Impact Statement
(PHSIS). The PHSIS is intended to provide information to State and local health officials to keep them apprised of
proposed health services grant applications submitted by community-based nongovernmental organizations within
their jurisdictions.
Community-based nongovernmental applicants are required to submit the following information to the head of the
appropriate State and local health agencies in the area(s) to be impacted no later than the Federal application receipt
due date: (1) A copy of the face page of the application (SF 424); and (2) a summary of the project (PHSIS), not to exceed
one page, which provides a description of the population to be served, a summary of the services to be provided and a
description of the coordination planned with the appropriate State or local health agencies.



(In the OMB Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, the Community Health Center program is listed as Number 93.224
and the Migrant Health Center program is listed as Number 93.246.)

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the proposed allocations to States of FY 1994 funds for social services under the Refugee Resettlement
Program (RRP). In order to help meet the special needs of former political prisoners from Vietnam, the Director proposes
to add to the formula allocation $2,000,000 in funds previously set aside for social services discretionary projects.
In the final notice, allocation amounts could be adjusted after considering comments and evidence from States on
population estimates. This notice proposes to eliminate the set-aside for mutual assistance associations (MAAs)
as a separate component of the social service allocations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Amounts Proposed For Allocation



The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) has available $80,802,000 in FY 1994 refugee social service funds as part
of the FY 1994 appropriation for the Department of Health and Human Services (Pub. L. No. 103-112).

Of the total of $80,802,000, the Director of ORR proposes to make available to States $68,681,700 (85%) under the allocation
formula set out in this notice. These funds would be made available for the purpose of providing social services to
refugees. In addition, the Director of ORR proposes to make available $2,000,000 from discretionary social service
funds to be allocated under the formula in this notice for additional services to former political prisoners from
Vietnam. The allocation amounts proposed in this notice could be adjusted slightly in the final notice after taking
into consideration any population adjustments (see Section VI, below). ORR intends FY 1994 to be the last year in which
a special set-aside will be allocated for additional services for former political prisoners from Vietnam.



A. Discretionary Social Service Funds for Vietnamese Political Prisoners



In recognition of the special vulnerability of refugees who are former political prisoners from Vietnam, the Director
of ORR proposes to set aside $2,000,000 from discretionary social service funds to be allocated under the formula
set forth in this announcement, based on the number of actual political prisoner arrivals in FY 1993. This formula
allocation is shown separately in Table 1 (cols. 7 and 8). States are required to use this allocation to provide additional
services, as described below, to recent arrivals from Vietnam who are former political prisoners and members of their
families.

Allowable services for the above-cited funds for political prisoners include the following direct services: (1)
Specialized orientation and adjustment services, including peer support activities; and (2) specialized employment-related
services, as needed. Under no circumstances may these funds be used for direct cash payments or stipends, or for the
purchase of advertising space or air time.

Allowable services under this allocation for Vietnamese political prisoners are intended to supplement, not to
supplant, those services provided to refugees in general under the social service formula allocation, discussed
below.

ORR intends to provide technical assistance to States and organizations that request it to assure effective program
development and implementation.

Because these funds are proposed to provide specifically for services for former political prisoners from Vietnam,
States which allocate social service funds to other local administrative jurisdictions, such as counties, shall
do so for these funds, using a formula which reflects recent and anticipated arrivals of this target population only.

ORR strongly encourages States and other contracting jurisdictions, in selecting service providers for the above,
to award these funds, to the extent possible, to qualified refugee mutual assistance associations with experience
serving the target population. All contractors receiving these funds should have Vietnamese language capacity
and Vietnamese cultural understanding.

States are required to provide to ORR program performance information on the Vietnamese political prisoner program
that meets the reporting requirements contained in 45 CFR 92.40, under the terms and conditions of the social services
grant awards to States. This information, to be contained in the narrative portion of State quarterly performance
reports, must indicate: (1) Name of service contractors; (2) categories of activities provided; (3) numbers of persons
and types (former prisoners, family members, etc.) served; and (4) outcomes, to the extent possible.



B. Refugee Social Service Funds



The population figures for the social service allocation include refugees, Cuban/Haitian entrants, and Amerasians
from Vietnam since these populations may be served through funds addressed in this notice. (A State must, however,
have an approved State plan for the Cuban/Haitian Entrant Program in order to use funds on behalf of entrants as well
as refugees.)

The Director proposes to allocate $68,681,700 to States on the basis of each State's proportion of the national population
of refugees who had been in the U.S. 3 years or less as of October 1, 1993 (including a floor amount for States which have
small refugee populations).

The use of the 3-year population base in the allocation formula is required by section 412(c)(1)(B) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act (INA) which states that the ``funds available for a fiscal year for grants and contracts [for social
services] * * * shall be allocated among the States based on the total number of refugees (including
children and adults) who arrived in the United States not more than 36 months before the beginning of such fiscal year
and who are actually residing in each State (taking into account secondary migration) as of the beginning of the fiscal
year.''

As established in the FY 1991 social services notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of August 29, 1991, section I, ``Allocation Amounts'' (56 FR 42745), a variable floor amount for States which have
small refugee populations will be calculated as follows: If the application of the regular allocation formula yields
less than $100,000, then_

(1) A base amount of $75,000 is provided for a State with a population of 50 or fewer refugees who have been in the U.S.
3 years or less; and
(2) For a State with more than 50 refugees who have been in the U.S. 3 years or less: (a) A floor has been calculated consisting
of $50,000 plus the regular per capita allocation for refugees above 50 up to a total of $100,000 (in other words, the
maximum under the floor formula is $100,000); (b) if this calculation has yielded less than $75,000, a base amount
of $75,000 is provided for the State.

ORR has consistently supported floors for small States in order to provide sufficient funds to carry out a minimum
service program. Given the range in numbers of refugees in the small States, we have concluded that a variable floor,
as established in the FY 1991 notice, will be more reflective of needs than previous across-the-board floors.

The $12,120,300 in remaining social service funds (15% of the total funds available) is expected to be used by ORR on
a discretionary basis to provide funds for individual projects intended to contribute to the effectiveness and efficiency
of the refugee resettlement program. Grant announcements on discretionary initiatives will be issued separately.



Population To Be Served



Although the allocation formula is based on the 3-year refugee population, in accordance with the requirements of
45 CFR part 400 Subpart I_Refugee Social Services, States are not required to limit social service programs to refugees
who have been in the U.S. only 3 years. In keeping with 45 CFR 400.147(a), a State must allocate an appropriate portion
of its social service funds, based on population and service needs, as determined by the State, for services to newly
arriving refugees who have been in the U.S. less than one year.

While 45 CFR 400.147(b) requires that in providing employability services, a State must give priority to a refugee
who is receiving cash assistance, social service programs should not be limited exclusively to refugees who are cash
assistance recipients. If a State intends to provide services to refugees who have been in the U.S. more than 3 years,
45 CFR 400.147(c) requires the State to specify and justify as part of its Annual Services Plan those funds that it proposes
to use to provide services to those refugees.

ORR expects States to ensure that refugee social services are provided to special populations such as Amerasians
and former political prisoners from Vietnam, in addition to special funding that ORR may designate to address the
special needs of these populations.

ORR funds may not be used to provide services to United States citizens, since they are not covered under the authorizing
legislation, with the following exceptions: (1) Under current regulations at 45 CFR 400.208, services may be provided
to a U.S.-born minor child in a family in which both parents are refugees or, if only one parent is present, in which that
parent is a refugee; and (2) under the FY 1989 Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations
Act (Pub. L. No. 100-461), services may be provided to an Amerasian from Vietnam who is a U.S. citizen and who enters
the U.S. after October 1, 1988.



Service Priorities



Refugee social service funding should be used to assist refugee families to achieve economic independence. To this
end, ORR expects States to ensure that a coherent plan of services is developed for each eligible family that addresses
the family's needs from time of arrival until attainment of economic independence. Each service plan should address
a family's needs for both employment-related services and other needed social services. 

Reflecting section 412(a)(1)(A)(iv) of the INA, the Director expects States to ``insure that women have the same
opportunities as men to participate in training and instruction.'' In addition, States are expected to make sure
that services are provided in a manner that encourages the use of bilingual women on service agency staffs to ensure
adequate service access by refugee women. In order to facilitate refugee self-support, the Director also expects
States to implement strategies which address simultaneously the employment potential of both male and female wage
earners in a family unit, particularly in the case of large families. States are expected to make every effort to assure
the availability of day care services in order to allow women with children the opportunity to participate in employment
services or to accept or retain employment. To accomplish this, day care may be treated as a priority employment-related
service under the refugee social services program. Refugees who are participating in employment services or have
accepted employment are eligible for day care services. For an employed refugee, day care funded by refugee social
service dollars must be limited to one year after the refugee becomes employed. States are expected to use day care
funding from other publicly funded mainstream programs as a prior resource and are expected to work with service providers
to assure maximum access to other publicly funded resources for day care.

In accordance with 45 CFR 400.146, if a State's cash assistance dependency rate for refugees (as defined in section
400.146(b)) is 55% or more, funds awarded under this notice (with the exception of the political prisoner set-aside)
are subject to a requirement that at least 85% of the State's award be used for employability services as set forth in
section 400.154. ORR expects these funds to be used for services which directly enhance refugee employment potential,
have specific employment objectives, and are designed to enable refugees to obtain jobs in less than one year as part
of a plan to achieve self-sufficiency. This reflects the Congressional objective that ``employable refugees should
be placed on jobs as soon as possible after their arrival in the United States'' and that social service funds be focused
on ``employment-related services, English-as-a-second-language training (in non-work hours where possible),
and case-management service'' (INA, section 412(a)(1)(B)). If refugee social service funds are used for the provision
of English language training, such training should be provided concurrently, rather than sequentially, with employment
or with other employment-related services, to the maximum extent possible. ORR also encourages the continued provision
of services after a refugee has entered a job to help the refugee retain employment or move to a better job. 

Since current welfare dependency data are not available, those States that historically have had dependency rates
at 55% and above are invited to submit a request for a waiver of the 85% requirement if they can provide reliable documentation
that demonstrates a lower dependency rate. 

ORR will consider granting a waiver of the 85% provision if a State meets one of the following conditions: 
1. The State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director of ORR that the dependency rate of refugees who have been
in the U.S. 24 months or less is below 55% in the State. 

2. The State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director that (a) less than 85% of the State's social service allocation
is sufficient to meet all employment-related needs of the State's refugees and (b) there are non-employment-related
service needs which are so extreme as to justify an allowance above the basic 15%. Or

3. In accordance with section 412(c)(1)(C) of the INA, the State submits to the Director a plan (established by or in
consultation with local governments) which the Director determines provides for the maximum appropriate provision
of employment-related services for, and the maximum placement of, employable refugees consistent with performance
standards established under section 106 of the Job Training Partnership Act. 

Refugee social services should be provided in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible with a refugee's
language and cultural background. In light of the increasingly diverse population of refugees who are resettling
in this country, refugee service agencies will need to develop practical ways of providing culturally and linguistically
appropriate services to a changing ethnic population. To the maximum extent possible, particularly during a refugee's
initial years of resettlement, refugee social services should be provided through a refugee-specific system rather
than through a system in which refugees are only one of many client groups being served. When planning State refugee
services, States are strongly encouraged to take into account the reception and placement (R & P) services provided
by local resettlement agencies in order to utilize these resources in the overall program design and to ensure the
provision of seamless services to refugees.

In order to provide culturally and linguistically compatible services in as cost-efficient a manner as possible
in a time of limited resources, ORR encourages States and counties to promote and give special consideration to the
provision of refugee social services through coalitions of refugee service organizations, such as coalitions of
MAAs, voluntary resettlement agencies, or a variety of service providers. ORR believes it is essential for refugee-serving
organizations to form close partnerships in the provision of services to refugees in order to be able to respond adequately
to a changing refugee picture. Coalition-building and consolidation of providers is particularly important in
communities with multiple service providers in order to ensure better coordination of services and maximum use of
funding for services by minimizing the funds used for multiple administrative overhead costs.

States should also expect to use funds available under this notice to pay for social services which are provided to
refugees who participate in alternative projects. Section 412(e)(7)(A) of the INA provides that:




The Secretary [of HSS] shall develop and implement alternative projects for refugees who have been in the United States
less than thirty-six months, under which refugees are provided interim support, medical services, support [social]
services, and case management, as needed, in a manner that encourages self-sufficiency, reduces welfare dependency,
and fosters greater coordination among the resettlement agencies and service providers.




This provision is generally known as the Wilson/Fish Amendment. The Department has already issued a separate notice
in the 

Federal Register

 with respect to applications for such projects (50 FR 24583, June 11, 1985). The notice on alternative projects does
not contain provisions for the allocation of additional social service funds beyond the amounts established in this
notice. Therefore a State which may wish to consider carrying out such a project should take note of this in planning
its use of social service funds being allocated under the present notice.



Funding to MAAs



ORR proposes to eliminate the set-aside for refugee mutual assistance associations as a separate component under
the social service notice and proposes instead to fold these funds into the social service formula allocation to States.
ORR believes that the continued and/or increased utilization of qualified refugee mutual assistance associations
in the delivery of social services helps to ensure the provision of culturally and linguistically appropriate services
as well as increasing the effectiveness of the overall service system. Therefore, at a minimum, ORR expects States
to continue to award refugee social service funds to MAAs at a level comparable to the MAA set-aside level in previous
years. In addition, ORR strongly encourages States when contracting for services, including employment services,
to give consideration to the special strengths of MAAs, whenever contract bidders are otherwise equally qualified,
provided that the MAA has the capability to deliver services in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible
with the background of the target population to be served.

ORR defines MAAs as organizations with the following qualifications:

<PARENT> FR940314-2-00045 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

a. The organization is legally incorporated as a nonprofit organization; and

b. Not less than 51% of the composition of the Board of Directors or governing board of the mutual assistance association
is comprised of refugees or former refugees, including both refugee men and women.



State Administration



States are reminded that under current regulations at 45 CFR 400.206 and 400.207, States have the flexibility to charge
the following types of administrative costs against their refugee program social service grants, if they so choose:
Direct and indirect administrative costs incurred for the overall management and operation of the State refugee
program, including its coordination, planning, policy and program development, oversight and monitoring, data
collection and reporting, and travel. See also State Transmittal No. 88-40.



II. [Reserved for Discussion of Comments in Final Notice]

III. Allocation Formula



Of the funds available for FY 1994 for social services, $68,681,700 is proposed to be allocated to States in accordance
with the formula specified below. A State's allowable allocation will be calculated as follows:

1. The total amount of funds determined by the Director to be available for this purpose; divided by_

2. The total number of refugees and Cuban/Haitian entrants who arrived in the United States not more than 3 years prior
to the beginning of the fiscal year for which the funds are appropriated and the number of Amerasians from Vietnam eligible
for refugee social services, as shown by the ORR Refugee Data System. The resulting per capita amount will be multiplied
by_

3. The number of persons in item 2, above, in the State as of October 1, 1993, adjusted for estimated secondary migration.

The calculation above will yield the formula allocation for each State. Minimum allocations for small States are
taken into account.

Allocations for political prisoners are based on FY 1993 arrival numbers for this group in each State from the Refugee
Data Center and are limited to States with 170 or more political prisoner arrivals. We have limited the population
base to FY 1993 political prisoner arrival numbers because these funds are intended to serve recent arrivals. We have
not included States with fewer than 170 former political prisoners in the political prisoner allocations formula
because the resulting level of funding would be insignificant. In these States, we believe the small number of political
prisoners could be adequately served under the State's refugee social services program.



IV. Basis of Population Estimates



The population estimates for the allocation of funds in FY 1994 are based on data on refugee arrivals from the ORR Refugee
Data System, adjusted as of October 1, 1993, for estimated secondary migration. The data base includes refugees of
all nationalities, Amerasians from Vietnam, and Cuban and Haitian entrants.

For fiscal year 1994, ORR's formula allocations for the States for social services are based on the number of refugees
and Amerasians who arrived, and on the numbers of entrants who arrived or were resettled, during the preceding three
fiscal years: 1991, 1992, and 1993, based on final arrival data by State. Therefore, estimates have been developed
of the numbers of refugees and entrants with arrival or resettlement dates between October 1, 1990, and September
30, 1993, who are thought to be living in each State as of October 1, 1993. Refugees admitted under the Federal Government's
private-sector initiative are not included, since their assistance and services are to be provided by the private
sponsoring organizations under an agreement with the Department of State.

The estimates of secondary migration were based on data submitted by all participating States on Form ORR-11.
The total migration reported by each State was summed, yielding in- and-out-migration figures and a net migration
figure for each State. The net migration figure was applied to the State's total arrival figure, resulting in a revised
population estimate. Because the reporting period covered on Form ORR-11 was a maximum of only 8 months as of
June 1993 for the majorigy of States whose reporting base was their cash/medical assistance caseload, extra weight
was given to the secondary migration reported by those States to arrive at estimates of secondary migration over a
36-month period. In 1993, no count of recently-arrived refugee children was available from the Department of Education
for use as a comparison.

Estimates were developed separately for refugees and entrants and then combined into a total estimated 3-year refugee/entrant
population for each State. Eligible Amerasians are included in the refugee figures.

Table 1, below, shows the estimated 3-year populations, as of October 1, 1993, of refugees (col. 1), entrants (col.
2), and total refugees and entrants (col. 3); the formula amounts which the population estimates yield (col. 4); and
the proposed allocation amounts after allowing for the minimum amounts (col. 5). Table 1 also shows the number of former
political prisoner arrivals in FY 1993 (col. 6); and the allocation amounts for services to this population (col.
7).

These population estimates and proposed allocation amounts are intended to be as close to the final figures as was
possible at the time they were developed. However, revisions may need to be made, based on data submitted by States
in accordance with Section VI of this notice, and all population estimates and allocation amounts may change somewhat
as a result.

A detailed explanation of the development of data used in this formula allocation can be obtained by writing to the
address indicated in Section VI of this notice.



V. Proposed Allocation Amounts 



Funding will be contingent upon the submittal and approval of a State annual services plan. The following amounts
are proposed for allocation for refugee social services in FY 1994:

VI. State Evidence on Refugee Population


If a State wishes ORR to reconsider its population estimate, it should submit written evidence. Requests will be evaluated
according to a strict standard. The following evidence should be provided:
 Documentation and discussion should be confined to the population entering the United States during the fiscal
years 1991, 1992, and 1993, and should clearly identify what refugee or entrant groups are being discussed.
 Documentation should include a list of refugees identified by name, alien number, date of birth, date of arrival,
and case size, if appropriate. Listings of refugees who are not identified by their alien numbers will not be considered.
Data should be submitted in machine readable form, preferably in ASCII format on diskette.
Any State evidence on population estimates should be submitted separately from comments on the proposed allocation
formula no later than 30 days from date of publication of this notice and should be addressed to: Loren Bussert, Office
of Refugee Resettlement, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW. Washington DC 20447. Telephone: (202) 401-4732.

Notice inviting applications for competitive cooperative agreement awards for fiscal year 1994.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The purpose of the FGDC National Spatial Data Infrastructure Competitive Cooperative Agreements Program (NSDICCAP)
is to facilitate and foster partnerships and alliances within and among various public and private entities to assist
in building the NSDI. The NSDI consists of policies, standards, agreements, and partnerships among a variety of sectors
and disciplines that will promote more cost-effective production, ready availability, and greater use of high quality
geospatial data. The NSDICCAP is intended to encourage resource-sharing projects, between and among the public
and private sector through the use of technology, networking, and enhanced interagency coordination efforts. Proposals
must involve two or more organizations, and participants are expected to cost share in the project. Activities initiated
under this program will promote development and maintenance of and access to data sets that are needed for national,
regional, State, and local analyses. Authority for this program is contained in the Department of the Interior and
Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1994, Public Law 103-138.


Applications may be submitted by State and local government agencies, educational institutions, private firms,
private foundations, and Federally acknowledged or State-recognized Native American tribes or groups.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under this FY 1994 program announcement, proposals are to be directed towards two components of the NSDI. The first
component deals with creation of a distributed clearinghouse for finding and accessing geospatial data. The second
component involves development and promulgation of the use of standards in data collection, documentation, transfer,
and search and query. The following list of efforts is considered within the scope of the two aforementioned activities,
and are intended to serve as general parameters for consideration when developing proposals: Component I. Development
and implementation of the National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse: Create (inventory, evaluate, catalog data,
and establish Internet access) and manage a node on the National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse that provides users
with a means for finding, accessing, and sharing data; increase use and awareness of geospatial data available over
Internet through development of training programs, information guides and other explanatory materials in support
of a National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse; and, establish, develop, or expand programs or projects that improve
local, regional, or national access to geospatial data to the government, public and private sector. Component II.
Develop and further the implementation of FGDC-endorsed standards: Conduct programs to increase user comprehension
and adoption of the FGDC Metadata Standard and the Spatial Data Transfer Standard; test and evaluate existing and
proposed geospatial data standards; and, stimulate the development of geospatial data standards for consideration
by the FGDC.

Availability of Draft Environmental Impact Statement 



<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-190 as amended),
the National Park Service, Department of the Interior, has prepared a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS)
assessing the potential impacts of the proposed Development Concept Plan for Santa Rosa Island, Channel Islands
National Park, Santa Barbara County, California. 



The draft plan proposes the development of infrastructure and facilities to support maintenance and protection
of resources and historic structures, research and further study of both natural and cultural resources, limited
experimental restoration of natural systems, and the provision of limited visitor use opportunities. Maintenance
and housing facilities would be provided in two locations. One alternative is evaluated, that of no action, which
would maintain existing housing, provide minimal maintenance of facilities to provide for basic health and safety

of visitors and employees, and provide essential resource 
protection with minimal research and planning for restoration of natural systems.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Written comments on the draft Development Concept Plan and DEIS will be accepted until May 31, 1994 and should be sent
to the Superintendent, Channel Islands National Park, 1901 Spinnaker Drive, Ventura, Ca. 93001. A public meeting
on the plan will be held April 27, 1994, from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., at the park visitor center located at the above address.
National Park Service officials will be available at this time to present the plan, receive oral and written comments,
and answer questions. 



Copies of the draft plan and DEIS are available at the park headquarters at the above address. Copies are also available
for inspection at libraries located in the park's vicinity and at the Western Regional Office, National Park Service,
600 Harrison St., suite 600, San Francisco, Ca. 94107-1372. 

Inquiries on the DEIS should be directed to the superintendent at the above address or at (805) 658-5700.

Cedar River Railroad Co._Directed Service Order_Charles City Railway Lines Inc.



The Charles City Railway Lines, Inc. (CCRY), a 3.6 mile railroad in Charles City, Iowa, with connections to the Cedar
River Railroad Company (CRR) and the Soo Line Railroad Company (SOO) was shut down by its management effective with
the close of business February 24, 1994, due to a lack of operating funds, and has been out of operation since that time.
CCRY, based on its letter to shippers dated February 4, 1994 announcing cessation of operations effective February
24, 1994, placed Embargo No. 1-94, dated 2/14/94, which was effective 2/24/94. There are two principal shippers
located on the CCRY.

The Commission was first contacted about the impending shutdown of the CCRY on February 10, 1994, by shippers on the
line, and on February 16, 1994, by the Iowa Department of Transportation (IDOT) indicating their concerns for the
possible shutdown of the railroad and requesting that the Commission consider issuing a directed service order (DSO).
IDOT's petition of February 16, 1994, requested the Commission to initiate voluntary directed service over the CCRY
lines and indicated that the CRR was willing to operate the CCRY lines as a ``Directed Rail Carrier'' (DRC). However,
it was not until February 28, 1994, that the CRR indicated its willingness to provide the uncompensated directed service
operations sought by IDOT and the two affected shippers.

Section 11125(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act authorizes the Commission to act in situations where it finds that


a rail carrier cannot transport traffic offered to it because_(1) its cash position makes its continuing operation
impossible; (2) transportation has been discontinued under court order; or (3) it has discontinued transportation
without obtaining a required certificate under 49 U.S.C. 10903

 (emphasis added). The initial period for the directed service order may not exceed 60 days. However, the order may
be extended for an additional period not to exceed 180 days.

Under a directed service order from the Commission, a directed carrier may voluntarily choose to provide directed
service without any subsidy or compensation to which it may be entitled from the Commission, as CRR has done here. See
St. Louis S.W. Ry. Co_Directed Service_Chicago, 363 I.C.C. 1 (1980), and Directed Service Order No. 1504, The New
York, Susquehanna and Western Railway Corporation_Directed Service_The Delaware and Hudson Railway Company,

Considering the limited nature of the proposed directed service operation, e.g., only two active shippers on the
3.6 mile CCRY line, CRR has asked that in order for CRR to waive all compensation from the Federal government otherwise
applicable under 49 U.S.C. 11125(b)(5), that it be allowed to condition it's offer to provide uncompensated directed
service by limiting its initial 60-day operation to only those portions of the CCRY lines that CRR determines can be
safely operated; that CRR not be required to improve any CCRY lines that it believes are unsafe to operate; that it be
allowed to perform needed switching service to shippers using crews from its through trains, and that it be allowed
to utilize CCRY maintenance of way employees in conjunction with its own employees only to the extent practicable
for its limited operations.

Considering CCRY's cessation of service without alternative and its apparent inability to continue due to its cash
position, we find that CCRY's current situation meets the standards of 49 U.S.C. 11125(a)(1) and (3).

In view of the need for continued rail service over CCRY's lines and CRR's willingness to provide directed service
without compensation from the Federal government, this decision grants the requests of interested parties for interim
service authority to CRR.

The emergency nature of the situation compels us to conclude that advance public notice and hearings would be impractical
and contrary to the immediate public interest in assuring the immediate resumption of essential rail transportation
services. Accordingly, we exercise our authority under 49 U.S.C. 11125(a) to waive advance public notice in the present
circumstances.

Section 11125 permits us to direct service for an initial period of not more than 60 days, with an option to extend the
directed service period for an additional 180 days, if cause exists. We believe directed service authority to be necessary
here at least for an initial 60 day period. Any interested person may file comments on this action during this period.



We Find



1. CCRY had discontinued service over all of its lines. CRR has requested the Commission to permit it to provide continued
rail service over those lines which it considers to be operable.

2. To prevent transportation and economic disruptions due to CCRY's ceased operations, and to assure the immediate
continued movement of commodities, some of which may be perishable, it is necessary for the Commission to authorize
CRR to operate CCRY's lines at Charles City, Iowa under 49 U.S.C. 11125, conditioned upon a waiver of any compensation
or subsidy from the Federal government.

3. Our action in this decision will not substantially impair the ability of CRR to serve its own patrons adequately,
or meet its outstanding common carrier obligations, see 49 U.S.C. 11125(b)(2)(B), and will assure continued rail
service to affected shippers.

This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or energy conservation.



It Is Ordered



1. Based upon its undertaking to do so without any form of compensation from the Federal government, CRR is authorized
to enter upon and operate CCRY's lines at Charles City, Iowa pursuant to this voluntary directed service order under
49 U.S.C. 11125.




(a) Entry by CRR on the lines of CCRY may occur on the date and time authorized in this decision. Operations by CRR may
continue no later than the sixtieth day from the effective date of this decision.

(b) CRR shall immediately notify the Commission, CCRY, and SOO, in writing, of the date on which it commences operations
under this order.




2. Operations performed under authority of this order shall conform to the directions and conditions prescribed
above.

3. All submissions filed in this proceeding should refer to DSO No. 1515 and be sent to the Commission's headquarters
at 12th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20423. An original and 10 copies should be submitted.

4. The provisions of this decision shall apply to intrastate, interstate, and foreign commerce.

5. The Commission retains jurisdiction to modify, supplement, or reconsider this decision at any time.

6. Notice to the general public of this decision shall be given by publication in the 

Federal Register

. The decision will be served on the Federal Railroad Administration, the Association of American Railroads, American
Short Line Railroad Association, CRR, CCRY, SOO, and the IDOT.

7. This decision and order shall become effective at 12:01 a.m., on March 7, 1994.

8. Unless otherwise modified by the Commission, this order will expire at 11:59 p.m., on May 5, 1994.




Decided: March 4, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Port Railroads, Inc._Lease and Operation Exemption_Southern Pacific Transportation Company</DOCTITLE>



Port Railroads, Inc. (PRI), a noncarrier subsidiary of Kyle Railways, Inc. (Kyle) has filed a notice of exemption
to lease and operate approximately 107.438 miles of railroad lines of the Southern Pacific Transportation Company
in Fresno and Kern Counties, CA.

The lines involved in the lease transaction consist of: (1) The West Side Line: Between milepost 207.138 on the west
leg of the wye and milepost 207.260 on the east leg of the wye, at Fresno, CA, and the end of the line at milepost 159.60
at Oxalis, CA; (2) the Riverdale Branch: Between milepost 182.003 at Ingle, CA, and the end of the line at milepost 208.73
at Burrell, CA; and (3) the Buttonwillow Branch: Between milepost 313.649 on the west leg of the wye and milepost 314.020
on the east leg of the wye, at Kern Junction in Bakersfield, CA, and the end of line at milepost 347.00 at Buttonwillow,
CA. The parties expected to consummate the proposed transaction on or after March 6, 1994.

This proceeding is related to Finance Docket No. 32458, Kyle Railways, Inc._Continuance in Control Exemption_Port
Railroads, Inc., wherein Kyle has concurrently filed a petition for exemption to continue in control of PRI and seven
other railroads upon PRI becoming a railroad.

Any comments must be filed with the Commission and served on: Fritz R. Kahn, Esq., suite 120, 1101 30th St., NW., Washington,
DC 20007.

The notice is filed under 49 CFR 1150.31. If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is
void 

ab initio.

 Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not automatically stay the transaction.




Decided: March 7, 1994.

Smead Manufacturing Co.; Hastings, MN; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment
Assistance




In accordance with section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on February 15, 1994, applicable to all workers of the subject
firm engaged in employment related to the production of office filing supplies. The certification notice was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on March 4, 1994 (59 FR 10429).

At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The
findings show that several workers were laid off a few months prior to the Department's impact date of August 1, 1993.
The findings also show that the workers were laid off as a result of a company decision to import office filing supplies.

Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification with a new impact date of April 1, 1993.

The amended notice applicable to TA-W-29,213 is hereby issued as follows: All workers of Smead Manufacturing
Company, Hastings, Minnesota engaged in employment related to the production of office filing supplies who became
totally or partially separated from employment on or after April 1, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance
under section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.

<DOCTITLE>Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Program: Unemployment Insurance Program Letters Interpreting Federal
Unemployment Insurance Law</DOCTITLE>



The Employment and Training Administration interprets Federal law requirements pertaining to unemployment compensation
as part of its role in the administration of the Federal-State unemployment compensation program. These interpretations
are issued in Unemployment Insurance Program Letters (UIPLs) to the State Employment Security Agencies (SESAs).
The UPLs described below are published in the Federal Register

 in order to inform the public.



Unemployment Insurance Program Letter No. 13-94



This UIPL advises SESAs of the provisions of Public Law (Pub. L.) 103-152 which affect the unemployment compensation
(UC) program. Public Law 103-152 requires that States establish and utilize a system of profiling all new claimants
for regular UC in order to identify those claimants most likely to exhaust regular UC and in need of reemployment services
in order to obtain new work. It also requires that an individual identified pursuant to the profiling system must participate
in reemployment services as a condition of UC eligibility.



Unemployment Insurance Program Letter No. 14-94



This UIPL advises SESAs of the provisions of Public Law 103-182 relating to self-employment assistance as it
affects the UC program. Public Law 103-182 amended Federal law to give States the option of permitting, for a
five-year period, certain individuals to receive payments from a State's unemployment fund for the purpose of assisting
such individuals in establishing businesses and becoming self-employed.

Subject: The Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-152)_Provisions Affecting the Federal-State
Unemployment Compensation Program 

 


Rescissions: None. 

Expiration Date: January 31, 1995. 

1. 

Purpose.

 To advise State employment security agencies (SESAs) of the provisions of the Unemployment Compensation Amendments
of 1993, Public Law (Pub. L.) 103-152, which affect the Federal-State Unemployment Compensation (UC) Program.

2. 

References.

 Section 4 of Public Law 103-152; Titles III and IX of the Social Security Act (SSA); Public Law 103-6; Public
Law 102-318; UI Occasional Papers 89-3 and 
91-1; and UIPL 45-93, dated September 23, 1993.

3. 

Background.

 On November 24, 1993, the President signed into law the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1993, Public Law
103-152. Public Law 103-152 extended the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program, and amended
the SSA to require States, as a condition of receiving administrative grants, to establish and utilize a system of
profiling all new claimants for regular UC for purposes of identifying claimants who are likely to exhaust UC and will
need job search assistance to make a successful transition to new employment. The SSA was further amended to require
States to disqualify an individual identified pursuant this profiling system if the individual fails to participate
in reemployment services. In addition, Public Law 103-152 made a technical change to Title IX of the SSA. States
have already been advised of those provisions affecting the EUC program in GAL 12-92, Change 6. This issuance
is limited to those amendments to the SSA affecting the Federal-State UC program. These amendments are as follows:

(a) a new requirement that States establish and utilize a system of profiling all new claimants for regular UC;

(b) a new requirement that State law require claimants identified as most likely to exhaust regular UC to participate
in reemployment services as condition of UC eligibility; and 

(c) a technical amendment to Title IX of the SSA pertaining to the Unemployment Trust Fund. 

4. 

Action Required. 

SESAs are requested to take the action necessary to assure consistency with Federal requirements as amended by Public
Law 103-152. The effective dates for implementation of these amendments are found in Attachment III. 

5. 

Inquiries. 

Inquiries should be directed to your Regional Office.

Unemployed Worker Profiling



a. Text of Amendment_Section 4(a) of Public Law 103-152

Sec. 4. Worker Profiling.

(a) In General._

(1) Establishment of Profiling System._Section 303 of the Social Security Act is amended by adding at the end thereof
the following new subsection:

``(j)(1) The State agency charged with the administration of the State law shall establish and utilize a system of
profiling all new claimants for regular compensation that_

``(A) Identifies which claimants will be likely to exhaust regular compensation and will need job search assistance
services to make a successful transition to new employment;

``(B) Refers claimants identified pursuant to subparagraph (A) to reemployment services, such as job search assistance
services, available under any State or Federal law;

``(C) Collects follow-up information relating to the services received by such claimants and the employment outcomes
for such claimants subsequent to receiving such services and utilizes such information in making identifications
pursuant to subparagraph (A); and

``(D) Meets such other requirements as the Secretary of Labor determines are appropriate.

``(2) Whenever the Secretary of Labor, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State agency charged
with the administration of the State law, finds that there is a failure to comply substantially with the requirements
of paragraph (1), the Secretary of Labor shall notify such State agency that further payments will not be made to the
State until he is satisfied that there is no longer any such failure. Until the Secretary of Labor is so satisfied, he
shall make no further certification to the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to such State.''

b. Discussion.

Profiling_Situation Prior to Enactment of Public Law 103-152. 

Profling is based on the premise that a set of characteristics_a ``profile''_can be developed to identify, at an early
stage of unemployment, which workers are likely to exhaust UC and will need assistance to find new jobs. Research on
this point sponsored by the Department of Labor and conducted in the State of New Jersey found that profiled claimants
who received reemployment services returned to work earlier than those who did not receive such services. (See UI
Occasional Papers 89-3 and 91-1 which contain reports on the New Jersey project). In addition, studies
on the long-term unemployed have found that individual characteristics such as schooling and job tenure relate to
when the individuals return to work. Thus, providing early reemployment assistance to individuals most likely to
remain out of work should result in an earlier return to work.

Section 4 of Public Law 103-6 addressed the establishment of a system of profiling all new claimants for regular
UC (including new claimants under Federal unemployment benefit allowance programs) to determine which claimants
may be most likely to exhaust regular UC and may need reemployment services to make a successful transition to new employment.
Although States were not required to establish a system of profiling, the Secretary was directed to ``encourag[e]
[its] adoption and implementation by all States,'' as well as provide ``technical assistance and advice to the States
in the development of model profiling systems.''

In response to this legislation, the Department took action to develop a model profiling system. UIPL 45-93
was issued and States were encouraged to provide comments on the profiling system and the procedures needed to implement
it. The Department was in the process of developing this system and a strategy for its implementation when Public Law
103-152 was enacted.



Profiling_Effect of Public Law 103-152. 

The amendments made by Public Law 103-152 repealed section 4 of Public Law 103-6 and added subsection (j)
to section 303, SSA, to require States, as a condition for receiving Title III grants, to implement and utilize a system
of profiling all new claimants for regular UC. Under section 303(j)(1), SSA, the system must include components which:

1. Identify which claimants will be likely to exhaust regular UC and will need job search assistance services to make
a successful transition to new employment.

2. Refer the claimants described in item 1 above to reemployment services, such as job search assistance services,
available under any State or Federal law. The conference Committee Report defines ``reemployment services'' as:


* * * job search assistance and job placement services, such as counseling, testing, and providing
occupational and labor market information, assessment, job search workshops, job clubs and referrals to employers,
and other similar services. [H. Rep. No. 333, 103rd Cong. 1st Sess., 5 (1993)] 

3. Collect follow-up information relating to the services received by such claimants and their employment outcomes
and use the information for future profiling. 

4. Meet ``such other requirements as the Secretary of Labor determines are appropriate.'' 

The Department of Labor will provide further guidance concerning ``reemployment services,'' job search assistance,''
``follow-up information,'' ``employment outcomes'' and any other requirements the Secretary of Labor determines
to be necessary for the proper implementation of a profiling system. 

c. 

Technical Assistance and Report. 

Section 4(c) of Public Law 103-152 requires that the ``Secretary of Labor shall provide technical assistance
and advice to assist the States in implementing the profiling system'' and that ``such assistance shall include the
development and identification of model profiling systems.'' The Department of Labor plans to provide technical
assistance to States. Information concerning this assistance and the model profiling systems will be provided in
future issuances. 

Section 4(d) of Public Law 103-152 requires that, not later than the date three years after the date of enactment
of Public Law 103-152, the Secretary of Labor will report to the Congress on the operation and effectiveness
of the profiling system and of the participation requirement described in Attachment II below. Since Public Law 103-152
was enacted on November 24, 1993, the report is due November 24, 1996. 

d. 

Effective Date. 

Section 303(j)(2), SSA, requires that States must comply substantially with the requirements of 303(j)(1), SSA
as a condition of receiving administrative grants under Section 303(a), SSA. 

Under section 4(f)(1) of Public Law 103-152, new section 303(j), SSA, ``shall take effect on the date one year
after the date of the enactment of this Act,'' or November 24, 1994. In determining whether to take action against a
State which has not appropriately amended its law and/or not established a profiling system by this effective date,
the Department of Labor will take into consideration the feasibility of such State taking that action to meet the requirements
of the statute, as interpreted by the Department in its operating instructions. These operating instructions will
be provided in future issuances.

Attachment II to UIPL 13-94

Participation in Reemployment Services




a. 

Text of the Amendment_Section 4(b) of Public Law 103-152.

(b) Participation Requirement._Section 303(a) of the Social Security Act is amended_

(1) By striking the period at the end of paragraph (9) and inserting ``; and '', and

(2) By adding at the end thereof the following new paragraph:

``(10) A requirement that, as a condition of eligibility for regular compensation for any week, any claimant who has
been referred to reemployment services pursuant to the profiling system under subsection (j)(1)(B) participate
in such services or in similar services unless the State agency charged with the administration of the State law determines_

``(A) Such claimant has completed such services; or

``(B) There is justifiable cause for such claimant's failure to participate in such services.''

b. Discussion. 

Public Law 103-152 added section 303(a)(10) to the SSA to require States, as a condition of receiving Title III
grants, to place an additional condition of eligibility on claimants who have been referred to reemployment services
pursuant to the profiling system under subsection 303(j)(1)(B), SSA. A profiled claimant, in order to be eligible
for regular UC for any given week, must participate in reemployment services or similar services unless the State
agency determines that (1) the profiled claimant has already completed such services; or (2) there is a justifiable
cause for the claimant's failure to participate in such services. The Department of Labor will provide further guidance
to States concerning participation in ``reemployment services'' or ``similar services'' and ``justifiable cause.''

The Department believes States will need to amend their laws to provide for a disqualification based on a profiled
claimant's failure to participate in reemployment services. If a State does not need to make such a law change, it will
be necessary to notify the Department that such a disqualification can be accomplished without amendment.

c. 

Effective Date. 

Section 4(f) of Public Law 103-152, requires that new Section 303(a)(10), SSA, ``shall take effect on the date
one year after the date of the enactment of this Act,'' or November 24, 1994. In determining whether to take action against
a State which has not met this requirement by this effective date, the Department of Labor will take into consideration
the feasibility of such State timely amending its law and establishing a profiling system (which is a necessary requisite
to this denial provision) which meets the requirements established by the Department in its operating instructions.

Attachment III to UIPL 13-94 

Draft Language to Implement Section 4(b) of Public Law 103-152 



States needing to amend their laws to incorporate the new eligibility criteria established by Public Law 103-152,
may wish to use the following draft language. 

(a) 

Eligibility for benefits._

An unemployed individual shall be eligible to receive benefits with respect to any week only if the individual: 



* * * * * 



( ) participates in reemployment services, such as job search assistance services, if the individual has
been determined to be likely to exhaust regular benefits and need reemployment services pursuant to a profiling system
established by the Commissioner. 



Attachment IV to UIPL 13-94 

Technical Amendment Concerning the Unemployment Trust Fund 



(a) 

Text of the Amendment_Section 5 of Public Law 103-152.

Sec. 5. Technical Amendment to Unemployment Trust Fund.

Paragraph (1) of section 905(b) of the Social Security Act is amended to read as follows: 

``(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), the Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer (as of the close of each
month) from the employment security administration account to the extended unemployment compensation account
established by subsection (a), an amount (determined by such Secretary) equal to 20 percent of the amount by which_


``(A) The transfers to the employment security administration account pursuant to section 901(b)(2) during such
month, exceed 

``(B) The payments during such month from the employment security administration account pursuant to section 901(b)(3)
and (d). 

If for any such month the payments referred to in subparagraph (B) exceed the transfers referred to in subparagraph
(A), proper adjustments shall be made in the amounts subsequently transferred.'' 

(b) Discussion.

 The legislation proposed which eventually became Public Law 103-318 contained a provision which would have
amended section 901(b)(1), SSA, to create new subparagraphs (A) and (B). This provision was not enacted. However,
corresponding amendments to section 905(b) were included in the enacted version of Public Law 103-319. As these
amendments referred to non-existent sections, the amendments had no effect. Section 5 of Public Law 103-152
amended Section 905(b), SSA, to delete the erroneously enacted language pertaining to the non-existing section.

Directive: 

Unemployment Insurance Program Letter No. 14-94


To: 

All State Employment Security Agencies


From: 

Mary Ann Wyrsch, Director, Unemployment Insurance Service


Subject: 

North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103-182)_Provisions Affecting the Federal-State
Unemployment Compensation (UC) Program relating to Self-Employment Assistance
Rescisions: None.
Expiration Date: February 28, 1995.




1. 

Purpose. 

To advise State agencies of the provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act which affect
the Federal-State UC Program.
2. 

References. 

The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA); Title III of the Social Security Act (SSA); the Federal-State Extended Unemployment
Compensation Act of 1970 (EUCA), as amended; section 9152 of Public Law 100-203; section 507 of the North American
Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (NAFTA), Public Law 103-182; Unemployment Insurance Program Letter
(UIPL) 29-83, Change 1: General Administration Letter (GAL) 7-94; and UI Occasional Paper 92-2.
3. 

Background. 

On December 8, 1993, the President signed into law the NAFTA, Public Law 100-182, which affects the UC program
in two ways. First, NAFTA created a transitional adjustment assistance program designed to address worker dislocation
caused by NAFTA. This aspect of NAFTA was addressed in GAL 7-94. Second, NAFTA amended Federal law to give States
the option of permitting, for a five-year period, certain individuals to receive a payment from the State's unemployment
fund for the purpose of assisting such individuals in establishing a business and becoming self-employed. It is this
second aspect of NAFTA which is the subject of this UIPL.
4. 

Discussion. 
a. In General. 

The ``withdrawal standard'' of Section 3304(a)(4), FUTA, and section 303(a)(5), SSA, limits withdrawals (with
specified exceptions not relevant here) from a State's unemployment fund to payments of ``compensation'' and prior
to the enactment of NAFTA would have prohibited withdrawals for the purpose of paying self-employment allowances.
The term ``compensation'' is defined in section 3306(h), FUTA, as ``cash benefits payable to individuals with respect
to their unemployment.'' Due to this requirement that the payment be with respect to ``unemployment,'' the withdrawal
standard has previously, with one temporary exception, prohibited States from using unemployment funds to assist
individuals in establishing themselves in self-employment.
The previous temporary exception was created by section 9152 of Public Law 100-203, the Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1987. Public Law 100-203 authorized three demonstration projects to test the feasibility of providing
self-employment allowances, payable from a State's unemployment fund, to individuals. Only Massachusetts operated
a demonstration project. The initial report on this project was issued in UI Occasional Paper 92-2, Self-Employment
Programs for Unemployed Workers, and is available by writing Ingrid Evans, United States Department of Labor, Unemployment
Insurance Service, 200 Constitution Ave. NW., room S-4231, Washington, DC 20210. A final report will be available
in 1994.
NAFTA amended Federal law to allow payments to self-employed individuals under specified conditions during the
five years following NAFTA's date of enactment. The report of the House Ways and Means Committee describes the intent
behind the new Self-employment provision:
Providing States the authority to establish and operate self-employment programs would significantly benefit
workers that may be dislocated because of the NAFTA. The traditional system of unemployment compensation is primarily
designed to provide income support for workers who are temporarily laid off or expect to be unemployed for only a short
time. However, as a result of the NAFTA, some workers may lose their jobs permanently and need additional tools besides
the basic income maintenance provided by the unemployment insurance system in order to re-enter the work force. For
some of those workers, access to a self-employment program would be the best path for them to re-enter the work force.
This provision gives states the ability to add the tool of self-employment training and support to the options available
to help speed the transition of dislocated workers back into the work force. [H. Rept. No. 361, Part 1, 103rd Cong.,
1st Sess. 94 (1993).]
Specifically, section 507, NAFTA, amended the withdrawal standard (and the definition of ``unemployment fund''
in section 3306(f), FUTA) to provide that amounts may be withdrawn from the unemployment fund of a State ``for the payment
of allowances under a self-employment assistance program (as defined in section 3306(t)) * * *''
FUTA. This exception to the withdrawal standard applies solely to the self-employment assistance (SEA) allowances
described in section 3306(t), FUTA, which was also added to FUTA by section 507(a), NAFTA. Under new section 3306(t)(1),
SEA allowances are payable ``in lieu of regular'' UC for the purposes of assisting individuals in establishing a business
and becoming self-employed.
b. 

Eligibility for SEA Allowances. 

SEA allowances are to be payable ``in the same amount, at the same interval [e.g., payment with respect to a period will
be made weekly if that is the State's usual practice for claims for regular UC or every other week if that is the usual
practice], on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions as'' regular UC. (Section 3306(t)(2), FUTA.) This
``equal treatment'' provision applies to all monetary and nonmonetary (including reporting and certification)
eligibility requirements except where specifically prohibited by other provisions of Federal law pertaining to
SEA allowances. It also applies to notice and appeal rights.

Since individuals engaged in self-employment activities will normally be disqualified if certain eligibility
provisions for State UC are followed, section 3306(t)(2), FUTA, provides that these provisions of State law shall
not be followed. Specifically, the following provisions shall not apply:

(1) State requirements relating to availability for work, active search for work, and refusal to accept work.

(2) State requirements relating to disqualifying income are not applicable to income earned from self-employment
by individuals claiming SEA allowances.

In addition, individuals in the SEA program will be considered to be ``unemployed'' for purposes of both Federal and
State UC laws provided the individuals meet provisions of State law subject to the above equal treatment provision
and four additional eligibility provisions for SEA allowances discussed immediately below. (The effect of this
requirement on Federal law is discussed below in item 4.f.)

Section 3306(t)(3), FUTA, contains the four additional eligibility provisions which individuals must meet to receive
SEA allowances:

(1) They must be eligible to receive regular UC under the State law (or they would be eligible but for the requirements
suspended by the SEA provisions at section 3306(t)(2), FUTA, as discussed above). This is basically a restatement
of the ``equal treatment'' requirement of section 3306(t)(1), FUTA, and includes monetary as well as initial and
continuing nonmonetary eligibility. For purposes of determining SEA eligibility, ``regular compensation'' includes
UC for ex-servicemembers (UCX) and former Federal employees (UCFE). (See item 4.g below.)

Since the SEA allowance is ``in lieu of'' regular UC, the total amount of SEA allowances that individuals may receive
is equal to their maximum benefit amount of regular UC less any regular UC previously received. Similarly, the weekly
SEA allowance amount must equal the weekly benefit amount for regular UC. Also, SEA allowances and regular UC may not
be paid for the same period.

The term ``regular compensation'' is defined in section 205(2), EUCA, as ``compensation payable to an individual
under any State unemployment compensation law (including compensation payable pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 85),
other than extended compensation and additional compensation.'' Thus, individuals who have exhausted regular
UC are ineligible for SEA allowances. Individuals may not receive SEA allowances in lieu of Federal-State extended
benefits (EB), additional benefits (AB) entirely financed by the State, any wholly funded Federal extension of UC,
or other types of compensation not meeting the definition of regular UC.

Individuals who are terminated from or voluntarily leave the SEA program may collect regular UC with respect to the
benefit year (if otherwise eligible) until the total amount of regular UC paid and SEA paid equals the maximum benefit
amount. Such individuals may be paid EB if otherwise eligible. This is because, under 20 CFR 615.5(a)(1), these individuals
are ``exhaustees'' for EB purposes because they have received ``all of the regular compensation that was payable
under the applicable State law * * *.'' Similarly, individuals who exhaust the maximum benefit amount
as SEA program participants may also receive EB if otherwise eligible. Whether any of the individuals discussed in
this paragraph are eligible for other Federal extensions will depend on the law creating the extension. Whether individuals
are eligible for AB will be determined by State law.

(2) The individuals must be identified pursuant to a State worker profiling system as likely to exhaust regular UC.
For further discussion of SEA profiling requirements, refer to items 4.d and 4.j of this UIPL.

(3) The individuals are participating in self-employment assistance activities which are approved by the State
agency. State agency is defined in Section 3306(e), FUTA, as the authority ``designated under a State law to administer
the unemployment fund in such State.'' The activities which must be offered the individuals are entrepreneurial
training, business counseling, and technical assistance. (Information concerning these activities may be found
in UI Occasional Paper 92-2, which describes services provided to claimants participating in the self-employment
demonstration programs in Washington and Massachusetts.) If these activities are not available, an individual
pursuing self-employment will not be eligible for SEA allowances; determination of eligibility for regular UC for
such individuals will be made under State law provisions relating to self-employment. The activities may be offered
by either private or public entities.

<TEXT>
 

An individual who fails to participate in a scheduled activity (e.g., failure to attend a scheduled training course)
is not considered to be participating in SEA program activities. However, for purposes of receiving a SEA allowance,
it is not always necessary for the individual to have actually participated in SEA program activities for the week
claimed. What is, at a minimum, necessary is that the individual be participating in a program (approved by the State
agency) which provides training programs on an ongoing basis and allows individuals to avail themselves of other
SEA program services when they are needed. As long as individuals are under such a program, even though no activities
are scheduled for a given week, they will be considered to be participating in SEA program activities and may be paid
SEA allowances. It is possible that an individual may be eligible for both regular UC and the SEA allowance. This will
occur when the individual is participating in training related to self-employment which is also approved training
under State law. In this instance, the State is free to determine whether regular UC or the SEA allowance will be paid
as long the eligibility requirements for the respective program are met. However, in no instance may both regular
UC and the SEA allowances be paid with respect to the same period. 

Since States do not disqualify individuals under their regular UC laws for failure to participate in SEA program activities,
the SEA ``equal treatment'' provision does not address what disqualifications States may impose in these cases.
It is recommended that States disqualify these individuals from receipt of SEA allowances only for the week the failure
to participate occurs. Such individuals may be eligible for regular UC for that week if State law provisions relating
to regular UC are met. Individuals who fail to meet the participation requirement may be dropped by the State from the
SEA program. 

(4) They are actively engaged on a full-time basis in activities (which may include training) relating to the establishment
of a business and becoming self-employed. The Department of Labor (``Department'') is researching the relationship
of this requirement to the Americans with Disabilities Act. When this research is completed, guidance on what constitutes
a ``full-time basis'' will be provided. 

As is the case with failing to participate in SEA activities, States do not currently disqualify individuals under
their regular UC laws for failure to actively engage on a full-time basis relating to the establishment of a business
and becoming self-employed. Therefore, the SEA ``equal treatment'' provision does not address what disqualifications
States may impose in these cases. It is recommended that States disqualify these individuals from receipt of SEA allowances
only for the week the failure to actively engage on a full-time basis occurs. Such individuals may be eligible for regular
UC for that week if State law provisions relating to regular UC are met. Individuals who fail to meet the ``full-time''
requirement may be dropped by the State from the SEA program. 

c. 

5 Percent Rule. 

Section 3306(t)(4), FUTA, places a limitation on the number of individuals in a State who may receive SEA allowances.
Specifically, it provides that the aggregate number of individuals receiving the allowance must ``not at any time
exceed 5 percent of the number of individuals receiving regular unemployment compensation under the State law at
such time * * *.'' The Department will monitor this ``5 percent test'' on a monthly basis. Therefore,
States must use at least a monthly measurement period as well. The calculation relates to individuals actually receiving
(i.e., paid) SEA for the week as a percent of those receiving regular UC for the same week. Thus, for example, if 10,000
individuals receive regular UC (including UCFE and UCX) for a given week, then no more than 500 may receive SEA allowances
(including UCFE and UCX claimants).





Note: 

The 5 percent figure is not arrived at by taking 5 percent of the sum of the number of individuals receiving SEA and the
number of individuals receiving regular UC.




The 5 percent figure is an express limitation which the State may not exceed. Therefore, States must monitor SEA allowance
payments closely to assure that the 5 percent limitation is not exceeded. The Department recommends that new individuals
not be added to the SEA program if it appears the 5 percent threshold may be exceeded. 

d. 

No Cost to Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF). 

Section 3306(t)(5), FUTA, places an additional requirement on the States as a condition of paying SEA allowances.
It provides that the payment of SEA allowances must not result in any cost to the UTF ``in excess of the cost that would
be incurred by such State and charged to such [Unemployment Trust] Fund if the State had not participated in'' the SEA
program. Put simply, payment of SEA allowances may not result in any additional benefit charges to the UTF. This limitation
applies only to the benefit costs associated with the payment of SEA/regular UC. It does not apply to the charging of
SEA allowances to employers.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940314-2-00106 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940314-2-00058 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Since individuals successfully establishing themselves in self-employment will not collect EB, the UTF will accrue
some savings to the Extended Unemployment Compensation Account and the State's account. However, since EB is not
always payable in a State, the Department has determined that this ``no cost'' requirement will be met only if:

(1) The State implements a profiling system which assures that only claimants likely to exhaust regular UC will receive
SEA allowances. An inadequate profiling system were those likely to not exhaust regular UC are allowed to receive
SEA allowances will not meet the ``no cost'' requirement.

(2) The State creates ``participation requirements'' designed to assure SEA allowances are paid only to those who
actually participate in the SEA program. Participation requirements for determining if an individual is actively
engaged on a full-time basis in SEA activities must be at least as stringent as the able and available requirements
for regular UC; otherwise the SEA program will not meet the ``no cost'' requirement.

More information on what is required of States in these areas is described in item 4.j below.

e. 

State Reports. 

Section 507(c), NAFTA, provides that any State operating a SEA program authorized by the Secretary of Labor must report
annually to the Secretary the number of individuals who participate in the SEA program, the number of individuals
who are able to develop and sustain businesses (e.g., business survival data), the cost of operating the SEA program,
and compliance with program requirements. The report must also contain other relevant data needed by the Department,
including data related to business income, number of employees and wages paid in the new businesses, and incidence
and duration of unemployment after business start-up.

State reports will be submitted with respect to a calendar year and will be due the June 30 following the report year.
This means the first report may be for only part of a year. For example, if a State's SEA program is effective April 1,
1994, then the first annual report will be due on June 30, 1995 and will cover a nine-month period.

Failure to submit the report as required will create an issue under section 303(a)(6), SSA, which requires that, as
a condition of receipt of administrative grants for the UC program, State law provides for ``the making of such reports,
in such form and containing such information, as the Secretary of Labor may from time to time require * * *.''

Under section 507(d), NAFTA, the Secretary of Labor is required to submit a report to Congress with respect to the SEA
program not later than four years after the date of enactment of NAFTA. Since NAFTA was enacted on December 8, 1993,
this report is due no later than December 8, 1997. This report will be based on the reports from the States operating
SEA programs.

f. 

Individuals Receiving SEA considered to be Unemployed. 

As noted in item 4.a, section 3306(h) defines ``compensation'' as ``cash benefits payable to individuals with respect
to their unemployment.'' Payments to self-employed individuals are not compensation since they are not payable
with respect to unemployment. However, under section 3306(t)(2)(c), FUTA, individuals to whom the SEA allowances
are payable ``are considered to be unemployed for the purposes of Federal and State laws applicable to unemployment
compensation, as long as such individuals meet the requirements'' of section 3306(t). The effect of this provision
is that, with respect to SEA, individuals are considered to be unemployed and payments made to them are considered
to be ``compensation.'' Thus, the term ``compensation'' is considered to include individuals eligible for SEA allowances.
The term ``regular compensation'' does not, however, include SEA allowances. This is because under Section 3306(t)(1),
FUTA, SEA is payable ``in lieu of'' regular UC.

g. 

Equal Treatment Requirements Elsewhere in Federal Law. 

In addition to the SEA ``equal treatment'' requirement in Section 3306(t)(2), FUTA, Federal law contains two other
equal treatment requirements mandating payment of compensation ``in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject
to the same conditions'' as UC payable under State law. One requirement is found in section 3304(a)(6)(A), FUTA, and
pertains to payment of UC based on services performed for State and local governments and certain nonprofit entities,
commonly called ``reimbursing'' employers. The other requirement is found in 5 U.S.C. 8502(b) and pertains to payment
of UCX and UCFE. As noted in item 1.f, above, the term ``compensation'' is considered to include SEA allowances. Therefore,
individuals who perform services covered under these two additional ``equal treatment'' provisions must be given
the option of receiving SEA allowances. The payment of SEA allowances does not require an amendment to the UCFE/UCX
agreement.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940314-2-00107 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940314-2-00058 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The ``equal treatment'' requirement contained in section 3306(t)(2), FUTA, provides that SEA allowances will be
``payable in the same amount, at the same interval, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions, as regular
unemployment compensation under the State law * * *.'' Thus, SEA allowances must be paid to all eligible
individuals to whom regular UC is payable under State law, including individuals who performed services to which
section 3304(a)(6)(A), FUTA, and 5 U.S.C. chapter 85 apply. 
These equal treatment requirements extend to all aspects related to the payment of SEA. 
h. 

Financing of SEA Allowances. 

It will be necessary for States to review their laws to determine how the allowances will be financed. Financing depends
on the type of employer for which the individual receiving the allowance previously performed services. 
(1) 

Experience Rated Employers. 

Section 3303(a)(1), FUTA, requires, as a condition of employers in a State obtaining the additional credit against
the Federal unemployment tax, that no reduced contribution rate be assigned an employer, except on the basis of ``experience
with respect to unemployment or other factors bearing a direct relation to unemployment risk * * *.''
All but one of the existing experience rating systems consist of charging payments of compensation or benefit wages
to an employer who had previously provided employment to the compensated individual. 
As noted in item 1.f, under section 3306(t)(2)(c), FUTA, individuals to whom the SEA allowance is payable ``are considered
to be unemployed for the purposes of Federal and State laws applicable to unemployment compensation * * *.''
Under this provision, SEA allowances reflect ``experience with respect to unemployment or other factors bearing
a direct relation to unemployment risk'' for purposes of section 3303(a)(1), FUTA. Therefore, the measurement of
an employer's experience through charges based on SEA allowances is appropriate. 
In charging SEA allowances, States must use the same method of charging (e.g., charging base period employers proportionately)
and noncharge in the same situations (e.g., noncharging claims where the individual has voluntarily quit) as apply
to regular UC. To fail to do this would raise an issue under the ``uniform method'' requirement of section 3303(a)(1),
FUTA. See UIPL 29-83, Change 1, dated September 24, 1991. 
The Department will address the issue of whether SEA allowances may be noncharged when it develops a comprehensive
noncharging policy. 
(The one experience rating system not using payments of compensation or benefit wages is Alaska which uses a payroll
decline system. The Department believes this system will not be affected by the payment of SEA allowances.)
(2) 

Reimbursing Employers. 

Section 3309(a)(2), FUTA, provides that costs ``of compensation attributable under the State law'' to service performed
for State and local governments and nonprofit organizations to which that section pertains must be reimbursed by
such entities. Since, as discussed in item 1.f, SEA allowances are considered to be compensation, this requirement
also applies to SEA allowances. 
(3) 

Federal Military and Civilian Employers. 

Under 5 U.S.C. 8509(b), moneys in the Federal Employees Compensation Account shall be ``available only for the purpose
of making payments to States pursuant to agreements'' with the Secretary of Labor. Since payments of SEA are payments
of compensation for purposes of Federal law, SEA allowances attributable to Federal military or civilian service
may be charged to Federal employers. 
i. 

Payment of Administrative Costs. 

Costs of administering SEA allowances (including those paid to UCFE and UCX claimants) are payable from grants received
for the administration of State's UC law under Title III of the SSA. Costs of providing SEA program services such as
entrepreneurial training, business counseling and technical assistance are not, however, payable from these Title
III funds.

j. 

Required Plan.

 Section 3306(t)(6), FUTA, provides that a State SEA program must meet ``such other requirements as the Secretary
of Labor determines to be appropriate.'' Secretary's Order No. 4-75 (40 FR 18515) gives the Department the authority
to make this determination. The Department has determined that, prior to implementing a SEA program, the Department
must approve a State plan. This approval process will assure an orderly start-up of the SEA program in a State. To be
approved the plan must contain:

(1) A description of the profiling system used to identify SEA program participants. The State has three options for
choosing a profiling system:

(A) Using elements of the statistical model developed by the Department for purposes of providing technical assistance
in implementing Section 303(j), SSA. (Section 303(j), SSA, requires States to establish and use a system of profiling
all new claimants for regular UC.) The report on the profiling model, Profiling Dislocated Workers for Early Referral
to Reemployment Services by Kelleen Worden (October 6, 1993), is available from the appropriate Regional Office.
If this model is used, States must re-estimate the coefficients using State data.

(B) A statistical model developed by the State.

(C) Another profiling method developed by the State.

Regardless of which option is chosen, the State must demonstrate that its system has a high degree of accuracy for purposes
of meeting the cost-neutrality requirement discussed in item 4.d. For this reason, the State must submit with its
plan a baseline analysis of historical data indicating the extent to which the exhaustion rate of individuals identified
by the proposed system exceeds the exhaustion rate of the population of all beneficiaries under the regular UC program.
The determination of whether the system is sufficiently accurate will be made by the Department.

(2) Assurances that the annual report will be submitted as required and contain such information as required by this
UIPL.

(3) A description of participation requirements including:

(A) The structured set of services provided to individuals in the SEA program. The description must address the working
relationship of the State agency with any entity (such as a State economic development agency or an agency administering
the Job Training Partnership Act) providing services under the SEA program.

(B) A description of what actions (such as certification procedures) the States will take to assure SEA participants
are engaged ``on a full-time basis'' in self-employment activities.

(4) Legislative language implementing the SEA program consistent with the requirements of this UIPL. (Draft language
is provided in Attachment II and a Commentary in Attachment III.)

(5) A description of the source (and amount of) funds for paying for SEA program activities such as entrepreneurial
training, business counseling, and technical assistance, and assurances that Title III, SSA, funds will not be used
for these activities.

(6) Assurances that the payment of SEA allowances will not create any additional benefit costs to the UTF.

Since no State may commence operation of a SEA program without approval of a plan by the Department, States may expedite
implementation of the SEA program by submitting their plans prior to obtaining legislation. Although the Department
may provide provisional approval of a plan prior to enactment, it will not approve any plan until certified copies
of SEA legislation are provided by the State. Any modifications to an approved plan are to be submitted to the Department.

Proposed plans and modifications to approved plans are to be submitted to the appropriate Regional Office.

k. 

Counting of SEA Claims for EB Trigger Purposes. 

SEA claimants are to be included in the calculation of the insured unemployment rate (IUR) for purposes of determining
whether EB is payable in a State.

Reporting Requirements. 

Any changes required in reporting to the Department will be addressed in future issuances.

m. 

Effective Date and Termination Date of SEA Programs. 

Under Section 507(e), NAFTA, the provisions of Federal law relating to SEA programs are effective on the date of enactment
of NAFTA. In addition, these provisions provide only temporary exceptions to the withdrawal standard. The authority
to operate SEA programs expires five years after the date of enactment of NAFTA. Since NAFTA was enacted on December
8, 1993, the SEA program provisions were effective on that date and expire on December 8, 1998.

5. 

Action Required. 

The establishment of SEA programs is optional for States. However, States must enact enabling legislation and obtain
this Department's approval of a plan prior to implementing a SEA program.

6. 

Inquiries. 

Inquiries should be directed to the appropriate Regional Office.

Draft Language to Implement a Self-Employment Assistance Program



States wishing to amend their UC law to add the optional SEA program provisions may use the following draft language.
A Commentary is provided in Attachment III.

Section 

XXXX

. Self-Employment Assistance Program

(a) 

Definitions. 

As used in this section_

(1) ``Self-employment assistance activities'' means activities (including entrepreneurial training, business
counseling, and technical assistance) approved by the commissioner in which an individual identified through a
worker profiling system as likely to exhaust regular benefits participates for the purpose of establishing a business
and becoming self-employed.

Attachment III to UIPL 94-



Commentary on the Draft Language to Implement a Self-Employment Assistance Program



This commentary should be used in conjunction with Section 4 of this UIPL.

States will need to make adjustments in the draft language to accommodate State law conventions. Blanks have been
provided for inserting cites to relevant sections of the State law.

(a) 

Definitions.

(1) Self-employment assistance activities.

 These activities are defined consistent with section 3306(t)(3)(C) and (D), FUTA. States should note that the approval
of the State agency is limited to the self-employment ``activities'' themselves. States may not base a denial of approval
on factors unrelated to the self-employment assistance activities.

(2) 

Self-employment assistance allowance.

 This section defines the SEA allowance and establishes that such allowances are to be paid from the State's unemployment
fund. States may also wish to consider whether to amend the section of State law which governs withdrawals from the
unemployment fund.

(3) 

Regular Benefits.

 A definition of ``regular benefits'' (or ``regular compensation'') is necessary since SEA allowances are payable
``in lieu of'' regular compensation. State law may already contain a definition of regular benefits in which case
the addition of this definition may not be necessary. Some State laws contain a definition of regular benefits in the
sections pertaining to EB. In these cases, the State will need to determine whether the definition is limited to the
EB section, and, therefore, whether a cross-reference is necessary.

(4) 

Full-time basis.

 Since the Department is not at this time providing a specific definition of ``full-time basis,'' it is recommended
that States reserve the right to prescribe the definition in regulations in order to assure consistency with Federal
law.

(b) 

Amount of self-employment assistance allowance.

 This section governs the weekly and maximum amount of SEA allowance payable. It assures that SEA allowances are paid
``in the same amount'' as regular UC. It also clarifies the relationship between payments of regular UC and SEA allowances
with respect to a benefit year.

(c) 

Eligibility for self-employment assistance allowance.

 This section contains the ``equal treatment'' requirement of Section 3306(t)(2), FUTA (except for the requirement
that SEA allowances be paid ``in the same amount'' which is contained in subsection (b) above). It also contains the
three exceptions to the ``equal treatment'' requirement which are found in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of section
3306(t)(2), FUTA.

By cross referencing the definition of ``self-employment assistance activities,'' this provision should assure
payment only to those participating in such activities. It also contains the requirement of section 3306(t)(3) (D)
that the individual be actively engaged in a full-time basis in activities relating to the establishment of a business
and becoming self-employed.

States are free to establish their own disqualifications for failure to meet these requirements. States should note
that, like unavailability for work, failure to participate may be only a temporary condition which should not necessarily
result in an indefinite denial. Conversely, quitting the SEA program may be grounds for a duration disqualification.
The draft language provides for a disqualification only for the week the failure occurred.

States also have the option of dropping an individual from the SEA program for failure to meet SEA requirements. This
may be appropriate if, for example, the individual misses training necessary to commence self-employment activities.

(d) 

Limitation on receipt of self-employment assistance allowances.

 This section implements section 3306(t)(4), FUTA, which limits the number of individuals receiving SEA allowances
at any given time to 5 percent of the number of individuals receiving regular UC. Giving the commissioner authority
to create regulations to meet this requirement provides flexibility to the agency to assure that necessary data will
be collected as required by this Department and that the five percent limit will not be exceeded.

(e) 

Financing costs of SEA allowances.

 Since State UC law may provide only for the financing of regular UC and not SEA allowances, it may be necessary to describe
the financing mechanism for the allowances. The draft language uses the same mechanism as is used for regular UC.

Draft language for the noncharging of SEA allowances is not provided at this time as the Department is not addressing
the issue of whether such allowances may be noncharged at this time.

(f) 

Effective Date and Termination Date.

 Since SEA allowances may be paid only after enactment of State law and approval by this Department, it will be necessary
to specify that the allowances will not become payable until both conditions are met. The draft language assures that
SEA allowances will not become payable until the first week aster both conditions are met.

Since the authority under NAFTA for SEA programs terminates five years after the date of enactment of NAFTA, it is recommended
that States ``sunset'' any SEA provisions. The draft language provided does not provide a definite expiration date
since States may wish to continue operating a SEA program if the Federal authority is extended either on a temporary
or permanent basis. States may, however, wish to include a specific expiration date. The draft language takes into
account an expiration of Federal legislative authority which falls on a weekday by providing that the program will
terminate as of the end of the week preceding the week containing the ending date of the Federal authority. If, however,
the ending date of the Federal authority as a Saturday, then the State must end its SEA program on later than midnight
on such Saturday.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Power Authority of the State of New York; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix R, ``Fire Protection Program for Nuclear Power Facilities Operating Prior To January 1,
1979,'' section III.G.2, to the Power Authority of the State of New York the (licensee) for the Indian Point Nuclear
Generating Unit No. 3 (IP3), located at the licensee's site in Westchester County, New York.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



Section III.G.2 of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix R, specifies measures to be taken to ensure that one train of redundant equipment
necessary to achieve and maintain hot shutdown conditions remains free of fire damage.

During a programmatic review of IP3's Fire Protection Program and Appendix R compliance strategy, the licensee identified
that safe shutdown instrument sensing lines inside containment do not meet the separation requirements of section
III.G.2 of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix R. Specifically, in some areas the wide-range steam generator (SG) water level
and pressurizer level sensing lines are not separated by a horizontal distance of 20 feet, nor are they separated by
a radiant energy shield. In addition, fire detection and suppression in the area is limited. The licensee has, therefore,
requested exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix R, section III.G.2, for the wide-range SG water
level and pressurizer level sensing lines within the IP3 containment structure.



Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed exemption is needed to permit the licensee to operate the plant without being in violation of the Commission's
regulations and to obviate the need for extensive modifications. Physical modification of the plant to achieve literal
compliance with 10 CFR part 50, Appendix R, section III.G.2, would require many design changes, for example: rerouting
portions of the sensing lines, installing additional barriers, and the installation of additional fire suppression
and detection. Given the location of the sensing lines, the implementation of these changes would entail extensive
scaffolding, as well as engineering and financial resources. In addition, since these modifications were not anticipated
in the current outage scope, the detailed development and implementation of such design changes could significantly
delay restart from the current outage, resulting in lost revenue.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



Section III.G.2 of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix R, requires that where redundant trains of systems necessary to achieve
and maintain hot shutdown conditions are located within the same fire area inside containment, fire protection must
be provided by separation of cables and equipment by a horizontal distance of 20 feet, noncombustible radiant energy
shields, or by installation of fire detectors and an automatic fire suppression system in the fire area. The licensee
has determined that certain sections of the wide-range SG water level and pressurizer level sensing lines within
containment do not meet these requirements. Therefore, the licensee has requested an exemption from the requirement
of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix R, section III.G.2, for these sensing lines within the containment.

The likely result of a fire affecting the sensing lines would be erroneous signals. The erroneous signals would not
initiate until the fluid inside the lines is heated by the fire and would terminate after the fire was extinguished.
The lines themselves would not experience fire damage.

The capability to safely shutdown the unit would not be jeopardized in the event that a fire results in erroneous wide-range
SG water level or pressurizer level indications. Specifically, a fire inside containment would not necessitate
control room evacuation (i.e., alternate shutdown), so operations personnel would have access to numerous and diverse
plant status indications. In addition, plant operating procedures advise personnel that a fire may cause anomalous
equipment behavior. Erroneous wide-range SG water level or pressurizer level indications resulting from a fire
would be of short duration due to low combustion loadings inside containment. The fixed combustible loading in containment
is very small and the locations of the redundant sensing lines are remote from fixed combustibles. The largest fixed
combustible load, reactor coolant pump oil, is contained in a collection system in accordance with 10 CFR part 50,
Appendix R, section III.O, and automatic smoke detectors are installed above each reactor coolant pump. Personnel
access to the containment is restricted during power operation. As such, the potential for transient combustible
materials to accumulate in the containment is very low. The containment is inspected by operations personnel prior
to plant startup.

Based on the considerations discussed above, the Commission concludes that granting the proposed exemption will
not increase the probability of an accident and will not result in any post-accident radiological releases significantly
in excess of those previously determined for IP3. The proposed exemption would not otherwise affect radiological
plant effluents, nor result in any significant occupational exposure. In addition, the exemption does not affect
nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. 
Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological or nonradiological environmental
impacts associated with the proposed exemption.


Alternatives to the Proposed Action


As an alternative to the proposed action, the Commission considered denial of the proposed action. Denial of the application
would result in no change in current environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of the proposed action and
the alternative action are similar. The alternative would also result in unwarranted expenditures of engineering
and financial resources, and could significantly delay restart from the current outage.


Alternate Use of Resources


This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the ``Final Environmental Statement
for the Indian Point Nuclear Generating Station Unit No. 3,'' dated February 1975.


Agencies and Persons Consulted


The Commission consulted with the State of New York regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.


Finding of No Significant Impact


The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed license amendment.
Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for exemption dated November 30, 1993. This document
is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW.,
Washington, DC 20555, and at the White Plains Public Library, 100 Martine Avenue, White Plains, New York.

<DOCTITLE>Tennessee Valley Authority; Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Unit 2; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant
Impact</DOCTITLE>




The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of a one-time schedular exemption
from the requirements of sections III.D.2(a) and III.D.3 of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 to the Tennessee Valley Authority,
licensee for the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN), Unit 2. The plant is located at the licensee's site in Hamilton County,
Tennessee. The exemption was requested by the licensee in its letter dated February 4, 1994.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



The action would exempt the licensee from the provisions in sections III.D.2(a) and III.D.3 of appendix J to 10 CFR
part 50 with respect to the requirement to perform Primary Containment Type B and Type C local leak rate tests at intervals
no greater than 2 years. The exemption would affect Unit 2 only and allow the tests to be delayed until the Cycle 6 refueling
outage. This outage is scheduled to start approximately 4 months after the 2-year period ends.

Between March and April 1992, all Type B and Type C local leak rate tests were preformed during the SQN Unit 2 Cycle 5 refueling
outage. Between March 1, 1993, and October 19, 1993, Unit 2 was shut down due to a steam leak in the secondary system,
and experienced several forced shutdowns since it was restarted. Due to the accumulated length of the shutdowns,
TVA has decided to delay start of the Unit 2 Cycle 6 refueling outage until July 1994. As a result, the expiration of the
2-year time interval for the Type B and Type C tests occurs before the outage starts. Therefore, to perform the tests
in accordance with the requirement would force the unit to shut down in April 1994. To prevent this, the proposed exemption
would allow a one-time deferment of the Appendix J interval requirement from March 1994 until the shutdown in July
1994. The result would be an interval of approximately 4 months since the previous test for any component.

This environmental assessment is similar to an environmental assessment processed by the Commission and forwarded
by letter dated November 9, 1993. It was published in the 

Federal Register 

on November 16, 1993 (58 FR 60470). This action addressed the 10 CFR part 50 appendix J exemption for the Unit 2 refueling
outage when it was scheduled to begin in April 1994.



The Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed action is required to exempt the licensee from the requirement to conduct Type B and Type C containment
local leak rate tests on SQN Unit 2 at a 2-year frequency so that the tests can be performed during the Cycle 6 refueling
outage that is scheduled to start in July 1994.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action




With respect to the requested action, exemption from the above requirement would allow the licensee to delay conducting
Type B and Type C local leak rate tests at Unit 2 approximately 4 months beyond the scheduled expiration date of the 2-year
period. This relatively small increase in the test interval does not significantly contribute to the total Type B
and Type C leakage limits.

The intent of Sections III.D.2(a) and III.D.3 of appendix J is to ensure that containment leakage is maintained within
the prescribed limits. Based on the following information, the exemption will not significantly affect the ability
of the individual primary containment components that are subject to Type B or Type C tests to perform this safety function:

1. The valves and components for which the extension of the 2-year interval is being requested have a history of being
leak tight and in good condition. The leak-tight condition of these components was last verified by Type B and C local
leak rate tests conducted during the Cycle 5 refueling outage in 1992 and, at least for many, by the Type A containment
leak rate test conducted on Unit 2 during the same refueling outage. Based on the present containment leakage that
accounts for the less than 8.0 percent of the 0.6 percent La limit, the remaining margin is sufficient to ensure any
incremental increase in leakage resulting from the extension would not cause unacceptable as-found test results.

2. Based on historical data, any incremental increase in leakage because of the extension will be small. Improved
maintenance practices implemented during the Unit 2 Cycle 5 outage, including motor operated valve testing of containment
isolation valves, periodic replacement of valve packing, and periodic lubrication of valve stems, provide increased
assurance that these components will perform their safety function.

3. Many of the components for which the exemption is requested were included in the Type A test performed in April 1992.
This test indicated a containment leak rate of 0.15 percent per day, which is below the 0.1875 percent per day limit.

<DOCNO> FR940314-2-00115 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940314-2-00060 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

With regard to other potential radiological environmental impacts, the proposed exemption does not increase the
radiological effluents from the facility and does not increase the occupational exposure at the facility. Therefore,
the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological impacts associated with the proposed exemption.


With regard to potential nonradiological environmental impacts, the proposed exemption involves systems located
within the restricted areas as defined in 10 CFR part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has
no other significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption. 

Therefore, the proposed exemption does not significantly change the conclusions in the licensee's ``Final Environmental
Statement Related to the Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2'' (FES), dated February 21, 1974. The Commission
concluded that operation of the Sequoyah units will not result in any environmental impacts other than those evaluated
in the FES and its letter to the licensee dated September 15, 1981, which granted the facility operating license DPR-79
for Unit 2. 



Alternative to the Proposed Action 



Because the staff has concluded that there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed exemption,
any alternative to this exemption will have either no significantly different environmental impact or greater environmental
impact. 

The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. This would not reduce environmental impacts
as a result of plant operations. 



Alternative Use of Resources 



This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in connection with the ``Final Environmental
Statement Related to the Operation of the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2,'' dated February 21, 1974. 



Agencies and Persons Consulted 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's request. The staff did not consult other agencies or persons. 



Finding of No Significant Impact 



The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. 

Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. 

For details with respect to this action, see the licensee's request for an exemption dated February 4, 1994, which
is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW.,
Washington, DC, and at the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Library, 1101 Broad Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402.

<DOCTITLE></DOCTITLE>
Arizona Public Service Co.; Consideration of Transfer of Control of Ownership of Licensee and Opportunity for Public
Comment on Antitrust Issues





Notice is hereby given that the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Commission) is considering approval
under 10 CFR 50.80 of the indirect transfer of control of El Paso Electric Company's (El Paso) interest in Palo Verde
Nuclear Generating Station (PVNGS) Units 1, 2, and 3, (Operating License Nos. NPF-41, NPF-51, and NPF-74)
to a subsidiary of the Central and South West Corporation (CSW). By letter dated January 13, 1994, Arizona Public Service
Company (APS), partial owner and operator and operating agent for PVNGS submitted its request for indirect transfer
and deletion of sale-leaseback provisions, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.80. The request for license amendments to delete
the provisions of certain previous sale-leaseback arrangements relating to Operating License Nos. NPF-51
and NPF-74 will be subject of a separate 

Federal Register

 notice.



Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.80 the Commission may approve the transfer of control of a licensee, after notice to interested
persons, upon the Commission's determination that the new owner is qualified to have control of the license and the
transfer of control is otherwise consistent with applicable provisions of law, regulations and orders of the Commission.



By this notice the Commission is seeking public comment on this proposed transfer of control of ownership. Written
comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory Publications Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publication
Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulation Commission, Washington, DC 20555 and should site the
publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to room P-233, Phillips Buildings, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda,
Maryland between 7:30 a.m. and 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room,
the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555.



Antitrust Issues





Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.101 of the Commission's regulations, the staff is publishing receipt of APS's request to transfer
the above described control of ownership of PVNGS.



Any person who wishes to submit comments or information relating to antitrust issues believed to be raised by this
transfer request should submit said comments or information within 30 days of the initial publication of this notice
in the 

Federal Register

 to the U.S. Nuclear Regulation Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Chief, Inspection and Licensing Policy
Branch, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. The Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation will issue
a finding whether significant changes in the licensees' activities have occurred since the completion of the previous
antitrust review.



Although the staff is providing the opportunity for comments concerning the competitive aspects of the proposed
transfer, the staff notes that it is aware of and is closely following a proceeding at the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) involving CSW's proposed acquisition of El Paso. The NRC will consider the FERC proceeding to the
maximum extent possible in resolving issues brought before the NRC.



For further details with respect to the subject transfer, see the request for transfer of control dated January 13,
1994, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Self-Regulatory Organizations: Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., Relating
to Trade Recording and Price Reporting 


March 8, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on January 22, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I,
II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


Currently, Interpretation and Policy .01 to CBOE rule 6.51, ``Reporting Duties,'' requires both the buyer and the
seller in a transaction to record on a card or ticket information concerning the transaction, including the buyer's
or seller's assigned broker initial code and his clearing firm (if a market maker), the symbol of the underlying security,
the type, expiration month and exercise price of the option contract, the transaction price, the number of contract
units comprising the transaction, the time of the transaction, the name of the contra clearing firm member and the
assigned broker initial code of the contra member. Under Interpretation and Policy .01, this information constitutes
the ``transaction record.'' The CBOE proposes to amend Interpretation and Policy .01 to allow members to submit options
transaction data to the Exchange for trade recording and price reporting purposes in various media in addition to
paper form. 
The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission. 


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


The CBOE states that the purpose of the proposal is to enable CBOE members to submit options transaction data to the
CBOE for trade recording and price reporting purposes in various media in addition to paper form. Under current CBOE
rule 6.51, members are required to submit transaction data in paper form only, either on a trade ticket or on a transaction
card. The CBOE states that in today's market and operations technology environment the limitation is unduly restrictive,
and some Exchange members have requested the opportunity to submit transaction record data by means of electronic
data transmission. Submission in that form would enable those members to report trades and prices to the CBOE through
the same automated medium they use to report that information to their clearing firms. Accordingly, the CBOE seeks
authority to approve particular media in addition to paper that CBOE members may use for trade recording and price
reporting purposes. 
In administering the proposed rule change, the CBOE will from time to time identity particular media and formats acceptable
for use under Exchange Rule 6.51 based on members' needs and will inform members about acceptable media and formats
through appropriate circulars. The CBOE expects to identify as acceptable only those media that involve secure and
tested technology. 
The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and with section
6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to facilitate cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in
the clearance and settlement of securities transactions, consistent with the protection of investors and the public
interest. 


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 


The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition. 


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others 


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. 


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action

<DOCTITLE>The Registration as a Clearing Agency of the Participants Trust Co., Order Granting Approval of Registration Until
March 31, 1995</DOCTITLE>


On January 26, 1994, the Participants Trust Company (``PTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 an amendment to its Form CA-1
 requesting that the Commission extend PTC's registration as a clearing agency until March 31, 1995. Notice of PTC's
amended application and request for extension of temporary registration appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on February 15, 1994.
 No comments were received. This order approves PTC's amendment by extending PTC's registration as a clearing agency
until March 31, 1995.






On March 28, 1989, the Commission granted PTC temporary registration as a clearing agency pursuant to sections 17A
and 19(a) of the Act, and rule 17Ab2-1 thereunder for a period of twelve months.
 Subsequently, the Commission issued orders that extended PTC's temporary registration as a clearing agency, the
last of which extended PTC's registration until March 31, 1994.






As discussed in detail in the initial order granting PTC's temporary registration,
 one of the primary reasons for PTC's registration was to develop depository facilities for mortgage-backed securities,
particularly securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (``GNMA''). PTC services
include certificate safekeeping, book entry deliveries, an automated facility for the pledge or segregation of
securities, and other services related to the immobilization of securities certificates.




PTC continues to make significant progress in the areas of financial performance, regulatory commitments, and operational
capabilities. The par value of GNMA securities on deposit grew from $706 billion on December 31, 1992 to $850 billion
on December 31, 1993.
 The par value of VA REMICs on deposit at PTC grew from $1.608 billion on December 31, 1992 to $4.634 billion on December
31, 1993.
 The average transaction volume grew from 250,000 in 1992 to 309,000 in 1993.

PTC continued its efforts over the past year to implement operational and procedural changes in connection with PTC's
temporary registration.
 For example, PTC acquired rights to the SPEED source code, thereby facilitating the process of enhancing the SPEED
system to suit PTC's needs. PTC also initiated a program to distribute to participants a portion of GNMA I principal
and interest (``P&I'') earlier in the day,
 and in December 1993, introduced a new P&I processing system, PRISM, that further automates P&I data processing.
PTC was able to reduce its fees to participants further, effective January 1, 1994,
 and declared a dividend of $.525 per share to stockholders of record on December 31, 1993.









Although PTC has made considerable progress toward complying with the undertakings set out above, PTC needs more
time to implement fully the changes necessary for compliance. Accordingly, PTC has requested that the Commission
extend PTC's registration as a clearing agency until March 31, 1995, to permit PTC to gain experience and stability
as a fully operative depository and to comply fully with the undertakings made in connection with PTC's registration.






The Commission believes that PTC continues to meet the determinations enumerated in section 17A(b)(3). PTC has facilitated
the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of mortgage-backed securities. PTC has functioned as a clearing
agency for the past four years in compliance with the Act.



It is therefore ordered, 

that PTC's temporary registration as a clearing agency be, and hereby is, extended until March 31, 1995, subject to
the terms, undertakings, and conditions specified in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26671.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Intermarket Clearing Corporation; Filing and Order Granting Temporary Approval
on an Accelerated Basis to a Proposed Rule Change Relating to Revisions to the Standards for Letters of Credit Deposited
as Margin </DOCTITLE>
 


March 7, 1994. 
 


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on February 23, 1994, The Intermarket Clearing Corporation (``ICC'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items
have been prepared primarily by ICC. The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments from interested
persons and to grant accelerated approval of the proposed rule change through December 31, 1994. 
 




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 
 


The proposed rule change requests that the Commission extend its temporary approval of ICC's modifications to its
rules setting forth the standards for letters of credit deposited with ICC as a form of margin.
 
 




II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

 


In its filing with the Commission, ICC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. ICC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements. 
 


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

 


The proposed rule change requests that the Commission extend its temporary approval of ICC's modifications to its
rule 502(a)(3), which sets forth the standards for letters of credit deposited with ICC as margin. The modifications
which are the subject of this proposed rule filing are the same modifications which were previously approved by the
Commission.
 
 




First, ICC intends to require that letters of credit state expressly that payment must be made prior to the close of
business on the third banking day following demand. Second, ICC proposes to amend its rules to eliminate the issuer's
right to revoke the letter of credit. Third, unless otherwise permitted by ICC, ICC's proposal requires letters of
credit to expire on a quarterly basis rather than annually. Fourth, ICC proposes to add language to its rules to make
explicit ICC's authority to draw upon a letter of credit at any time, whether or not the clearing member that deposited
the letter of credit has been suspended or is in default, if ICC determines that such a draw is advisable to protect ICC,
other clearing members, or the general public. 
 
Finally, ICC proposes to amend its rules to grant its chairman limited discretion to accept a letter of credit that
varies from the standards set forth in its rules. This discretionary power will be limited by the following factors:
(1) Before using this power, the chairman must consult with the staffs of ICC's regulatory agencies, which include
the Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC''); (2) this power can be used only in unusual
circumstances and only on a temporary basis; (3) after exercising such power, the chairman must advise ICC's board
of directors; and (4) ICC must promptly notify clearing members affected by the exercise of this power.
 ICC believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of section 17A of Act.
 Specifically, ICC believes the proposed rule change promotes the protection of investors by enhancing ICC's ability
to safeguard the securities and funds in its possession or subject to its control.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



ICC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



Comments were not and are not intended to be solicited with respect to the proposed rule change, and none were received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



For the reasons set forth in the previous Commission order approving ICC's revised standards for letters of credit
deposited as margin, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with ICC's obligations under section
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.
 Among other things, the revised standards: (1) Should make the letters of credit ICC will accept as margin deposits
more liquid than under the previous standards and, consequently, should permit ICC to more safely rely upon such letters
of credit; (2) should result in more frequent assessments of the financial conditions of clearing members depositing
letters of credit and thereby should facilitate the discovery of any adverse developments in a more timely manner:
and (3) should make letters of credit a more reliable form of margin deposit than previously because issuers will no
longer be able to revoke letters of credit at times when clearing members most need credit facilities (

e.g.

, when a clearing member is experiencing financial difficulties or during times of market volatility).
 By approving the proposed rule change on a temporary basis through December 31, 1994, ICC, the Commission, and other
interested parties will be able to assess further any effects these revised standards have on letter of credit issuance
and on margin deposited at ICC.
 








ICC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving because
the Commission believes it is desirable that the revised standards that were implemented under the previous temporary
approval order remain in place pending permanent approval.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of ICC. All submissions should refer to the file number SR-ICC-94-04
and should be submitted by April 4, 1994.



V. Conclusion



On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that ICC's proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and in
particular with Section 17A of the Act.



It is therefore ordered

, under section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposal (File No. SR-ICC-94-03) be, and hereby is,
approved through December 31, 1994.




For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. Relating to Assessments and Fees on Members</DOCTITLE>



March 8, 1995.




Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on February 25, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The NASD has designated this proposal as one
establishing or changing a fee under section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act, which renders the rule effective upon the
Commission's receipt of this filing. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change




The NASD is proposing to add new section 45 to the Code of Arbitration Procedure to require that any member named as a
party to an arbitration proceeding shall be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when the Arbitration Department
perfects service of the claim naming the member on any party to the proceeding. Below is the text of the proposed rule
change. Proposed new language is italicized.



Part III. Uniform Code of Arbitration



* * *



Member Surcharge





Sec. 45. (a) Each member who is named as a party to an arbitration proceeding, whether in a Claim, Counterclaim, Crossclaim
or Third-Party claim, shall be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when the Arbitration Department perfects
service of the claim naming the member on any party to the proceeding. For each associated person who is named, the surcharge
shall be assessed against the member or members which employed the associated person at the time of the events which
gave rise to the dispute, claim or controversy. No member shall be assessed more than a single surcharge in any arbitration
proceeding. The surcharge shall not be subject to reimbursement under Subsection 43(c) of the Code.

(B) For the purposes of this Section, service is perfected when the Director of Arbitration properly serves the Respondents
to such proceeding under Subsection 25(a) of the Code.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The NASD is proposing to add new section 45 to the Code of Arbitration Procedure to provide that any member named as a
party to an arbitration proceeding shall be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when the Arbitration Department
perfects service of the claim naming the member on any party to the proceeding. In addition, any firm whose associated
persons are named in an arbitration proceeding will be assessed the surcharge.

Historically, the revenue-to-expense ratio of the NASD's arbitration service has resulted in a deficit, which has
been subsidized by other revenues of the Association. Although the deficit has declined in 1992, the NASD has determined
in a recent review of the arbitration process that the deficit will begin to rise in the immediate future as a result
of significantly increased resourcing needs. The NASD anticipates such needs to be ongoing. The increased resourcing
needs result from a number of factors, including case growth, more selective arbitrator recruitment, increased
arbitrator training, increased arbitrator compensation, and the anticipated overhaul of the arbitration administrative
systems. The NASD determined that the time frame within which to initiate cost recovery for impending resourcing
needs should be the immediate future, and that cost recovery should be directed at those member firms using the NASD's
arbitration service.


Proposed new subsection (a) would require each member who is named as a party to an arbitration proceeding, whether
in a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim or third-party claim, to be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when the
Arbitration Department perfects service of the claim naming the member on any party to the proceeding. This fee would
be in addition to fees assessed pursuant to section 43
 and 44
 of the Code. The fee applies both to members who file as Claimants and to members who are served by the Arbitration Department
as Respondents. Therefore, in claims brought by members, the $200 fee would be assessed in addition to the $500 claim
filing fee described in the current fee schedule. For an associated person who is named as a party to an arbitration
proceeding, the fee would be assessed against the member firm or firms which employed the associated person at the
time of the events which gave rise to the claim. However, no member will be assessed more than a single charge in any arbitration
proceeding. Finally, subsection (a) clarifies that the surcharge is not subject to reimbursement under subsection
43(c) of the Code.

<DOCNO> FR940314-2-00125 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940314-2-00066 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The NASD estimates that it will collect the $200 surcharge on 75 percent of the approximately 5700 arbitration cases
expected to be filed in 1994, which will result in over $800,000 of additional revenue for the Arbitration Department
in 1994. Thus, the surcharge will effectively offset expenses to be incurred on arbitrator education through 1994.
The NASD expects the arbitrator education program to reach over 3,000 new arbitrators and almost 500 chairpersons
during the period that began in the fourth quarter of 1993 and will end at the end of 1994. This will add over $750,000
to the Arbitration Department expenses, which will include costs for staff and travel time, conference rooms, written
materials, videotape production and mailing costs.
The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of section 15A(b)(5)
 of the Act, which require that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues,
fees and other charges among members in that the proposed rule equitably assesses a surcharge on each member that is
named or whose associated person is named and for which service is perfected in an arbitration proceeding and applies
such revenue to additional costs resulting from increased arbitration resourcing needs.




(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


Written comments were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The foregoing rule change has become effective upon filing pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act and subparagraph
(e) of rule 19b-4 thereunder in that it constitutes a due, fee or other charge.
At any time within 60 days of the filing of a rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, the Commission may
summarily abrogate the rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in
the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to SR-NASD-94-11 and should be submitted by April 4, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Options Clearing Corporation; Order Approving Proposed Amendment to the Options
Disclosure Document; Correction</DOCTITLE>


March 8, 1994.


In FR Document No. 94-3250, beginning on page 6661, column 1, for Friday, February 11, 1994, a sentence was incorrectly
stated. The first paragraph should be changed to clarify that the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,
did not participate in the submission of the revised Options Disclosure Document (``ODD'') and to indicate that the
Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') filed the revised ODD on behalf of, rather than in conjunction with, the American
Stock Exchange, Inc., the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the Pacific Stock
Exchange, Inc., and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.
The first paragraph is revised to read as follows:



On February 2, 1994, the Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') on behalf of the American Stock Exchange, Inc., the
Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc., and the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'') submitted amended copies of an options disclosure document (``ODD'')
to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') pursuant to Rule 9b-1
 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'').

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Public Reference
Branch of the SEC.



Applicant's Representations


1. Century Life, a mutual life insurance company organized under the laws of Iowa, entered into a permanent affiliation
with CUNA Mutual Life Insurance Society (``CUNA Mutual'') on July 1, 1990. Applicants state that the terms of the ``Agreement
of Permanent Affiliation'' provide for the following: Financial sharing between Century Life and CUNA Mutual of
future individual life insurance business through reinsurance arrangements; joint development of business plans
and systems for the distribution of individual insurance and other financial service products within the credit
union movement; and, sharing of certain resources and facilities. All of the directors of Century Life are also directors
of CUNA Mutual and many of the senior executive officers of Century Life hold similar positions with CUNA Mutual. Applicants
state that the affiliation is not a merger or a consolidation and that both Century Life and CUNA Mutual remain separately
owned by their respective contract owners who retain voting rights.
2. The Account, established by Century Life on December 14, 1993 as a separate investment account under Iowa law, serves
as a funding medium for certain flexible premium individual deferred variable annuity contracts (the ``Contracts'').
Applicants state that the Account meets the definition of a ``separate account'' under the federal securities laws.
The Account is registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. The application incorporates
by reference the registration statement, currently on file with the Commission (File No. 33-73738), for the
Account.
3. The Account currently has five subaccounts, each of which invests exclusively in the shares of a designated investment
portfolio of the Ultra Series Fund (the ``Fund''). The Fund, a Massachusetts business trust, is registered under
the 1940 Act as an open-end diversified management investment company. The Fund currently has six investment portfolios,
five of which offer their shares to the Account.
4. The Contracts may be purchased on a nontax qualified basis (the ``Nonqualified Contracts'') or they may be purchased
in connection with retirement plans, including retirement programs described in sections 401(a) or 403(b) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ``Code''), or as individual retirement annuities that qualify for
favorable federal income tax treatment under section 409 of the Code (together, the ``Qualified Contracts'').
5. CUNA Brokerage Services, Inc. (``CUNA Brokerage'') acts as the principal underwriter, as defined in the 1940 Act,
of the Contracts pursuant to the terms of an underwriting agreement between Century Life and CUNA Brokerage. The principal
business address of CUNA Brokerage is the same as that of CUNA Mutual.

6. An owner of a Contract may allocate purchase payments to one or more subaccounts of the Account, and the purchase
payments will be credited with the investment experience of the chosen subaccount or subaccounts. An owner of a Contract
may also allocate purchase payments to the guaranteed interest option, part of the general account of Century Life,
and such payments will be credited with interest as provided for in the Contracts.
7. The minimum initial purchase payment for Nonqualified Contracts is $5,000 and for Qualified Contracts, other
than those sold in connection with tax sheltered annuity arrangements (``TSAs''), the amount is $2,000. Subsequent
purchase payments must be at least $1,000 and may be made any time before the annuity date and during the annuitant's
lifetime. Initial and subsequent purchase payments for TSAs must be at least $25, and such payments in each Contract
year must total $300 and be paid pursuant to a schedule.
8. The Contract provides for a series of annuity payments beginning on the annuity date. The Contract owner may select
from four annuity payment options, two of which are available only as a fixed annuity and two of which are available
as either a variable or a fixed annuity.
9. If the owner of a Contract dies prior to the annuity date and the Contract is in force, Century Life will, upon receipt
of due proof of death, pay a death benefit. If the annuitant is age 75 or younger, the death benefit is equal to the greatest
of:



(a) Aggregate purchase payments made under the Contract less partial withdrawals as of the date that Century Life
receives due proof of death; or
(b) Contract value as of the date that Century Life receives due proof of death; or
(c) The death benefit floor amount as of the date of death plus any net purchase payments and minus any partial withdrawals
made since the most recent death benefit floor computation anniversary;



less premium taxes not previously deducted and any outstanding loan amount on the date the death benefit is paid. The
death benefit floor amount is the Contract value on the most recent death benefit floor computation anniversary.
Death benefit floor computation anniversaries occur on the seventh Contract anniversary and each seventh Contract
anniversary thereafter prior to the annuitant's 76th birthday. After the annuitant's 76th birthday, the death benefit
will equal the Contract value less any outstanding loan amount and any applicable premium taxes not previously deducted
as of the date that Century Life receives due proof of the annuitant's death.


10. On each Contract anniversary prior to the annuity date, Century Life deducts from the variable Contract value
an annual fee of $30. Applicants guarantee that this charge will not increase and state that the charge reimburses
Century Life for administrative expenses relating to the Contract. The fee will be deducted from each subaccount
based on the proportion that the value in each such subaccount bears to the total Contract value. After the annuity
date, the annual Contract fee is deducted from variable annuity payments. Applicants represent that this charge
will be deducted in reliance upon Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act and that the charge represents reimbursement only for
administrative costs expected to be incurred over the life of the Contract. Applicants further represent that Century
Life does not anticipate a profit from this charge.
11. Century Life deducts a daily administrative charge equal to an annual effective rate of .15% of the assets of the
Account. The application states that this charge will compensate Century Life for certain expenses incurred in administering
the Contracts. Applicants represent that this charge will be deducted in reliance upon Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act
and that the charge represents reimbursement only for administrative costs expected to be incurred over the life
of the Contract. Applicants further represent that Century Life does not expect to make a profit from this charge.
12. Although no fee is currently charged for transfers, Century Life reserves the right to charge $10 for the 13th and
each subsequent transfer during a Contract year. The transfer fee will be deducted from the subaccount or guarantee
amount from which the transfer is made. Applicants represent that where the fee is imposed, Applicants will rely upon
Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act for the deduction. Applicants state that the transfer fee will represent reimbursement
only for administrative costs expected to be incurred over the life of the Contract. Applicants further represent
that Century Life does not anticipate a profit from this charge.
13. Applicants note that various governmental entities levy a premium tax, currently ranging up to 3.5%, on annuity
contracts, such as the Contracts, issued by insurance companies. The timing of the tax levies varies among taxing
authorities. The application states that if applicable to a Contract, premium taxes will be deducted either: (a)
From purchase payments as received; (b) from Contract value upon withdrawal or surrender; (c) from adjusted Contract
value upon application to an annuity payment option; or (d) upon payment of a death benefit. Applicants note that Century
Life reserves the right to deduct premium taxes at the time such taxes are incurred.

14. A contingent deferred sales charge (the ``Sales Charge'') of up to 7% is imposed on the partial withdrawal or surrender
of purchase payments within seven years of such payments having been made. The Sales Charge is deducted from the Contract
value remaining after withdrawal so that the reduction in Contract value as a result of a withdrawal will be greater
than the withdrawal amount requested. Amounts obtained from imposition of the Sales Charge will be used to cover expenses
relating to the sale of the Contracts, including payment of commissions to registered representatives and other
promotional expenses. Applicants state that Century Life does not anticipate that the Sales Charge will generate
sufficient revenues to pay the cost of distributing the Contracts. If the Sales Charge is insufficient to cover the
cost of distribution, the deficiency will be met from the general account assets of Century Life and these assets may
include amounts derived from the charge for mortality and expense risks.


15. Century Life will impose a daily charge equal to an annual effective rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets of
the Account to compensate Century Life for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection with the Contracts.
Approximately .85% of the 1.25% charge is attributable to mortality risk, and approximately .40% is attributable
to expense risk. Century Life guarantees that this charge will never exceed 1.25%. If the mortality and expense risk
charge is insufficient to cover actual costs and assumed risks under the Contracts, Century Life will bear the loss.
Conversely, if the charge exceeds costs, the excess will be profit to Century Life. Applicants state that Century
Life currently anticipates a profit from this charge.


16. Applicants state that the mortality risk borne by Century Life arises from its contractual obligation to make
annuity payments (as determined in accordance with the Contracts) regardless of how long all annuitants or any individual
annuitant may live. Applicants state that this undertaking assures that neither annuitant's own longevity nor an
improvement in general life expectancy will adversely affect the periodic annuity payments that a payee will receive
under the Contract. Applicants state that Century Life also incurs a risk in connection with the death benefit guarantee
and that there is no charge for this guarantee.


17. Applicants state that the expense risk assumed by Century Life is the risk that administration costs will exceed
amounts received by Century Life through imposition of the administration charge, the transfer fee (where imposed)
and the annual Contract fee.



Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions




1. Applicants request that the Commission, pursuant to section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, grant exemptions from sections
26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act in connection with Applicants' assessment of the daily charge for mortality
and expense risks. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27 (c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in pertinent part, prohibit a registered unit
investment trust and any depositor thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic payment plan certificates
unless the proceeds of all payments (other than sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian
and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not
exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative
services of a character normally performed by the bank itself.


2. Applicants assert that the charge for mortality and expense risks is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed
by Century Life under the Contracts. Applicants state that the charge is a reasonable charge to compensate Century
Life for the risks that: the annuitants under the Contracts will live longer than has been anticipated in setting the
annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts; the Contract value will be less than the death benefit; and administrative
expenses will be greater than amounts derived from the asset-based administration charge, the transfer fee and the
Contract fee.


3. Applicants represent that the charge of 1.25% for the mortality and expense risks assumed by Century Life is within
the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this representation
is based upon Century Life's analysis of publicly available information about similar industry practices, taking
into consideration such factors as: current charge levels; charge level guarantees; and guaranteed annuity rates.
Applicants represent that Century Life will maintain at its administrative offices, available to the Commission,
a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, the
comparative survey.


4. Applicants represent that Century Life has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution
financing arrangement will benefit the Account and the Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth
in a memorandum which will be maintained by Century Life and will be made available to the Commission.


5. Century Life also represents that the Account will invest only in management investment companies which undertake,
in the event such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have such
plan formulated and approved by the company's board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of
such company within the meaning of the 1940 Act.



Conclusion




Applicants assert that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from sections
26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.







For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

2. Series of The One Group currently offer shares in four classes pursuant to exemptive orders previously granted
by the SEC.
 Class A shares of The One Group's series, other than class A shares of money market series, are sold subject to a front-end
sales charge. Class B shares, which are available only with respect to non-money market series, are sold subject to
a CDSC. Retirement class shares are offered to certain investors without any front-end or deferred sales charge.
Fiduciary class shares are offered to certain investors without a front-end or deferred sales charge. Class A, class
B, and the retirement class shares are authorized to pay 440 Distributors distribution and shareholder services
fees pursuant to a



rule 12b-1 plan in annual amounts up to .35%, 1%, and .75% of average daily net assets, respectively.





3. Series of The Kent Funds currently offer two classes of shares pursuant to an exemptive order granted to The Kent
Funds and its current distributor.
 Investment class shares of The Kent Funds' series, other than investment class shares of money market series, are
sold subject to a front-end sales charge. Institutional class shares of the Kent Funds' series are sold without a front-end
or deferred sales charge. Each series of The Kent Funds is authorized to pay 440 Distributors a monthly shareholder
services fee of up to .25% of the series' average daily net assets pursuant to a rule 12b-1 plan.





4. Shares of series of Allmerica Funds, other than money market series, are sold subject to a front-end sales charge.
For purchases of $1,000,000 or more of shares of Allmerica Funds' non-money market series, no front-end sales charge
is imposed but a 1% CDSC is imposed on certain redemptions. The CDSC is assessed in reliance upon an exemptive order
granted by the SEC.
 Under a rule 12b-1 plan, series of Allmerica Funds pay Allmerica a shareholder services fees in the amount of
up to .25% of average daily net assets of the non-money market series, and up to .10% of the average daily net assets of
the money market series.





5. The Valiant Fund offers its series at net asset value without any sales charge. The Valiant Fund has adopted a rule
12b-1 plan, but no payments have been authorized or will be made during the current fiscal year.
6. Applicants seek relief to implement a proposed multiple pricing system (the ``Multiple Pricing System''). Under
applicants' proposal, the non-money market series of the Trusts will provide investors the option of purchasing
shares: (a) with a front-end sales load and in certain circumstances a distribution fee of up to .75% (``Class A shares'');
(b) subject to a CDSC and distribution and shareholder services fees of up to 1% (``Class B shares''); (c) subject to
a CDSC that will normally be lower than the CDSC imposed on Class B shares and a distribution and shareholder services
fees of up to 1% (``Class C shares''); and (d) without a sales charge and either with or without distribution and shareholder
services fees of up to .75% (``Class D shares''). Each of the money market series of the Trusts will provide investors
the option of purchasing shares: (a) without a sales load and subject to a distribution fee of up to .35% (``Class E shares'');
(b) without a sales load and subject to distribution and shareholder services fees of up to .75% (``Class F shares'');
and (c) without sales charges or distribution fees (``Class G''). Each series' rule 12b-1 plan will be amended
as necessary to accommodate the proposed fee arrangements of each class.

7. Existing shares of The One Group correspond to shares authorized under the Multiple Pricing System as follows:
Class A shares of the non-money market series correspond to Class A shares, and class A shares of the money market series
correspond to Class E shares; class B shares correspond to Class B shares; retirement class shares of the non-money
market series correspond to Class D shares, and retirement class shares of the money market series correspond to Class
F shares; fiduciary class shares of the non-money market series correspond to Class D shares, and fiduciary class
shares of the money market series correspond to Class G shares. Existing shares of The Kent Fund correspond to shares
authorized under the Multiple Pricing System as follows: investment class shares of the non-money market series
correspond to Class A shares, and investment class shares of the money market series correspond to Class E shares;
institutional class shares of the non-money market series correspond to Class D shares, and institutional class
shares of the money market series correspond to Class F shares. Shares of Allmerica Funds' existing non-money market
series will be redesignated Class A, and shares of the existing money market series will be redesignated Class E.
8. From time to time each Trust also may offer additional classes of shares. Certain of these additional classes (``Indirect
Investor Classes'') will be offered only to Qualified Institutional Investors (as defined herein). All classes
of shares other than the Indirect Investor Classes, including Classes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, will be referred to herein
as ``Direct Investor Classes.'' Qualified Institutional Investors eligible to purchase Indirect Investor Classes
are limited to the following five categories: (a) benefit plans such as qualified retirement plans, other than individual
retirement accounts and retirement plans of self-employed persons, with total assets in excess of $5 million or such
other amounts as the Trusts may establish and with such other characteristics as the Trusts may establish; (b) defined
contribution retirement plans maintained by the Advisers or their affiliates for the benefit of their employees;
(c) banks and insurance companies purchasing shares for their own accounts; (d) registered investment companies
not affiliated with 440 Financial or with any of the Advisers; and (e) endowment funds of non-profit organizations.
9. The benefit plans in category (a) will have a separate trustee for the plan who is vested with investment discretion
as to plan assets. The plan beneficiaries will have limited ability to access their plan investments without incurring
adverse tax consequences. Applicants will exclude self-directed plans from this category. The assets of the tax-exempt
retirement plans in category (b) will be held in trust by a trustee, and the employees who participate in such plans
will have limited pre-retirement access to their plan investments. The investors in categories (c), (d), and (e)
will share with category (a) the essential features of substantial assets under management and investment decision-making
by institutional management. Investors in the Direct Investor Classes will not be eligible to purchase shares of
the Indirect Investor Classes.
10. Applicants propose to convert Class B shares, other than Class B shares acquired through the reinvestment of dividends
and distributions, automatically to Class A shares a certain number of years after the end of the calendar month in
which the shareholders' order to purchase was accepted. Shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends
and distributions will be considered held in a separate sub-account, and each time any Class B shares convert to Class
A shares, a 

pro rata 

portion of the Class B shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends or distributions also will convert.
The purpose of the conversion feature is to relieve the holders of the Class B shares from continuing to pay a high ongoing
distribution fee after the Class B shares have been outstanding long enough for the Distributor to have recouped its
distribution expenses.
11. Shares of one class of a series generally may be exchanged for a corresponding class of another series belonging
to the same ``family of funds'' (as defined in rule 11a-3). Each Trust is a separate family of funds. Exchanges
will not be permitted between Direct Investor Classes of shares and Indirect Investor Classes of shares.
12. Applicants seek exemptive relief to permit them to impose a CDSC on redemptions of shares of Classes B and C. In no
event would the aggregate amount of the Class B CDSC exceed 6% of the aggregate purchase payments made by an investor
for Class B shares of a series. The CDSC for the Class C shares of a series will not exceed 1% of the aggregate purchase
payments. The CDSC will be calculated as the lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the net
asset value of the shares at the time of purchase or redemption. In determining the applicability and rate of any CDSC,
it will be assumed that a redemption is made first of shares representing capital appreciation, next of shares representing
reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions, and finally of other shares held by the shareholder for
the longest period of time.

13. The Trusts intend to waive the CDSC in the event of one or more of the following occurrences: (a) on redemptions following
the death or disability, as defined in section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code or 1986, as amended (the ``Code''),
of a shareholder if redemption is made within one year of death or disability of a shareholder, as relevant; (b) in connection
with a lump-sum or other distribution following retirement or, in the case of an IRA or Keough Plan or a custodial account
pursuant to section 403(b)(7) of the Code, after attaining age 591/2 or, in connection with redemptions which result
from a tax-free return of an excess contribution pursuant to section 408(d) (4) or (5) of the Code or from the death or
disability of the employee; (c) in connection with redemptions of shares purchased by officers, directors or trustees,
and employees of the series, the Advisers and their affiliated entities the Distributors and their affiliated entities,
and by the members of the immediate families of such persons; (d) in connection with redemptions of shares made pursuant
to a shareholder's participation in any systematic withdrawal plan adopted by a series; (e) in connection with redemptions
effected by advisory accounts managed by the Advisers and their affiliated entities; (f) in connection with redemptions
by tax-exempt employee benefit plans as a result of the enactment or promulgation of any law or regulation pursuant
to which continuation of the investment in the series would be improper; and (g) in connection with redemptions effected
by a registered investment company in connection with the combination of the investment company with a series by merger,
acquisition of assets, or by any other transaction. In addition, the Trusts intend to reduce the CDSC in connection
with redemptions by large accountholders.
14. Each series may provide a 

pro rata

 credit for any CDSC paid in connection with a redemption of shares from a series followed by a reinvestment in the series
effected within 365 days, or a shorter period, of the redemption. The credit will be paid for by the series' distributor.


Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Applicants request an order exempting them from the provisions of sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) to the extent
that the proposed issuance and sale of various classes of shares representing interests in the same Trust might be
deemed: (a) to result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g); (b) prohibited by section 18(f)(1);
and (c) to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i).
2. Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement will better enable the Trusts to meet the competitive
demands of today's financial services industry. Under the multiclass arrangement, an investor will be able to choose
the method of purchasing shares that is most beneficial given the amount of his or her purchase, the length of time the
investor expects to hold his or her shares, and other relevant circumstances. The proposed arrangement would permit
the Trusts to facilitate both the distribution of their securities and provide investors with a broader choice as
to the method of purchasing shares without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs or unnecessary investment
risks.
3. The proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights relating to the rule 12b-1 plans in the manner described
is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. In addition, such arrangements should
not give rise to any conflicts of interest because the rights and privileges of each class of shares are substantially
identical.
4. Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement does not present the concerns that section 18 was
designed to address. The multi-class arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the shares of the
Trusts. The multi-class arrangement does not involve borrowing, nor will it affect the Trust's existing assets or
reserves, and does not involve a complex capital structure. Nothing in the multi-class arrangement suggests that
it will facilitate control by holders of any class of shares.
5. Applicants submit that the requested exemption to permit the Trusts to implement the proposed CDSCs is appropriate
in the public interest, consistent with the protection of investors, and consistent with the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the Act. The proposed CDSC arrangements will provide shareholders the option of having
their full payment invested for them at the time of their purchase of shares of the Trusts with no deduction of an initial
sales charge.


Applicants' Conditions


Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:

<DOCNO> FR940314-2-00134 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940314-2-00069 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a series and be identical in
all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among various classes of shares of the same series will
relate solely to: (a) the method of financing certain expenses that may be imposed upon a particular class of shares
and which are limited to (i) incremental transfer agent fees identified by the transfer agent as being attributable
to a specific class of shares, (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials
such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders of a specific class of shares, (iii)
blue sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares,
(v) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class,
(vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to one class of shares, (vii) trustees' fees incurred as a
result of issues relating to one class of shares, and (viii) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified
that should be properly allocated to one class of shares which shall be approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order,
(collectively, ``Class Expenses''); (b) the impact of different rule 12b-1 plan (if any) or shareholder services
plan (if any) payments made by a particular class of shares; (c) voting rights on matters which pertain to rule 12b-1
plans or shareholder services plans; (d) the conversion feature applicable to classes of shares sold subject to a
CDSC which are convertible into a class of shares not subject to a CDSC; and (e) the designation of each class of shares
of a series. 
 
2. If a series implements any amendment to its rule 12b-1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b-1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by a class of shares under the plan into which another class will convert (the ``Target Class''), existing
shares of the class that will convert (``Purchase Class'') will stop converting into Target Class shares unless the
Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The trustees shall take such action
as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares
(``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation
of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares. If deemed
advisable by the trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase
Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material
respects except that New Purchase Class shares will convert into New Target Class shares. New Target Class or New Purchase
Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall
be effected in any manner that the trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance
with condition 6 below, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class
or New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the Advisers and the Distributors. Purchase Class shares sold after
the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided
that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are
disclosed in an effective registration statement. 
 
3. Any class of shares with a conversion feature will convert into another class of shares on the basis of the relative
net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion,
the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined
in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based
sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion.

4. The trustees of each of the Trusts, including a majority of the independent trustees, shall have approved the Multiple
Pricing System, prior to the implementation of the Multiple Pricing System by a particular series. The minutes of
the meetings of the trustees regarding their deliberations with respect to the approvals necessary to implement
the Multiple Pricing System will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the Multiple Pricing System is
in the best interest of both the series and their respective shareholders.


5. The initial determination of the Class Expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class of a series
and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the trustees, including a majority of
the independent trustees. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable
by a series to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the trustees, and the trustees shall review, at least quarterly,
a written report of the amounts so expended and the purpose for which such expenditures were made.


6. On an ongoing basis, the trustees, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will
monitor each series for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares.
The trustees, including a majority of the independent trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Advisers and the Distributors will be responsible for reporting
any potential or existing conflicts to the trustees. If a conflict arises, the Advisers and the Distributors at their
own costs will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company.


7. The trustees will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder servicing
expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the
statements, only distribution expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a class of shares will
be used to support any rule 12b-1 plan or shareholder services plan expenditures charged to such class. Expenditures
not related to the sale or servicing of a specific class will not be presented to the trustees to support rule 12b-1
plan or shareholder services plan expenditures charged to shareholders of such class of shares. The statements,
including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent
trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.


8. If any class will be subject to a shareholder services plan, such shareholder services plan will be adopted and operated
in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b-1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder
were subject to rule 12b-1, except that shareholders will not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b-1.


9. Dividends paid by a series with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that expenditures associated
with any rule 12b-1 plan or shareholder services plan and any Class Expense will be borne by the affected class.


10. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of income and expenses among such classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'').
The Expert has rendered a report to the applicants (and such report has been filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the application),
stating that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will
be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor
the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and based upon such review, will render at least
annually a report to the Trusts that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert
shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act.
The work papers of the Experts with respect to such reports, following request by the Trusts (which the Trusts agree
to make), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written request for such work papers by a senior
member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the SEC, limited to the Director, an Associate
Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, any Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrator
or Associate and Assistant Administrator. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures
placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and
tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time
to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.


11. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for
calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions among the various classes of shares and the proper allocation
of income and expenses among such classes of shares and this representation will be concurred with by the Expert in
the initial report referred to in condition 10 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute
Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 10 above. The applicants
agree to take immediate corrective action if the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur in the
ongoing reports.


12. The prospectuses of the series relating to each class of shares will contain a statement to the effect that financial
institutions, groups, and any other person entitled to receive any compensation for selling series shares may receive
different levels of compensation for selling one particular class of shares over another in a series.

13. The series' Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when shares of a particular class may appropriately
be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares to agree to conform to these standards.
Applicants' compliance standards will require the investors eligible to purchase an Indirect Investor Class of
shares of a non-money series offering such shares to invest in the Indirect Investor Class of shares, rather than the
Direct Investor Classes of shares of such non-money market series. Applicants' compliance standards will also require
all investors eligible to purchase an Indirect Investor Class of shares of a money market series offering such shares,
to invest in an Indirect Investor Class of shares of such money market series. 

 14. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the trustees
with respect to the Multiple Pricing System will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the trustees.


 15. Each Trust will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, service fees,
initial sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privilege applicable to each Director Investor Class of
shares in every prospectus offering any Direct Investor Classes of shares. Each Trust will disclose the respective
expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, service fees, initial sales loads, deferred sales loads,
and exchange privileges, if any, applicable to each Indirect Investor Class of shares in every prospectus offering
Indirect Investor Classes of shares. The Indirect Investor Classes will be offered solely pursuant to separate prospectus(es).
The prospectus(es) for the Indirect Investor Classes will disclose the existence of the Trust's Direct Investor
Classes and will identify the entities eligible to purchase such shares, and the prospectuses for the Trust's Direct
Investor Classes will disclose the existence of the Indirect Investor Classes and will identify the persons eligible
to purchase shares of such classes. Each Trust will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable
to all classes in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities
and statement of operations, information related to the trust as a whole generally, and not on a per class basis. Each
Trust's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Trust.
To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any
Direct Investor Class of shares, it will also disclose the expenses and/or performance data applicable to all Direct
Investor Classes of shares. Advertising materials reflecting the expenses or performance data for the Indirect
Investor Classes will be available only to Qualified Institutional Investors eligible to purchase such Indirect
Investor Classes and to the extent any such advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance
data applicable to any one Indirect Investor Class of shares, it will also disclose the expenses or performance data
applicable to all Indirect Investor Classes of shares. The information provided by applicants for publication in
any newspaper or similar listing of the Trusts' asset values and public offering prices for Direct Investor Classes
of shares will present each class of shares, except the Indirect Investor Classes, separately. 

 16. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply SEC
approval, authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Trust may make pursuant to
a rule 12b-1 distribution plans or shareholder services plans in reliance on the exemptive order. 

 17. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed Rule 6c-10 under the Act, Investment Company Act
Release No. 16169 (Nov. 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 



Under section 4672(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an importer or exporter of any substance may request that the Secretary
determine whether such substance should be listed as a taxable substance. The Secretary shall add such substance
to the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines that taxable chemicals constitute
more than 50 percent of the weight, or more than 50 percent of the value, of the materials used to produce such substance.
This determination is to be made on the basis of the predominant method of production. Notice 89-61, 1989-1
C.B. 717, sets forth the rules relating to the determination process. 


Determination 


On March 5, 1990, the Secretary determined that bisphenol-A and alpha-methylstyrene should be added to the list of
taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, effective July 1, 1990. 
The rate of tax prescribed for bisphenol-A, under section 4671(b)(3), is $5.11 per ton. This is based upon a conversion
factor for benzene of 0.68 and a conversion factor for propylene of 0.37. 
The rate of tax prescribed for alpha-methylstyrene, under section 4671(b)(3), is $4.96 per ton. This is based upon
a conversion factor for benzene of 0.66 and a conversion factor for propylene of 0.36. 
The petitioner is Aristech Chemical Corporation, a manufacturer and exporter of these substances. No material comments
were received on these petitions. The following information is the basis for the determinations.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the acceptance, under Notice 89-61, 1989-1 C.B. 717, of petitions requesting that
di-n-hexyl adipate, ortho-dichlorobenzene and para-dichlorobenzene be added to the list of taxable 
substances in section 4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Publication of this notice is in compliance with Notice
89-61. This is not a determination that the list of taxable substances should be modified. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The petitions were received on December 27, 1989. The petitioner is Monsanto Company, a manufacturer and exporter
of these substances. The following is a summary of the information contained in the petitions. The complete petitions
are available in the Internal Revenue 
Service Freedom of Information Reading Room. 




Di-n-hexyl adipate 


HTS number: 2917.39.20.00 
CAS number: 110-33-8





This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals ethylene, methane, benzene, and nitric acid. Di-n-hexyl adipate
is a liquid produced predominantly by reaction of n-hexyl alcohol with adipic acid in the presence of a catalyst. n-hexyl
alcohol is produced from aluminum, natural gas (via hydrogen), and ethylene (via triethylaluminum). Oxidation
of the intermediate mixed trialkylaluminum with air produces a mixed aluminum alkoxide, which is hydrolyzed to produce
a mixture of alcohols, from which n-hexyl alcohol is 
recovered by distillation. Adipic acid is produced from benzene (via cyclohexane) and the methane in natural gas
(via hydrogen). Oxidation of cyclohexane using air and nitric acid in a two-step process produces adipic acid. 


The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is:

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces a determination, under Notice 
89-61, that the list of taxable substances in section 
4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code will be modified to 
include perchloroethylene. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Under section 4672(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an 
importer or exporter of any substance may request that the 
Secretary determine whether such substance should be listed 
as a taxable substance. The Secretary shall add such 
substance to the list of taxable substances in section 
4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines that taxable chemicals 
constitute more than 50 percent of the weight, or more than 
50 percent of the value, of the materials used to produce 
such substance. This determination is to be made on the 
basis of the predominant method of production. Notice 89-61, 
1989-1 C.B. 717, sets forth the rules relating to the 
determination process. 



Determination 



On March 5, 1990, the Secretary determined that 
perchloroethylene should be added to the list of taxable 
substances in section 4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue 
Code, effective July 1, 1990. 

The rate of tax prescribed for perchloroethylene under 
section 4671(b)(3), is $5.44 per ton. This is based upon a 
conversion factor for ethylene of 0.17 and a conversion 
factor for chlorine of 1.71. 

The petitioner is Vulcan Chemicals, a manufacturer and 
exporter of this substance. No material comments were 
received on this petition. The following information is the 
basis for the determination. 



Perchloroethylene 



HTS number: 2903.23.00.00 
CAS number: 127-18-4 




Perchloroethylene is derived from the taxable chemicals 
ethylene and chlorine. Perchloroethylene is a liquid 
produced predominantly by the high temperature chlorination 
of ethylene. 

The stoichiometric material consumption formula for 
perchloroethylene is:



C

2

H

4

 (ethylene)+4 Cl

2

 (chlorine) __-> C

2

Cl

4

 (perchloroethylene)+4 HCl (hydrogen chloride) 





Perchloroethylene has been determined to be a taxable 
substance because a review of its stoichiometric material 
consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant 
method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 100 
percent by weight of the materials used in its production.
