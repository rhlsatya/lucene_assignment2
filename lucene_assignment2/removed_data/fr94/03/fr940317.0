Oranges, Grapefruit, Tangerines, and Tangelos Grown in Florida and Imported Grapefruit; Relaxation of the Minimum
Size Requirement for Red Seedless Grapefruit 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of two interim
final rules that relaxed the minimum size requirement to 35/16 inches in diameter (size 56) for domestic shipments
of Florida red seedless grapefruit and for red seedless grapefruit imported into the United States. This rule enables
handlers in Florida and importers to continue to ship size 56 red seedless grapefruit for the entire 1993-94
season.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 905 [7 CFR part 905] regulating the handling
of oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, hereinafter referred to as the order. This order
is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C 601-674], hereinafter
referred to as the Act. 



This rule is also issued under section 8e of the Act which provides that whenever specified commodities, including
grapefruit, are regulated under a Federal marketing order, imports of these commodities into the United States are
prohibited unless they meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements as those in effect
for the domestically produced commodities. Section 8e also provides that whenever two or more marketing orders regulate
the same commodity produced in different areas of the United States, the Secretary shall determine which area the
imported commodity is in most direct competition with and apply regulations based on that area to the imported commodity.
The Secretary has determined that grapefruit imported into the United States are in most direct competition with
grapefruit grown in Florida regulated under Marketing Order No. 905, and has found that the minimum grade and size
requirements for imported grapefruit should be the same as those established for grapefruit under Marketing Order
No. 905. 

The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.

There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. 
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are about 100 Florida citrus handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering oranges, grapefruit,
tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, and about 11,000 producers of these citrus fruits in Florida. There are
approximately 25 importers of grapefruit subject to the grapefruit import regulation. Small agricultural producers
have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than
$500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000.
A minority of these handlers and a majority of the producers and importers may be classified as small entities. 
This rule finalizes an interim final rule that relaxed the minimum size requirement for domestic shipments of Florida
red seedless grapefruit to 35/16 inches in diameter (size 56) through November 6, 1994. This rule will enable handlers
to continue to ship size 56 red seedless grapefruit for the entire 1993-94 season. The interim final rule was
published in the November 12, 1993, 

Federal Register

 [58 FR 59931], and provided 30 days for interested persons to file comments. No comments were received. 
Section 905.306 [7 CFR 905.306] specifies minimum grade and size requirements for different varieties of fresh Florida
grapefruit. Such requirements for domestic shipments are specified in  905.306 in Table I of paragraph (a),
and for export shipments in Table II of paragraph (b). Export requirements were not changed by the interim final rule
for Florida grapefruit. 
The Citrus Administrative Committee (committee) met September 28, 1993, and unanimously recommended that the minimum
size requirement for domestic shipments of fresh red seedless grapefruit be relaxed. The committee meets prior to
and during each season to review the handling regulations effective on a continuous basis for each citrus fruit regulated
under the order. Committee meetings are open to the public, and interested persons may express their views at these
meetings. The Department reviews committee recommendations and information, as well as information from other
sources, and determines whether modification, suspension, or termination of the handling regulations would tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
The committee reports that it expects that the fresh market demand will be sufficient to permit the shipment of size
56 red seedless grapefruit grown in Florida during the entire 1993-94 season. The committee also expects that
the overall external quality of the fruit will be good. The committee also expects that more Florida red seedless grapefruit
will be shipped fresh this season than last season. 
This rule is designed to enable Florida grapefruit shippers to continue shipping size 56 red seedless grapefruit
to the domestic market consistent with current and anticipated strong demand in those markets during the entire 1993-94
season, and to maximize shipments to fresh market channels. This rule is based on the committee's assessment of the
maturity, flavor level, and size composition of this season's Florida red seedless grapefruit crop. The Florida
seedless grapefruit shipping season normally begins in September and continues until the following July. 
Minimum size requirements are designed to provide fresh markets with fruit of acceptable size and maturity, thereby
maintaining consumer confidence in fresh Florida grapefruit. This helps create buyer confidence and contributes
to stable marketing conditions. This is in the interest of producers, packers, and consumers, and is expected to increase
returns to Florida grapefruit growers. 
Under the order for Florida citrus, handlers may ship up to 15 standard packed cartons (12 bushels) of fruit per day,
and gift packages which are individually addressed and not for resale, under exemption provisions. Fruit shipped
for animal feed is also exempt under specific conditions. In addition, fruit shipped to commercial processors for
conversion into canned or frozen products or into a beverage base are not subject to the handling requirements. 
This rule also finalizes an interim final rule that relaxed the minimum size requirement for imported shipments of
red seedless grapefruit. The interim final rule was published in the November 12, 1993, 

Federal Register

 [58 FR 59933], and provided 30 days for interested persons to file comments. No comments were received. 
Section 8(e) of the Act requires that whenever grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements are in effect for grapefruit
under a domestic marketing order, imported grapefruit must meet the same or comparable requirements. The interim
final rule for Florida grapefruit relaxed the minimum size requirements for Florida red seedless grapefruit. Therefore
a corresponding change was needed in the grapefruit import regulation. 
Minimum grade and size requirements for grapefruit imported into the United States are currently in effect under
 944.106 [7 CFR 944.106], as reinstated on July 26, 1993 [58 FR 39428, July 23, 1993]. The interim final rule for
imported grapefruit relaxed the minimum size requirements for imported red seedless grapefruit to 35/16 inches
in diameter (size 56) for the period November 8, 1993, through November 6, 1994. 
In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the USTR has concurred with the issuance of this final rule as it pertains to
imported grapefruit. 
This rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to relax the minimum size requirement
for red seedless grapefruit, as specified. The Department's view is that this rule will have a beneficial impact on
producers, handlers, and importers since it will permit Florida grapefruit handlers to continue to make available
those sizes of fruit needed to meet consumer needs consistent with this season's crop and market conditions. 
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Increase in Expenses; Winter Pears Grown in Oregon, Washington, and California



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; amendment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends a final rule to authorize an increase in expenses for the Winter Pear Control Committee (Committee)
under Marketing Order No. 927 for the 1993-94 fiscal year. This final rule amendment will enable the Committee
to incur increased expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer the
program are derived from assessments on handlers.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule amendment is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 927 (7 CFR part 927) regulating the handling
of winter pears grown in Oregon and Washington. The agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.



The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

This final rule amendment has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order provisions now in effect, winter pears grown in Oregon, Washington, and California are subject to assessments.
It is intended that the assessment rates specified herein will be applicable to all assessable pears handled during
the 1993-94 fiscal year, which began July 1, 1993, through June 30, 1994. This final rule amendment will not preempt
any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.

Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

There are approximately 90 handlers of winter pears regulated under the marketing order each season and approximately
1,850 winter pear producers in Oregon, Washington, and California. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR  121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000,
and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority
of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.

The Oregon, Washington, and California winter pear marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that
the assessment rates for a particular fiscal year apply to all assessable winter pears handled from the beginning
of such year. Annual budgets of expenses are prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration
of this marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are handlers and
producers of Oregon, Washington, and California winter pears. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with
the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area, and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate
budgets. The Committee's budget is formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons
have an opportunity to participate and provide input.

The assessment rates recommended by the Committee are derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of pears. Because these rates are applied to actual shipments, they must be established at rates which will provide
sufficient income to pay the Committee's expected expenses.

The Winter Pear Control Committee met on June 4, and June 24, 1993, and unanimously recommended total expenses of $6,933,615
for the 1993-94 fiscal year. In comparison, the 1992-93 fiscal year expense amount was $6,716,983, which
is $216,632 less than the recommended amount for this fiscal year.

The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.45 per standard box, or equivalent and a supplemental
assessment rate of $0.04 per standard box, or equivalent for Anjou variety pears. In comparison, the 1992-93
pear assessment rate was $0.43 per standard box, or equivalent and $0.09 for the supplemental assessment rate on Anjou
variety pears. This represents a $0.02 increase and $0.05 decrease, respectively, in the assessment rates recommended
for this fiscal year because the current rates should generate sufficient income to cover the increased expenses.

Major expense categories for the 1993-94 fiscal year include $4,937,803 for advertising, $566,433 for contingency,
$422,826 for Ethoxyquin data research, and $174,775 for salaries and benefits. Comparable 1992-93 budgeted
expenses are $4,562,500, $490,578, $855,000, and $160,905, respectively.

The Committee's approved 1993-94 fiscal year expenses and assessment rates were adopted in a final rule and
published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 54926, October 25, 1993).

On December 1, 1993, the Committee conducted a mail ballot and on a vote of 13 in favor and 1 opposed, recommended to increase
expenses to $7,931,925. This is a $998,310 increase in expenses from the previously approved 1993-94 budget.
No changes in the approved assessment rates were recommended because the current rates should generate sufficient
income to cover the increased expenses.

The increase is deemed necessary by the Committee because the crop estimate, which is now approximated at 15,250,000
standard boxes of winter pears was underestimated by nearly 2 million boxes. Due to the larger crop, additional funding
in major categories is needed. This includes a total of $639,322 for contingency, $5,718,750 for paid advertising,
$305,000 for winter pear improvement, $305,000 for SOPP, and $484,000 for Ethoxyquin data research which represent
increases of $72,889, $780,947, $41,650; $41,650, and $61,174 respectively, from the previously approved budget.

This action will not impose additional costs on handlers because the previously established assessment rates are
not being changed. Further, the increased expenses should benefit the industry by assisting in marketing a record-large
crop. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule as hereinafter set forth will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this final rule
amendment are reasonable and likely to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rates to cover
such expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 

It is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest
to give preliminary notice or to engage in further public procedure prior to putting this rule into effect and that
good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to conduct a more aggressive advertising and promotional
program to market the largest crop in the industry's history; (2) the marketing season is well underway and further
delays in authorizing this increase in expenditures would reduce the program's effectiveness; (3) handlers are
aware of this action and need no additional time to comply because the assessment rates are not being changed; (4) no
comments were received during the rulemaking proceeding to establish the assessment rates for the current fiscal
year which remain unchanged by this action; and (5) no useful purpose would be served by delaying this action.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule authorizes expenditures and establishes an assessment rate for the California Olive Committee
(Committee) under M.O. No. 932 for the 1994 fiscal year. Authorization of this budget enables the Committee to incur
expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer this program. Funds to administer this program are derived
from assessments on handlers.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 932 [7 CFR part 932], as amended, regulating
the handling of olives grown in California. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. 



The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order provisions now in effect, olives grown in California are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment
rate specified herein will be applicable to all assessable olives handled during the 1994 fiscal year, beginning
January 1, 1994, through December 31, 1994. This interim final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a

court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 

Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural

There are approximately 5 handlers of olives regulated under the marketing order each season and approximately 1,350
olive producers in California. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined
as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. None of the handlers may be classified as small entities.

The marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate for a particular fiscal year
apply to all assessable olives handled from the beginning of such year. Annual budgets of expenses are prepared by
the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of this marketing order, and submitted to the Department
for approval. The members of the Committee are handlers and producers of California olives. They are familiar with
the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area, and are thus in a position
to formulate appropriate budgets. The Committee's budget is formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus,
all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input.

The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of olives. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will provide sufficient
income to pay the Committee's expected expenses.

The California Olive Committee met on December 14, 1993, and unanimously recommended a total expense amount of $3,748,290,
for its 1994 budget. This is $928,530 more in expenses than the previous year. The increase is primarily due to additional
funding for market development.

The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $27.21 per ton for the 1994 fiscal year, which is
$1.46 more in the assessment rate from the 1993 fiscal year. The assessment rate, when applied to anticipated shipments
of 101,000 tons, would yield $2,748,210 in assessment income. This, along with approximately $1,000,000 from the
Committee's authorized reserves will be adequate to cover estimated expenses.

Major expense categories for the 1994 fiscal year include $1,150,000 for the market expansion program, $990,860
for consumer affairs, and $173,730 for salaries. Funds in the reserve at the end of the fiscal year, estimated at $300,000
will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses.

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly
offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS
has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule as hereinafter set forth will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the fiscal year for the Committee began January 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment
for the fiscal year apply to all assessable olives handled during the fiscal year; 

(3) handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting; and (4) this interim
final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization
of this action.

Vidalia Onions Grown in Georgia; Increased Expenses 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; amendment.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule increases the level of authorized expenses under Marketing Order No. 955 for the 1993-94 fiscal
period. Authorization of these increased expenses is needed to cover marketing expenditures in excess of those authorized
in the Vidalia Onion Committee's (Committee) 1993-94 budget.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 955 (7 CFR part 955), regulating the handling of Vidalia
onions grown in Georgia. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 


The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12788, Civil Justice Reform. This rule increases the level
of authorized expenditures for the 1993-94 fiscal period which began September 16, 1993, and ends September
15, 1994. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an
irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are approximately 250 producers of Georgia Vidalia onions under this marketing order, and approximately 145
handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601)
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of Vidalia onion producers and handlers may be classified
as small entities. 
The budget of increased expenses for the 1993-94 fiscal period was prepared by the Vidalia Onion Committee,
the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval.
The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of Vidalia onions. They are familiar with the Committee's
needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate
budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had
an opportunity to participate and provide input.

The Committee met July 22, 1993, and unanimously recommended a 1993-94 budget of $262,950, which included $82,500
for marketing. An interim final rule implementing that recommendation was published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 7, 1993 (58 FR 47023) and finalized on December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64103).

The Committee subsequently met on February 17, 1994, and unanimously recommended an increase of $18,000 in its 1993-94
budget for the construction and purchase of a new trade show booth. The trade show booth is expected to cost $27,000
and will be used in conjunction with the Committee's Vidalia onion promotional efforts. The Committee recommended
that $9,000 of current budget money be used and that the remaining $18,000 be taken from the authorized reserve, increasing
marketing expenses from $82,500 to $100,500, and increasing the total budget from $262,950 to $280,950. The reserve,
which currently totals $187,766, is within the maximum permitted by the order of three fiscal periods' expenses.
There are adequate funds to cover this new expenditure, so no increase in the assessment rate was recommended.

Since no increase in the assessment rate is being recommended, no additional costs will be imposed on handlers. Therefore,
the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice or to engage in further public procedure prior to putting
this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after
publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The fiscal period began on September 16, 1993, and the Committee needs to have approval to pay its expenses
which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended
by the Committee at a public meeting; and (3) no increase in the assessment rate is being recommended so no additional
funds will need to be collected from handlers.

Raisins Produced From Grapes Grown in California; Final Free and Reserve Percentages for the 1993-94 Crop Year
for Natural (Sun-Dried) Seedless Raisins 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule invites comments on the establishment of final free and reserve percentages for 1993 crop
Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins. The percentages are 74 percent free and 26 percent reserve. These percentages
are intended to stabilize supplies and prices and to help counter the destabilizing effects of the burdensome oversupply
situation facing the raisin industry. This rule was unanimously recommended by the Raisin Administrative Committee
(Committee), the body which locally administers the marketing order. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This interim final rule is issued under marketing agreement and Order No. 989 (7 CFR part 989), both as amended, regulating
the handling of raisins produced from grapes grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the ``order.'' The order
is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter
referred to as the ``Act.'' 



The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order provisions now in effect, final free and reserve percentages may be established for raisins acquired by handlers
during the crop year. This rule establishes final free and reserve percentages for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless
raisins for the 1993-94 crop year, beginning August 1, 1993, through July 31, 1994. This interim final rule will
not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with
this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempt therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his/her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are approximately 25 handlers of California raisins who are subject to regulation under the raisin marketing
order, and approximately 5,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small
agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. A majority of producers
and a minority of handlers of California raisins may be classified as small entities. 

The order prescribes procedures for computing trade demands and preliminary and final percentages that establish
the amount of raisins that can be marketed throughout the season. The regulations apply to all handlers of California
raisins. Raisins in the free percentage category may be shipped immediately to any market, while reserve raisins
must be held by handlers in a reserve pool for the account of the Committee, which is responsible for local administration
of the order. Under the order, reserve raisins may be: Sold at a later date by the Committee to handlers for free use;
used in diversion programs; exported to authorized countries; carried over as a hedge against a short crop the following
year; or disposed of in other outlets noncompetitive with those for free tonnage raisins. 

While this rule may restrict the amount of Natural 
(sun-dried) Seedless raisins that enter domestic markets, final free and reserve percentages are intended to lessen
the impact of the oversupply situation facing the industry and promote stronger marketing conditions, thus stabilizing
prices and supplies and improving grower returns. In addition to the quantity of raisins released under the preliminary
percentages and the final percentages, the order specifies methods to make available additional raisins to handlers
by requiring sales of reserve pool raisins for use as free tonnage raisins under ``10 plus 10'' offers, and authorizing
sales of reserve raisins under certain conditions. 

The Department's ``Guidelines for Fruit, Vegetable, and Specialty Crop Marketing Orders'' specifies that 110 percent
of recent years' sales should be made available to primary markets each season before recommendations for volume
regulation are approved. This goal is met by the establishment of a final percentage which releases 100 percent of
the computed trade demand and the additional release of reserve raisins to handlers under ``10 plus 10'' offers. The
``10 plus 10'' offers are two simultaneous offers of reserve pool raisins which are made available to handlers each
season. For each such offer, a quantity of raisins equal to 10 percent of the prior year's shipments is made available
for free use. 

Pursuant to  989.54(a) of the order, the Committee which is responsible for local administration of the order,
met on August 16, 1993, to review shipment and inventory data, and other matters relating to the supplies of raisins
of all varietal types. The Committee computed a trade demand for each varietal type for which a free tonnage percentage
might be recommended. The trade demand is 90 percent of the prior year's shipments of free tonnage and reserve tonnage
raisins sold for free use for each varietal type into all market outlets, adjusted by subtracting the carryin of each
varietal type on August 1 of the current crop year and by adding to the trade demand the desirable carryout for each varietal
type at the end of that crop year. As specified in  989.154, the desirable carryout for each varietal type shall
be equal to the shipments of free tonnage raisins of the prior crop year during the months of August, September, and
one half of October. If the prior year's shipments are limited because of crop conditions, the total shipments during
that period of time during one of the three years preceding the prior crop year may be used. In accordance with these
provisions, the Committee computed and announced a 1993-94 trade demand of 282,909 tons for Natural (sun-dried)
Seedless raisins.

As required under  989.54(b) of the order, the Committee met on October 5, 1993, and computed and announced a
preliminary crop estimate and preliminary free and reserve percentages for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins
which released 85 percent of the trade demand since field prices had been established. The preliminary crop estimate
and preliminary free and reserve percentages were as follows: 387,947 tons, and 62 percent free and 38 percent reserve.
Also at that meeting, the Committee computed and announced preliminary crop estimates and preliminary free and reserve
percentages for Dipped Seedless, Oleate and Related Seedless, Golden Seedless, Zante Currant, Sultana, Muscat,
Monukka, and Other Seedless raisins. On November 15, 1993, the Committee decided that volume control percentages
only were warranted for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins, which would remain at 62 percent free and 38 percent
reserve. It determined that the supplies of the other varietal types would be less than or close enough to the computed
trade demands for each of these varietals or could be substituted to relieve anticipated shortages in some size ranges
of Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins used for baking. In view of these factors, volume control percentages would
not be necessary to maintain market stability. 

Pursuant to  989.54(c), the Committee may adopt interim free and reserve percentages. Interim percentages
may release less than the computed trade demand for each varietal type. Interim percentages for Natural (sun-dried)
Seedless raisins of 73.75 percent free and 26.25 percent reserve were computed and announced on January 13, 1994.
That action released most, but not all the computed trade demand for Natural 
(sun-dried) Seedless raisins. 

Under  989.54(d) of the order, the Committee is required to recommend to the Secretary, no later than February
15 of each crop year, final free and reserve percentages which, when applied to the final production estimate of a varietal
type, will tend to release the full trade demand for any varietal type. 

The Committee's final estimate of 1993-94 production of Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins is 384,501 tons.
Dividing the computed trade demand of 282,909 tons by the final estimate of production results in a final free percentage
of 74 percent and a final reserve percentage of 26 percent. 

Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this interim final
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant information presented, including the Committee's recommendations and other
information, it is found that this regulation, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy
of the Act. 

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that upon good cause it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The relevant provisions of this part require that the percentages designated herein for the 1993-94
crop year apply to all Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins acquired from the beginning of that crop year; (2) handlers
are currently marketing 1993-94 crop raisins of the Natural (sun-dried) Seedless varietal type and this action
should be taken promptly to achieve the intended purpose of making the full trade demand quantity computed by the Committee
available to handlers; (3) handlers are aware of this action, which was recommended by the Committee at an open meeting,
and need no additional time to comply with these percentages; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day period
for written comments and all comments received will be considered prior to finalization of this interim final rule.

Swine Brucellosis 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule and request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the brucellosis indemnity regulations to provide for payment at fair market value for whole herds
of swine depopulated because of brucellosis. This action is necessary to eliminate in an expeditious manner all swine
herds known to be affected with brucellosis. This action will also help ensure that swine brucellosis is eradicated
in the United States within the next 5 years, thus saving the Federal government millions of dollars in program costs.
This action will also help eliminate the human health risk associated with swine brucellosis. We are also amending
the regulations concerning interstate movement of swine to require that all brucellosis-exposed swine from herds
known to be affected with the disease be identified with an eartag before being moved interstate from the herd. This
action will allow all handlers of swine to take precautions in handling swine potentially infected with brucellosis.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Brucellosis is a serious infectious disease of swine, cattle, bison, and other species, including humans, caused
by bacteria of the genus 

Brucella.

 Brucellosis in swine is characterized by abortion, infertility, orchitis, posterior paralysis, and lameness.
To help prevent the spread of the disease, and to further its eradication, the regulations in 9 CFR part 51 provide for
payment of Federal indemnity to owners of certain animals destroyed because of brucellosis. The payment of indemnity
is intended to provide owners with a financial incentive for promptly destroying animals infected with or exposed
to brucellosis. Because the continued presence of brucellosis in a herd seriously threatens the health of animals
in that herd and possibly other herds, the prompt destruction of brucellosis-affected swine is critical if brucellosis
eradication efforts in the United States are to succeed. 

Under the regulations in  51.3(b)(2) prior to the effective date of this interim rule, indemnity payments for
herd depopulation were made only for breeding swine destroyed because of brucellosis, and were based on a maximum
``per head'' rate of $150 per head for registered, inbred, or hybrid swine, and $65 per head for all other breeding swine.
In this interim rule, we are amending the regulations to provide that in the case of whole herd depopulation of swine,
indemnity payments shall be paid for all swine in the herd, not just for breeding swine, and at a fair market value determined
by the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), based on an appraisal conducted by
an independent appraiser assigned by the Administrator, except that indemnity payments, plus any salvage, must
not exceed the appraised value of each animal. 
Because brucellosis is primarily transmitted through sexual contact, swine other than breeding swine have not been
considered to be significantly at risk for transmitting brucellosis to other swine. Consequently, indemnity has
not been paid for ``feeder'' or ``finishing'' pigs. Recently, however, the infection of 30 humans with brucellosis
through the handling of swine other than breeding swine at a packing plant in North Carolina has indicated that such
swine do pose a significant risk of transmitting brucellosis to swine and humans.

In response to the occurrence of brucellosis among workers at the packing plant, the State of North Carolina has ordered
that the plant may obtain swine only from validated brucellosis-free States, or from validated brucellosis-free
herds in States other than validated brucellosis-free States. Although, at this time, the infection of humans and
the North Carolina order involve only one packing plant, if the problem were to broaden and occur at other packing plants
in North Carolina, or to occur in additional States, additional individuals could suffer significant hardship from
brucellosis infections, and packing plants and owners of herds other than validated brucellosis-free herds could
experience severe economic disruption.
The United States Animal Health Association (USAHA), a nationwide association of State veterinarians and industry
members, recently passed a resolution requesting that the Department establish the goal of the complete eradication
of swine brucellosis in the United States by the end of 1996. This resolution was supported by the National Pork Producers
Council (NPPC) and the American Meat Institute (AMI). Additionally, the USAHA passed a second resolution, supported
by NPPC and AMI, requesting that the Department move to depopulate immediately all herds of swine known to be affected
with brucellosis by paying fair market value for all swine in the affected herds. (Under  51.1, a herd known to
be affected is defined as any herd in which any animal has been classified as a brucellosis reactor and which has not
been released from quarantine.)
We compared the probable outcome of following the USAHA resolutions with that of continuing the existing eradication
program, and concluded that eradication of swine brucellosis can be accomplished more quickly, with significantly
less expense, by beginning now to pay fair market value for whole herd depopulation.
This change in the indemnity regulations is warranted now due to the success of the existing swine brucellosis eradication
program. During the life of the program, the prevalence of swine brucellosis has been reduced from 15 percent of the
nation's swine herds to 0.014 percent. Currently, only 34 herds nationwide are known to be affected with brucellosis.
Because the number of herds known to be affected is small, paying fair market value for whole herd depopulation is feasible.
When undertaking whole herd depopulation, herd owners, where it is possible, will be required either to dispose of
the swine through means other than slaughter (e.g., through burial, incineration, rendering, etc.) on the premises
where the animals are held or penned at the time the indemnity is approved, or to move their swine for disposal to another
location when movement to the location is approved, in advance, by an APHIS representative. Paying fair market value
for whole herd depopulation, as provided for in this interim rule, will enable herd owners to dispose of swine through
means other than slaughter (e.g., through burial, incineration, rendering, etc.). (The flat rates provided for
under the existing regulations assume that the herd owner will also receive salvage value at slaughter.) Disposing
of swine through such alternate means will help eliminate the danger of spreading brucellosis to swine, as well as
help protect packing plant workers from the danger posed by brucellosis-infected swine.
Prior to the effective date of this interim rule,  51.6 of the regulations required that swine for which indemnity
was paid under the regulations be slaughtered at a slaughtering establishment. In order to allow for alternative
means of destruction, we are amending  51.6(c) in this interim rule to provide that in the case of indemnity paid
for whole herd depopulation, swine may be destroyed on the premises where the animals are held or penned at the time
the indemnity is approved, or may be moved for destruction to another location when movement to the location is approved
in advance by an APHIS representative. We are also providing that in cases where the swine are destroyed other than
at a slaughtering establishment, the carcasses of the swine shall be disposed of by burial, incineration, or other
disposal means authorized by applicable State law, and are requiring that destruction and disposition of animals
destroyed other than at a slaughtering establishment be performed in the presence of an APHIS representative.
As noted above, in paying fair market value for whole herd indemnity, every effort will be made to dispose of swine by
means other than slaughter. In some cases, however, when a packing plant is willing to handle swine from herds known
to be affected, when it has been notified of the arrival of the swine, and when appropriate precautions are taken to
protect the plant's workers, slaughter may be a feasible means of disposing of the animals. As noted above, in such
cases, the indemnity paid, plus any salvage, must not exceed the appraised value of the swine.
Although, under the provisions of this interim rule, average indemnity costs for the Federal government will increase
from $1,760 per herd to $9,030 per herd, the total cost for indemnity is expected to increase only slightly over the
life of the program, and total program costs are expected to decrease substantially. According to APHIS projections,
the eradication program as provided for prior to this interim rule would have required over 30 more years to accomplish
total eradication, with projected costs of almost $600,000 for indemnity and $18 million for surveillance. In contrast,
because the provisions of this interim rule will allow for the quick depopulation of herds known to be affected with
brucellosis, and therefore increase program effectiveness, total eradication is expected to be accomplished in
5 years, with projected costs of $850,000 for indemnity and $10.5 million for surveillance. Thus, the total cost of
eradication will be reduced from $18.6 million to $11.35 million, and the time necessary to achieve eradication shortened
by more than 25 years.

Identification of Exposed Swine From Herds Affected With Brucellosis


The regulations in 9 CFR part 78 govern, among other things, the interstate movement of swine affected with brucellosis.
Under these regulations, the interstate movement of brucellosis reactor swine and exposed swine is subject to certain
restrictions. Among the restrictions on the movement of reactor swine is the requirement that such swine be individually
identified by attaching to the left ear a metal tag bearing a serial number and the inscription, ``U.S. Reactor,''
or a metal tag bearing a serial number designated by the State animal health official for identifying brucellosis
reactors.
Although part 78 does require that exposed swine moved interstate be accompanied by a permit, it does not require that
exposed swine from a herd known to be affected with brucellosis be identified with a metal eartag. However, because
some swine originating in a herd known to be affected are likely to be the offspring of infected sows, and because the
swine in the herd may be in extended contact with infected swine, they are at increased risk of being infected with brucellosis.
Because of this increased risk, we consider it necessary to provide that such swine can be readily identified prior
to slaughter. In order to better monitor the movement of exposed swine to ensure that they are destroyed and are not
diverted into herds not affected with brucellosis, we are amending  78.32 to require that exposed swine from
a herd known to be affected with brucellosis may be moved interstate from the herd only if identified in the same manner
as reactor swine. This identification will facilitate the monitoring of such swine until they are slaughtered, thus
protecting against the spread of brucellosis by such animals. An additional benefit of such identification is that
it will alert packing plants to the arrival of reactor swine, allowing them to take appropriate handling precautions.


Immediate Action


The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing
this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary to eliminate a public
health risk, avert a potentially serious economic impact on swine marketing, reduce government expenses, and significantly
shorten the time necessary for the eradication of swine brucellosis.
Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the
public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon publication
in the 

Federal Register

. We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the 

Federal Register

. After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the 

Federal Register

. It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the
comments.


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Department has reviewed this rule under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.
This interim rule provides for indemnity payment for whole herd depopulation of swine herds known to be affected with
brucellosis. Prior to the effective date of this interim rule, indemnity for herd depopulation was paid only for breeding
swine infected with or exposed to the disease, and was based on a maximum ``per head'' rate of $150 per head for registered,
inbred, or hybrid swine, and $65 per head for all other breeding swine.
At present 34 swine herds in the United States are known to be affected with brucellosis. This number represents 0.014
percent of the 235,840 swine herds in this country. Of the 34 herds, 18 are in Florida and 12 are in Texas. Louisiana,
Mississippi, South Carolina, and Oklahoma have 1 each. The 34 herds known to be affected are all independently owned,
and all of the farmers are considered ``small entities'' (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million or less, according
to Small Business Administration size standards).
APHIS cannot require that farmers depopulate their herds, so it is impossible to determine exactly how many owners
will accept indemnity for whole herd depopulation. Because several herds are in the final stages of brucellosis ``cleanup,''
these farmers may not choose to depopulate their entire herds.
At the time of this writing, current market values for the different classes of swine are:

1

 Sows, $160; boars, $150; gilts, $160; feeder pigs, $100; and suckling pigs, $20.




If owners choose to depopulate their entire herds, under the regulations they could start new operations with a more
productive swine herd after a standard minimum of 30 days of ``downtime'' for elimination of the 

Brucella 

bacteria from the premises through cleaning and disinfecting. Noninfected sows tend to produce more piglets than
do infected sows.

This interim rule also requires that all exposed swine in a herd known to be affected with brucellosis must be identified
with a metal eartag before being moved interstate from the herd known to be affected. We estimate that the cost of applying
eartags to exposed swine in the average herd known to be affected will be less than $50.

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Change in Disease Status of the Republic of Korea Because of Rinderpest and Foot-and-Mouth Disease 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are declaring the Republic of Korea free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease. There have been no outbreaks
of foot-and-mouth disease in the Republic of Korea since 1934, and we have determined that rinderpest has never existed
there. We are also adding the Republic of Korea to a list of countries that, although declared free of rinderpest and
foot-and-mouth disease, are subject to special restrictions on the importation of their meat and other animal products
into the United States. This revision will remove the prohibition on the importation into the United States, from
the Republic of Korea, of live ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from ruminants, and will relieve restrictions
on the importation, from the Republic of Korea, of milk and milk products from ruminants. 


The Republic of Korea is not declared to be free of hog cholera and swine vesicular disease. Therefore, the importation
from the Republic of Korea of swine and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from swine will continue to be restricted because
of these diseases. 
We are also adding the Republic of Korea to the list of countries whose importation into the United States of llamas
and alpacas is restricted.

 </SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The regulations in 9 CFR part 94 (referred to below as the regulations) govern the importation into the United States
of specified animals and animal products in order to prevent the introduction into the United States of various diseases,
including rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy, African swine fever,
hog cholera, and swine vesicular disease. These are dangerous and destructive communicable diseases of ruminants
and swine. 
Section 94.1(a)(1) of the regulations provides that rinderpest or FMD exists in all countries of the world except
those listed in  94.1(a)(2), which are declared to be free of these diseases. 
On November 30, 1993, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 63122-63123, Docket No. 93-127-1) a proposal to add the Republic of Korea

1

 to the list in  94.1(a)(2) of countries declared to be free of rinderpest and FMD. 




We also proposed to add the Republic of Korea to the list in  94.11(a) of countries declared free of rinderpest
and FMD that are subject to special restrictions on the importation of their meat and other animal products into the
United States. 
Additionally, we proposed to add the Republic of Korea to the list in 
 94.1(d)(1) of countries in which rinderpest or FMD has been known to exist and that were declared free of rinderpest
and FMD on or after September 28, 1990. All countries declared free of rinderpest and FMD on or after September 28, 1990,
must be added to this list. The importation or entry of llamas and alpacas into the United States from countries on this
list is prohibited, unless the llamas or alpacas are imported through the Harry S Truman Animal Import Center in accordance
with 9 CFR 92.435. 
We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 60-day comment period ending January 31, 1994. We did not receive
any comments. The facts presented in the proposed rule still provide the basis for this final rule. 
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as
a final rule.




Effective Date: 

This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective
less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. This rule removes the prohibition on the importation into the United States, from the Republic of Korea, of ruminants
and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from ruminants and relieves restrictions on the importation, from the Republic
of Korea, of milk and milk products from ruminants. We have determined that approximately 2 weeks are needed to ensure
that Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service personnel at ports of entry receive official notice of this change
in the regulations. Therefore, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined
that this rule should be made effective 15 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. 


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.

This rule adds the Republic of Korea to the list in part 94 of countries declared to be free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth
disease. This action relieves restrictions imposed on the importation of live ruminants and fresh, chilled, and
frozen meat of ruminants from the Republic of Korea into the United States. This action does not relieve restrictions
on the importation of live swine and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of swine because the Republic of Korea is still
considered to be affected with hog cholera and swine vesicular disease.

Based on available information, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports of fresh, chilled,
or frozen meat of ruminants from the Republic of Korea into the United States as a result of this rule. In 1992, the United
States did not import any live ruminants or swine from the Republic of Korea. Additionally, only 2 metric tons of meat
and meat products were shipped from the Republic of Korea to the United States. This accounted for less than one-tenth
of one percent of total 1992 meat imports. The Republic of Korea is currently an importer of beef and lamb and does not
produce enough ruminant meat to be self-sufficient. Therefore, any effect on domestic prices or supplies will be
insignificant. Increases in imports of live ruminants from the Republic of Korea are also unlikely because there
is no demand in the United States for live ruminants from the Republic of Korea and because of high transportation costs.

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12778 


This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and

Importation of Pork and Pork Products From Countries Where Swine Vesicular Disease Is Known To Exist 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the regulations concerning importation of certain cured and dried pork and pork products from countries
where swine vesicular disease is known to exist, to allow the bones to be removed in the country where the pork or pork
products are processed. Prior to the effective date of this final rule, the regulations required that bones be removed
in the country where the swine are raised and slaughtered. This action will give processors an option as to where bones
are removed, while continuing to prevent the introduction of swine vesicular disease into the United States. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Regulations in 9 CFR part 94 regulate, among other things, the importation of certain animals, meat, and animal products
into the United States. These regulations are designed to prevent the introduction into the United States of certain
diseases of livestock and poultry. Section 94.12 restricts the importation of pork and pork products into the United
States from countries where swine vesicular disease (SVD) is known to exist. In order to prevent the introduction
of this disease into the United States, only pork and pork products that meet conditions detailed in the regulations
are eligible for entry into the United States. 
Prior to the effective date of this final rule, the regulations allowed swine to be raised and slaughtered in an SVD-free
country and the meat shipped to an SVD-infected country for curing and drying. However, if the resulting cured and
dried pork or pork products were to be imported into the United States, all bones had to be removed in the country of origin,
that is, the country where the swine were raised and slaughtered. The bones could not be removed in the country where
the pork or pork products were cured and dried. (See  94.12(b)(1)(iv)(A).) 
On November 15, 1993, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 
60146-60147, Docket No. 93-102-1) a proposal to amend  94.12(b)(1)(iv)(A) of the regulations
to allow the option of removing the bones in the country where the pork and pork products are cured and dried. 
We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 60-day comment period ending January 14, 1994. We received one
comment by that date. It was from a veterinary medical association, and was in favor of the proposed changes. 
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as
a final rule. 


Effective Date 


This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective
less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. 
Immediate implementation of this rule is necessary to provide relief to those persons who are adversely affected
by restrictions we no longer find warranted. Therefore, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service has determined that this rule should be effective upon publication in the 

Federal Register

. 


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
At present, Germany is the only country where SVD is considered to exist that exports these cured and dried pork and
pork products to the United 
States. During 1989, approximately 17,987 kilograms of cured and dried pork and pork products were exported from
Germany to the United States. The value of these imports totaled $113,000. 
Three facilities in Germany currently process cured and dried pork and pork products for the United States market.
The regulatory amendments made final in this document will allow these processing facilities to purchase pork from
SVD-free countries with the bones in, and remove the bones at the processing facilities in Germany. The amendments
will not have any impact on the domestic pork industry, which is valued in excess of $4 billion.

We have been unable to identify any domestic entities that will be affected by the rule. We therefore estimate that
the rule will have a negligible impact on the domestic market for cured and dried pork and pork products. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Ascorbic Acid, Erythorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Ascorbate, and Sodium Citrate on Beef, Lamb, and Pork Cuts



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is amending the Federal meat inspection regulations to permit the application
of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium citrate, singly or in combination,
to the surface of fresh beef cuts or fresh lamb cuts to delay discoloration of such cuts. Use of these substances will
result in the preservation of a fresh color and appearance throughout the product's microbiological shelf life.
This action is in response to petitions submitted by Wilson Foods Corporation. In addition, FSIS is amending the regulations
to clarify the permitted use and levels of such substances on fresh pork cuts, and revise the purpose of these substances
from ``to maintain color'' to ``to delay discoloration'' for clarification. Preserving the fresh color and appearance
of beef and lamb cuts increases the marketability of such products; therefore, losses to manufacturers due to color
deterioration will be reduced. In addition, FSIS is removing and reserving 9 CFR 317.8(b)(37), which requires qualifying
statements on fresh pork cuts.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Executive Order 12866



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.



Executive Order 12778



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. States and local jurisdictions
are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) from imposing any marking, labeling, packing, or ingredient
requirement on federally inspected meat products that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under
FMIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, exercise concurrent jurisdictions over meat products that are
outside official establishments for the purpose of preventing the distribution of meat products that are misbranded
or adulterated under the FMIA, or, in the case of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their
entry into the United States. Under the FMIA, States that maintain meat inspection programs must impose requirements
that are at least equal to those required under the FMIA. The States may, however, impose more stringent requirements
on such State inspected products and establishments.

No retroactive effect will be given to this rule. There are no applicable administrative procedures that must be exhausted
prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule.



Effect on Small Entities



The Administrator, FSIS, has made a determination that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. The final rule allows the application of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid,
citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium citrate, singly or in combination, to the surface of fresh beef cuts or fresh
lamb cuts to delay discoloration. This final rule will impose no new requirements on small entities. Current regulations
already allow these substances to be applied to the surface of fresh pork cuts. Currently, approximately 20 percent
to 25 percent of meat packaging companies are producing red meat cuts. FSIS estimates that less than 3 percent of these
companies will be affected by this final rule. Also, the Agency estimates the cost of applying these substances to
the surface of fresh beef cuts or fresh lamb cuts is between $.03 and $.04 per pound. However, if production of fresh
beef cuts or fresh lamb cuts treated in this manner increases and a sustained market develops for these products, the
cost will decrease.

The meat industry will benefit from this final action because the preservation of the fresh color and appearance of
beef cuts and lamb cuts for a longer period of time should increase the marketability of these products, thereby reducing
the losses to manufacturers due to color deterioration of beef cuts and lamb cuts. Manufacturers, both large and small,
opting to use such substances will be required to revise the ingredients statement on product labels to show the presence
of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and/or sodium citrate. However, the use of these
substances will be voluntary, and any costs associated with new label applications will be covered under existing
approved paperwork requirements of FSIS's prior label approval system.

Manufacturers choosing to apply ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium citrate,
singly or in combination, to fresh beef cuts and fresh lamb cuts will be required to develop and maintain an approved
partial quality control (PQC) program, and would thus incur expenses associated with maintaining the PQC program.
Decisions by individual manufacturers on whether to use such substances on the surface of fresh beef and fresh lamb
cuts will be based on their conclusions that the benefits will outweigh the costs of maintaining the required PQC program.
Current regulations already require manufacturers of fresh pork cuts using those substances to develop and maintain
an approved PQC program.

to fresh beef and lamb cuts will be required to develop and maintain a partial quality control (PQC) program. FSIS will
receive, evaluate, and either approve or disapprove requests for such PQC programs. The PQC program will be placed
on file in the establishment, and be available to any duly authorized representative of the Secretary. The information
collection requirements contained in this final rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under
approval number 0583-0087.



Background



Wilson Foods Petitions



On December 13, 1988, and October 24, 1991, Wilson Foods Corporation, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, submitted petitions,
along with supporting technical data, to FSIS to permit the application of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, sodium
ascorbate, citric acid and sodium citrate, singly or in combination, to fresh beef cuts and fresh lamb cuts to delay
discoloration of the meat cuts.
 The intended effect of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, and sodium ascorbate is to serve as antioxidants; the intended
effect of citric acid and sodium citrate is to serve as sequestrants. The petitioner's data demonstrate that the required
amount to accomplish the intended effects, singly or in combination, would be at levels not to exceed 500 ppm or 1.8
milligrams (mg) per square inch of the product's surface of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, or sodium ascorbate,
and/or not to exceed 250 ppm or 0.9 mg per square inch of the product's surface of citric acid or sodium citrate. The data
submitted by the petitioner were the results of experiments on products which were packaged in a modified atmosphere
of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen. It is the Agency's understanding that the benefits provided by the addition
of these substances occur regardless of packaging conditions. However, this rulemaking concerns the addition of
substances, rather than packaging gases, which are not a part of this rule.





The petitioner's data further demonstrate that such treatments result in delaying undesirable discoloration of
the product for a period of time that does not exceed the product's microbiological shelf life. Fresh beef cuts and
fresh lamb cuts treated with the substances mentioned above and stored at refrigerator temperature will remain wholesome
for up to 21 days. Loss of the ``fresh'' color and marketability of beef cuts and lamb cuts occurs before the product
becomes microbiologically unsafe. Some consumers are reluctant to purchase fresh beef or lamb cuts because of the
change to a darker color of the product before spoilage.



Current Regulations



Section 318.7(c)(4) of the Federal meat inspection regulations (9 CFR 318.7(c)(4)) allows the use of ascorbic acid,
erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium citrate on fresh pork cuts to maintain color at levels
not to exceed either 500 ppm or 1.8 mg/sq inch of surface of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid or sodium ascorbate, singly
or in combination, and/or not to exceed either 250 ppm or 0.9 mg/sq inch of surface of citric acid or sodium citrate,
singly or in combination. In addition, 9 CFR 318.7(c)(4) requires the use of such substances under an approved PQC
program under 9 CFR 318.4(d) and (e). Section 317.8(b)(37) of the Federal meat inspection regulations (9 CFR 317.8(b)(37))
requires that when ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium citrate, singly or
in combination, are added to fresh pork cuts, there shall appear on the label of that product, in letters of the same
style and type and not less than one-fourth the size of letters in the product name, contiguous to the name of the product,
a statement identifying the specific approved substance(s) by its common name and the purpose for which it is added
such as ``Sprayed with a solution of water, ascorbic acid and citric acid to maintain color.''

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists ascorbic acid in 21 CFR 182.3013, erythorbic acid in 21 CFR 182.3041,
and sodium ascorbate in 21 CFR 182.3731 as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) when used in accordance with good manufacturing
practices for use as preservatives. FDA lists citric acid in 21 CFR 182.6033 and sodium citrate in 21 CFR 182.6751 as
GRAS when used in accordance with good manufacturing practices for use as sequestrants.



Proposed Rule



On October 4, 1993, FSIS published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 51581) to permit the application of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium
citrate, singly or in combination, to the surface of fresh beef cuts or fresh lamb cuts to delay discoloration of such
meat cuts. The proposed rule would allow these substances to be used, singly or in combination, at levels of not more
than 500 ppm or 1.8 milligrams per square inch of product surface area for ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid or sodium
ascorbate, and/or not more than 250 ppm or 0.9 milligrams per square inch of surface area for citric acid or sodium citrate
to achieve the intended technical effects.

<TEXT>
 

FSIS also proposed that processors who apply these substances to cuts of fresh beef and lamb be required to follow an
approved PQC program as set forth in 9 CFR 318.4(d). Neither processing of such products nor distribution of such products
in commerce would be permitted until such PQC programs are approved and utilized according to the requirements set
forth in 9 CFR 318.4(e). All such PQC programs would cover certain critical control points, including: (1) The condition
of the meat before treatment (it must be fresh or previously frozen and maintained in a wholesome condition, evidenced
by time and temperature records from the point of slaughter), (2) solution formulation control, (3) single application
control, (4) finished product ingredient analysis monitoring, and (5) integrity of the packaging during storage,
transportation, and distribution. This would ensure that these substances applied to the surface of the meat cuts
to delay discoloration would not be applied in excessive amounts; therefore, the discoloration of the cuts would
occur before the onset of microbiological spoilage.
Cuts of fresh pork treated with ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, sodium citrate, and citric acid
are currently required by 9 CFR 317.8(b)(37) to be labeled with a statement identifying these substances by their
common and usual name and the purpose for which they are used; e.g., ``Sprayed with a solution of water, ascorbic acid
and citric acid to maintain color.'' This statement is required to be shown on the label in a prominent manner, contiguous
to the product name, in letters of the same style and type and not less than one-fourth the size of the largest letter
in the product name. After reassessing its overall policy regarding prominent labeling, FSIS set forth in the proposed
rule that 9 CFR 317.8(b)(37) requiring qualifying statements on fresh pork cuts would be removed and reserved.
In addition, on November 4, 1992, the Agency published in the 

Federal Register

 a proposed rule (57 FR 52596) to eliminate those prominent disclosure requirements for product name qualifiers where
the inclusion of a substance does not significantly alter the basic identity of the finished product or where the prominently
disclosed information can be found in the ingredients statement. Such rule, in part, would eliminate product name
qualifiers on fresh pork cuts treated with ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, sodium citrate, and
citric acid. FSIS is considering the publication of a final rule on prominent labeling which would become effective
in the near future. FSIS believes that such action would not deprive consumers of informative labeling because all
substances used in the preparation of a product are required to be listed in the ingredients statement (9 CFR 317.2(f)(1)).
However, as indicated in the proposed rule on ascorbic acid and other substances, FSIS is removing and reserving 9
CFR 318.7(b)(37). Therefore, as of the effective date of this final rule, qualifying statements, which identify
the presence of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, sodium citrate, and citric acid on fresh port cuts,
are no longer required on the labeling of fresh pork cuts which contain such substances.
FSIS also stated in the preamble to the proposed rule that 9 CFR 317.8(b)(6) prohibits the word ``fresh'' on labels
to designate product which has been salted for preservation. Therefore, FSIS would not allow the word ``fresh'' to
be used on the labels of products treated with ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, sodium citrate,
and citric acid.
FSIS proposed to amend the table of approved substances in 9 CFR 318.7 by revising the current entry for the Class of
substance titled ``Miscellaneous,'' under the Substance column for ``Ascorbic, erythorbic acid, citric acid,
sodium ascorbate, and sodium citrate'' to include such use on fresh beef and lamb cuts, along with the existing use
on fresh pork cuts. In addition, FSIS proposed that the entry be revised to clarify the permitted use and levels of such
substances on fresh pork cuts. The Agency also proposed to revise the purpose of these substances from ``to maintain
color'' to ``to delay discoloration'' for clarification.


Discussion of Comments


FSIS received three comments in response to the proposed rule. The comments were submitted by a consultant and two
food manufacturers. The commenters fully supported the proposed rule.
After review of the comments and other information, the Administrator has determined that the application of ascorbic
acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium citrate to the surface of fresh beef and lamb cuts,
as permitted in the rule, will not render the products in which they are used adulterated or misbranded or otherwise
not in compliance with the Federal Meat Inspection Act. The Administrator has further determined that these substances
will be functional and suitable for the products and will be permitted for use on the surface of fresh beef and lamb cuts
as the lowest level necessary to accomplish the stated technical effect.

ACTION:

 Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On September 29, 1993 (58 FR 50859), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (``NRC'' or ``Commission'') published a proposed
rule granting a petition for rulemaking submitted by a number of colleges and universities possessing NRC licenses.
The petition requested that the NRC reinstate the exemption from annual fees previously given nonprofit educational
licensees. The proposed rule requested public comment solely on that issue. The exemption had been eliminated in
a final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 20, 1993. After careful consideration, the Commission has decided to reinstate the annual fee exemption for
nonprofit educational institutions.

I. Background



Soon after publishing its final rule establishing the NRC's FY 1993 fee schedules (58 FR 38666; July 20, 1993), which
included for the first time annual fees for previously exempt nonprofit educational institutions

1

, the Commission received a petition for reconsideration of that rule. The petition, filed by a number of colleges
and universities affected by the policy change, requested that the NRC reconsider its decision to charge annual fees
to such institutions. The petition asserted that the externalized benefits and public good resulting from use of
university research reactors in various fields of education would be lost if these fees were imposed upon college
and university licensees. (See Petition for Reconsideration of Final Rule (July 30, 1993) (appended to the Proposed
Rule for the Restoration of the Annual Fee Exemption to Nonprofit Educational Institutions, 58 FR 50859; September
29, 1993.)) The petition pointed to research in such fields as nuclear safety, medicine, archaeology, food science
and textiles, education of the public in nuclear matters, and to various benefits of education.





The petition relied upon a letter from economist Alfred Kahn to counsel for Cornell University, a petition signatory.
The Kahn letter referred to ``pure knowledge,'' especially nonproprietary university research made accessible
to the public free of charge, as ``the archetypical `public good,' in economic terms, the essential characteristic
of which is that, once produced, it can be made available more and more widely at zero economic cost.''

While considering whether to grant the petition for reconsideration, or in the alternative to grant some nonprofit
educational institutions individual ``public interest'' exemptions from the new annual fees, the NRC sent staff
members to a number of colleges and universities to learn more about the use of nuclear materials in educational programs
and the benefits that resulted from those materials' use. The Commission concluded, on the basis of these visits and
the arguments made in the petition for reconsideration, that it should propose to retract the new annual fees ($62,100
per research reactor license; lesser amounts for each materials license). Accordingly, on September 29, 1993 (58
FR 50859), the Commission published in the 

Federal Register

 a notice granting the petition and proposing to restore the annual fee exemption for nonprofit educational institutions.

The Commission received over 200 comments on the proposed rule, with the vast majority in favor of restoring the annual
fee exemption. (This number includes comments on the educational exemption provided to the Commission in response
to its Congressionally-mandated study of overall agency fee policy, see 58 FR 21116; April 14, 1993). After careful
review of the comments, and after studying the views of a professional economist engaged to assist in analyzing the
comments (see note 2 infra), the Commission has decided to make final its proposed reinstatement of the exemption
from annual fees for nonprofit educational institutions.

<TEXT>
 

As the Commission made clear in the proposed rule, it will not charge other licensees retroactively for the monetary
shortfall produced by the Commission's change in policy on the educational exemption. Therefore, for FY 1993 no licensees
will be charged additional fees to compensate for the restored exemption. In addition, because the educational exemption
is being restored for FYs 1991-92, there will be no refunds to power reactor licensees who paid increased annual
fees in those years due to the exemption of nonprofit educational institutions (a point also detailed in the proposed
rule).



II. Responses to Comments



Although the comment period expired on October 29, 1993, the NRC reviewed all comments received prior to November
13, 1993. The Commission received over 200 comments in response to the proposed rule. Copies of all comment letters
received are available for inspection in the NRC Public Document Room (``PDR''), 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level),
Washington, DC 20555.

1. 

Comment

. Most commenters were educational institutions, who argued that their educational and research activities with
licensed nuclear materials will have to be severely curtailed or halted altogether if the annual fee exemption is
not restored. They claimed that the annual fees would, in many cases, entirely subsume the budget for operation of
the research reactor or use of nuclear material. Many commenters also stated that there was no possibility of obtaining
more money for their operating budgets, and that the inevitable result of annual fees would therefore be an across-the-board
reduction in nuclear-related studies.



Response.

 The Commission is aware of the effect annual fees could have on nonprofit educational institutions, not only from
their comments but also from its own site visits. The Commission believes that much of the work done by these institutions
with nuclear materials, in both nuclear and non-nuclear fields of study, is extremely valuable and should not be impeded
or halted due to the new annual fees. Further, for reasons discussed later, subsidies for such activities are both
necessary and desirable.

2. 

Comment.

 A number of comments received from nonprofit educational institutions stated that their work produced externalized
benefits to society, in the words used in the DC Circuit's Allied-Signal decision, ``not captured in tuition or other
market prices.'' Among the benefits cited were research in fields such as nuclear safety, neutron activation analysis,
neutron radiography, archaeology, art history and biology. Much of this research, some commenters claimed, was
basic research done to advance science, not for profit or commercial use (although such an outcome might occur). One
commenter noted that it does not accept research grants and contracts without making them public, and publishes virtually
all its findings. The commenters asserted that this research, if halted due to new fees, would not likely be duplicated
or replaced by the private sector.



Response. 

The Commission agrees with commenters that much of the work done with nuclear materials in academia, if halted, would
simply not be continued in the private sector. In particular, the Commission was impressed by the arguments made regarding
basic research. The Commission believes that such research, done in the spirit of academic inquiry, is an integral
part of the programs run by educational institutions with NRC licenses.

<DOCNO> FR940317-0-00030 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940317-0-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission agrees with commenters' arguments that educational institutions' commitment to basic research
is largely unique, as it is not driven by the need to develop commercial uses. While there is undoubtedly much basic
research performed outside educational institutions, the Commission does not believe that it is an adequate substitute
for academic research. 

In the Commission's view, a major benefit resulting from educational institutions' use of nuclear reactors and materials
is the production of new knowledge through research, which the Commission would term a ``public good,'' as defined
in economic theory.

2

 Two characteristics of a public good like pure knowledge are its nondepletability and nonexcludability. That is,
one person's acquisition of knowledge does not reduce the amount available to others; further, it is not efficient_and
often is impossible, as a practical matter_to prevent others from acquiring it. These characteristics make it difficult
to recoup the costs of producing pure knowledge. Because the value of a public good may be very great, but the costs of
producing it impossible to recapture, it may be necessary to subsidize that good's production for production to occur
at all. In the Commission's view, that is true of the pure knowledge produced by nonprofit educational institutions,
and the Commission has therefore decided to exempt them from fees. 





Restoring the educational exemption will have additional beneficial consequences. Colleges and universities
not only produce research results and pure knowledge (what we have termed ``public goods''), but also other benefits
of great value to both the nuclear community and society as a whole. For instance, many of the students trained on research
reactors will likely become the next generation of nuclear reactor operators and engineers. The knowledge they gain
from their education in these fields will allow them to operate reactors and other nuclear facilities safely and effectively.
Knowledge attained through education will also be of value to those companies or Government agencies, including
the armed forces, who hire these students to perform nuclear-related work, which often cannot be done without extensive
education in the area. 

3. 

Comment. 

A number of commenters argued, for a variety of reasons, that the educational exemption should not be restored. Some
commenters stated that each licensee should pay its fair share. Others believed that for-profit entities benefit
the public as well and should not be penalized because they generate profits. Certain nonprofit commenters and medical
licensees argued that if the exemption were retained, it should be expanded to include nonprofit institutions and
medical licensees that are not now exempted from fees. A few commenters stated that in certain fields of study, schools
and university hospitals compete with private research laboratories and nonprofit hospitals, respectively, and
thus would receive an unfair subsidy from an annual fee exemption. One commenter went on to argue that such a subsidy
amounted to an unlawful promotion of atomic energy by the NRC. Another commenter requested that the proposed rule
be changed to exempt it from the annual fee, noting that it was the only Federally-owned research reactor not so exempted,
due to the level of its power output. 

A number of other commenters supported restoration of the educational exemption, but believed it should be funded
in a different manner. The two alternatives most popular with commenters were funding the exemption out of general
revenues, which would mean removing it from the fee base, or funding it via a surcharge on all licensees, not just power
reactor licensees. Those commenters favoring removal of the educational exemption from the fee base acknowledged
that such an outcome would require Congressional legislation. 



Response. 

After deliberating over whether the educational exemption should be restored, the Commission believes the wisest
policy decision is to exempt nonprofit educational licensees once again. Since the Commission published its final
rule in July 1993 abolishing the educational exemption, it has devoted an extraordinary amount of time and attention
to the question of whether to reverse that decision. It has reviewed hundreds of letters on the issue, fielded numerous
phone comments and inquiries, and sent staff members to study the issue by visiting college and university licensees.
In the Commission's view, the evidence taken as a whole leans strongly in favor of restoring that exemption, for the
reasons described above: that many educational licensees would be forced to halt their research and educational
activities due to lack of funds if NRC fee subsidies were withdrawn; that those activities would often not be continued
in the private sector, resulting in a serious loss of basic research in numerous areas of study; and that the public
good inherent in the production of knowledge made available to all is worthy of Government support. Such support would
not therefore constitute an unlawful subsidy or promotion of atomic energy.

The Commission has received anecdotal information from some commenters indicating that certain nonprofit research
institutions (which do not fall within the definition of nonprofit educational institution as provided in 10 CFR
171.5) and Federally-owned research reactors should receive the same treatment as educational institutions.

3

 However, the Commission does not believe it has sufficient information on which to base a generic exemption for such
research institutions and reactors. Because the proposed rule did not suggest that the educational exemption be
expanded in this way, the Commission received a smaller number of comments than are needed to make an informed decision
on this issue. For that reason, the current policy of charging such entities annual and user fees remains in effect.
Those nonprofit research institutions and Federally-owned research reactors who believe that they qualify for
an exemption from the annual fee based on the public good concept are, of course, free to request one from the Commission.
See 10 CFR 171.11. Depending on the outcome of any such requests, the Commission may need to revisit the question of
whether to make nonprofit research institutions generically exempt from fees in a future rulemaking. 





The Commission also believes that medical licensees should continue to pay annual fees. This is consistent with past
Commission practice. Contrary to some commenters' assertions, the Commission's fee policy does not result in a competitive
advantage for university medical licensees over nonprofit hospitals. Both are charged fees for licenses authorizing
medical treatment using licensed nuclear material.

4

 The Commission does not believe that medical licensees are analogous to nonprofit educational institutions. Their
function is not pure research and education, but primarily to provide services to paying customers. 





While the Commission does not dispute that medicine provides significant benefits to patients, such treatment is
both depletable and excludable. The benefits of medicine are therefore a private rather than a public good. By contrast,
an educational institution generally disseminates the results of its basic research to all who want it, even going
beyond the confines of the university itself, without receiving compensation from any of those benefitting from
that knowledge. The key to nonprofit educational licensees' singular treatment is not merely that they provide valuable
social benefits; rather, it is the existence of certain market failure considerations (discussed above) that apply
to producers of pure knowledge through basic research, but not to medical practitioners. The distinction between
educational and medical licensees is addressed at greater length in the Commission's 

Federal Register

 notice discussing the petition filed by the American College of Nuclear Physicians and the Society of Nuclear Medicine
seeking a fee exemption for medical licensees (published in the Proposed Rule Section of this issue of the 

Federal Register

). 

The Commission does not plan to adopt the suggestion of some commenters that most or all other licensees should contribute
something toward the costs of exempting nonprofit educational licensees. The agency, in any event, is not recouping
these costs for FY 1993, as it is legally precluded from retroactively collecting those costs from licensees. The
Commission in its Energy Policy Act-mandated review of fee policy has concluded that the costs of exempting nonprofit
educational institutions should be excluded from the fee base through legislation modifying OBRA-90. In its
study, the Commission concluded that if legislation to accomplish this is not enacted, these costs should continue
to be recovered through fees assessed to power reactor licensees.

4. 

Comment. 

A number of commenters have argued that the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (``AEA''), mandates NRC support of
education, and that accordingly the NRC must restore the educational exemption to conform to that mandate. In this
regard, some commenters made the point that their facilities were originally funded or provided to them by the AEC
or other Federal agencies. 



Response. 

The Commission acknowledges its longstanding policy of supporting education, and believes that such support has
been vital to the success of nuclear and nuclear-related education. That notwithstanding, the Commission does not
view its education policy, or the exhortatory language of the AEA, as mandating that colleges and universities be
exempt from NRC fees. The Commission has decided to restore the fee exemption as a policy matter, not a matter of legal
compulsion. 

5. 

Comment. 

Many educational institutions commented that it made little sense to charge them annual fees when much of their nuclear-education
funding was derived from Federal agencies such as the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation. Another
commenter argued that State agencies were nonprofit in nature and should be exempted in the same manner as colleges
and universities. 



Response. 

The Commission for reasons discussed above decided to reinstate the exemption for nonprofit educational institutions.
The fact that a number of these institutions received funding from Federal agencies was not a factor in the final decision.
The Commission's decision was based primarily on who received the benefits of the services rendered, rather than
who funded the underlying activities. 

The Commission also notes that it charges fees to other governmental licensees, including both Federal and State
agencies. (Virtually no Federal agencies are charged user fees under part 170 due to a prohibition against such fees
in the Independent Offices Appropriation Act, see 31 U.S.C. 9701.) It finds no basis for changing its historical policy
with respect to these entities in this rulemaking. This issue is addressed in the Commission's Report to Congress
on fee policy, cited earlier in this rulemaking. 

6. 

Comment. 

Some educational commenters stated that they should fall under the category of small entities, and asked whether
the definition of ``small entity'' could be broadened to include a greater number of institutions than currently
fall within the definition. 



Response. 

The Commission intends to re-examine the size standards it uses to define small entities within the context of compliance
with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Commission will conduct this review within the context of the proposed revisions
of small business size standards proposed by the Small Business Administration (``SBA'') (58 FR 46573; September
2, 1993). The Commission will not complete its review until the SBA promulgates a final rule containing the revised
size standards. Until these activities are completed, it would be premature to address this comment. 



III. Final Action_Changes Included in Final Rule 



The Commission has made only one change to its FY 1993 final rule establishing annual and user fee schedules for that
fiscal year. As it proposed, the Commission has amended  171.11 to exempt nonprofit educational institutions
from annual fees. The new exemption provision is identical to that contained in the FY 1991 and 1992 final fee rules.
Because the final fee schedule for FY 1993 has already been issued, the Commission will not be charging any other licensees
for the fees that would have been paid for FY 1993 by the newly exempt group of licensees. For that reason, no new fee schedule
is being published at this time. A revised NRC fee schedule incorporating these changes and billing other licensees
for the FY 1994 exemption's costs will be included in the FY 1994 proposed fee rule.

<DOCNO> FR940317-0-00033 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940317-0-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Because the Commission has decided in this final rule to reinstate the annual fee exemption for nonprofit educational
institutions, the NRC will cancel the FY 1993 annual fee invoices for those licensed activities exempt under this
final rule. Accordingly, refunds will be made to those licensees who paid the FY 1993 annual fees and are now exempt
under this final rule. Additionally, no further action will be taken on nonprofit educational institutions' exemption
requests, which had been held in abeyance pending this final rule. 

Some nonprofit educational institutions filed applications requesting termination, downgraded, possession-only
or combined licenses to avoid the FY 1993 annual fee. If those applications are still pending, the licensees should
notify the NRC within 30 calendar days from the effective date of this rule if they wish to rescind their applications
due to the exemption's reinstatement. Absent such notification, the NRC will process the applications as filed.
There are instances where the NRC has already completed final action on some of the applications in question. The affected
nonprofit educational institutions are advised that if they wish to reinstate their previous license authority,
they must file an application to do so with the NRC. Such applications for reinstatement of previous license authority
are exempted from fees under 10 CFR 170.11(a)(4) as appropriate. 



IV. Section-by-Section Analysis 



Section 171.11 Exemptions 



Paragraph (a) of this section is amended by adding nonprofit educational institutions, as defined in  171.5,
to the list of those entities exempted from annual fees by the Commission. A discussion of this change in fee policy
is found in Sections I and II of this final rule. 



V. Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion 



The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(1).
Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement has been prepared for the
final regulation. 



VI. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 



This final rule contains no information collection requirements and, therefore, is not subject to the requirements
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). 



VII. Regulatory Analysis 



With respect to 10 CFR part 171, on November 5, 1990 the Congress passed Public Law No. 101-508, the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA-90). OBRA-90, as amended, requires that for FYs 1991 through 1998 approximately
100 percent of the NRC's budget authority be recovered through the assessment of fees. To accomplish this statutory
requirement, on July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38666), the NRC, in accordance with  171.13, published in the 

Federal Register

 the final amount of the FY 1993 annual fees for operating reactor licensees, fuel cycle licensees, materials licensees,
and holders of Certificates of Compliance, registrations of sealed source and devices and QA program approvals,
and Government agencies. Consistent with OBRA-90 and its Conference Committee Report, the Commission has
ensured that_

(1) The annual fees are based on the Commission's FY 1993 budget of $540 million less the amounts collected from part
170 fees and the funds directly appropriated from the Nuclear Waste Fund to cover the NRC's high level waste program;


(2) The annual fees, to the maximum extent practicable, have a reasonable relationship to the cost of regulatory services
provided by the Commission; and 

(3) Annual fees are assessed to those licensees which the Commission, in its discretion, determines can fairly, equitably
and practicably contribute to their payment. 

Therefore, when developing the annual fees for operating power reactors, the NRC continues to consider the various
reactor vendors, the types of containment, and the location of those reactors. The annual fees for fuel cycle licensees,
materials licensees, and holders of certificates, registrations and approvals and for licenses issued to Government
agencies take into account the type of facility or approval and the classes of the licensees. 

10 CFR part 171, which established annual fees for operating power reactors effective October 20, 1986 (51 FR 33224;
September 18, 1986), was challenged and upheld in its entirety in 

Florida Power and Light Company 

v. 

United States, 

846 F.2d 765 (DC Cir. 1988), 

cert. denied,

 490 U.S. 1045 (1989). 

10 CFR part 171, which established fees based on the FY 1989 budget, was also legally challenged. As a result of the Supreme
Court decision in 

Skinner 

v. 

Mid-American Pipeline Co., 

109 S.Ct. 1726 (1989), and the denial of certiorari in 

Florida Power and Light, 

all of the lawsuits were withdrawn. 

The NRC's FY 1991 annual fee rule was largely upheld recently by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals in 

Allied-Signal 

v. 

NRC, 

988 F.2d 146 (DC Cir. 1993). 



VIII. Regulatory Flexibility Certification 



As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies that this final rule as adopted
does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



IX. Backfit Analysis

The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this final rule and that a backfit analysis
is not required for this final rule. The backfit analysis is not required because these amendments do not require the
modification of or additions to systems, structures, components, or design of a facility or the design approval or
manufacturing license for a facility or the procedures or organization required to design, construct or operate
a facility. 



List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 171 



Annual charges, Byproduct material, Holders of certificates, registrations, and approvals, Intergovernmental
relations, Non-payment penalties, Nuclear materials, Nuclear power plants and reactors, Source material, Special
nuclear material. 




For the reasons set out in the preamble and under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and 5 U.S.C.
552 and 553, the NRC hereby adopts the following amendments to 10 CFR part 171. 



PART 171_ANNUAL FEES FOR REACTOR OPERATING LICENSES, AND FUEL CYCLE LICENSES AND MATERIALS LICENSES, INCLUDING
HOLDERS OF CERTIFICATES OF COMPLIANCE, REGISTRATIONS, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM APPROVALS AND GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES LICENSED BY THE NRC 



1. The authority citation for part 171 is revised to read as follows:

U.S.C. 5841); sec. 2903, Pub. L. 102-486, 106 Stat. 3125 (42 U.S.C. 2214 note).




2. In  171.11, paragraph (a) is revised to read as follows: 



 171.11 

Exemptions. 



(a) An annual fee is not required for: 

(1) A construction permit or license applied for by, or issued to, a nonprofit educational institution for a production
or utilization facility, other than a power reactor, or for the possession and use of byproduct material, source material,
or special nuclear material. This exemption does not apply to those byproduct, source, or special nuclear material
licenses which authorize: 

(i) Human use; 

(ii) Remunerated services to other persons; 

(iii) Distribution of byproduct material, source material, or special nuclear material or products containing
byproduct material, source material, or special nuclear material; or 

(iv) Activities performed under a Government contract. 

(2) Federally-owned research reactors used primarily for educational training and academic research purposes.
For purposes of this exemption, the term research reactor means a nuclear reactor that_

(i) Is licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under section 104 c. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C.
2134(c)) for operation at a thermal power level of 10 megawatts or less; and 

(ii) If so licensed for operation at a thermal power level of more than 1 megawatt, does not contain_

(A) A circulating loop through the core in which the licensee conducts fuel experiments; 

(B) A liquid fuel loading; or 

(C) An experimental facility in the core in excess of 16 square inches in cross-section.

Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled; Replacement of Lost, Damaged, or Stolen Excluded
Resources (Hurricane Andrew) 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Social Security Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rules with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Some supplemental security income (SSI) recipients who were victims of Hurricane Andrew in south Florida have not
been able to replace or repair their damaged homes due to circumstances beyond their control. This means that some
SSI recipients will have resources (insurance money) in amounts that will disqualify them for SSI benefits if held
for periods exceeding the maximum 18-month period provided in regulations at  416.1232. Since Hurricane Andrew
occurred in August 1992, some SSI recipients could become ineligible as early as March 1994. We are codifying in regulations,
interim final rules which provide additional time for victims of Hurricane Andrew to make arrangements to effect
repair or replacement of excluded property without interruption of their SSI benefits.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In August 1992, Hurricane Andrew devastated south Florida causing damage estimated in excess of $18 billion. According
to published reports, of the 47,000 homes destroyed, 32,000 are still uninhabitable. Only 10 percent of 140,000 damaged
homes have been rebuilt or repaired because the number of contractors available to rebuild homes is steadily decreasing.




We estimate that approximately 450 SSI recipients, who were victims of Hurricane Andrew, have received payments
from private insurance companies for the repair or replacement of their property, but because of the extent of the
devastation, they have not yet been able to repair or replace their homes and property. 




The regulations at  416.1205(c) provide that SSI recipients can have no more than $2,000 in countable resources
and SSI couples can have no more than $3,000. The regulations at  416.1237 provide that assistance received
under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act or other assistance provided under a Federal statute because
of a catastrophe which is declared to be a major disaster by the President of the United States or comparable assistance
received from a State or local government, or from a disaster assistance organization, is excluded permanently under
 416.1210 in determining countable resources. 


The regulations at  416.1232 complement the disaster assistance exclusion by providing that cash or in-kind
items for the repair or replacement of lost, stolen, or damaged excluded resources are not treated as resources for
9 months, plus one extension for a reasonable period up to an additional 9 months for good cause if circumstances do
not permit repair or replacement within the initial 9-month period and the individual intends to use the funds for
repair or replacement. 


Excluded resources generally include the individual's home, household goods and personal effects, and the automobile,
as are described in   416.1212, 416.1216 and 416.1218 respectively. 


Private insurance payments do not qualify as disaster assistance and, therefore, cannot be permanently excluded.
For some of these SSI recipients, the maximum period of 18 months during which monies to repair or replace excluded
resources are not treated as resources is about to expire. Because of the vast devastation caused by Hurricane Andrew,
these individuals have not been able to rebuild or repair their homes. We estimate that, as early as March 1994, some
of these individuals will begin to lose SSI eligibility. 


We propose interim final regulations to amend  416.1232(b) for victims of Hurricane Andrew only, to extend
the maximum 18-month period during which cash or in-kind replacement received from any source for purposes of repairing
or replacing an excluded resource is not treated as a resource: 



</SUPPLEM>

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940317-0-00037 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940317-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 For an additional 12 months as long as the individual intends to repair or replace the property and good cause
still exists for not yet having done so. 


Existing regulations for the exclusion of monies to repair or replace an excluded resource have been adequate to cover
past situations, including other disasters. However, the damage caused by Hurricane Andrew was so extensive and
destroyed so much of the existing infrastructure (e.g., governmental and public services and utilities, construction
and repair industry and equipment, etc.) that the current maximum 18-month period, in this context, is not adequate.
Many SSI recipients hurt by Hurricane Andrew who have received insurance settlements have not been able to rebuild
or repair their homes or even contract for those services. Through this regulatory change, we are providing additional
time for victims of this extraordinary disaster to make arrangements to effect repair or replacement without interruption
in their SSI benefits. 


During the extension period, we will make periodic contacts with each individual to determine whether the individual
still intends to repair or replace the property and, if so, whether good cause for not yet having done so still exists.
We will obtain evidence to make these determinations. 




Regulatory Procedures





We are publishing these new SSI resource counting rules as interim final rules with a request for comments instead
of as proposed rules. The Department, even when not required by statute, as a matter of policy, generally follows the
Administrative Procedure Act (APA) notice of proposed rulemaking and public comment procedures specified in 
5 U.S.C. 553 in the development of its regulations. The APA provides exceptions to its notice and comment procedures
when an agency finds that there is good cause for dispensing with such procedures on the basis that they are impracticable,
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. After due consideration, we have determined that, under 5 U.S.C.
553(b)(B), good cause exists for waiver of notice of proposed rulemaking on these regulations because such procedures
would be contrary to the public interest. The process of notice and comment rulemaking generally requires many months
before culminating in a final rule. If SSI recipients who are victims of Hurricane Andrew do not receive the beneficial
effect of this rule by March 1994, some will lose their SSI eligibility. Since it is in the public interest that these
individuals continue to receive SSI benefits while they make arrangements to repair or replace their excluded resources
that have been damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Andrew, we believe that the public interest warrants immediate promulgation
of these rules. Accordingly, promulgation of these rules pursuant to notice and comment rulemaking would be contrary
to the public interest and thus may be dispensed with pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). However, we are asking the public
to comment on these interim final rules and will determine if these regulations need revision on consideration of
any comments received. 




Executive Order 12866 




These interim final regulations do not meet the criteria for a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of
E.O. 12866 and, thus, are not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review under E.O. 12866. 




Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 




These interim final regulations do not contain reporting requirements. However, they extend the initial regulation
that did. Inadvertently, we did not publish a narrative for that regulation concerning the need for clearance by the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB). We would normally seek approval of the reporting requirements contained in
the initial regulation (under the Paperwork Reduction Act) from OMB. We are not doing so in this situation because
we already have their clearance to collect this kind of information using the SSA-795 (Statement of Claimant
or Other Person), OMB Control Number 0960-0045. 


We expect that approximately 450 SSI recipients will be involved, and that it will take them an estimated five minutes
each to provide this information. The annual burden for this reporting requirement is estimated at 37.5 hours. The
respondents are SSI recipients who have excess countable resources as a result of the damage caused by Hurricane Andrew.





Regulatory Flexibility Act 




We certify that these interim final regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities because they affect eligibility for or the amount of SSI payments of individuals. Therefore, a regulatory
flexibility analysis as provided in Public 
Law 96-354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required.

(b) The initial 9-month time period will be extended for a reasonable period up to an additional 9 months where we find
the individual had good cause for not replacing or repairing the resource. An individual will be found to have good
cause when circumstances beyond his or her control prevented the repair or replacement or the contracting for the
repair or replacement of the resource. If good cause is found for an individual, any unused cash (and interest) is counted
as a resource beginning with the month after the good cause extension period expires. 

Exception

: 

For victims of Hurricane Andrew only

, the extension period for good cause may be extended for up to an additional 12 months beyond the 9-month extension
when we find that the individual had good cause for not replacing or repairing an excluded resource within the 9-month
extension.

Antibiotic Drugs; Cefmetazole and Cefmetazole Sodium Injection


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the antibiotic drug regulations to provide for the inclusion of
accepted standards for a new bulk form of cefmetazole and for its use in a new dosage form of cefmetazole sodium, cefmetazole
sodium injection. The manufacturer has supplied sufficient data and information to establish its safety and efficacy.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA has evaluated data submitted in accordance with regulations promulgated under section 507 of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 357), as amended, with respect to a request for approval of (1) a new bulk form of cefmetazole,
and (2) for its use in a new dosage form of cefmetazole sodium, cefmetazole sodium injection. The agency has concluded
that the data supplied by the manufacturer concerning this antibiotic drug are adequate to establish its safety and
efficacy when used as directed in the labeling and that the regulations should be amended in 21 CFR part 442 to provide
for the inclusion of accepted standards for this product.


Environmental Impact


The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.


Submitting Comments and Filing Objections


This final rule announces standards that FDA has accepted in a request for approval of an antibiotic drug. Because
this final rule is not controversial and because, when effective, it provides notice of accepted standards, FDA finds
that notice and comment procedure is unnecessary and not in the public interest. This final rule, therefore, is effective
April 18, 1994. However, interested persons may, on or before April 18, 1994, submit written comments to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Any person who will be adversely affected by this final rule may file objections to it and request a hearing. Reasonable
grounds for the hearing must be shown. Any person who decides to seek a hearing must file (1) on or before April 18, 1994,
a written notice of participation and request for a hearing, and (2) on or before May 16, 1994, the data, information,
and analyses on which the person relies to justify a hearing, as specified in 21 CFR 314.300. A request for a hearing
may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and
substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. If it conclusively appears from the face of the data, information,
and factual analyses in the request for a hearing that no genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the action
taken by this order, or if a request for a hearing is not made in the required format or with the required analyses, the
Commissioner of Food and Drugs will enter summary judgment against the person(s) who request(s) the hearing, making
findings and conclusions and denying a hearing. All submissions must be filed in three copies, identified with the
docket number appearing in the heading of this document and filed with the Dockets Management Branch.
The procedures and requirements governing this order, a notice of participation and request for a hearing, a submission
of data, information, and analyses to justify a hearing, other comments, and grant or denial of a hearing are contained
in 21 CFR 314.300.
All submissions under this order, except for data and information prohibited from public disclosure under 21 U.S.C.
331(j) or 18 U.S.C. 1905, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

Accuracy-Related Penalty


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Temporary regulations.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains temporary regulations relating to the accuracy-related penalty under chapter 1 of the Internal
Revenue Code. These regulations affect all persons that file returns of income tax and provide guidance necessary
to comply with these changes. These regulations are necessary to effect changes to the accuracy-related penalty
made by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


These temporary regulations set forth certain changes made to the accuracy-related penalty in section 6662 of the
Internal Revenue Code (Code) by section 13251 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993). These
changes eliminated the disclosure exception for the negligence penalty (section 6662(b)(1) of the Code) and raised
the disclosure standard for purposes of the penalties for disregarding rules or regulations (section 6662(b)(1)
of the Code) and a substantial understatement of income tax (section 6662(b)(2) of the Code) from ``not frivolous''
to ``reasonable basis.'' See section 13251 of OBRA 1993 and H. Rep. No. 213, 103rd Cong., 1st Sess. 669 (1993) (the Conference
Report).
The legislative history to OBRA 1993 indicates that this ``reasonable basis'' standard is a relatively high standard
of tax reporting that is significantly higher than the ``not frivolous'' disclosure standard previously applicable
to taxpayers under section 6662 of the Code and currently applicable to preparers under section 6694 of the Code. See
Conference Report, at p.669. A position is not frivolous if it is not ``patently improper.'' See  1.6694-2(c)(2)
of the Income Tax Regulations and current  1.6662-3(b)(3). The legislative history to OBRA 1993 also
provides that the reasonable basis standard is not satisfied by a position that is merely arguable or merely a colorable
claim. See Conference Report, at p.669.
In addition to adopting the new reasonable basis standard as the standard that a disclosed return position must satisfy
to avoid the disregard and substantial understatement penalties, Congress adopted the new reasonable basis standard
as the standard that a return position must satisfy to avoid the negligence penalty. See Conference Report at p.669.

Treasury requests comments on how the new reasonable basis standard should be defined for purposes of the negligence,
disregard, and substantial understatement penalties.


Explanation of Changes


Section 1.6662-3(a) of the regulations generally provides that if any portion of an underpayment, as defined
in section 6664(a) of the Code and  1.6664-2, of any income tax imposed under subtitle A of the Code that
is required to be shown on a return is attributable to negligence or disregard of rules or regulations, there is added
to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such portion. Section 1.6662-3(b)(1) defines ``negligence'' to include
any failure to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue laws or to exercise ordinary
and reasonable care in the preparation of a tax return. Currently,  1.6662-3(c) generally provides that
no penalty under section 6662(b)(1) may be imposed on any portion of any underpayment that is attributable to negligence
or a position contrary to a rule or regulation if the position is adequately disclosed and is not frivolous, if the requirements
of that section are met.
Section 1.6662-4(a) of the regulations generally provides that if any portion of an underpayment of any income
tax imposed under subtitle A of the Code that is required to be shown on a return is attributable to a substantial understatement
of such income tax, there is added to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such portion. Section 1.6662-4(a)
further provides that, except in the case of any item attributable to a tax shelter, an understatement is reduced by
the portion of the understatement that is attributable to positions for which there was substantial authority or
adequate disclosure. Currently, under  1.6662-4(e)(2), this adequate disclosure exception will not
apply if the position on the return is frivolous.
As a result of OBRA 1993, the minimum standard that a disclosed return position must satisfy to avoid either the penalty
for disregarding rules or regulations or for a substantial understatement of income tax has been raised from ``not
frivolous'' to ``reasonable basis.'' In addition, there is no longer a disclosure exception for the negligence penalty
and, to avoid that penalty, the return position generally must satisfy the new reasonable basis standard.
These rules generally apply to returns that are due (without regard to extensions for filing) after December 31, 1993.
However, the rules relating to changes to the penalties for negligence or disregard of rules or regulations will not
apply to returns, including qualified amended returns, filed on or before March 14, 1994.


Special Analyses


It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, these temporary regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
for comment on their impact on small business.


Drafting Information


The principal author of these regulations is David L. Meyer, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel, Income Tax and Accounting,
Internal Revenue Service. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.

<ACTION>

Technical amendment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document contains corrections to regulations published on February 17, 1993 (58 FR 8884). That Interim Final
Rule changed the length categories of recreational vessels subject to the recreational vessel fee (RVF) for calendar
years 1993 and 1994, as required by Section 501 of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act of 1992.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background




The Interim Final Rule, as published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 8884; February 17, 1993), provided amendatory language revising the categories of vessels, by length, that
were subject to the Recreational Vessel Fee for calendar years 1993 and 1994. However, the Interim Final Rule also
contained incorrect amendatory language revising section 1.30-1 which caused the text of former paragraph
(c) and the introductory text of paragraph (d) of that section to be mistakenly deleted. Since the purpose of the rulemaking
was only to implement Section 501 of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act of 1992, Public Law 102-587,
the amendatory language should have redesignated paragraphs (c) and (d) of  1.30-1 as paragraphs (d)
and (e), respectively, rather than causing them to be deleted. This document revises 33 CFR 1.30-1 to redesignate
and restore the deleted text as it formerly appeared in the CFR.




Need for Correction



As published, the Interim Final Rule omitted information on applicability of the fees to vessels operated 
on navigable waters of the United States.

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Legal Services Corporation (``Corporation'') is required by law to establish maximum income levels for individuals
eligible for legal assistance. This document updates the specified income levels to reflect the annual amendments
to the Federal Poverty Guidelines as issued by the Department of Health and Human Services.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 1007(a)(2) of the Legal Services Corporation Act (``Act''), 42 U.S.C. 2996f(a)(2), requires the Corporation
to establish maximum income levels for individuals eligible for legal assistance, and the Act provides that other
specified factors shall be taken into account along with income. Section 1611.3(b) of the Corporation's regulations
establishes a maximum income level equivalent to one hundred and twenty-five percent (125%) of the official Federal
Poverty Income Guidelines.




Responsibility for revision of the official Federal Poverty Income Guidelines was shifted in 1982 from the Community
Services Administration to the Department of Health and Human Services. The revised figures for 1994 set out below
are equivalent to 125% of the current official Poverty Guidelines as set out at 58 FR 6277 (Feb. 10, 1994).

SUMMARY:

 NMFS is rescinding the closure to directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the Western Regulatory Area of the Gulf of Alaska
(GOA) to allow a 48-hour directed fishery. This action is necessary to fully utilize the total allowable catch (TAC)
of Atka mackerel in that area. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the GOA 
Exclusive Economic Zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce 
according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the 
Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery 
Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is 
governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 
and 672. 


In accordance with  672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the annual TAC for Atka mackerel in the Western Regulatory Area of
the GOA, was established by the final 1994 groundfish specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994), as 2,500 metric
tons (mt). The final 1994 groundfish specifications also closed the directed fishery for Atka mackerel in the Western
Regulatory Area of the GOA under  672.20(c)(2). 
The Regional Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, in accordance with  672.20(c)(2)(ii), has determined that the
TAC of Atka mackerel in the Western Regulatory Area of the GOA is sufficient to allow a 48-hour directed fishery. Therefore,
NMFS is rescinding the closure to directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the Western Regulatory Area of the GOA as of
12 noon A.l.t., March 14, 1994. 
In accordance with  672.20(c)(2)(ii), the Regional Director has established a directed fishing allowance
of 2,300 mt, with the remaining 200 mt to be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the area.
The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance will be attained by a 48-hour directed fishery
for Atka mackerel. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the Western Regulatory
Area of the GOA, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., March 16, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.

 Interpretation; Solicitation of comments. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is publishing its views with respect to the disclosure
obligations of participants in the municipal securities markets under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities
laws, both in connection with primary offerings and on a continuing basis with respect to the secondary market. This
interpretive guidance is intended to assist municipal securities issuers, brokers, dealers and municipal securities
dealers in meeting their obligations under the antifraud provisions. The Commission is seeking comment on issues
discussed in this release and possible future agency action. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In a companion release, the Commission is proposing rule amendments that prohibit a broker, dealer or municipal securities
dealer from underwriting a municipal issue unless the issuer agrees to disseminate information to the secondary
market and from recommending the purchase of a municipal security without reviewing such information. 



I. Executive Summary



The recent high volume of municipal securities offerings, as well as the growing ownership of municipal securities
by individual investors, has highlighted the need for improved disclosure practices in the municipal securities
market, particularly in the secondary market. To encourage and expedite the ongoing efforts by market participants
to improve disclosure practices, and to assist market participants in meeting their obligations under the antifraud
provisions, the Commission is publishing its views with respect to disclosures under the federal securities laws
in the municipal market. 

This interpretive release addresses the following: 





(1) With respect to primary offering disclosure, despite the significant improvement in disclosure practices in
recent years as a result of voluntary initiatives, increased attention needs to be directed at 





 Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest and material financial relationships among issuers, advisers
and underwriters, including those arising from political contributions; 


 Disclosure regarding the terms and risks of securities being offered; 


 Disclosure of the issuer's or obligor's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. This
information should include audited financial statements (or disclosure that the financial statements were not
subject to audit) and an explanation of the accounting principles followed in the preparation of the financial statements,
unless the statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (``GAAP'') or
accompanied by a quantified explanation of any deviation from GAAP;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940317-0-00051 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940317-0-00022 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Disclosure of the issuer's plans regarding the provision of information to the secondary market; and 


 Timely delivery of preliminary official statements to underwriters and potential investors. 

(2) The Commission is renewing its recommendation for legislation to repeal the exemption for corporate obligations
underlying certain conduit securities from the registration and reporting requirements of the federal securities
laws. 

(3) Particularly because of their public nature, issuers in the municipal market routinely make public statements
and issue reports that can affect the market for their securities; without a mechanism for providing ongoing disclosures
to investors, these disclosures may cause the issuer to violate the antifraud provisions. 

Basic mechanisms to address potential antifraud liability include: 


 Publication of financial information, including audited financial statements and other financial and operating
information, on at least an annual basis; 


 Timely reporting of material events reflecting upon the creditworthiness of the issuer or the obligor and
the terms of its securities, including material defaults, draws on reserves, adverse rating changes and receipt
of an adverse tax opinion; and 


 Submission of such information to an information repository. 

(4) Underwriters and municipal securities dealers are key players in maintaining the quality of disclosure in the
municipal securities markets. The underwriter has a duty to review the issuer's disclosure documents before offering,
selling or bidding for the securities and to have a reasonable basis for its belief as to the accuracy and completeness
of the representations in the documents. Municipal dealers must have a reasonable basis for recommending the purchase
of securities. 

In a companion release,

1

 the Commission is proposing for comment two related rule amendments, the first proposing to prohibit a broker, dealer
or municipal securities dealer from underwriting a municipal issue unless the issuer makes a commitment to provide
annual and event-related secondary market information to a designated repository; and the second proposing to prohibit
a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer from recommending purchases of such issues in the secondary market
if it does not review such information.

II. Introduction




A. The Municipal Securities Market 



As detailed in the recent Staff Report on the Municipal Securities Market, the market for municipal securities is
characterized by great diversity and high volume. Issuers, estimated to number approximately 50,000, include state
governments, cities, towns, counties, and special subdivisions, such as special purpose districts and public authorities.
It is estimated that there currently are 1.3 million municipal issues outstanding, representing approximately
$1.2 trillion in securities.

2

 In 1993, a record level of over $335 billion in municipal securities was sold, representing over 17,000 issues. This
record financing was heavily influenced by refundings. Nevertheless, the level of long term new money financings,
representing 49% of financings for the year, reflected continued growth. In 1993, there were $142 billion of new money
long term financings, compared to $81 billion in 1988, a 75% increase.

3

 






In recent years, the forms of securities used to meet the financing needs of these issuers have become increasingly
diverse and complex. For example, conduit bonds, certificates of participation, and a variety of derivative products
have joined traditional general obligation and revenue bonds as prevalent forms of municipal financing.

4

 





In addition, there has been a change in the investor profile in the municipal securities market. By 1992, individual
investors, including those holding through mutual funds, held 75% of the municipal debt outstanding, compared to
44% in 1983.

5

 





Along with the changing investor profile, there has been a change in investor strategy. Traditionally, municipal
bondholders have been buy and hold investors; however, this strategy has changed significantly with the growth and
development of municipal bond funds. Many of these funds actively trade their portfolio securities to take advantage
of market conditions or to meet redemption needs. 



B. SEC Oversight of the Municipal Securities Market 



As the agency charged with administering the federal securities laws and overseeing this nation's securities markets,
the Commission has an obligation to protect investors in the municipal markets from fraud, including misleading
disclosures. As the New York City report stated nearly two decades ago: 







By virtue of the large dollar volume of municipal securities issued and outstanding each year, such securities are
a major factor in the Nation's economy and the national securities markets. In light of the national scope of the municipal
securities markets, there is an overriding federal interest in assuring that there is adequate disclosure of all
material information by issuers of municipal securities. 

Although municipalities have certain unique attributes by virtue of their political nature, insofar as they are
issuers of securities, they are subject to the proscription against false and misleading disclosures.

6

 





The burgeoning volume and complexity of municipal securities offerings, as well as the retail nature of the market,
heighten the need for market participants to seek to prevent fraud through the timely provision of material information
concerning municipal issuers and securities. 

While Congress exempted offerings of municipal securities from the registration requirements and civil liability
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933,

7

 and a mandated system of periodic reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,

8

 it did not exempt transactions in municipal securities from the coverage of the antifraud provisions of section 17(a)
of the Securities Act,

9

 section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.

10

 These antifraud provisions prohibit any person, including municipal issuers and brokers, dealers and municipal
securities dealers, from making a false or misleading statement of material fact, or omitting any material facts
necessary to make statements made by that person not misleading, in connection with the offer, purchase or sale of
any security. In addition, brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers are subject to regulations adopted
by the Commission, including those regulations adopted to define and prevent fraud.

11

 Municipal securities dealers are also subject to rules promulgated by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board
(``MSRB'').

12

 










C. Disclosure Practices and Calls for Enhanced Disclosure 



In the absence of a statutory scheme for municipal securities registration and reporting, disclosure by municipal
issuers has been governed by the demands of market participants and antifraud strictures. Spurred by the New York
City fiscal crisis in 1975 and the Washington Public Power Supply System defaults,

13

 participants in the municipal securities market have developed extensive guidance to improve the level and quality
of disclosure in primary offerings of municipal securities, and to a more limited extent, continuing disclosure
in the secondary market.

<DOCNO> FR940317-0-00053 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940317-0-00022 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In 1989, the Commission adopted Rule 15c2-12 under the Exchange Act

14

 to enhance the quality and timeliness of disclosure to investors in municipal securities.

15

 The rule requires that underwriters (both bank and non-bank) of primary offerings of municipal securities with an
aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or more obtain and distribute to their customers the issuers' official
statements for the offerings. This mechanism provides underwriters an opportunity to review the issuer's disclosure
documents before commencing sales to investors.

16

 







There is a consensus that, over the last two decades, these market and regulatory efforts have improved significantly
the quality of primary offering disclosure in the municipal securities markets.

17

 Nonetheless, there continue to be concerns with the adequacy of municipal offering disclosure, particularly with
respect to offerings of non-general obligation bonds and smaller issues.

<DOCNO> FR940317-0-00054 </DOCNO>

Secondary market disclosure practices present greater concerns. Recent highly publicized defaults

19

 and refundings,

20

 as well as the tremendous level of issuances during the past two years, have heightened interest in municipal secondary
market disclosure.

21

 The PSA has testified that today ``secondary market information is difficult to come by even for professional municipal
credit analysts, to say nothing of retail investors.''

22

 Substantial issuer information, in the form of official statements, state-required reports, and other public documents,
is available from the approximately 20% of municipal issuers that come to market frequently, accounting for 80% of
the dollar volume of municipal securities issued.

23

 However, the remaining issuers, representing 20% in dollar volume but 80% in number, which come to the market much
less frequently, provide substantially less continuing information. Many of these issues are health care issues,
housing issues, industrial development bonds, and other conduit financings,

24

 financing sectors which have had the greatest incidence of defaults, both monetary and technical.

25

 In addition, information often is unavailable for smaller issues of securities of general purpose units of government
and the securities of special purpose districts and authorities.

26

In response to a request by Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt for a recommended ``market-participant sponsored
solution'' to the disclosure issues in the municipal securities market, on December 20, 1993, 12 groups and associations
representing a broad range of market participants submitted to the Commission a Joint Statement on Improvements
in Municipal Securities Market Disclosure (the ``Joint Statement'').

27

 The Joint Statement sets forth ``a framework for improving the availability of information in the marketplace''
that calls for both continued market initiatives to improve issuer disclosure and ``support from the SEC and the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB).''

28

 Among other things, its participants recommend the adoption of a rule or interpretive guidance restricting underwriting
of municipal issues unless continuing information covenants are provided by the issuer. 






III. Primary Offering Disclosure




A. Application of the Antifraud Provisions 



The antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws prohibit fraudulent or deceptive practices in the offer
and sale of municipal securities.

29

 Disclosure documents used by municipal issuers, such as official statements, are subject to the prohibition against
false or misleading statements of material facts, including the omission of material facts necessary to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. The adequacy of the disclosure
provided in municipal security offering materials is tested against an objective standard: an omitted fact is material
if there is a substantial likelihood that, under all the circumstances, the omitted fact would have assumed actual
significance in the deliberations of the reasonable [investor]. Put another way, there must be a substantial likelihood
that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly
altered the ``total mix'' of information made available.

30

 






B. Voluntary Guidelines 



In the primary offering of municipal securities, the extensive voluntary guidelines issued by the Government Finance
Officers Association (``GFOA'') have received widespread acceptance and, among a number of larger issuers, have
been viewed as ``in essence obligatory rules.''

31

 Other groups, including the National Federation of Municipal Analysts (``NFMA''), have published voluntary disclosure
guidelines covering industry specific sectors, including among others, housing, student loans, transportation
and health care.

32

 In connection with the offering of municipal securities, the GFOA Guidelines call for:

33

 






 An introduction to serve as the guide to the official statement; 

 A description of the securities being offered, including complete information regarding the purposes of
the offering, the plan of financing, the security and sources of repayment, and the priority of the securities, as
well as structural characteristics, such as call provisions, tender options, original issue or deep discount, variable
rates, and lease purchase agreements; 

 Information regarding the nature and extent of any credit enhancement and financial and business information
about the issuer of the enhancement; 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940317-0-00056 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940317-0-00022 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 A description of the government issuer or enterprise, including information about the issuer's range or level
of service, capacity and demographic factors and, in the case of revenue supported offerings, information on the
enterprise's organization, management, revenue structure, results of operations and operating plan; 

 With respect to obligations of private profit making and nonprofit conduit issuers, information regarding
the business or other activity, including the enterprise's form of organization and management, rate-making or
pricing policies, and historical operations and plan of operation; 

 A description of the issuer's outstanding debt, including the authority to incur debt, limitations on debt,
and the prospective debt burden and rate of its retirement; 

 A description of the basic documentation, such as indentures, trust agreements and resolutions authorizing
the issuance and establishing the rights of the parties; 

 Financial information, including summary information regarding the issuer's or obligor's financial practices
and results of operations, and financial statements, prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles and audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards; 

 A discussion of legal matters, such as pending judicial, administrative, or regulatory proceedings that
may significantly affect the securities offered, legal opinions, and tax considerations; and 

 A discussion of miscellaneous matters, including ratings and their description and meanings, underwriting
arrangements, arrangements with financial advisors, interests of named experts, pending legislation, and the
availability of additional information and documentation. 





The guidelines prepared by the GFOA and the NFMA provide a generally comprehensive roadmap for disclosure in offering
statements for municipal securities offerings. There are, however, areas that need further improvement in both
the context of negotiated and competitively bid underwritings. In addition, implementation of these guidelines
needs to be extended to the whole market. For example, while large repeat general obligation issuers usually have
comprehensive disclosure documents, small issuers and conduit issuers, particularly in the health care, housing
and industrial development areas, do not always provide the same quality of disclosure.

34

 





C. Areas Where Improvement Is Needed 



1. Conflicts of Interest and Other Relationships or Practices 



Information concerning financial and business relationships and arrangements among the parties involved in the
issuance of municipal securities may be critical to an evaluation of an offering.

35

 Recent revelations about practices used in the municipal securities offering process have highlighted the potential
materiality of information concerning financial and business relationships, arrangements or practices, including
political contributions, that could influence municipal securities offerings. For example, such information
could indicate the existence of actual or potential conflicts of interest, breaches of duty, or less than arm's-length
transactions. Similarly, these matters may reflect upon the qualifications, level of diligence, and disinterestedness
of financial advisers, underwriters, experts and other participants in an offering. Failure to disclose material
information concerning such relationships, arrangements or practices may render misleading statements made in
connection with the process, including statements in the official statement about the use of proceeds, underwriters'
compensation and other expenses of the offering. In addition, investors reasonably expect participants in municipal
securities offerings to follow standards and procedures established by such participants, or other governing authorities,
to safeguard the integrity of the offering process; accordingly, material deviations from those procedures warrant
disclosure. 





Existing rules and voluntary guidelines call for certain specific disclosures by offering participants. GFOA guidelines
call for offering statement disclosure to investors of contingency fees to named experts, including counsel, and
any other interest or connection those parties have with other transaction participants.

36

 MSRB rules call for dealer disclosure to issuers and investors of any financial advisory relationship between an
issuer and a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer, under certain circumstances.

37

 MSRB rules also call for dealer disclosure to investors of, among other things, certain fees and expenses in negotiated
transactions.

38

 







Beyond existing specific disclosure requirements and guidelines, the range of financial and business relationships,
arrangements and practices that need to be disclosed depends on the particular facts and circumstances of each case.
If, for example, the issuer (or any person acting on its behalf) selects an underwriter, syndicate or selling group
member, expert, counsel or other party who has a direct or indirect (for example, through a consultant) financial
or business relationship or arrangement with persons connected with the offering process, that relationship or
arrangement may be material.

39

 Areas of particular concern are undisclosed payments to obtain underwriting assignments and undisclosed agreements
or arrangements, including fee splitting, between financial advisers and underwriters.

40

 If the adviser is hired to assist the issuer, such relationships, financial or otherwise, may divide loyalties. Similarly,
affiliations between sellers of property to be used in a financed project and conduit borrowers raise questions regarding,
among other things, the determination of fair market value of the property and self-dealing. 






2. Terms and Risks of Securities 



Evolution in the financial markets has led to increasingly complex and sophisticated derivative and other municipal
products. While these new products offer investors a wide range of investment alternatives, in choosing among the
alternatives, investors need a clear understanding of the terms and the particular risks arising from the nature
of the products.

41

 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940317-0-00057 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940317-0-00022 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In particular, investors need to be informed about the nature and effects of each significant term of the debt, including
credit enhancements and risk modifiers, such as inverse floaters and detachable call rights. Investors in these
securities should be aware of their exposure to interest rate volatility, under all possible scenarios. In addition,
any legal risk concerning the issuer's authority to issue securities with unconventional features needs to be disclosed.
The PSA recently has identified disclosure that should be provided in connection with the offer of financial instruments
that include such features as auction and swap-based inverse floaters and embedded cap bonds.

42

 





Credit enhancements are used with increasing frequency in the municipal market. According to published information,
over 37% of the dollar volume of new long term issues carry some form of credit enhancement.

43

 The existence of bond insurance or other credit enhancement creates the need for disclosure concerning the provider
of the credit enhancement and the terms of the enhancement

44

 to avoid misleading investors concerning the value of the enhancements provided and the party's ability to fund the
enhancement. The GFOA recommends that appropriate financial information about the assets, revenues, reserves
and results of operations of credit enhancers be provided in the official statement. In determining the extent of
disclosure, consideration should be given to the amount of the enhancement relative to the income and cash flows of
the issuer or obligor, conditions precedent to application of the enhancement, duration of the enhancement, and
other factors indicating a material relationship between the enhancement and the investor's anticipated return.







In a trend that has become increasingly common, municipal bond insurers are including in indentures provisions that
appear to delegate to the bond insurer the ability to modify terms of the indenture, prior to default, without the consent
of, or even prior notification to, bondholders.

45

 There should be clear disclosure of any such provision that may have a material impact on the rights of bondholders
or the obligations of the issuer, including the specific material rights of the bondholder that could be so altered.






3. Financial Information 

 

a. 

Financial Accounting.

 Sound financial statements are critical to the integrity of the primary and secondary markets for municipal securities,
just as they are for corporate securities.

46

 The key to the reliability and relevancy of the information contained in the financial statements of a municipal issuer
is the use of a comprehensive body of accounting principles consistently applied by the issuer.

47

 






Although there continues to be some diversity in the financial reporting practices used in preparing financial statements
of governmental issuers, practice in the municipal market is evolving rapidly to reliance on generally accepted
accounting principles (``GAAP'') as determined by the Government Accounting Standards Board (``GASB'').

48

 Only two years after GASB was founded in 1984, financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, as promulgated
by GASB, were required by 75.2% of cities, 78.3% of counties and 69% of school districts responding to a research survey.

49

 Forty-six states currently require, or are in the process of establishing a requirement, that state government financial
statements be presented in accordance with GAAP.

50

 In addition, local as well as state governments that receive significant amounts of federal aid must prepare financial
statements in accordance with GAAP or provide information concerning variance from GAAP.

51

 








The GFOA Guidelines call for financial statements that are either prepared in accordance with GAAP or accompanied
by a quantified (if practicable) explanation of the differences.

52

 To avoid misunderstanding, investors need to be informed of the basis for financial statement presentation. Accordingly,
when a municipal issuer neither uses GAAP nor provides a quantified explanation of material deviations from GAAP,
investors need a full explanation of the accounting principles followed. 





b. 

Audits

. Investors in the public securities markets have a reasonable expectation that annual financial statements contained
in offering documents or periodic reports are subject to audit.

53

 In the case of municipal issuers, these financial statement audits are typically conducted by either an independent
certified public accountant or a state auditor. Although the frequency and timeliness of audits vary, every state
requires some periodic audit verification of government financial statements.

54

 A prudent investor needs to be able to evaluate the extent to which he or she can rely on the second look an auditor provides.

</DOC>

<DOCNO> FR940317-0-00058 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940317-0-00022 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Accordingly, the offering statement should state whether the financial statements it contains were audited in accordance
with generally accepted auditing standards (``GAAS''), as established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. 

c. 

Other Financial and Operating Information.

 Financial information beyond that contained in the financial statements_provided in tabular and narrative format,
footnotes, supplemental tables, schedules and discussions of operations and financial position_is essential
to the fair presentation of an issuer's financial performance and position. As reflected in industry guidelines,

55

 the type of information needed (

e.g., 

tax revenue base, budget, demographics, project revenues and operations) varies depending on the type of issuer,
the type of security sold, and the sources for repayment of the bond obligations. 





There are a number of areas in which greater care needs to be taken to provide investors with adequate information.
In a pooled financing structure, such as that used by bond banks, in addition to providing financial information concerning
the issuing authority or program in the aggregate, it may be necessary to provide information on participating obligors.
This will depend on diversification and risk concentration factors, such as the significance of any single obligor
to the overall financing. 

Conduit bond issuers need to provide operational information concerning the activities of the private enterprise
that will provide the cash flows to service the debt_for example, financial reporting, legal proceedings, changes
in indebtedness, defaults and other significant developments relating to the underlying corporate obligor. Where
the issuing authority in a conduit financing has no remaining obligation for the repayment of the indebtedness, in
providing financial information about the issuing entity (as compared to the obligor on the bonds), care must be taken
to avoid misleading investors regarding the sources of repayment.

56

 





Municipal issuers also must consider disclosure issues arising from their activities as end users of derivative
products. For example, the use of non-exchange traded derivatives to alter interest rate risk exposes the issuer
to counterparty credit risk. Disclosure documents need to discuss the market risks to which issuers are exposed,
the strategies used to alter such risks and the exposure to both market risk and credit risk resulting from risk alteration
strategies. The NFMA has published sector specific secondary market disclosure guidelines calling for a discussion
of the issuer's use of derivative products, especially interest rate swaps.

57

 





Moreover, in addition to financial and operating data, the official statement may need to include a narrative explanation
to avoid misunderstanding and assist the reader in understanding the financial presentation. A numerical presentation
alone may not be sufficient to permit an investor to judge financial and operating condition of the issuer or obligor.

58

 For example, it may be necessary to explain the presentation of budget information and the relationship of the budget
figures to the financial statements. 





In addition, issuers must assess whether the future impact of currently known facts mandate disclosure. The GFOA
Guidelines call for a description of known facts that would significantly affect the financial information presented
or future financial operation of the issuer, as well as a discussion of its projected operations.

59

 For example, in a hospital financing, a steadily declining population in the surrounding community that, in the future,
would not support the size of facility to be built would be important to investors. Disclosure of such currently known
conditions and their future impact is critical to informed decisionmaking. 





d. 

Timeliness of Financial Statements. 

The timeliness of financial information is a major factor in its usefulness. To avoid providing investors with a stale,
and therefore potentially misleading, picture of financial condition and results of operations, issuers and obligors
need to release their annual financial statements as soon as practical. After extensive discussion with market participants,
it appears that, for the most part, audited financial statements of municipal issuers for the most recently completed
fiscal year are available within six months after fiscal year end. The six month time period is consistent with the
recommendations of NASACT's Blue Ribbon Committee Report.

60

 Unaudited financial statements should be provided when available prior to the completion of the audit. 





4. Availability of Continuing Information 



An investor's ability to monitor future developments affecting the issuer, as well as the likely liquidity of a security,
are important to an investor's evaluation of an offering. The official statement should state clearly whether ongoing
disclosure concerning the issuer or obligor will be provided, including the type, timing, and method of providing
such information.

61

 In deciding whether to purchase the securities or to continue to hold them, investors need to know whether the issuer
has committed to provide information on an ongoing basis.

62

 The absence of such a commitment can adversely affect the secondary market for the securities and increases the risks
of the investment.

As discussed above, the Joint Statement recommends that the Commission adopt a rule prohibiting a municipal securities
dealer from underwriting securities absent a commitment to provide ongoing information. In the Companion Release,
the Commission is proposing such a rule for comment. In order to fully inform investors, an issuer needs to include
in the official statement a description of the scope of its continuing disclosure commitment, the type of information
that would be provided, the repositories to which the information would be sent, when annual and other periodic information
would be available, and the consequences of the issuer's failure to abide by the requirements of the covenant. 



5. Clarity and Conciseness 



Like other disclosure documents, official statements need to be clear and concise to avoid misleading investors
through confusion and obfuscation. The expanded level of disclosure in official statements and increased sophistication
of municipal securities instruments have, in many cases, resulted in longer and more complex disclosure documents,
with the corresponding danger of overly detailed, legalistic, and possibly obtuse disclosure.

63

 





The location, emphasis, and context of the disclosure can affect the ability of a reasonable investor to understand
the relationship between, and cumulative effect of, the disclosure.

64

 As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has stated:




[D]isclosures in a prospectus must steer a middle course, neither submerging a material fact in a flood of collateral
data, nor slighting its importance through seemingly cavalier treatment. The import of the information conveyed
must be neither oversubtle nor overplayed, its meaning accurate, yet accessible.

65

 





Appropriate disclosure ``is measured not by literal truth, but by the ability of the material to accurately inform
rather than mislead'' investors.

66

 As the Commission has indicated in other contexts, legalistic, overly complex presentations and inattention to
understandability can render the disclosure incomprehensible and consequently misleading.

67

 






6. Delivery of Official Statements 



One of the concerns leading to the adoption of Rule 15c2-12 was that underwriters were not receiving official
statements within time periods that would allow them to examine the accuracy of the disclosure.

68

 The Commission noted in proposing the rule that a thorough, professional review by underwriters of municipal offering
documents could encourage appropriate disclosure of foreseeable risks and accurate descriptions of complex put
and call features, as well as novel financing structures now employed in many municipal offerings. In addition, with
the increase in novel or complex financings, there may be greater value in having investors receive disclosure documents
describing fundamental aspects of their investment. Yet, underwriters are unable to perform this function effectively
when offering statements are not provided to them on a timely basis.

69

 






To address this concern, the rule requires any underwriter, including lead underwriters, syndicate members, and
selling group members that receive in excess of the usual seller's commission, to obtain and review an official statement
that is deemed final as of its date by the issuer, except for the omission of certain information, before bidding for,
purchasing, offering, or selling municipal securities in a primary offering. 

Since the adoption of Rule 15c2-12, however, there have been continued problems with the timeliness of receipt
by underwriters of the ``near final'' official statement required by the Rule.

70

 In addition to compromising the ability of an underwriter to make a reasonable investigation of the issuer, this problem
also may limit the ability of potential customers to make informed investment decisions. In a recent NFMA survey,
59% of those responding rated the delivery of preliminary official statements in competitive sales as either not
very good or poor, and 50% rated the delivery of preliminary official statements in negotiated sales as either not
very good or poor.

71

 






One cause of delay has been confusion as to the point at which the underwriter must have obtained and reviewed the near
final official statement in a negotiated offering. The term ``offer'' traditionally has been defined broadly under
the federal securities laws and, for purposes of Rule 15c2-12, encompasses the distribution of a preliminary
official statement by the underwriter, as well as oral solicitations of indications of interest. Thus, prior to the
time that the underwriter distributes the preliminary official statement to potential investors, or otherwise
begins orally soliciting investors, the rule requires it to have obtained and reviewed a near final official statement.
If no offers are made, the underwriter is required to obtain and review a near final official statement by the earlier
of the time the underwriter agrees (whether in principle or by signing the bond purchase agreement) to purchase the
bonds, or the first sale of bonds to investors.

72

 





The Commission has acknowledged that the rule would require greater planning and discipline by some issuers.

73

 The Commission anticipated that, in order to allow underwriters to meet their obligation to have a reasonable basis
for recommending any municipal securities, issuers would have to begin drafting disclosure documents earlier,
and perhaps with greater care than in the past.

74

 This result enables underwriters to receive, and if necessary influence the content of, the final official statement
before committing themselves to an offering.

75

 Moreover, placing an obligation on the issuer to prepare the official statement at an earlier stage is appropriate,
because it is the issuer's obligation to ensure that there is timely dissemination of disclosure documents in connection
with the offer and sale of the issuer's securities.

76

 








D. Conduit Financings 



When financing involves a third party as the source of repayment, investors need information on that underlying borrower.
The GFOA Guidelines call for description of conduit obligors, which are defined by the GFOA Guidelines to include
both private profit-making and nonprofit entities.

77

 The suggested information includes the nature and development of the business or other activity to be undertaken
by the conduit obligor (including its form of organization and management), location of principal facilities and
service area, ratemaking or pricing policies and historical operations and plan of operations.

To address disclosure issues involving conduit financings in a comprehensive fashion, however, legislation addressing
the exempt status of conduit securities under the federal securities laws is necessary. Bonds used to finance a project
to be used in the trade or business of a private corporation are, from an investment standpoint, equivalent to corporate
debt securities issued directly by the underlying corporate obligor.

78

 Payments on these types of conduit securities are derived solely from revenues received by the governmental entity
under the terms of a contractual agreement, typically a lease or a note, from a private enterprise, rather than from
the general credit and taxing power of the governmental issuer. The tax-exempt status of interest payments does not
alter the fundamental analysis that these are private obligations, in which the investor looks, and can look, only
to a private entity for repayment. 





The private nature of many conduit enterprises distinguishes them from traditional municipal financings. The incidence
of bond default appears to be inversely related to the degree a financed project represents an essential public service.

79

 A study conducted by the PSA on non-rated issues that defaulted found that 75% were issued by local authorities in the
areas of health care and industrial related sectors such as energy, chemical, pollution control and industrial development.

80

 






Given the essentially private nature of non-governmental industrial development financings, investors need the
same disclosure regarding the underlying non-municipal corporate obligor as they would receive regarding any corporate
obligor, and the same regulatory and liability scheme should apply. Accordingly, the Commission has consistently
supported legislative proposals to amend Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act

81

 and Section 3(a)(29)

82

 of the Exchange Act to remove the registration exemption for the corporate credit underlying municipal conduit securities
involving non-governmental industrial development (private activity) financings.

83

 The Commission today renews that legislative recommendation. 







Pending amendment to the securities laws to eliminate the registration exemption, the disclosure provided by such
non-governmental conduit borrowers should be substantially the same as if such conduit borrower were subject to
the information requirements of the federal securities laws applicable to the particular conduit borrower. For
example, financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles prescribed
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board should be provided. 



IV. Disclosure in the Secondary Market for Municipal Securities 



While significant progress has been made in primary market disclosure practices in recent years, the same development
has not taken place with respect to secondary market disclosure. The GFOA issued separate secondary market disclosure
guidelines in 1979, but they have not yet achieved the broad acceptance accorded its primary offering guidance. In
the last five years, the NFMA, the National Council of State Housing Agencies, and the Association of Local Housing
Authorities have published sector specific guidelines for secondary market disclosure; the National Advisory
Council of the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers (``NASACT'') is in the process
of preparing such guidelines for adoption by the states.

84

 The GFOA's longstanding Certificate of Achievement program recognizes issuers that have prepared comprehensive
annual financial reports meeting its guidelines. The NFMA's Award of Recognition Program likewise recognizes issuers
that have committed to provide continuous disclosure.

A. Application of Antifraud Provisions 



Participants in the municipal securities market do not dispute the need for ongoing disclosure following an offering
of securities, but municipal issuers reportedly resist developing a routine of ongoing disclosure to the investing
market because of concerns about the costs of generating and disseminating that information and about potential
liability relating to such disclosure. These issuers and obligors are at times advised by their professional advisors
that there is no duty under the federal securities laws to make disclosure following the completion of the distribution.

85

 At least some municipal issuers thus appear to believe that silence shields them from liability for what may later
be found to be false or misleading information. As a practical matter, however, municipal issuers do not have the option
of remaining silent. Given the wide range of information routinely released to the public, formally and informally,
by these issuers in their day-to-day operations, the stream of information on which the market relies does not cease
with the close of a municipal offering. In light of the public nature of these issuers and their accountability and
governmental functions, a variety of information about issuers of municipal securities is collected by state and
local governmental bodies, and routinely made publicly available.

86

 Municipal officials also make frequent public statements and issue press releases concerning the entity's fiscal
affairs. 






A municipal issuer may not be subject to the mandated continuous reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, but when
it releases information to the public that is reasonably expected to reach investors and the trading markets, those
disclosures are subject to the antifraud provisions.

87

 The fact that they are not published for purposes of informing the securities markets does not alter the mandate that
they not violate antifraud proscriptions.

88

 Those statements are a principal source of significant, current information about the issuer of the security, and
thus reasonably can be expected to reach investors and the trading market. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit has said: ``The securities markets are highly sensitive to press releases and to information contained in
all sorts of publicly released . . . documents, and the investor is foolish who would ignore such releases.''

89

 Since investors obtain information concerning the fiscal health of a municipal issuer from its public statements
concerning financial and other matters, ``[t]he nature of these statements and the assumptions upon which they are
based must be carefully and accurately communicated to the public, so that potential investors may be fully informed
of all material facts relevant to their inv
