Witchweed Regulated Areas 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Affirmation of interim rule as final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are adopting as a final rule, without change, an interim rule that amended the list of suppressive areas under the
witchweed quarantine and regulations by adding and deleting areas in North Carolina and South Carolina. These changes
affected 7 counties in North Carolina and 2 counties in South Carolina. These actions were necessary in order to impose
certain restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles to prevent the artificial spread of witchweed
and to delete unnecessary restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


In an interim rule effective and published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 6, 1993 (58 FR 51979-51982, Docket No. 93-075-1), we amended the witchweed quarantine
and regulations by adding areas in Craven, Cumberland, Greene, Pender, and Pitt Counties in North Carolina, and areas
in Horry County in South Carolina to the list of suppressive areas in  301.80-2a of the regulations. 
We also amended the list of suppressive areas by removing areas in Craven, Cumberland, Greene, Pender, Sampson, and
Wayne Counties in North Carolina and Dillon and Horry Counties in South Carolina from the list of suppressive areas
in  301.80-2a of the regulations. 
Comments on the interim rule were required to be received on or before December 6, 1993. We did not receive any comments.
The facts presented in the interim rule still provide a basis for the rule. 
This action also affirms the information contained in the interim rule concerning Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, Executive Orders 12372 and 12778, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. 
Further, for this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the review process required by Executive
Order 12866. 


List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 301 


Agricultural commodities, Plant diseases and pests, Quarantine, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation.

Accordingly, we are adopting as a final rule, without change, the amendments in subpart ``Witchweed'' in 7 CFR part
301 that were published at 
58 FR 51979-51982 on October 6, 1993.

National Poultry Improvement Plan and Auxiliary Provisions 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the National Poultry Improvement Plan (the Plan) and its auxiliary provisions by providing new administrative
and laboratory procedures for examining and testing participating flocks and preventing and responding to disease
outbreaks. The changes, which were voted on and approved by the voting delegates at the Plan's 1992 Biennial Conference,
will keep the provisions of the Plan current with changes in the poultry industry, allow the use of state-of-the-art
laboratory procedures, and allow the Plan to better respond to disease emergencies. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The National Poultry Improvement Plan (referred to below as ``the Plan'') 
is a cooperative Federal-State-industry mechanism for controlling certain 
poultry diseases. The Plan consists of a variety of programs intended to 
prevent and control egg-transmitted, hatchery-disseminated poultry diseases. 
Participation in all Plan programs is voluntary, but flocks, hatcheries, and 
dealers must qualify as ``U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean'' before participating in any other Plan program. Also, regulations
in 9 CFR part 82.34 require that no hatching eggs or newly hatched chicks from egg-type chicken breeding flocks 
may be moved interstate unless they are classified ``U.S. Sanitation Monitored'' under the Plan or they meet the requirements
of a State classification plan determined by the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS) to be equivalent to the Plan, in accordance with 9 CFR 145.23(d). 
The Plan identifies States, flocks, hatcheries, and dealers that meet 
certain disease control standards specified in the Plan's various programs. 
As a result, customers can buy poultry that has tested clean of certain 
diseases or that has been produced under disease-prevention conditions. 
The regulations in 9 CFR parts 145 and 147 (referred to below as ``the 
regulations'') contain the provisions of the Plan. APHIS amends these 
provisions from time to time to incorporate new scientific information and 
technologies within the Plan. 
On August 25, 1993, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 44782-44793, Docket No. 92-151-1) a proposal to amend the regulations by: 

1. Adding definitions of 

Administrator, Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service, serial,

 and 

suspect flock;

 
2. Clarifying the recordkeeping requirements for flocks maintained 
primarily for the production of hatching eggs; 
3. Providing for U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) approval of 
pullorum-typhoid tube agglutination antigens; 
4. Allowing a sample of at least 500 birds, in lieu of the entire 
flock, to be tested by the State Inspector to qualify certain succeeding 
flocks for participation in the Plan's pullorum-typhoid program; 
5. Removing provisions that allow two consecutive generations in egg-type chicken breeding flocks, meat-type chicken
breeding flocks, and 
waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game bird breeding flocks to go without 
testing for pullorum-typhoid; 
6. Providing for the Plan to investigate any multi-State outbreak of a 
Plan disease; 
7. Allowing the use of a federally licensed 

Salmonella enteritidis

 
bacterin to vaccinate birds in egg-type chicken multiplier breeding flocks; 
8. Providing for various sample sizes of live birds for bacteriological 
examination under the U.S. Sanitation Monitored program for egg-type chickens; 
9. Changing the name of the U.S. Sanitation Monitored program for egg- 
type chickens to U.S. 

S. enteritidis 

Monitored; 
10. Adding a USDA-approved polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA 
procedure as a method of diagnosing mycoplasma; 
11. Adding the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as a basic 
screening test for mycoplasma;

12. Adding an alternative laboratory procedure for mycoplasma 
hemagglutination inhibition (HI) testing using a microtiter technique; 
13. Providing for the most contemporary laboratory methods for use in 
environmental sample selection, 

Salmonella 

isolation, examination of 


Salmonella 

reactors, and program monitoring procedures for egg-type chicken 
breeding flocks, meat-type chicken breeding flocks, and waterfowl, exhibition 
poultry, and game bird breeding flocks; and 
14. Amending the procedure for determining the status and effectiveness 
of sanitation monitored programs. 
In addition to the changes discussed above, we also proposed to 
redesignate, revise, or amend certain footnotes in the regulations and remove 
paragraph designations where they appeared before individual definitions. 
We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 30-day comment 
period ending September 24, 1993. We received three comments by that date, 
from a State department of agriculture, a college of veterinary medicine, and 
a veterinary research laboratory. These comments are addressed below. 
One comment referred to our proposal to amend  145.23(d)(1) to allow 
the use of a federally licensed 

Salmonella enteritidis 

bacterin to vaccinate 
birds in egg-type chicken multiplier breeding flocks following the 
bacteriological examination of environmental samples collected when the birds 
were 2 to 4 weeks of age. The commenter asked if there was a decrease in the 
efficacy of the bacterin when older birds were vaccinated. The label on the 
licensed bacterin calls for birds to be vaccinated twice, once at 10 to 12 
weeks of age, and again at 17 to 18 weeks of age; there are no instructions 
regarding older birds. Because the bacterin must be used in accordance with the label instructions, we believe that
the regulations need not address the 
vaccination of older birds. 
In our proposed amendment to  147.7, ``Standard test procedures for 
mycoplasma,'' the second sentence of paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(C) states that the 
dilution required to give four hemagglutination (HA) units is calculated by 
dividing the stock antigen HA titer by 8. One commenter stated that the stock 
antigen HA titer should be divided by 4 instead of 8. We disagree. The 
antigen titration is done with volumes of 50  u L. In the HI test, 25  u L of 
antigen is added to 25  u L of serum dilution. The antigen, then, must contain 
4 HA units in 25  u L; the 4 HA units would then be doubled for 50  u L, so 
dividing by 8 is correct. Therefore, we did not make any changes in response 
to the comment. 
Also in our proposed amendment to  147.7, paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E) 
calls for the serial dilution of 25  u L from a specified number of wells. One 
commenter suggested that such multiple transfers of volumes as small as 25  u L 
may be difficult using a multichannel pipettor due to incomplete volume 
transfer. We believe that no change in the regulations is necessary because 
multichannel pipettors calibrated to deliver the proper volume are readily 
available from commercial sources. 
Proposed paragraph (e)(iv)(B)(3) of  147.7 states that for the assay 
described in the paragraph to be valid, the backtitration of the antigen must 
be 1:4 or 1:8. One commenter suggested that the latter number should be 
omitted because a backtitration of 1:8 would result in potentially suppressed 
HI titers. We believe that the 4-HA to 8-HA range allows for realistic 
performance variation within the test while maintaining stringent quality 
control. As proposed, the protocol stated that the positive control must be 
within one dilution of the previously determined titer, so any loss of 
sensitivity would be detected if a backtitration approaching 8 HA units was 
suppressing the HI titers of samples. Therefore, we did not make any changes 
in response to the comment. 
One commenter pointed out that the 1:5 serum dilution referred to in 
paragraph (e)(2)(v)(D)(

1

) of the proposed amendment to  147.7 should actually 
be a 1:5.5 serum dilution. While 1:5.5 is actually correct, the ultimate 
serial dilutions of the sample would be 1:11, 1:22, 1:44, etc., each of which 
can be presented as the nearest standard dilution (1:10, 1:20, 1:40, etc.) 
without a loss of accuracy in the test. Therefore, we did not make any 
changes in response to the comment. 
Proposed new paragraph (a)(5) of  147.11 stated that the Analytical 
Profile Index for Enterobacteriaceae (API) system may be used to aid cultural 
identifications. One commenter noted that API is not the only such system 
that could be used. We agree and have changed  147.11(a)(5) to indicate that 
systems other than API are available. 
Two of the comments encouraged us to amend illustration 1 in  147.11 to 
accurately reflect the procedures called for in the text of proposed new 
paragraph (a)(1) of  147.11. As proposed, the text of  147.11(a)(1) 
required the inoculation of non-selective plates in addition to two selective 
plating media. The commenters pointed out that the upper right-hand block of 
illustration 1 did not include the inoculation of non-selective plates. We 
agree, and have added the inoculation of non-selective plates to the upper 
right-hand block of illustration 1. The probability of isolating 

Salmonella 

from organ tissues will be enhanced if non-selective plating media are used in addition to selective plating media.

One of the commenters suggested that a reference to footnote 2 be added 
to the upper left-hand block of illustration 1, which refers to non-selective 
enrichment broths. Because footnote 2 to illustration 1 contains pertinent 
information concerning non-selective enrichment, we agree and have added a 
reference to footnote 2 in the upper left-hand block of illustration 1. The 
same commenter noted that we had omitted the word ``broths'' after the word 
``enrichment'' in footnote 1 to illustration 1, and also suggested that the 
first sentence of footnote 2 be revised for the sake of clarity. We agree 
with both of these points and have added the word ``broths'' to footnote 1 and 
have revised the first sentence of footnote 2 to read ``Beef extract or 
infusion broths and plates are preferred.'' 
Another commenter suggested that illustrations 1 and 2 are difficult to 
follow and that wording should be added to the illustrations to indicate that 


Salmonella pullorum 

is a slow grower and produces a smaller colony than other 

salmonellae, 

that the production of H

2

S is delayed or absent, and that the 
production of gas is weak or absent. We believe that the illustrations are 
easily understood and that the additional information suggested by the 
commenter is unnecessary. Each illustration contains a block referring to the 
use of ``additional identification media and diagnostic systems,'' which 
includes means of biochemical identification and differentiation of bacteria. 
Further, we believe that a person conducting such tests would be familiar with 
the isolation of 

Salmonella, 

including the identification of characteristic colonies of pullorum and other 

salmonellae 

on various media. Therefore, we have made no changes in response to the comment. 
Finally, paragraph (a)(2) of our proposed amendment to  147.14 stated 
that culturing for the dependable recovery of 

salmonellae 

should include the use of preenrichment broths supplemented with ferrous sulfate. One of the 
commenters noted that there is debate regarding the usefulness of adding 
ferrous sulfate to overcome the inhibitory effects of conalbumin, and pointed 
out that the egg culture protocol included in recently published APHIS 
regulations (``Chicken Disease Caused by 

Salmonella Enteritidis

'') does not 
include the addition of ferrous sulfate. The ``regulations'' to which the 
commenter referred were actually proposed regulations published in the 

Federal Register 

on August 2, 1993 (58 FR 41048-41061, Docket No. 91-016-1) and, as such, have no regulatory effect.
The protocols included in that proposed rule are still under review and will not become effective until a final rule
is 
published. We believe that the ability of conalbumin to chelate metallic ions 
such as Fe

3

+ or Cu

2

+ has been clearly demonstrated by both Gelb and Harris 
(1980) and Tan and Woodworth (1969). Additionally, Board 

et al. 

(1991) 
demonstrated that the addition of iron to preenrichment broth aided in the 
recovery of 

Salmonella enteritidis 

from eggs. Therefore, we have made no 
changes in response to the comment. 
In addition to the changes discussed above, we are making two other 
changes. First, we are adding Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control 
numbers to   147.1, 147.2, 147.3, 147.5, 147.11, 147.12, 147.13, and 147.21. 
The existing paperwork requirements contained in those sections_not any new 
requirements that may be contained in this final rule_were approved by OMB 
after the proposed rule was published, so the control numbers must be added to 
the end of each of those sections. Second, we are correcting an out-of-date 
reference in  147.43, which contains provisions regarding the Plan's General 
Conference Committee. In that section, there is a reference to the Assistant 
Secretary of Agriculture for Marketing and Transportation Services. In 1982, 
the Marketing and Transportation Services division was reorganized and renamed 
Marketing and Inspection Services, so we have corrected the reference in 
 147.43 to reflect the current organization. 
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in 
this document, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule, 
with the changes discussed in this document. 


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of 
Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of 
Management and Budget. 
The changes contained in this document are based on the recommendations 
of representatives of member States, hatcheries, dealers, flockowners, and 
breeders who took part in the Plan's 31st Biennial Conference. Because 
participation in the Plan is voluntary, individuals are likely to remain in 
the program as long as the costs of implementing the program are lower than 
the added benefits they receive from the program. The changes in this final 
rule will keep the provisions of the Plan current with changes in the poultry 
industry, will allow the use of state-of-the-art laboratory and testing 
procedures, and will allow the Plan to better respond to disease emergencies. 
Of the changes contained in this final rule, only two are expected to 
have more than a negligible economic effect on Plan participants. The 
amendment that will allow, in certain cases, a 500-bird sample to be tested in 
lieu of the entire flock will result in a cost savings for affected Plan 
participants because fewer tests will be required to qualify certain 
multiplier breeding flocks and succeeding flocks for participation in the 
Plan's pullorum-typhoid program. It is likely, however, that those savings 
will be offset by the amendment that increases testing requirements by 
removing, for all poultry except turkeys, provisions that allow two 
consecutive generations of breeding flocks to go without testing for pullorum-typhoid. The remaining items, because
they are either administrative or 
procedural in nature, will not have a significant economic impact. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12372 


This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic 
Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which 
requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 
7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.) 


Executive Order 12778 


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil 
Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and 
regulations that are in conflict with this rule; (2) has no retroactive 
effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may 
file suit in court challenging this rule. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 


et seq.

), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this final rule have been submitted for
approval to the Office of Management and Budget.

(e) * * *

(1) 

Procedure No. 1. * * *



* * * * *



(2) Procedure No. 2.

 Purpose: To test for antibodies to avian mycoplasma by hemagglutination inhibition (HI). The test uses the constant
antigen, titered-sera method for measuring antibodies to 

M. gallisepticum, M. synoviae, 

or 

M. meleagridis.

(i) Materials needed.

(A) M. gallisepticum, M. synoviae

, and/or 

M. meleagridis

 HI antigens.

(B) Positive and negative control sera.

(C) Phosphate buffered saline (PBS).

(D) Microtiter plates, 96-well, U-bottom.

(E) 12-channel pipettor (Titerek).

(F) 50  u L pipettor (Pipetman P200).

(G) Pipette tips.

(H) 0.5 percent homologous red blood cells (RBC's) in PBS (use RBC's from the same species being tested).

(I) Plate-sealing tape.

(J) Mirrored plate reader.

(ii) 

Microtiter hemagglutination antigen (HA) titration.



(A) Perform standard hemagglutination test (HA) on mycoplasma antigen to determine titer of antigen.

(

1

) Dispense 50  u L of PBS into each well of 3 rows of a 96-well microtiter plate.

(

2

) Dispense 50  u L of stock antigen into the wells of 2 rows.

(

3

) Perform serial two-fold dilutions (50  u L) using a 12-channel pipettor. The dilution series will be from 1:2 to
1:4096.

(

4

) Add 50  u L of 0.5 percent homologous RBC's to each well of all 3 rows. The row with no antigen serves as an RBC control.

(B) Incubate at room temperature (approximately 30 minutes) until the control RBC's give tight buttons. The HA titer
is read as the last well to give a complete lawn (hemagglutination). The desired endpoint is 4 HA units. The well containing
the 1:4 dilution should give a complete HA while the 1:8 dilution should show less than complete HA.

(C) Dilute stock antigen to 4 HA units for the HI test. The dilution required to give 4 HA units is calculated by dividing
the stock antigen HA titer by 8. (Example: 1:320 HA units 
 8 = 40, dilute stock antigen 1:40.)

(iii) 

Hemagglutination inhibition assay.

(A) Label one column (A to H) of a 96-well, U-bottom microtiter plate for each sample, each positive and negative control
sera, antigen backtitration, and RBC control.

(B) Add 40  u L of PBS to the top row of wells (row A) of the plate.

(C) Add 25  u L of PBS to all remaining wells of the plate.

(D) Add 10  u L of each test sera to well A of each column (making a 1:5 sera dilution).

(E) Serially dilute 25  u L from well A through H using a 12-channel pipettor. Discard the final 25  u L. Row A = 1:5...row
H = 1:640.

(F) With an Oxford doser, add 25  u L of 4 HA unit antigen to wells B through H. Well A serves as sera control.

(G) Prepare an antigen backtitration by adding 25  u L of PBS to each well of one column. Add 25  u L of diluted antigen
to well A and serially dilute 25  u L from wells A to D. This prepares 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, and 1:16 dilutions. (It is recommended
that the antigen control backtitration be performed before the diluted antigen is used in the assay. Dilution problems
could be detected and corrected before the inappropriately diluted antigen is used in the assay.)

(H) Leave a column of wells blank for an RBC control.

(I) Agitate gently and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.

(J) Add 50  u L of 0.5 percent RBC's to all wells. Note: Do not agitate after RBC's have been added (agitation may result
in false positive reactions by causing the RBC's to fall, resulting in ``false'' buttons).

(K) Cover the plate with sealing tape. Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes or until control RBC's give a tight
button.

(L) Read the reaction on a mirrored plate reader.

(iv) Results.



(A) The titer is reported as the reciprocal of the last dilution to give a tight button of RBC's. The final dilution scheme
includes the antigen in the dilution calculation and is as follows: B=1:20, C=1:40, D=1:80, E=1:160, F=1:320, G=1:640,
H=1:1,280.

(B) For the assay to be valid:

(

1

) The positive control sera must give a result within one dilution of the previously determined titer.

(

2

) The negative control sera must be negative.

(

3

) The backtitration of the antigen must be 1:4 or 1:8.

(

4

) The RBC control must give tight, non-hemolyzed buttons.

(

5

) Sera controls (well A of each test sera) must not have non-specific agglutination or hemolysis. If negative, report
as ``negative with non-specific agglutination or non-specific hemolysis'' or ``unable to evaluate due to non-specific
agglutination or hemolysis'' or treat the serum to remove the non-specific agglutination and repeat the test. (See
paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section.)

(v) 

Treatment to remove non-specific agglutination.

(A) Purpose. 

Treatment of serum to remove non-specific agglutination that is interfering with HI assays.

(B) 

Specimen.

 Serum.

(C) 

Materials.

 Homologous RBC's (chicken or turkey), 50 percent solution PBS, centrifuge, incubator, 4C (refrigerator).

(D) 

Procedure.

 (

1

) Prepare a 1:5 dilution of test serum by adding 50  u L of serum to 200  u L of PBS.

(

2

) Prepare a 50 percent solution of RBC's by adding equal volumes of packed RBC's to PBS. Mix well. 

(

3

) Add 25  u L of 50 percent RBC solution to the serum dilutions. 
(

4

) Vortex gently to mix. 
(

5

) Incubate at 4 
 C for 1 hour. 
(

6

) Centrifuge to pellet the RBC's. 
(

7

) Use the supernatant to perform the HI assay. Modify the dilution scheme in the assay to consider the initial 1:5 dilution
prepared in the treatment. For the 1:5 dilution scheme, do not add PBS to row A. Add 50  u L of the 1:5 treated supernatant
to row A. Serially dilute 25  u L from rows A 
through H. This prepares a serum dilution of 1:10 through 1:640 in rows B 
through H. 

24. In part 147, ``Subpart B_Bacteriological Examination Procedure,'' a 
new  147.10 is added to read as follows: 



 147.10 

Laboratory procedure recommended for the bacteriological examination 
of egg-type breeding flocks with salmonella enteritidis positive environments. 



Birds selected for bacteriological examination from egg-type breeding 
flocks positive for 

Salmonella enteritidis 

after environmental monitoring 
should be examined as described in  147.11(a) of this subpart, with the 
following exceptions and modifications allowed due to the high number of birds 
required for examination: 

(a) Except when visibly pathological tissues are present, direct 
culture,  147.11(a)(1) of this subpart, may be omitted; and 

(b) Enrichment culture of organ (non-intestinal) tissues using a non- 
selective broth,  147.11(a)(2) of this subpart, may be omitted. 

25. Section 147.11 is amended as follows: 

a. Footnotes 1 through 4 and their references in the regulatory text 
are redesignated as footnotes 7 through 10. 

b. Paragraphs (a) through (j) are redesignated as follows: 






c. A new paragraph (a) and a paragraph heading for paragraph (b) are 
added to read as set forth below. 

d. At the end of the regulatory text of the section, the words 
``(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0579- 
0007)'' are added. 



 147.11 

Laboratory procedure recommended for the bacteriological examination of salmonella. 



(a) 

For egg- and meat-type chickens, waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game birds.

 All reactors to the Pullorum-Typhoid tests, up to at least four birds, should be cultured in accordance with both 

direct 

(paragraph (a)(1)) and 

selective enrichment

 (paragraph (a)(2)) procedures described in this section. Careful aseptic technique should be used when collecting
all tissue samples. 

(1) Direct culture (refer to illustration 1). Grossly normal or 
diseased liver, heart, pericardial sac, spleen, lung, kidney, peritoneum, 
gallbladder, oviduct, misshapen ova or testes, inflamed or unabsorbed yolk 
sac, and other visibly pathological tissues where purulent, necrotic, or 
proliferative lesions are seen (including cysts, abscesses, hypopyon, and 
inflamed serosal surfaces), should be sampled for direct culture using either 
flamed wire loops or sterile swabs. Since some strains may not dependably 
survive and grow in certain selective media, inoculate 

non-selective plates

 in addition to two selective plating media. Refer to illustration 1 for recommended bacteriological recovery and
identification procedures.
 Proceed immediately with collection of organs and tissues for selective enrichment culture. 





(2) Selective enrichment culture (refer to illustration 2). Collect 
and culture organ samples separately from intestinal samples, with intestinal 
tissues collected last to prevent cross-contamination. Samples from the 
following organs or sites should be collected for culture in selective 
enrichment broth. A non-selective broth culture (illustration 1) of pooled 
organs and sites should also be included as described in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section.

(i) Heart (apex, pericardial sac, and contents if present); 
(ii) Liver (portions exhibiting lesions or, in grossly normal organs, 
the drained gallbladder and adjacent liver tissues); 
(iii) Ovary-Testes (entire inactive ovary or testes, but if ovary is 
active, include any atypical ova); 
(iv) Oviduct (if active, include any debris and dehydrated ova); 
(v) Kidneys and spleen; and 
(vi) Other visible pathological sites where purulent, necrotic, or 
proliferative lesions are seen. 

(3) From each reactor, aseptically collect 10 to 15 g, or the nearest 
lesser amount available, from each organ or site listed in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section and mince, grind, and blend them completely in 10 times their 
volume of beef extract broth or a comparable non-selective broth. Organs or 
sites listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be pooled from the same 
individual bird. Suspensions should be transferred in 10-ml aliquots to 
100 ml of both tetrathionate brilliant green (TBG) (Hajna or Mueller-Kauffmann) broth and a separate non-selective
broth and incubated at 37 
 C for 
24 hours. Refer to illustration 2 for recommended bacteriological recovery 
and identification procedures, including delayed secondary enrichment and 
combinations of plating media that significantly suppress the overgrowth of 
contaminants, such as brilliant green Novobiocin (BGN) and Xylose-Lysine- 
Tergitol 4 (XLT4). 

(4) From each reactor, make a composite sample of the following parts 
of grossly normal or diseased tissues from the digestive tract: Crop wall, 
duodenum (including portions of the pancreas), jejunum (including remnant of 
yolk-sac attachment), both ceca, cecal tonsils, and rectum-cloaca. 
Aseptically collect 10-15 g or the nearest lesser amount available from each 
specified digestive or intestinal tissue, and mince, grind, and blend them 
completely in 10 times their volume of TBG broth. The digestive/intestinal 
tissues may be pooled from the same individual bird. Do not pool tissues from 
different birds. Transfer 10 ml of the described digestive TBG suspensions 
into 100 ml of TBG broth, and incubate at 41.5 
 C for 24 hours. Cultures may 
be incubated at 37 
 C if 41.5 
 C incubators are not available. The higher 
incubation temperatures for TBG broth reduce populations of competitive 
contaminants common in gut tissue. Refer to illustration 2 for recommended 
bacteriological recovery and identification procedures, including delayed 
secondary enrichment and combinations of plating media that significantly 
suppress the overgrowth of contaminants, such as BGN and XLT4. 
(5) A system such as the Analytical Profile Index for 
Enterobacteriaceae (API) may be utilized to aid cultural identifications. 
(6) All isolates culturally identified as 

salmonellae

 should be 
serogrouped or serotyped.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Congress has permitted Federal government employees to accept from foreign governments gifts of travel or expense
for travel taking place entirely outside of the United States of more than minimal value. The Board's Rules Regarding
Foreign Gifts and Decorations provide that requests for Board approval of the acceptance of such expenses must be
submitted to the Vice Chairman of the Board. The rules do not specify who should act upon such requests in the absence
of the Vice Chairman, or in situations where the position of Vice Chairman is vacant. Accordingly, this rule will authorize
the Board's Administrative Governor to act on requests for Board approval of these expenses when the Vice Chairman
if unavailable.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

 In accordance with the authority provided in 5 U.S.C. 7342, the Board's Rules Regarding Foreign Gifts and Decorations
currently state that requests for Board approval of the acceptance of travel or expenses for travel from a foreign
government of more than minimal value must be submitted to the Vice Chairman. 12 CFR 264b.3(d) The rules are silent
as to who is responsible for acting upon such requests in the Vice Chairman's absence. This rule will provide that the
Board's Administrative Governor is authorized to approve these requests when the Vice Chairman is unavailable.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



This rule relates solely to the internal management, operations and personnel of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve Board, and no notice of proposed rulemaking is required by 5 U.S.C. 553. Accordingly, the Regulatory Flexibility

Risk-Based Capital: Multifamily Housing Loans; 
Interest Rate Risk Component Delay of Effective Date 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Thrift Supervision, Treasury.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; delay of effective date.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is adopting a final rule that amends its risk-based capital regulation to give
a 50 percent risk weight to qualifying multifamily mortgage loans and securities backed by such loans (mortgage-backed
securities or MBS). The OTS is adopting this rule as part of an interagency initiative to implement the provisions
of section 618(b) of the Resolution Trust Corporation Refinancing, Restructuring, and Improvement Act of 1991 and
section 305(b)(1)(B) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991.


Multifamily mortgage loans that on the effective date of this rule qualified for the 50 percent risk-weight category
under criteria in the OTS's previous capital rule and continue to satisfy those criteria will continue to be risk-weighted
at 50 percent. 
The OTS is also further delaying the effective date of a portion of its Interest Rate Risk final rule adopted on August
31, 1993 and making a conforming amendment to the rule.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background Information 


A. Statutory Authority and Regulatory Background 


The OTS today is issuing a final rule amending its risk-based capital treatment of multifamily mortgage loans. This
rule conforms with the requirements of both section 618(b) of the Resolution Trust Corporation Refinancing, Restructuring,
and Improvement Act of 1991 (RTCRRIA)
 and section 305(b)(1)(B) of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA).






Section 618(b)(1) of RTCRRIA requires the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the
Office of Comptroller of the Currency, and the OTS (collectively, ``the federal banking agencies'') to accord a 50
percent risk weight to multifamily mortgage loans and related MBS meeting certain specified criteria and gives the
agencies discretion to add other prudential safeguards. Section 305(b)(1)(B) of FDICIA requires the federal banking
agencies to revise their risk-based capital standards to ensure that those standards reflect the actual performance
and expected risk of loss of multifamily mortgage loans. 
Under the OTS's existing risk-based capital regulation, multifamily mortgage loans are assigned to the 50 percent
risk-weight category if: They are secured by multifamily residential properties consisting of 5-to-36 dwelling
units; they have an initial loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of not more than 80 percent; and an average annual occupancy
rate of 80 percent or more of total units has existed for at least one year. While the criteria prescribed by RTCRRIA
for qualifying multifamily mortgage loans overlap with OTS's existing criteria for these loans, they are not identical.

Section 618(b)(2) of RTCRRIA requires that any loan fully secured by a first lien on a multifamily residential property
that is sold by a financial institution subject to a 

pro rata

 loss sharing arrangement be treated as a sale and not a recourse transaction, to the extent that the purchaser and not
the seller is exposed to loss on that loan portion. In addition, section 618(b)(3) of RTCRRIA provides that the federal
banking agencies must take into account loss sharing arrangements, other than 

pro rata

 arrangements, under their risk-based capital regulations. The statute requires the agencies to consider the extent
to which loans fully secured by a first lien on a multifamily residential property subject to other than 

pro rata

 loss sharing arrangements should be treated as sold, but it does not require the agencies to afford such arrangements
sales treatment. 

The OTS's regulations already satisfy the requirements of sections 618(b)(2) and (3) of RTCRRIA. The OTS requires
that savings associations follow generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Sales with recourse are recorded
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 77 ``Reporting by Transferors for Transfers
of Receivables with Recourse.'' 

Under the OTS's capital rule, in computing risk-based capital, the sale of a loan fully secured by a first lien on a multifamily
residential property would be accorded sales treatment if each participant is responsible solely for its 

pro rata

 share of the risk, there is no recourse to the originating association on the portion of the loan for which the buyer
is liable, and the transaction meets the requirements of SFAS No. 77. 

In addition, the OTS's current risk-based capital regulation provides that savings associations must include in
risk-weighted assets 100 percent of ``the values of assets sold with recourse * * * except where the
amount of recourse liability retained by the savings association is less than the capital requirement for credit-risk
exposure.'' 12 CFR 567.6(a)(2)(i)(C). Thus, the capital charge of a selling institution on loans sold with recourse
on either a 

pro rata

 or other than 

pro rata

 basis is limited to the institution's maximum contractual liability for losses on the loans sold, where the contractual
liability is less than the capital requirement for the asset. 



B. Description of the Proposal 



On September 2, 1992, the OTS published a notice of proposed rulemaking containing an amendment to the definition
of ``qualifying multifamily mortgage loan'' in its risk-based capital regulation. The proposed definition incorporated
the criteria set forth in section 618(b)(1) of RTCRRIA and added other, prudent underwriting standards. 57 FR 40143
(September 2, 1992). The public comment period on the proposal closed on October 2, 1992. 

Under the proposal, multifamily mortgage loans would qualify for the 50 percent risk-weight category if they satisfied
the following statutory criteria: (1) The loan must be secured by a first lien on a residence consisting of 5 or more
dwelling units; (2) the loan must amortize principal and interest over a period of not less than seven years and not
more than 30 years; (3) all payments of principal and interest must have been made on a timely basis in accordance with
the terms of the loan for at least one year; and (4) if the rate of interest does not change over the term of the loan, then:
(a) The LTV ratio at origination cannot exceed 80 percent, and (b) the ratio of annual net operating income generated
by the property (before payment of any debt service on the loan) to annual debt service on the loan cannot be less than
120 percent; or (5) if the loan has a variable rate, then: (a) The LTV ratio at origination cannot exceed 75 percent,
and (b) the ratio of annual net operating income generated by the property (before payment of any debt service on the
loan) to annual debt service on the loan cannot be less than 115 percent. 

The proposal also provided that multifamily mortgage loans must satisfy the following additional prudential criteria
to qualify for the 50 percent risk-weight category: (1) The loan must be performing and not more than 90 days past due;
(2) the loan must comply with applicable lending limit requirements and other prudent underwriting standards; and
(3) the multifamily residential property securing the loan must have had an average annual occupancy rate of 80 percent
or more total units for at least one year.

The final rule follows the approach set forth in the proposal with three modifications:

3

 the occupancy rate requirement has been removed; LTV ratios will be calculated based on the ratio of the current loan
balance to the value of the property; and multifamily loans that on the effective date of this rule qualified for a lower
risk-weight category under the OTS's previous regulations but do not qualify under the amended rule will be grandfathered.





II. Summary of Comments and OTS Response 



The OTS solicited public comment on all aspects of its proposed amendments to its risk-based capital regulation concerning
multifamily mortgage loans and MBS secured by or representing an interest in such loans. The OTS received a total of
31 comment letters. Those who submitted comments included 20 savings associations, 9 thrift and housing trade groups,
and 2 governmental-related entities. The discussion that follows identifies the principal issues raised in this
rulemaking and summarizes the OTS's response to these issues. 



A. Appropriate Risk-Weight Category 



All of the commenters supported the proposal to amend the risk-based capital regulation, although several commenters
suggested revisions. Generally, commenters believed it was appropriate to risk weight multifamily loans at 50 percent
because of the lower risk presented by these loans as compared with other real estate and commercial loans. Commenters
also indicated that this regulation would aid credit availability and cause more rental housing to become available
because lenders would have greater incentives to originate multifamily mortgage loans due to the lower capital charge
on such loans meeting the prudential criteria set forth in this rule. 

As required by section 305 of FDICIA, the OTS has analyzed the loss data on multifamily mortgage loans for savings associations
to determine the appropriate risk weight for such loans. The average annualized ratio of net charge-offs to the amount
of outstanding permanent multifamily mortgage loans was 0.59 percent for the thirteen quarters beginning March
1990 and ending March 31, 1993, as reported on the quarterly Thrift Financial Reports. In contrast, the average annualized
net charge-off rate over the same period was 0.11 percent for permanent 1-4 family residential mortgage loans,
1.17 percent for permanent nonresidential property loans, 1.19 percent for permanent commercial loans, 1.41 percent
for multifamily construction loans, and 2.19 percent for commercial construction loans. The average annualized
net charge-off rate over this period for all assets in the 100 percent risk-weight category was 0.83 percent. 

The average net charge-off rates for these assets for the four quarters of 1992 were the following: 0.74 percent for
permanent multifamily mortgage loans, 0.22 percent for permanent 1-4 family residential mortgage loans,
1.29 percent for nonresidential property loans, 1.37 percent for permanent commercial loans, 2.43 percent for multifamily
construction loans, and 2.32 percent for commercial construction loans. 

Although the net charge-off rate for permanent multifamily mortgage loans exceeded that for permanent 1-4
family residential loans, it was substantially below the net charge-off rates for the other types of loans specified
above during the entire period reviewed. Permanent multifamily mortgage loans also had a net charge-off rate well
below the average annualized aggregate net charge-off rate for 100 percent risk-weight assets for the twelve-month
period. 

Accordingly, the OTS believes that it is appropriate to accord a 50 percent risk weight to multifamily mortgage loans
satisfying the conservative underwriting and performance standards set forth in section 618(b) of RTCRRIA and two
of the three additional prudential criteria proposed by the federal banking agencies. The additional prudential
criteria retained in the final rule are: (1) The loan must be performing and not 90 days or more past due; and (2) the loan
must comply with prudent underwriting standards.

<TEXT>
 

This final rule appropriately affords a reduced risk weight to loans whose future repayment prospects are such that
they expose institutions to relatively low levels of credit risk. Multifamily mortgage loans not meeting the standards
set forth in this rule may pose higher risk of loss and should be placed in the 100 percent risk-weight category. This
final rule also satisfies the requirement of section 305 of FDICIA to ensure that multifamily mortgage loans are placed
in an appropriate risk-weight category based on actual performance and potential risk of loss. 



B. Criteria for Eligibility in the 50 Percent Risk-Weight 
Category 



1. Number-Of-Units Restriction 



The OTS's current risk-based capital regulation limits qualifying multifamily mortgage loans to properties with
five to 36 units. The OTS requested comments on whether to retain this restriction. The majority of commenters urged
the OTS not to impose a number-of-units restriction on the size of properties securing qualifying multifamily mortgage
loans. Two commenters advocated retaining the number-of-units restriction, claiming that loans on smaller multifamily
properties pose a lower risk of loss than larger projects. The OTS has considered these comments in light of the OTS's
general experience with its current rule providing reduced risk weighting for multifamily mortgage loans on relatively
small properties and believes they have some merit. Nevertheless, based on its data on the overall loss experience
for multifamily mortgage loans regardless of size, and to conform with the uniform position adopted by the federal
banking agencies, the OTS is not including a number-of-units restriction. 

A few commenters advocated removing a number-of-units restriction in order to allow mortgage loans secured by manufactured
housing properties to qualify for the 50 percent risk-weight category. The OTS wishes to clarify that its capital
rules generally, and this provision in particular, apply the same standards and principles to manufactured housing
as to other residential properties in determining the appropriate risk weight. 


2. LTV Ratio 



While a few commenters advocated calculating the LTV ratio at origination only, most commenters favored the agency's
suggestions that the LTV ratio could be computed when there has been a loan paydown or a more recent appraisal. Several
commenters cautioned the agency to control the frequency of new appraisals. 

Upon review, the OTS has determined to calculate LTV ratios as a continuing criterion based on current loan balance
to the value of the property. Prudent underwriting standards dictate that at origination of a loan to purchase a multifamily
property, the value of the property is the lower of acquisition cost of the property or the initial appraised value,
or, if appropriate, the value of the property as determined by the initial evaluation.

4

 The OTS recognizes that the value of property can change over time based on factors such as changes in market conditions
or material development of the property. Nothing in this rule prohibits the recomputation of the LTV ratio based on
such changes and developments. 




In cases not involving purchase of a multifamily property, the value of the property generally would be determined
by the most current appraisal, or, if appropriate, the most current evaluation. All appraisals and evaluations must
be made in a manner consistent with the OTS's real estate appraisal regulations, guidelines, and policies and with
the institution's own appraisal policies. Loans that exceed the LTV ratios set forth in the regulation at origination
will be permitted to qualify for the 50 percent risk weight when the loans are paid down below an 80 percent LTV ratio
for fixed rate loans and a 75 percent LTV ratio for variable rate loans, if the other criteria set forth in this regulation
are satisfied. 



3. 80 Percent Occupancy Rate 


The majority of commenters advocated removing the 80 percent occupancy-rate requirement. These commenters suggested
that the requirement was unnecessary in light of the debt service, LTV ratio, and timely payments requirements. A
few commenters also noted that occupancy rate may not accurately measure the income generated by a property. The OTS
concludes that the debt service requirement is a more accurate measure of the income-producing capacity of the property
than the occupancy-rate requirement and is eliminating the occupancy-rate requirement from the final rule. 



4. Timely Payments Requirement 



The proposal includes the requirement that loans receive timely payment of principal and interest for the year preceding
its placement in the 50 percent risk-weight category. The OTS received many comments on the effect of the timely payments
requirement on the willingness of institutions to make multifamily mortgage loans. Several commenters urged that,
for other than new construction loans, lenders be permitted to look at the property's prior operating history to determine
compliance with the timely payments requirement. This would allow loans on properties with a history of timely payments
to qualify for the 50 percent risk-weight category at origination.

<DOCNO> FR940318-0-00018 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940318-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

To clarify some misunderstanding of this criterion, the determination whether the timely payments requirement
is met is made only once, at the time when the institution decides to place the multifamily mortgage loan in the 50 percent
risk-weight category. ``Timely payments'' will generally be considered those payments not 30 days or more past due.
The criteria that the loan be performing and not 90 days or more past due will be used to monitor the payment stream of
the loan on an ongoing basis. 
Upon review, the OTS has decided that, when a borrower refinances a loan on an existing property, as an alternative,
the timely payments requirement may be satisfied if: (1) All principal and interest payments on the loan being refinanced
have been made on a timely basis in accordance with the terms of that loan for the preceding year and (2) the net income
on the property for the preceding year would support timely principal and interest payments on the new loan in accordance
with the applicable debt service requirement. 
5. Cooperative and Not-For-Profit Multifamily Mortgage Loans 
Five commenters asked that a cooperative housing loan where the master mortgage is a joint obligation of the shareholders
in the cooperative be treated as a qualifying multifamily mortgage loan under the rule. Certain cooperative and other
not-for-profit multifamily housing properties, however, may not be able to generate sufficient income to satisfy
the debt service ratio required by the rule. Therefore, the OTS will permit cooperatives and other not-for-profit
multifamily properties to meet the debt service ratio requirement by generating sufficient cash flows to provide
comparable protection to the institution. Debt service coverage providing comparable protection to the institution
may take a number of different forms that include, but are not limited to, special operating reserves accounts or special
operating subsidies provided by federal, state, local, or private sources. 



6. Treatment of MBS 



Some commenters agreed with the requirement in the proposal that, in order to qualify for a 50 percent risk weight,
MBS must be secured by or represent an interest in qualifying multifamily mortgage loans at the time of securitization.
Several commenters suggested that the final rule allow multifamily mortgage loans to be securitized immediately,
and the MBS backed by such loans to qualify for the lower risk-weight category after the underlying mortgage loans
have satisfied the timely payments requirement. 
Upon review of this issue and consultation with the other federal banking agencies, the OTS has decided that it will
generally expect MBS secured by or representing an interest in multifamily mortgage loans to qualify for the 50 percent
risk-weight category at original securitization. Thus, all of the underlying multifamily mortgage loans must satisfy
the qualifying criteria, including the timely payments requirement, at the time the MBS is securitized. 
The MBS will remain in the 50 percent risk-weight category provided the investing institution receives timely payments
(generally those payments not 30 days or more past due) of principal and interest in accordance with the terms of the
MBS. However, institutions holding the multifamily MBS, or servicers or trustees on their behalf, will not be required
to track the continuing qualification of the underlying mortgage loans. 
Several commenters misunderstood the interaction of this provision regarding certain MBS with other provisions
concerning MBS in the OTS's risk-based capital regulation. Today's rule only addresses privately issued, non-high-quality
MBS backed by qualifying multifamily mortgage loans. MBS backed by multifamily mortgage loans that are issued or
guaranteed by a U.S. government sponsored enterprise; that are privately issued and rated in one of the two highest
rating categories by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating service; and those with residual characteristics
would be treated the same as MBS with the same characteristics backed by 1-4 family residential mortgage loans.



C. Grandfathering of Loans Currently Qualifying for the 50 Percent Risk-Weight Category 



The majority of commenters favored the OTS's proposal to ``grandfather'' the risk-weighting of existing multifamily
mortgage loans qualifying for the 50 percent risk-weight category under the OTS's prior regulation, but not qualifying
under the new criteria. The other federal banking agencies are not presented with this issue since their existing
capital rules do not provide a 50 percent risk-weight for any multifamily mortgage loans. 

OTS's supervisory experience with multifamily mortgage loans qualifying for the 50 percent risk-weight category
under its prior rule shows no reason to increase the capital charge on these loans to 100 percent. Associations that
originated and administered these loans in accordance with the prudent criteria established by the OTS's prior rule
should retain the benefit of the reduced capital charge. Therefore, the OTS has decided to ``grandfather'' any multifamily
mortgage loans that, on the effective date of this rule, qualified for the 50 percent risk-weight category under the
OTS's previous rule and that continue to meet those criteria. Any ``grandfathered'' multifamily mortgage loan that
does not remain in compliance with the requirements of the prior rule may requalify for the 50 percent risk-weight
category only by satisfying the criteria under today's rule. 

Several commenters urged the OTS to retain its existing criteria or to adopt less stringent criteria for loans on multifamily
properties with less than 36 units because such loans present less risk than loans on larger properties. The OTS has
given serious consideration to this suggestion, but in the interest of interagency uniformity has determined not
to provide a reduced risk weight to new loans qualifying under the prior OTS rule. 



D. Recourse

One commenter suggested that the OTS clarify and amend the recourse provisions of its capital rule to recognize more
subtle distinctions in risk. Upon consideration, the OTS has decided not to amend its recourse provisions as part
of this rulemaking because the OTS and the other federal banking agencies are considering the treatment of loss sharing
arrangements and related recourse issues as part of their comprehensive interagency review of recourse, initiated
by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Counsel (FFIEC). Under the FFIEC's initiative, the agencies
are considering revisions to their risk-based capital standards to distinguish among loss sharing arrangements
involving asset sales based on the degree of risk involved in the transaction. 


III. Description of the Final Rule 


Under today's final rule, multifamily mortgage loans qualify for the 50 percent risk-weight category if they satisfy
the following criteria: (1) The loan must be secured by a first lien on a multifamily residential property consisting
of 5 or more dwelling units; (2) the loan must amortize principal and interest over a period at origination of not less
than seven years and not more than 30 years; (3) when the loan is considered for a lower risk-weight category, all principal
and interest payments have been made on a timely basis in accordance with its terms for the preceding year; (4) the loan
is performing and not 90 days or more past due; (5) the loan is made by the savings association in accordance with prudent
underwriting standards; and (6) if the interest rate on the loan does not change over the term of the loan, then: (a)
The current loan balance amount does not exceed 80 percent of the value of the property securing the loan; and (b) for
the property's most recent fiscal year, the ratio of annual net operating income generated by the property (before
payment of any debt service on the loan) to annual debt service on the loan is not less than 120 percent, or in the case
of cooperative or other not-for-profit housing projects, the property generates equivalent debt service coverage;
or (7) if the loan has a variable rate, then: (a) The current loan balance amount does not exceed 75 percent of the value
of the property securing the loan; and (b) for the property's most recent fiscal year, the ratio of net operating income
generated by the property (before payment of any debt service on the loan) to annual debt service on the loan is not less
than 115 percent, or in the case of cooperative or other not-for-profit housing projects, the property generates
equivalent debt service coverage. 
In addition, the final rule extends ``grandfathered'' treatment to those multifamily mortgage loans that on the
effective date of this rule qualified for the 50 percent risk-weight category under the definition of ``qualifying
multifamily mortgage loan'' in the OTS's previous capital rule and continue to satisfy the criteria of that definition,
but do not satisfy all the criteria for inclusion in the 50 percent risk-weight category under today's rule. Any ``grandfathered''
multifamily mortgage loan that does not remain in compliance with the requirements of the prior rule may requalify
for the 50 percent risk-weight category only by satisfying the criteria set forth in today's rule. 
Under today's rule, a multifamily mortgage loan

5

 must continue to meet the requisite criteria on an ongoing basis, unless otherwise specified, for the loan to remain
in the 50 percent risk-weight category. A multifamily mortgage loan that does not remain in compliance with the requirements
set forth in today's rule must be reassigned to the appropriate risk-weight category. The OTS notes that institutions
may make multifamily mortgage loans that do not meet the criteria set forth in this rule so long as such loans conform
with prudent underwriting standards. Such loans must be placed in the appropriate risk-weight category. 
 




Furthermore, purchasers of multifamily mortgage loans may look to the borrower's payment history with the selling
institution and the characteristics of the purchased loans to determine compliance with the timely payments requirement
and other qualifying criteria under this rule. Likewise, institutions with multifamily mortgage loans in their
portfolio that did not qualify for a lower risk-weight under the OTS's previous risk-based capital rule may review
the borrower's prior payment history to determine compliance with this rule's criteria.

IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Loans on multifamily properties with a small number of
units are already covered under the existing risk-based capital regulation and will continue to be covered under
either the grandfathering provision or the new rule. 


V. Executive Order 12866 


The OTS has determined that this final rule does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action.'' 


VI. Effective Date 


This final multifamily rule is effective upon publication in the 

Federal Register

 without the 30-day delay of effective date provided for in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. The delayed
effective date requirement may be waived for ``good cause.'' The OTS has determined that good cause exists to waive
the delayed effective date requirement since the rule relieves a restriction on savings associations by permitting
them to utilize a lower risk weight for eligible multifamily housing loans and securities collateralized by such
loans in calculations of their risk-based capital ratios. This effective date will enable savings associations
to use the reduced risk weight for multifamily housing loans in their Thrift Financial Report for the quarter ending
March 31, 1994. 
One of today's amendments affects a credit risk-weight category at section 567.6(a)(1)(iii)(C), a section also
amended by Interest Rate Risk. 58 FR 45813 (August 31, 1993). The Interest Rate Risk amendments to 567.6 were originally
to become effective on July 1, 1994, when a savings association would first have been required to deduct an interest
rate risk component in calculating its risk-based capital requirement. To simplify reporting requirements, the
agency is changing the effective date of those amendments to September 30, 1994. OTS is therefore publishing on an
interim basis section 567.6(a)(1)(iii)(C) as it will be in effect from March 18, 1994 through September 29, 1994.
This reflects today's multifamily amendment to this section, but not the change that the interest rate risk amendments
will make to that section. Section 567.6(a)(1)(iii)(C) as it will be in effect on and after September 30, 1994 follows.

Finally, a conforming amendment is being made to section 567.7(a) to change the date the deduction of an institution's
interest rate risk component becomes effective.

Qualifying multifamily mortgage loan.

 (1) The term 

qualifying multifamily mortgage loan

 means a loan secured by a first lien on multifamily residential properties consisting of 5 or more dwelling units,
provided that:

(i) The amortization of principal and interest occurs over a period of not more than 30 years;

(ii) The original minimum maturity for repayment of principal on the loan is not less than seven years;

(iii) When considering the loan for placement in a lower risk-weight category, all principal and interest payments
have been made on a timely basis in accordance with its terms for the preceding year;

(iv) The loan is performing and not 90 days or more past due;

(v) The loan is made by the savings association in accordance with prudent underwriting standards; and

(vi) If the interest rate on the loan does not change over the term of the loan:

(A) The current loan balance amount does not exceed 80 percent of the value of the property securing the loan; and

(B) For the property's most recent fiscal year, the ratio of annual net operating income generated by the property
(before payment of any debt service on the loan) to annual debt service on the loan is not less than 120 percent, or in
the case of cooperative or other not-for-profit housing projects, the property generates sufficient cash flows
to provide comparable protection to the institution; or

(vii) If the interest rate on the loan changes over the term of the loan:

(A) The current loan balance amount does not exceed 75 percent of the value of the property securing the loan; and

(B) For the property's most recent fiscal year, the ratio of annual net operating income generated by the property
(before payment of any debt service on the loan) to annual debt service on the loan is not less than 115 percent, or in
the case of cooperative or other not-for-profit housing projects, the property generates sufficient cash flows
to provide comparable protection to the institution.

(2) The term 

qualifying multifamily mortgage loan

 also includes a multifamily mortgage loan that on March 18, 1994 was a first mortgage loan on an existing property consisting

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) published a final regulation under part 615 on January 27, 1994 (59 FR 3785).
The final regulation amends 12 CFR part 615 to allow Farm Credit System institutions to document the existence of a
first lien on the security for long-term real estate mortgage loans by obtaining title insurance or an attorney's
certification. In accordance with 12 U.S.C. 2252, the effective date of the final rule is 30 days from the date of publication
in the 

Federal Register

 during which either or both Houses of Congress are in session. Based on the records of the sessions of Congress, the
effective date of the regulations is March 18, 1994.

Small Business Size Regulations; Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Small Business Administration (SBA).

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Small Business Administration amends its regulations governing the Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership
Development program authorized by sections 7(j)(10) and 8(a) of the Small Business Act. Several statutory changes
have been made affecting the 8(a) program that have not previously been incorporated in SBA's regulations. This final
rule is needed to remove the inconsistencies that currently exist in SBA's regulations due to these statutory provisions,
as well as a procedural inconsistency that currently exists between SBA's regulations and the Federal Acquisition
Regulations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 21, 1989, SBA published a final rule in the 

Federal Register

, 54 FR 34692, amending its regulations with respect to the Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development
program authorized by sections 7(j)(10) and 8(a) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C.   636(j)(10) and
637(a). That rule finalized SBA's implementation of the Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988, Public
Law 100-656, 102 Stat. 3853. SBA published technical amendments to this rule on August 27, 1990, 55 FR 34901.
Several statutory changes have been made affecting the 8(a) program since these regulatory revisions and need to
be incorporated into SBA's regulations. This final rule is needed to remove the inconsistencies that currently exist
in SBA's regulations due to these statutory provisions.




Section 203 of the Small Business Administration Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 1990, Public Law 101-574,
104 Stat. 2818, statutorily amended SBA's requirement that an applicant concern be in business for two years in order
for it to be eligible for Program Participation. That law authorizes SBA to establish a minimum time in business requirement
only if a possible waiver of that requirement is also provided. SBA's regulation concerning the two-year in business
requirement, contained in 13 CFR 124.107, needs to be amended to identify the criteria for a waiver to the two-year
in business rule. Confusion among 8(a) applicants has arisen because this regulation has not yet been amended.

Public Law 101-574 also made three statutory changes, relating to participation in the 8(a) program by tribally-owned
concerns, that need to be implemented in the regulations. The first of these changes overrides SBA's previous regulation
concerning affiliation of tribally-owned concerns for size purposes. Section 204 of Public Law 101-574, 104
Stat. 2819, amended section 7(j)(10)(J)(ii) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 636(j)(10)(J)(ii), to specify
that, for purposes of the 8(a) program, the size of a tribally-owned concern generally shall be determined without
regard to its affiliation with the tribe, any entity of the tribal government, or any other business enterprise owned
by the tribe. SBA's previous regulation permitted affiliation to be found with other tribally-owned entities based
on one or more relationships other than common tribal ownership. This final rule incorporates the statutory language
into SBA's regulations. The other two statutory changes pertain to 8(a) joint ventures between tribally-owned concerns
and large businesses. Section 205 of Public Law 101-574, 104 Stat. 2819-20, increased the number of 8(a)
joint ventures authorized between tribally-owned concerns and large businesses from two to five and extended, through
September 30, 1994, the authorization for tribally-owned 8(a) concerns to enter joint ventures with large businesses.
This final rule incorporates these changes into the regulations.
Additionally, Section 206 of Public Law 101-574, 104 Stat. 2820, extended SBA's surety bond waiver authority
in section 7(j)(13)(D)(iii) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 636(j)(13)(D)(iii), from October 1, 1992, to October
1, 1994. This final rule adds that statutory revision.

Section 207 of Public Law 101-574, 104 Stat. 2820, amended section 8(a)(1) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C.
637(a)(1), to authorize SBA to award a competitive 8(a) contract to a concern whose term of participation in the 8(a)
program has expired if the concern was an eligible Program Participant on the date specified for receipt of offers
contained in the contract solicitation. This final rule incorporates this provision into the regulations.

Finally, a second, contract-specific waiver to SBA's nonmanufacturer rule (the requirement that, for a supply contract,
a small business concern that is not itself the manufacturer must provide the product of a small business manufacturer)
is added to the substantive size regulations for both 8(a) and small business set-aside contracts. This change incorporates
the statutory change to the Small Business Act made by Section 210 of Public Law 101-574, 104 Stat. 2821. While
the procedures for requesting and receiving such a waiver were published as a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 on September 21, 1993, 58 FR 48981, a change is also needed to the substantive size rules recognizing this type of waiver.

In addition to these changes (necessitated by Public Law 101-574), Section 10 of the Alaska Land Status Technical
Corrections Act of 1992, Public Law 102-415, 106 Stat. 2112, 2115, eliminated the need for SBA to determine whether
a specific Alaska Native Corporation (ANC) is economically disadvantaged in determining the eligibility of an ANC-owned
business entity for the 8(a) program. This final rule deletes SBA's regulatory provision requiring SBA to determine
the economic disadvantage of an ANC prior to determining eligibility of an ANC-owned business entity. SBA's regulations
concerning eligibility determinations in competitive 8(a) acquisitions are not consistent with the FAR regarding
the same subject. The FAR authorize procuring agency contracting officers, in negotiated competitive 8(a) acquisitions,
to submit to SBA for an eligibility determination only the 8(a) offeror determined by the procuring agency to be the
apparent successful offeror. 48 CFR 19.805-2(c)(2). SBA's regulations have permitted a procuring agency
contracting officer to submit all 8(a) offerors determined to be in the competitive range for eligibility determinations.
The conflict in the two regulations has caused confusion and friction between SBA and procuring agencies. SBA believes
that the FAR approach to eligibility determinations in negotiated competitive 8(a) acquisitions is the better approach
and adopts it in this final rule.

This final rule corrects a typographical error in the 8(a) regulations which, in a cross reference, inadvertently
refers to the ``developmental'' stage of program participation instead of the ``transitional'' stage of program
participation. It also changes references to the ``Office of Program Eligibility'' or ``OPE'' to the ``Division
of Program Certification and Eligibility'' or ``DPCE.''

Section by Section Analysis



The following is a section by section analysis of each provision of SBA's regulations that is affected by this final
rule:

Paragraphs 121.1102(a) and 124.112(c)(2) are amended to take into account the statutory amendments to the Small
Business Act regarding affiliation of tribally-owned 8(a) concerns made by Section 204 of the Small Business Administration
Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 1990, Public Law 101-574, 104 Stat. 2814, 2819. This statute specifies
that, in determining the size of a small business concern owned by a socially and economically disadvantaged Indian
tribe (or a wholly owned business entity of such tribe) for either 8(a) program entry or contract award, each firm's
size shall be determined independently without regard to its affiliation with the tribe, any entity of the tribal
government, or any other business enterprise owned by the tribe, unless the Administrator determines that one or
more such tribally-owned business concerns have obtained, or are likely to obtain, a substantial unfair competitive
advantage within an industry category. Prior to this statutory change, ownership by an Indian tribe, by itself, would
not cause SBA to determine an 8(a) applicant/concern to be affiliated with the tribe or other entities owned by the
tribe. Affiliation with other tribally-owned entities could have been caused by circumstances other than common
tribal ownership (for example, affiliation through common management or common facilities). The two relevant paragraphs
of SBA's regulations (one in the size regulations and one in the 8(a) regulations) are amended to provide for the statutory
change.

Paragraphs 121.906(b)(3) (for small business set aside contracts) and 121.1106(b)(3) (for 8(a) contracts) are
amended to provide for a second exception to SBA's nonmanufacturer rule. The nonmanufacturer rule requires that,
for a supply contract, a small business that is not itself the manufacturer of the items being procured must supply
the product of a small business manufacturer. SBA's regulations previously provided for an exception to this requirement
where there are no small business manufacturers or processors in the Federal market. Section 210 of Public Law 101-574,
104 Stat. 2814, 2821, amended the Small Business Act to authorize a second exception where the Administrator accepts
a determination by the contracting officer that no small business manufacturer or processor reasonably can be expected
to offer a product meeting the specifications (including period for performance) required of an offeror by the solicitation.
The regulations are amended to incorporate this statutory change.

Section 124.107 is amended to take into account the statutory amendments to SBA's two-year in business rule made by
Section 203 of the Small Business Administration Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 1990, Public Law 101-574,
104 Stat. 2818-19. The statutory criteria for waiver of the two-year rule are repeated in this final rule. In
addition, the rule clarifies that, if an applicant concern has performed only government contracts or only private
sector contracts, the applicant's performance on those contracts alone will be reviewed to determine whether the
applicant possesses a record of successful performance. This implementation avoids the possible interpretation
that a waiver is available only to those concerns that have successfully performed both public and private sector
contracts.

Paragraph 124.111(a)(2)(ii) is amended to correct a typographical error. The paragraph speaks of maintaining eligibility
in the transitional stage of Program Participation, but cross references to information on the developmental stage
of Program Participation. This final rule amends the cross reference to refer to the transitional stage of Program
Participation.

Paragraphs 124.112(a)(1) and 124.112(c) are amended to include a reference to entities which are themselves owned
by wholly-owned business entities of Indian tribes, in accord with section 204(b) of Public Law 101-574, 104
Stat. 2819.

Paragraph 124.112(a)(3) is amended to eliminate the regulatory provision requiring SBA to determine whether a specific
ANC is economically disadvantaged. Section 10 of the Alaska Land Status Technical Corrections Act of 1992, Public
Law 102-415, 106 Stat. 2112, 2115, amended Section 29(e) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C.
1626(e)) to provide as follows:

(e)(1) For all purposes of Federal law, a Native Corporation shall be considered to be a corporation owned and controlled
by Natives and a minority and economically disadvantaged business enterprise if the Settlement Common Stock of the
corporation and other stock of the corporation held by holders of Settlement Common Stock and by Natives and descendants
of Natives, represents a majority of both the total equity of the corporation and the total voting power of the corporation
for the purposes of electing directors.




This rule would merely put the substance of this statutory provision into SBA's 8(a) regulations.



Redesignated paragraph 124.112(c)(2)(iv) and paragraph 124.321(h)(2) are both amended to increase from two to
five the number of 8(a) joint venture opportunities that an 8(a) tribally-owned concern is authorized to enter into
with large business concerns. These amendments implement the change made to the Small Business act by Section 205
of Public Law 101-574, 104 Stat. 2814, 2819.

Paragraph 124.305(f) is amended to reflect an extension of the surety bond exemption authority from October 1, 1992
to October 1, 1994. This change is statutorily authorized by Section 206 of Public Law 101-574, 104 Stat. 2820.

Section 124.307 is amended by adding a new paragraph (e) and Section 124.311 is amended by adding a new paragraph (i)
to authorize SBA to award a competitive 8(a) contract to a concern whose program term has expired if the concern was
an eligible Program Participant on the date specified in the contract solicitation for the receipt of offers. The
change in  124.307 recognizes the authority established in  124.311(i) as an exception to the general
requirement that an 8(a) contract can be awarded only to a concern that is still a current Program Participant on the
date of contract award. These changes are necessary to take into account the statutory revisions made by Section 207
of Public Law 101-574, 104 Stat. 2820. Consistent with these changes, with current  19.805-2(c)
of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and with current SBA policy,
 124.311(f)(4) is also amended to state that eligibility in the competitive 8(a) context is to be determined
as of the date of a Participant's submission of its initial offer which includes price. In other words, so long as a firm
was eligible on the date that it submitted its initial offer which included price, it would remain eligible despite
changes in circumstances prior to award. So long as the award of the contract would be within the Participant's approved
support level on the date that it submits its initial offer which includes price, the receipt of additional 8(a) contract
support after that date and prior to award would not affect the concern's support level eligibility.

Paragraph 124.311(f)(4) also is amended to make SBA's regulations consistent with the FAR in connection with eligibility
determinations for competitive 8(a) awards. While it is SBA's view that because SBA is the agency charged with the
responsibility of implementing the Small Business Act, including the 8(a) program, its regulations take precedence
over the FAR in all matters interpreting the Small Business act, SBA believes that the FAR's approach to eligibility
determinations in the context of negotiated procurements is the better approach. The change to SBA's regulations
is needed to clear up the confusion that exists with procuring agency contracting officers and SBA personnel that
are attempting to implement conflicting provisions of the FAR and SBA's regulations. SBA's regulations had permitted
a procuring agency to submit all offerors within the competitive range. Under the approach taken by the FAR, and adopted
in this rule by SBA, in a negotiated competitive 8(a) procurement, the procuring agency would submit to SBA for an eligibility
determination only the 8(a) offeror determined by the procuring agency to be the apparent successful offeror.

SBA believes that the revised rule is more consistent with the way size eligibility is determined in the small business
set-aside context. In that area, when requested by the procuring agency contracting officer, SBA will determine
the size eligibility only of the apparent successful offeror, not of some broader group of offerors. For 8(a) competitive
requirements, if the apparent successful offeror is found to be ineligible, SBA then would go to the second highest
ranked offeror, and so on, until an eligible 8(a) Participant was found. This rule would not preclude procuring agencies
from sending a list of highest to lowest ranked Participants as determined by the procuring agency, but it would limit
SBA's eligibility determination to one firm at a time until an eligible offeror was determined. Because this provision
is a procedural rule, it is adopted as a final rule without the necessity of a proposed rule and an opportunity for public
comment.

Paragraph 124.321(h)(3) is amended by changing the sunset date for authorizing 8(a) joint ventures between tribally-owned
8(a) concerns and large businesses from September 30, 1991 to September 30, 1994.

Paragraph 124.601(c) is amended by changing the reference to the procedures for size protests for the Department
of Defense's Small Disadvantaged Business program from `` 121.9'' to ``  121.1601-121.1608.''
The reference to  121.9 contained in  124.601(c) is a reference to the procedures relating to size protests
and requests for size determinations. At the time  124.601(c) was added to SBA's regulations,  121.9
was entitled ``Protest of small business status.'' 13 CFR 121.9 (1989). When SBA's size regulations were amended
in December 1989, see 54 Fed. Reg. 52634 (Dec. 21, 1989), the reference in  124.601(c) was not correspondingly
changed. The substance of former  121.9 is currently contained in   121.1601 through 121.1608.
These sections are now entitled ``Procedures for Size Protests and Requests for Formal Size Determinations.'' 13
CFR 121.1601-121.1608 (1993). Thus, this change merely updates the citation to SBA's size protest procedures.

Paragraphs 124.602(f), 124.602(g), 124.604, 124.605(a)(3), and 124.605(c)(1) are amended by changing the phrase
``Office of Program Eligibility'' to read ``Division of Program Certification and Eligibility.'' Paragraphs 124.602(g),
124.604, 124.607(d), 124.608(a), 124.608(b), 124.608(b)(1), 124.608(b)(3), 124.608(c), 124.609(a), and 124.609(b)
are amended by changing the term ``OPE'' to read ``DPCE.'' These changes are intended to reflect an internal restructuring
of SBA's Office of Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development.



Compliance With Executive Orders 12612, 12778, and 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.),
and the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Ch. 35)



SBA certifies that this final rule will not be considered a significant rule within the meaning of Executive Order
12866 and will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq. 

This rule is necessary to resolve several points relating to eligibility for SBA's Section 8(a) program. It will have
no effect, however, on the amount or dollar value of any contract requirement or the number of requirements reserved
for the 8(a) program. As such, it is not likely to have an annual economic effect of $100 million or more, result in a major
increase in costs or prices, or have a significant adverse effect on competition or the United States economy.

For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Ch. 35, SBA certifies that this final rule contains no new reporting
or record keeping requirements.

For purposes of Executive Order 12612, SBA certifies that this rule does not have any federalism implications warranting
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For purposes of Executive Order 12778, SBA certifies that this rule is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance
with the standards set forth in Section 2 of that Order.

6. Section 124.107 is amended by revising the introductory text, by redesignating paragraphs (b) and (c) as paragraphs
(c) and (d), respectively, by revising paragraph (a), and by adding a new paragraph (b) to read as follows:



 124.107

Potential for success.



Except for tribally-owned applicant concerns which must meet the requirements of  124.112(c)(6), SBA will
approve a concern for Program Participation only when it finds that the applicant concern possesses reasonable prospects
for success in competing in the private sector and has been in business in its primary industry classification for
two full years, unless a waiver for the two-year in business requirement is granted pursuant to paragraph (b) of this
section.

(a) Unless a waiver is granted pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, an applicant concern must demonstrate that
it has been in business in the primary industry classification in which it seeks 8(a) certification for two full years
prior to the date of its 8(a) application by submitting income tax returns showing revenues for each of the two previous
years.

(b) The requirement that an applicant concern be in business for two full years may be waived, and the concern shall
be considered to have demonstrated reasonable prospects for success, if each of the five conditions set forth in paragraph
(b)(1) of this section are met.

(1) The two-year in business requirement may be waived if_

(i) The individual or individuals upon whom eligibility is to be based have substantial and demonstrated business
management experience;

(ii) The prospective Program Participant has demonstrated technical experience to carry out its business plan with
a substantial likelihood for success;

(iii) The prospective Program Participant has adequate capital to sustain its operations and carry out its business
plan;

(iv) The prospective Program Participant has a record of successful performance on contracts from governmental
and/or nongovernmental sources in the primary industry category in which the prospective Program Participant is
seeking Program certification; and

(v) The prospective Program Participant has, or can demonstrate its ability to timely obtain, the personnel, facilities,
equipment, and any other requirements needed to perform such contracts.

(2) In order to be eligible for a waiver of the two-year in business requirement, an applicant concern that has been
in business for less than two years must indicate in its application that it seeks a waiver, must provide information
on governmental and nongovernmental contracts in progress and completed (including letters of reference) to establish
successful contract performance, and must demonstrate how it otherwise meets the five conditions for waiver.

(3) SBA shall consider an applicant's performance on both government and private sector contracts if the applicant
has performed contracts in both arenas. In such a case, an applicant's performance on both types of contracts will
be reviewed to determine whether the firm has an overall successful performance record. If, however, the applicant
has performed only government contracts or only private sector contracts, the applicant's performance on those
contracts alone will be reviewed to determine whether the applicant possesses a record of successful performance.

(c) * * *

(2) * * *

(i) A tribally-owned applicant concern must qualify as a small business concern as defined for purposes of Government
procurement in part 121 of this title. The particular size standard to be applied shall be based on the primary industry
classification of the applicant concern.



* * * * *



(iii) In determining the size of a small business concern owned by a socially and economically disadvantaged Indian
tribe (or a wholly owned business entity of such tribe) for either 8(a) program entry or contract award, each firm's
size shall be determined independently without regard to its affiliation with the tribe, any entity of the tribal
government, or any other business enterprise owned by the tribe, unless the Administrator determines that one or
more such tribally-owned business concerns have obtained, or are likely to obtain, a substantial unfair competitive
advantage within an industry category.



* * * * *



12. Newly redesignated paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of section 124.112 is further amended by removing ``two'' and adding
``five'' in place thereof in the introductory text.

(f) 

Expiration date. 

The exemptions described in this section are authorized only until October 1, 1994, and apply only to those contracts
awarded on or after August 21, 1989.

14. Section 124.307 is amended by adding new paragraph (e) to read as follows:



 124.307 

Contractual assistance.

15. Section 124.311(f)(4) is revised to read as follows:



 124.311 

8(a) competition.



* * * * *



(f) * * *

(4)(i) In a sealed bid acquisition, upon the receipt of offers, the procuring agency shall submit to SBA a list of offerors
ranked in the order of their standing for award (that is, lowest bid, second low bid, etc.) with the total evaluated
price for each offer, differentiating between basic requirements and any options.

(ii) In a negotiated acquisition, the procuring agency shall transmit to SBA the offeror determined by the procuring
agency to be the apparent successful offeror. Such a referral generally shall be made at the time the procuring agency
transmits the 8(a) contract documents to SBA for signature, unless the contracting officer has made a responsibility
referral to SBA under FAR 19.809. In the case of such a referral, SBA shall determine eligibility when the responsibility
referral is made to SBA, and may determine responsibility both at the time of the referral and at the time of award.

(iii) Eligibility shall be determined as of the date of a Participant's submission of its initial offer which includes
price. In addition, eligibility is determined for each competitive 8(a) acquisition independent of other 8(a) acquisitions
for which a Participant has submitted an offer, but for which no award has been made.







Example. 

Participant X has an approved 8(a) support level of $1 million. To date, X has received no 8(a) contract support. X submits
offers that include price on five separate 8(a) competitive procurements (each with a $500,000 base year). The $1
million support level is not an eligibility bar to the Participant receiving any or all of the five acquisitions for
which it submitted an offer because at the time that it submitted its offers, it was eligible to receive each contract
independent of the other four contracts. In this example, it is possible that X is ultimately awarded all five contracts,
even though the five taken together would be in excess of its applicable support level. Once awards have actually been
made in excess of the $1 million support level, any 

subsequent

 offers would be made in the face of ineligibility.



* * * * *



16. Section 124.311 is further amended by revising the introductory text in paragraph (f)(5), redesignating paragraphs
(f)(5)(iii) and (f)(5)(iv) as paragraphs (f)(5)(iv) and (f)(5)(v), respectively, adding a new paragraph (f)(5)(iii),
and revising the first sentence of newly redesignated paragraph (f)(5)(v) to read as follows:



 124.311 

8(a) competition.



* * * * *



(f) * * *

(5) Within 5 working days after receipt of the procuring agency's request for an eligibility determination, the SBA
will determine whether any firm identified is eligible for award of the contract, including:



* * * * *



(iii) If the procurement is to be restricted within a particular stage of program participation or a particular geographical
area, whether the firm is within the required stage of development or location;



* * * * *



(v) If the firm is in the transitional stage, whether it has exceeded its approved business support level by more than
25 percent (or will exceed such level if it is awarded the contract at issue), and whether it has achieved its competitive
business mix targets under 124.312. * * *



* * * * *



17. Section 124.311 is further amended by adding the following new paragraph (i) to read as follows:



 124.311 

8(a) competition.



* * * * *



(i) 

Award to firms whose program terms have expired. 

A concern that has completed its term of participation in the 8(a) program, as set forth in  124.110, may be awarded
a competitive 8(a) contract if it was a Program Participant eligible for award of the contract on the date specified
for receipt of offers contained in the contract solicitation.



 124.321 

[Amended]



18. Section 124.321(h)(2) is amended by removing ``two'' and adding ``five'' in its place.

19. Section 124.321(h)(3) is amended by removing ``September 30, 1991'' and adding ``September 30, 1994.''



 124.601 

[Amended]



20. Section 124.601(c) is amended by removing the reference to a `` 121.9'' and adding ``  121.1601-121.1608.''



  124.602, 124.604 and 124.605 

[Amended]



21. Sections 124.602(f), 124.602(g), 124.604, 124.605(a)(3), and 124.605(c)(1) are amended by revising the phrase
``Office of Program Eligibility'' to read ``Division of Programs Certification and Eligibility'' wherever it appears.



  124.602, 124.604, 124.607 and 124.608 

[Amended]



22. Sections 124.602(g), 124.604, 124.607(d), 124.608(a), 124.608(b) introductory text, 124.608(b)(1), 124.608(b)(3),
124.608(c), 124.609(a), and 124.609(b) are amended by revising the term ``OPE'' to read ``DPCE'' wherever it appears.

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and  97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Forms
8260-3, 8260-4, and 8260-5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above.



The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 

Federal Register

 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers or aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.

This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. Some
SIAP amendments may have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for some SIAP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining
SIAPs, an effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided.

Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions
existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these
SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary,
impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal Instrument
Approach Procedures (TERPs). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions existing
or anticipated at the affected airports. The FAA has determined through extensive testing that current non-localizer
type, non-precision instrument approaches developed using the United States Standard for Terminal Instrument
Approach Procedures (TERPS) criteria can be safely flown by aircraft equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS)
avionics which are FAA approved. In consideration of the above, the applicable Instrument Approach Procedures (IAPs)
will be recharted to include ``or GPS'' in the title without otherwise reviewing, modifying, or amending the procedure.
This will allow those IAPs to be conducted without consideration of the status of the navigation aid or avionics that
defines the underlying approach in the existing rule. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these
SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary,
impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``major
rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures

Standard Instrument Approach Procedures: Miscellaneous Amendments


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of changes occurring in the National
Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities, addition of new obstacles, or changes
in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace
and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the affected airports.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and  97.20 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as stated
above.


The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 

Federal Register

 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction of charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The Provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.


The Rule


This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amend, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been cancelled. The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained
in the U.S. Standard for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs
by FDC/P NOTAMS, the TERPs criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports.
This amendment to part 97 contains separate SIAPs which have compliance dates stated as effective dates based on related
changes in the National Airspace System or the application of new or revised criteria. All SIAP amendments in this
rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice Airmen (NOTAM) as an emergency
action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances which
created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days.
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). Because of the close and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and
safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable,
and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective
in less than 30 days.


Conclusion


The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the
anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Revisions to the Export Administration Regulations: Equipment Related to the Production of Chemical Weapons and
Warfare Agents, Microorganisms and Toxins; Revision to Australia Group Members 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Export Administration, Commerce

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Export Administration maintains the Commerce Control List (CCL), which appears in the Export Administration
Regulations (EAR). This rule amends the CCL by revising Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) 1B70 and 1C61.
These ECCNs control dual-use items that can be used in the production of chemical and biological weapons (CBW). The
changes made by this rule are intended to conform the list of CBW related items controlled by the United States to the
lists of items agreed to and adopted by countries participating in the Australia Group (AG). 



In addition, this rule revises the list of countries participating in the Australia Group (AG) to include Argentina
and Hungary, since both countries now participate in the Australia Group. This revision is expected to reduce the
number of export license applications that will have to be submitted for items that are being made exempt from the validated
license requirements described in the chemical and biological weapons control provisions of the EAR, thereby reducing
the paperwork burden on the public.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



At the June, 1993, meeting of the Australia Group, the delegates made certain technical revisions in the Australia
Group's chemical equipment list and agreed to its adoption, subject to approval by their governments. The changes
agreed upon at the June, 1993, meeting have been adopted by the member countries and are contained in this interim rule.
Many of these changes refine the scope of the technical parameters describing chemical equipment that is controlled
for export.

This interim rule revises ECCN 1B70, which controls equipment that can be used in the production of chemical weapons
precursors or chemical warfare agents and revises ECCN 1C61, which controls microorganisms and toxins, as follows:




ECCN 1B70 



(1) 1B70.a is revised by raising the control thresholds for reaction vessels, reactors, or agitators, by revising
storage tanks and containers to include receivers, by specifying a heat transfer surface area for heat exchangers
or condensers, by revising distillation columns to include absorption columns, by removing degassing equipment
and adding multi-walled piping (previously controlled under 1B70.c). Finally 1B70.a now controls, not only equipment
having contact surfaces that are made of nickel or alloys having more than 40% nickel by weight, alloys with more than
25% nickel and chromium by weight, glass, or graphite (for heat exchangers) but also equipment having contact surfaces
that are made of the following: Fluoropolymers, glassed-lined (including vitrified or enamelled coating), tantalum
or tantalum alloys, titanium or titanium alloys, zirconium or zirconium alloys, or graphite (for heat exchangers
or condensers, distillation or absorption columns, or multi-walled piping only). 

(2) 1B70.b is not revised and continues to control remotely operated filling equipment with contact surfaces made
of nickel or alloys with more than 40% nickel by weight or alloys with more than 25% nickel and 20% chromium by weight.


(3) 1B70.c is revised to control multi-seal, canned drive, magnetic drive, bellows, or diaphragm pumps, with manufacturer's
specified maximum flow-rate greater than 0.6m

3

/h, or vacuum pumps with the manufacturer's specified maximum flow-rate greater than 5 m

3

/h (under standard temperature (0
  C) and pressure (101.30 kPa) conditions) having contact surfaces that are made of nickel or alloys with more
than 40% nickel by weight, alloys with more than 25% nickel and 20% chromium by weight, fluoropolymers, glass or glass-lined
(including vitrified or enamelled coating), graphite, tantalum or tantalum alloys, titanium or titanium alloys,
zirconium or zirconium alloys, ceramics, or ferrosilicon. 

(4) 1B70.d is revised to control incinerators (previously controlled under 1B70.e) that are designed to destroy
chemical warfare agents controlled on the U.S. Munitions List, or chemical weapons precursors controlled by ECCN
1C60, and that have specially designed waste supply systems, special handling facilities with an average combustion
chamber temperature greater than 1000
  C in which all surfaces in the waste supply system that come into direct contact with the waste products are made
from or lined with any of the following equipment: Nickel or alloys with more than 40% nickel by weight, alloys with
more than 25% nickel and 20% chromium by weight, or ceramics. 

(5) 1B70.e is revised to control toxic gas monitoring systems and dedicated detectors capable of detecting chemical
warfare agents controlled on the U.S. Munitions List or chemical weapons precursors controlled by ECCN 1C60, or detecting
phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine, or chlorine, and their compounds, at a concentration less than 0.3 mg/m3, and capable
of continuous operation, or capable of detecting chemical compounds having a cholinesterase-inhibiting activity.

ECCN 1C61B 




This entry is revised by adding the following microorganisms (including in some cases synonyms to microorganisms
that are currently controlled): 


(1) 

Viruses:

 Hog cholera virus (synonym: Swine fever virus), porcine enterovirus type 9 (synonym: swine vesicular disease virus);



(2) 

Bacteria:

 Xanthomonas albilineas; 


(3) 

Fungi:

 Colletotrichum coffeanum var. virulans, cochliobolus miyabeanus (helminthosporium oryzae), Microcyclus ulei
(synonym: dothidella ulei), puccinia graminis (synonym: Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici), puccinia striiformis
(puccinia gulmarum), Pyricularia grisea/pyricularia oryzae. 


(4) 

Rickettsiae:

 Rickettsia quintana (now known as Rochalimea quintana) 


Exports and reexports of microorganisms and toxins controlled by 1C61 continue to require an individual validated
license to all destinations except Canada. 


Finally, this rule adds Argentina and Hungary to the list of countries exempted from certain validated license requirements
on the basis of their recent membership in the 25-nation Australia Group. 



Savings Clause 




Shipments of items removed from general license authorizations as a result of this regulatory action that were on
dock for loading, on lighter, laden abroad an exporting carrier, or en route aboard carrier to a port of export pursuant
to actual orders for export before April 1, 1994 may be exported under the previous general license provisions up to
and including 
April 15, 1994. Any such items not actually exported before midnight April 15, 1994, require a validated export license
in accordance with this regulation. 



Rulemaking Requirements 




1. This rule was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. 


2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0694-0005,
0694-0010, and 0694-0023. 


3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
assessment under Executive Order 12612. 


4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this
rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under sections 3(a) of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has
to be or will be prepared.

5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 
(5 U.S.C. 553), requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public participation, and a delay in
effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation involves a military or foreign affairs function of the
United States. No other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be
given for this rule. 



However, because of the importance of the issues raised by these regulations, this rule is issued in interim form and
comments will be considered in the development of final regulations. Accordingly, the Department encourages interested
persons who wish to comment to do so at the earliest possible time to permit the fullest consideration of their views.




The period for submission of comments will close April 18, 1994. The Department will consider all comments received
before the close of the comment period in developing final regulations. Comments received after the end of the 
comment period will be considered if possible, but their consideration cannot be assured. The Department will not
accept public comments accompanied by a request that a part or all of 
the material be treated confidentially because of its business 
proprietary nature or for any other reason. The Department will return such comments and materials to the person submitting
the comments and will not consider them in the development of final regulations. All public comments on these regulations
will be a matter of public record and will be available for public 
inspection and copying. In the interest of accuracy and 
completeness, the Department requires comments in written form. 
Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, which will also be a matter of public record and will be available
for 
public review and copying. Communications from agencies of the United States Government or foreign governments
will not be made available for public inspection. 



The public record concerning these regulations will be maintained in the Bureau of Export Administration Freedom
of Information Records Inspection Facility, room 4525, Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue,
NW., Washington, DC 20230. Records in this facility, including written public comments and memoranda summarizing
the substance of oral communications, may be inspected and copied in accordance with regulations published in part
4 of title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Information about the inspection and copying of records at the 
facility may be obtained from Margaret Cornejo, Bureau of Export 
Administration Freedom of Information Officer, at the above address or by calling (202) 482-5653.

Schedules of Controlled Substances; Placement of Aminorex Into Schedule I


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Drug Enforcement Administration, Justice.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule is issued by the Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to place aminorex
into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). This action is based on findings made by the Acting Administrator
of the DEA, after review and evaluation of the relevant data by both DEA and the Assistant Secretary for Health, Department
of Health and Human Services, that aminorex meets the statutory criteria for inclusion in Schedule I of the CSA. Since
this substance has been temporarily scheduled in Schedule I, the regulatory control mechanisms and criminal sanctions
of Schedule I continue to be applicable to the manufacture, distribution, importation and exportation of aminorex.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On September 21, 1992, the Administrator of the DEA published a final rule in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 43399) amending  1308.11(g) of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations to temporarily place aminorex
into Schedule I of the CSA pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811(h). This final rule, which
became effective on the date of publication, was based on a finding by the Administrator that the temporary scheduling
of aminorex was necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. Section 201(h)(2) of the CSA (21 U.S.C.
811(h)(2)) requires that the temporary scheduling of a substance expires at the end of one year from the effective
date of the order. However, if proceedings to schedule a substance pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(a)(1) have been initiated
and are pending, the temporary scheduling of a substance may be extended for up to six months. Under this provision,
the temporary scheduling of aminorex which would have expired on September 21, 1993, was extended to March 21, 1994
by the DEA Administrator (58 FR 44611). 


On August 20, 1993 in a notice of proposed rulemaking published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 44311) and after a review of relevant data, the DEA Administrator proposed to place aminorex into Schedule I
of the CSA pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(a). Prior to that time the DEA Administrator submitted data which DEA gathered
regarding aminorex to the Assistant Secretary for Health, delegate of the Secretary of the Department of Health and
Human Services. In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(b), the DEA Administrator also requested a scientific and medical
evaluation and a scheduling recommendation for aminorex from the Assistance Secretary for Health. 
By letter dated March 4, 1994, the Acting Administrator for the DEA received the scientific and medical evaluation
and scheduling recommendation from the Assistant Secretary for Health. The Assistant Secretary recommended that
aminorex be placed into Schedule I of the CSA based on a scientific and medical evaluation of the available data. 
The notice of proposed rulemaking for aminorex provided the opportunity for interested parties to submit comments,
objections or requests for a hearing regarding the scheduling of aminorex. No comments, objections or requests for
hearings were received regarding the scheduling of aminorez.
Aminorex, also called aminoxaphen, 2-amino-5-phenyl-2-oxaoline, or 4,5-dihydro-5-phenyl-2-oxazolamine,
is a phenethylamine in which the side chain has been cyclized into a substituted oxazoline. In the mid 1960's, it has
marketed as an anorectic agent in Austria, West Germany, and Switzerland but was withdrawn from the European market
when it became apparent that aminorex administration was associated with a high risk of fatal pulmonary hypertension.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has notified the DEA that there are no exemptions or appovals in effect under
section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for aminorex. A search of the scientific and medical literature
revealed no indications of current medical use of aminorex in the United States.
Aminorex is chemically and pharmacologically similar to amphetamine, methamphetamine, and 

cis

-4-methylaminorex, all of which are controlled substances with high abuse potential. Like most central nervous
system (CNS) stimulants, aminorex produces acute locomotor stimulation in rodents. In drug discrimination studies,
aminorex fully substitutes for amphetamine in rats and monkeys and for cocaine in rats. The reinforcing effects of
aminorex were evaluated in rhesus monkeys and baboons. Aminoex is self-administered in both experimental paradigms.
Collectively, these data indicate that aminorex has an abuse liability and dependence profile similar to other potent
Schedule I and II controlled CNS stimulants. 
The earliest confirmed trafficking of aminorex was in Florida in 1989. Since that time, forensic laboratories have
identified aminorex in more than 70 exhibits submitted by law enforcement personnel in Florida, New Jersey, Michigan,
Minnesota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. Clandestine laboratories engaged in the synthesis of aminorex
have been discovered in Florida, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina.

Aminorex is orally active but the most common route of administration is via nasal insufflation. It is usually sold
as amphetamine or methamphetamine. There has been one death in 1990 associated with aminorex abuse in the United States.
Abuse of aminorex produces the same public health risks as those associated with other clandestinely produced stimulants
such as methamphetamine with the additional risk factor of pulmonary hypertension.



Based upon the investigation and review conducted by DEA and upon the scientific and medical evaluation and recommendation
of the Assistant Secretary for Health received in accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(b), the Acting Administrator for
the DEA, pursuant to the provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811 (a) and (b), finds that:



(1) Aminorex has a high potential for abuse;



(2) Aminorex has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States; and,



(3) There is a lack of accepted safety for use of aminorex under medical supervision.



These findings are consistent with the placement of aminorex into Schedule I of the CSA.



All regulations applicable to Schedule I substances continue to be in effect as of March 18, 1994 with respect to aminorex.
This substance has been in Schedule I pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811(h) since September
21, 1992. The current applicable regulations are as follows:



1. 

Registration.

 Any person who manufactures, distributes, delivers, imports or exports aminorex or who engages in research or conducts
instructional activities with respect to aminorex, or who proposes to engage in such activities, must be registered
to conduct such activity in accordance with parts 1301 and 1311 of title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.



2. 

Security

. Aminorex must be manufactured, distributed and stored in accordance with   1301.71-1301.76
title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.



3. 

Labeling and Packaging

. All labels and labeling for commercial containers of aminorex must comply with   1302.03-1302.05,
1302.07 and 1302.08 of title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.



4. 

Quotas

. All persons required to obtain quotas for aminorex shall submit applications pursuant to   1303.12
and 1303.22 of title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.



5. 

Inventory

. Every registrant required to keep records and who possesses any quantity of aminorex shall take an inventory of all
stocks of aminorex on hand pursuant to   1304.11-1304.19 of title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.



6. 

Records

. All registrants required to keep records pursuant to   1304.21-1304.27 of title 21 of the Code
of Federal Regulations shall maintain such records on aminorex.



7. 

Reports

. All registrants required to submit reports pursuant to   1304.34-1304.37 of title 21 of the Code
of Federal Regulations shall do so regarding aminorex.



8. 

Order Forms

. All registrants involved in the distribution of aminorex must comply with   1305.01-1305.16
of title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

9. 

Importation and Exportation. 

All importation and exportation of aminorex shall be in compliance with part 1312 of title 21 of the Code of Federal
Regulations. 

10. 

Criminal Liability. 

Any activity with respect to aminorex not authorized by, or in violation of, the CSA or the Controlled Substances Import
and Export Act shall be unlawful. 

The Acting Administrator of the DEA hereby certifies that the placement of aminorex into Schedule I of the CSA will
have no significant impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act,
5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

 This action involves the control of a substance with no currently accepted medical use or manufacture in the United
States. 

In accordance with the provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811(a), this scheduling action is a formal rulemaking ``on the record
after opportunity for a hearing.'' Such proceedings are conducted pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 556 and 557
and, as such, are exempt from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to Executive Order 12866,
3(d)(1). 

This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in Executive Order 12612, and it has been
determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a
Federal Assessment.

Final Regulations Under Section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code; Discharge of Indebtedness


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulations.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains final regulations under section 
108(e)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which provides 
that the common law stock-for-debt exception to the realization 
of discharge of indebtedness income does not apply where stock 
issued for indebtedness is nominal or token or fails to satisfy a 
proportionality test. The final regulations are necessary to 
provide guidance in applying section 108(e)(8). The regulations 
provide rules for determining whether stock issued for 
indebtedness is nominal or token under section 108(e)(8)(A) and 
rules for applying the proportionality test of section 
108(e)(8)(B).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


This document adds final regulations  1.108-1 under sections 
108(e)(8) (A) and (B) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). 
Sections 108(e)(8) (A) and (B) were added by section 2(a) of the 
Bankruptcy Tax Act of 1980 [Pub. L. 96-589, 94 Stat. 3389] and 
amended by section 11325 of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 
1990 [Pub. L. 101-508, 104 Stat. 1368]. On November 4, 1992, [57 
FR 52601] the Service published these regulations in proposed 
form in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Subsequent to the 
publication of the proposed regulations, section 13226 of the 
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 repealed the stock-for-
debt exception. The amendments made by section 13226 of the 
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 apply to stock 
transferred after December 31, 1994, in satisfaction of any 
indebtedness unless such transfer is in a title 11 or similar 
case (as defined in section 368(a)(3)(A)) that was filed on or 
before December 31, 1993.
The rules of the final regulations are effective with respect 
to any issuance of stock for indebtedness on or before December 
31, 1994, or any issuance of stock for indebtedness in a title 11 
or similar case (as defined in section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code) 
that was filed on or before December 31, 1993, pursuant to: (1) A 
plan confirmed by the court in a title 11 case after May 17, 1994, 
or (2) if there is no title 11 case, an insolvency workout in 
which all issuances of stock for indebtedness occur after May 17, 
1994. No inference is intended concerning the 
interpretation of sections 108(e)(8) (A) and (B) of the Code prior 
to the effective date of the regulations.
These final regulations adopt the proposed regulations with a 
few minor changes in response to comments. As indicated in the 
preamble to the proposed regulations, the Service is also 
publishing Rev. Proc. 94-26, I.R.B 1994-13, containing 
ruling guidelines for the nominal or token determination under 
section 108(e)(8)(A).
One commentator suggested that the final regulations contain 
safe harbors or a list of specified factors for the nominal or 
token determination required by section 108(e)(8)(A) and that a 
revenue procedure be published for determining whether preferred 
stock meets the nominal or token requirement of section 
108(e)(8)(A). Prior proposed regulations under section 108(e)(8) 
included factors that would be considered in determining whether 
stock was nominal or token. Commentators, with respect to those 
regulations, asserted that the list of factors was incomplete. 
The Service and Treasury agree that the determination of whether 
a stock issuance is nominal or token must be based on all the 
facts and circumstances, and that a list of specified factors 
would not fully address the relevant considerations in many 
cases. Rev. Proc. 94-26, I.R.B. 1994-13, provides one safe harbor on 
when common stock is not nominal or token. In the future, the 
Service and Treasury will consider issuing additional ruling 
guidelines as circumstances warrant.
The commentator suggested that the final regulations provide 
that for purposes of computing both the common stock and 
preferred stock proportionality tests the definition of adjusted 
issue price should be modified to include accrued interest that 
the issuer of the debt instrument has not paid. The Service and 
Treasury agree with the recommendation. The final regulations 
clarify that for purposes of the proportionality tests of section 
108(e)(8)(B), the denominator includes any indebtedness that is 
discharged in the title 11 case or workout, including accrued but 
unpaid stated interest.

The commentator suggested that the final regulations provide 
that, for purposes of determining whether certain stock is 
preferred stock for purposes of the regulations, preferred stock 
that is convertible into common stock should be considered 
participating stock if the conversion right represents, in 
substance, a meaningful right to participate in corporate growth. 
This suggestion is adopted in the final regulations.
In addition, the commentator suggested that a conversion right 
permitting a holder to receive common stock should always be 
treated as affording such holder a meaningful right to 
participate in corporate growth. The Service and Treasury have 
rejected this suggestion, because a conversion right does not 
necessarily afford the holder a meaningful right to participate 
in corporate growth. Whether a conversion right affords a 
meaningful right to participate in corporate growth must be 
determined on a case-by-case basis.
The preamble to the proposed regulations requested comments on 
the treatment of contingent liabilities under section 108(e)(8). 
No comments, however, were received on this issue. Although the 
regulations contain no provision for the treatment of contingent 
liabilities, contingent liabilities may not be used to increase 
the denominator inappropriately for purposes of meeting the 
proportionality tests. For example, the mere assertion by a 
claimant that it is owed a specific amount does not by itself 
warrant inclusion of the asserted liability in the denominator 
for purposes of determining the group ratios.


Special Analyses


It has been determined that this treasury decision is not a 
significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 
12866. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply and, 
therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. 
Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the 
notice of proposed rulemaking was submitted to the Chief Counsel 
for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on 
its impact on small business.


Drafting Information


The principal author of these final regulations is 
Annette M. Ahlers, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Corporate), 
Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service. However, 
other personnel from the IRS and the Treasury Department 
participated in their development.

List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 1 



Income taxes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 



Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations 



Accordingly, 26 CFR part 1 is amended as follows: 



PART 1_INCOME TAXES 





Paragraph 1.

 The authority citation for part 1 is amended by 
adding an entry in numerical order to read as follows: 






Authority:

 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * * Section 1.108-1 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 108(e)(8) and 108(e)(10)(B).
* * *







Par. 2.

 Section 1.108-1 is added to read as follows: 



 1.108-1 

Stock-for-debt exception not to apply in de minimis 
cases. 



(a) 

Overview.

 Section 108(e)(8) provides that the common law 
stock-for-debt exception does not apply if stock issued for 
indebtedness is nominal or token or if a proportionality test is 
not met. Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules for the 
nominal or token determination under section 108(e)(8)(A). 
Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for the 
proportionality test under section 108(e)(8)(B). Paragraph (d) 
of this section provides certain general rules and definitions. 
Paragraph (e) of this section provides an effective date. 

(b) 

Issuance of nominal or token stock.

 Under section 
108(e)(8)(A), the common law stock-for-debt exception does not 
apply to indebtedness discharged for stock that is nominal or 
token. All relevant facts and circumstances must be considered 
in making this determination. If common and preferred stock are 
issued for indebtedness, the determination is made separately 
with respect to the common stock and the preferred stock. The 
determination of whether common stock issued for unsecured 
indebtedness is nominal or token is made on an aggregate basis 
with respect to all common stock issued for unsecured 
indebtedness in the title 11 case or insolvency workout. Preferred stock issued for unsecured indebtedness is also
tested 
on an aggregate basis with respect to all preferred stock issued 
for unsecured indebtedness in the title 11 case or insolvency 
workout. 

(c) 

Issuance of a disproportionately small amount of stock 
for unsecured indebtedness

_(1) 

Common stock issued for 
unsecured indebtedness

_(i) 

In general.

 The common law stock-for-debt exception does not apply to an unsecured indebtedness 
discharged for common stock in a title 11 case or insolvency 
workout if the individual common stock ratio does not equal at 
least one-half of the group common stock ratio. 

(ii) 

Individual common stock ratio defined.

 The individual 
common stock ratio is the ratio of the value of the common stock issued for an unsecured indebtedness to the amount of
the 
unsecured indebtedness allocated to that common stock. The 
amount of unsecured indebtedness allocated to the common stock is 
the amount of the indebtedness for which the common stock is 
issued (as defined in paragraph (d)(5) of this section), reduced 
by the amount of other consideration, if any, transferred in 
exchange for the indebtedness, including_ 

(A) The amount of any money; 

(B) The issue price (determined under section 1273 or 1274) 
of any new indebtedness; 

(C) With respect to any preferred stock, the amount of 
indebtedness allocated to the preferred stock under 
paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section; and 


(D) The value of any other property, including any 
disqualified stock. 

(iii) 

Group common stock ratio defined.

 The group common 
stock ratio is the ratio of the aggregate value of all common 
stock issued for unsecured indebtedness in the title 11 case or 
insolvency workout to the aggregate amount of unsecured 
indebtedness allocated to that common stock. The amount of 
unsecured indebtedness allocated to the common stock is the 
aggregate amount of all unsecured indebtedness exchanged for 
stock or cancelled in the title 11 case or insolvency workout, 
reduced by the amount of other consideration, if any, issued for 
that indebtedness, including_ 

(A) The amount of any money; 

(B) The issue price (determined under section 1273 or 1274) 
of any new indebtedness; 

(C) With respect to any preferred stock, the amount of 
indebtedness allocated to the preferred stock under 
paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section; and

(D) The value of any other property, including any 
disqualified stock. 

(iv) 

Example.

 The following example illustrates these 
provisions. 






Example.

 (A) X Corporation has three outstanding debts, Debt 
1, Debt 2, and Debt 3. Debts 1 and 2 are unsecured and each has 
an adjusted issue price of $100,000. Debt 3 is also unsecured, 
and it has an adjusted issue price of $90,000 and accrued but 
unpaid interest of $10,000. In a title 11 case, Debt 1 is 
exchanged for $50,000 cash and $20,000 of common stock, Debt 2 is 
exchanged for $10,000 cash, and Debt 3 is exchanged for $5,000 
common stock. The individual common stock ratio for Debt 1 is 40 percent, which is determined by comparing the value
of the common 
stock issued for the indebtedness ($20,000) to the amount of 
unsecured indebtedness allocated to that stock ($100,000 adjusted 
issue price less $50,000 cash received). The individual common 
stock ratio for Debt 2 is 0 percent because no stock is received 
in exchange for the indebtedness. The individual common stock 
ratio for Debt 3 is 5 percent, which is determined by comparing 
the value of the common stock issued for the indebtedness 
($5,000) to the amount of unsecured indebtedness allocated to 
that stock ($100,000=$90,000 adjusted issue price and $10,000 
of accrued but unpaid interest). 

(B) The group common stock ratio is 10.4 percent, which is 
determined by comparing the value of all of the common stock 
issued for unsecured indebtedness in the title 11 case ($25,000) 
to the amount of unsecured indebtedness allocated to the stock 
($290,000 aggregate adjusted issue price of all indebtedness 
exchanged for stock or cancelled in the title 11 case plus 
$10,000 accrued but unpaid interest less $60,000 cash received). 
Accordingly, section 108(e)(8)(B) is satisfied only with respect 
to the common stock issued for Debt 1. The stock-for-debt 
exception does not apply to Debt 2 or Debt 3.


 


(2) 

Preferred stock issued for unsecured indebtedness

_(i) 


In general.

 The common law stock-for-debt exception does not 
apply to an unsecured indebtedness discharged for preferred stock 
in a title 11 case or insolvency workout if the individual 
preferred stock ratio does not equal at least one-half of the 
group preferred stock ratio. 

(ii) 

Individual preferred stock ratio defined.

 The individual 
preferred stock ratio is the ratio of the value of the preferred 
stock issued for an unsecured indebtedness to the amount of the 
unsecured indebtedness allocated to the preferred stock. The 
amount of the unsecured indebtedness allocated to preferred stock 
is equal to the lesser of the lowest redemption price (if any) or 
lowest liquidation preference (if any) of the preferred stock 
(determined at issuance). However, the allocable indebtedness 
may not be less than the fair market value of the preferred stock 
or greater than the amount of the unsecured indebtedness. 

(iii) 

Group preferred stock ratio defined.

 The group 
preferred stock ratio is the ratio of the aggregate value of all preferred stock issued for unsecured indebtedness
in the title 11 
case or insolvency workout to the aggregate amount of unsecured 
indebtedness allocated to the preferred stock under paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) of this section. 

(d) 

Definitions and special rules.

 For purposes of this 
section: 

(1) 

Common stock.

 Common stock is all stock other than 
disqualified stock and preferred stock. 

(2) 

Disqualified stock.

 Disqualified stock is disqualified 
stock as defined in section 108(e)(10)(B)(ii). 

(3) 

Liquidation preference.

 A liquidation preference exists 
if the stock's right to share in liquidation proceeds is limited 
and preferred.

(4) 

Preferred stock. 

Preferred stock is any stock (other 
than disqualified stock) that has a limited or fixed redemption 
price or liquidation preference and does not upon issuance have a 
right to participate in corporate growth to a meaningful extent. 
Preferred stock that is convertible into common stock is not 
treated as preferred stock if the conversion right represents, in 
substance, a meaningful right to participate in corporate growth. 
Solely for purposes of this paragraph (d)(4), a right to 
participate in corporate growth is not established by the fact 
that the redemption price or liquidation preference exceeds the 
fair market value of the preferred stock. 

(5) 

Amount of indebtedness. 

Generally, the 

amount of 
indebtedness 

is the adjusted issue price of the indebtedness. 
Appropriate adjustments are made for accrued but unpaid stated 
interest. (See the example in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this 
section.) 

(6) 

Undersecured indebtedness_

(i) 

General rule. 

If an 
indebtedness is secured by property with a value less than its 
adjusted issue price, the indebtedness is considered to be two 
separate debts: a secured indebtedness with an adjusted issue 
price equal to the value of the property, and an unsecured 
indebtedness with an adjusted issue price equal to the remainder. 
Absent strong evidence to the contrary, the value of the property 
securing the indebtedness is presumed to be equal to the issue 
price of any new secured indebtedness received for the 
indebtedness plus the value of any other consideration (except 
stock or new unsecured indebtedness) received for the 
indebtedness. A valuation of that property by a court in a title 
11 case is a factor in determining value, but is not controlling. 

(ii) 

Example. 

The following example illustrates these 
provisions: 







Example. 

Corporation X owes an indebtedness with an adjusted 
issue price of $100,000. The indebtedness is secured by certain 
property owned by Corporation X. Corporation X exchanges the 
indebtedness for $10,000 of stock and new secured indebtedness 
with an issue price of $70,000. Under paragraph (d)(6)(i) of 
this section, the indebtedness is bifurcated into a secured 
indebtedness of $70,000 (the issue price of the new secured 
indebtedness received in exchange therefor) and an unsecured 
indebtedness of $30,000 (the remainder of the adjusted issue 
price of the indebtedness). 




(e) 

Effective date. 

This section is effective with respect 
to any issuance of stock for indebtedness on or before December 
31, 1994, or any issuance of stock for indebtedness in a title 11 
or similar case (as defined in section 368(a)(3)(A) of the 
Internal Revenue Code) that was filed on or before December 31, 
1993_

(1) Pursuant to a plan confirmed by the court in a title 11 
case after May 17, 1994; or 

(2) If there is no title 11 case, pursuant to an insolvency 
workout in which all issuances of stock for indebtedness occur after May 17, 1994.

Final Regulations Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; Limitations on Corporate Net Operating
Loss Carryforwards

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulations.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains final regulations under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The final regulations
provide rules regarding the treatment of options in determining whether a loss corporation has an ownership change,
within the meaning of section 382. These rules are necessary to enable a loss corporation to determine whether it is
subject to the annual limitation provided in section 382 on the use of certain losses.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Paperwork Reduction Act 



The collections of information contained in these final regulations have been reviewed and approved by the Office
of Management and Budget in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under control
number 1545-1120. The estimated annual burden per respondent varies from .1 hour to .5 hour, depending on individual
circumstances, with an estimated average of .3 hour. 

Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing the burden should be sent to
the Internal Revenue Service, Attention: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and to the
Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503. 



Background 



This document contains final regulations to be added to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 382
of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The final regulations provide rules regarding the treatment of options in determining
whether a loss corporation has an ownership change within the meaning of that section. 

Proposed regulations on this subject were set forth in a notice of proposed rulemaking published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 5, 1992. See 57 FR 52743. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) received comments on the proposed regulations
and held a public hearing on February 2, 1993. Having considered the comments and the statements made at the hearing,
the IRS and the Treasury Department adopt the proposed regulations as revised by this Treasury decision. 



Explanation of Provisions 



Section 382 of the Code limits the amount of income earned by a corporation after an ownership change that can be offset
by losses incurred prior to the ownership change. In general, an ownership change is an increase of more than 50 percentage
points in stock ownership by 5-percent shareholders over a three-year period. 

Section 382(l)(3)(A) states that, except as provided in regulations, an option to acquire stock is treated as exercised
if the deemed exercise would result in an ownership change. That section also provides that a similar rule applies
in the case of certain interests that are similar to options. These rules are implemented by  1.382-2T(h)(4)
of the temporary regulations. 

The IRS issued the proposed regulations in response to numerous comments regarding the practical difficulties of
applying the option rules in the temporary regulations. The proposed regulations were intended to reduce these practical
difficulties by narrowing the scope of the option rules and simplifying their application.

The proposed regulations treat an option as exercised only if it is issued or transferred for an abusive principal
purpose. The proposed regulations define an abusive principal purpose as a principal purpose of manipulating the
timing of an owner shift to avoid, or ameliorate the impact of, an ownership change by one of two means. These two means
are (1) providing the holder of the option, prior to its exercise, with a substantial portion of the attributes of ownership
of the underlying stock, and (2) facilitating the creation of income to absorb the loss corporation's losses prior
to the exercise of the option. 

The determination of whether an option is issued or transferred for an abusive principal purpose is based on all relevant
facts and circumstances. The proposed regulations include a nonexclusive list of factors that evidence an abusive
principal purpose. One factor, for example, is the receipt by the loss corporation of a capital contribution (in exchange
for stock or otherwise) in connection with the issuance or transfer of an option. 

This Treasury Decision adopts the proposed regulations with several revisions. The following discussion describes
the principal differences between the proposed and final regulations. 



A. The Ownership, Control, and Income Tests 



The final regulations treat an option as exercised if it satisfies either an ownership test, a control test, or an income
test. 

The ownership test is substantially the same as the first element of the abusive principal purpose test of the proposed
regulations. An option satisfies the ownership test if a principal purpose of its issuance, transfer, or structuring
is to avoid or ameliorate the impact of an ownership change by providing the holder of the option, prior to its exercise
or transfer, with a substantial portion of the attributes of ownership of the underlying stock. 

The control test applies to an option held by a major shareholder or used in connection with a major corporate acquisition.
An actual or constructive holder of more than 50 percent of a corporation's stock can generally exercise significant
influence over the corporation prior to the exercise of the option. The rules of the proposed regulations, however,
may not adequately take into account the relationship between a major shareholder or option holder and the loss corporation.
In particular, the attributes of ownership element of the abusive principal purpose test of the proposed regulations
focuses only on the attributes of ownership of the stock covered by an option. It does not take into account an option
holder's influence over a corporation as a result of owning other stock or options. In addition, the proposed regulations
imply (and, as described below, the final regulations explicitly state) that the ability of the holder of an option
with a fixed exercise price to share in future appreciation of the underlying stock is not, by itself, a substantial
portion of the attributes of ownership of the stock. However, the extent to which a fixed price option transfers an
economic interest in the loss corporation to an option holder may be of particular concern when the option is held by
a major shareholder or is used in connection with a major corporate acquisition. 

For the reasons described above, the final regulations adopt a control test that applies to options held by major shareholders
or used in connection with major corporate acquisitions. An option satisfies the control test if (1) a principal purpose
of its issuance, transfer, or structuring is to avoid or ameliorate the impact of an ownership change, and (2) the holder
of the option and any persons related to the option holder have, in the aggregate, a direct and indirect ownership interest
in the loss corporation of more than 50 percent (determined as if the increase in such persons' percentage ownership
interest that would result from the exercise of the option in question and any other options to acquire stock held by
such persons, and any other intended increases in such persons' percentage ownership interest, actually occurred
on the date the option is issued or transferred). 

The control test will subject certain options to inquiry even if it is unlikely that the option holder (or a related
person) will actually acquire (directly or indirectly) more than 50 percent of the stock of the loss corporation.
The control test is not satisfied, however, unless a requisite purpose is present. For example, the control test will
apply to a contingent option to acquire more than 50 percent of the stock of a loss corporation even though the option
holder has no other relationship to the corporation. Nevertheless, in such a situation, the option would not be treated
as exercised if it were not issued with a principal purpose to avoid or ameliorate the impact of an ownership change.


The income test is substantially the same as the second element of the abusive principal purpose test of the proposed
regulations. An option satisfies the income test if a principal purpose of its issuance, transfer, or structuring
is to avoid or ameliorate the impact of an ownership change by facilitating the creation of income prior to its exercise
or transfer. The final regulations clarify that the creation of income concept is a broad one, and refers not only to
the creation of income, but to the creation of any value (e.g., unrealized built-in gains that would ameliorate the
impact of an ownership change), and also to the acceleration of income or the deferral of deductions. 



B. Clarification of Principal Purpose Concept 



The proposed regulations treat an option as exercised if a principal purpose of its issuance or transfer is abusive.
Various forms of this purpose standard are employed throughout the Code and regulations. See, e.g., sections 306(b)(4)
(``one of its principal purposes''); 336(d)(2)(B) (``a principal purpose''); 453(e)(7) (``one of its principal
purposes''); 7872(c) (``1 of the principal purposes''); 1.707-6(b) (``a principal purpose''); 1.1275-2T(g)
(``a principal purpose''); and 1.1504-4(g)(3)(iv)(B) (``a principal purpose''). The IRS and the Treasury
Department considered other formulations of a purpose test in an effort to provide greater clarity on the application
of the test. No appropriate substitute was identified. Accordingly, the final regulations retain the ``a principal
purpose'' standard, but clarify that the relevant inquiry under this standard is not limited to the purposes for which
an option is issued or transferred. The inquiry also focuses on the purposes of structuring the option, either alone
or in combination with other arrangements. An abusive purpose can be a principal purpose even when it is outweighed
by the non-tax reasons (taken together or separately) for the occurrence or structure of a transaction. 



C. Elimination of Abuse Factors and Disclosure Requirement 



As noted above, the proposed regulations provide a nonexclusive list of factors that evidence an abusive principal
purpose. The proposed regulations require a loss corporation to disclose certain information to the IRS if it does
not treat as exercised an option to which one of the specific abuse factors applies. 

The IRS and the Treasury Department have determined that the enforcement benefits that would be achieved by the disclosure
requirement do not justify the administrative burden it would impose on taxpayers (in addition to the general disclosure
requirement of the temporary regulations; see  1.382-2T(a)(2)(ii)). Therefore, the final regulations
do not retain the disclosure requirement of the proposed regulations. The accuracy-related penalty of section 6662
may apply, however, if a substantial underpayment results from a position that lacks substantial authority that
is not adequately disclosed by the taxpayer.

Because the promulgation of specific abuse factors in the proposed regulations related largely to the disclosure
requirement, the final regulations do not retain the specific abuse factors. The elimination of the abuse factors
also addresses commentators' concerns that these factors could have been viewed as creating a presumption that an
option to which a factor applied was issued or transferred for an abusive principal purpose. 

Instead of providing specific abuse factors that are evidence of an abusive principal purpose, the final regulations
merely identify a series of factors that exemplify circumstances that may be probative under the ownership, control,
and income tests. The weight given to these factors depends on the facts and circumstances. The presence or absence
of any of these factors does not create a presumption. 

Among the factors that are relevant in applying all three tests are any business purposes for the issuance, transfer,
or structure of an option, the likelihood of exercise of the option (taking into account, for example, any contingencies
to its exercise), transactions related to the issuance or transfer of the option, and the consequences of treating
the option as exercised. An option is not treated as exercised under any of the tests, however, if a principal purpose
of its issuance, transfer, or structuring is to avoid an ownership change by having it treated as exercised. 

The final regulations also provide examples of additional factors that are taken into account in applying each of
the separate tests. Among the additional factors that are taken into account in applying the ownership test are the
relationship between the exercise price of the option and the value of the underlying stock at the time of the issuance
or transfer of the option, whether the option provides its holder with the right to participate in the management of
the loss corporation or with other rights that ordinarily would be afforded to owners of the underlying stock, and
the existence of reciprocal put and call options. The ability of the holder of an option with a fixed exercise price
to share in future appreciation of the underlying stock is also a relevant factor, but is not sufficient, by itself,
for the option to be treated as exercised. Conversely, the fact that the holder of such an option does not bear the risk
of loss due to declines in value of the underlying stock does not preclude the option from satisfying the ownership
test. 

Among the additional factors that are taken into account in applying the control test are the economic interests in
the loss corporation of the option holder or related persons and the influence of those persons over the management
of the loss corporation. 

Among the additional factors that are taken into account in applying the income test are whether, in connection with
the issuance or transfer of the option, the loss corporation engages in income acceleration transactions or the holder
of the option or a related person purchases stock from, or makes a capital contribution or loan to, the loss corporation
that can reasonably be expected to avoid or ameliorate the impact of an ownership change. Examples of income acceleration
transactions are those outside the ordinary course of the loss corporation's business that accelerate income or
gain into the period prior to the exercise of the option or defer deductions to the period after the exercise of the option.


Commentators on the proposed regulations asked for clarification of the definition of ``capital contribution''
and guidance on the relevance of capital contributions in determining whether an option is treated as exercised.
The final regulations address these comments in two respects. First, as noted above, the final regulations eliminate
the abuse factors of the proposed regulations, including the factor related to capital contributions. Therefore,
although a capital contribution or similar transaction made in connection with the issuance or transfer of an option
is relevant in applying the income test, it cannot be viewed as giving rise to a presumption that the option satisfies
the test. In addition, the final regulations provide further guidance regarding the relevance of a capital contribution
or similar transaction. The final regulations provide that a capital contribution or similar transaction is more
probative toward an option satisfying the income test the larger the amount received by the loss corporation in the
transaction or related transactions. Further, such a transaction is generally not taken into account in applying
the income test if it is made to enable the loss corporation to continue the basic operations of its business for such
purposes as meeting the monthly payroll or funding other operating expenses.

D. Safe Harbors


In response to commentators' requests, the final regulations provide several safe harbors. The safe harbors apply
to (i) typical contracts to acquire stock that are closed on a change date within one year after they are entered into,
(ii) options that are part of security arrangements in typical lending transactions, (iii) certain compensatory
options, (iv) certain options exercisable only upon death, disability, mental incompetency, or retirement, and
(v) certain rights of first refusal. In addition, the final regulations authorize the IRS to promulgate additional
safe harbors by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
An option to which a safe harbor applies is generally not subject to the ownership, control, or income test. A contract
to acquire stock, however, is not exempted from the income test regardless of whether it is described in the safe harbor
applicable to contracts.


E. Treatment of Options Related to Certain Bankruptcy Reorganizations


Section 382(l)(5) provides rules that apply to ownership changes that occur while the loss corporation is under the
jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or similar case. A loss corporation that qualifies for these special rules can
use its pre-change losses, after certain reductions, without regard to the annual limitation provided in section
382.
Section 1.382-9(o) of the regulations provides that the option attribution rules of the temporary regulations
do not apply to certain options that arise as part of a plan of reorganization in a title 11 or similar case until the time
that the plan becomes effective. This rule clarifies the timing of any ownership change that results from the plan.
This Treasury decision amends  1.382-9(o) to provide that neither the option attribution rules of the
temporary regulations nor the new rules of the final regulations apply prior to the time the plan becomes effective.
In general, the new option rules of the final regulations apply to determine whether an ownership change occurs at
the time the plan becomes effective. As explained in Part F, below, however, a loss corporation that is subject to a
title 11 or similar case filed on or before May 17, 1994 may elect to apply the option attribution rules of the temporary
regulations up to the time that the plan of reorganization becomes effective.
Section 1.382-9(e) of the regulations provides rules regarding the treatment of options for purposes of determining
eligibility for the special rules of section 382(l)(5). The preamble of the proposed regulations requested comments
on the desirability of changes to the rules of  1.382-9(e) in light of the option rules of the proposed regulations.
The IRS and the Treasury Department are considering the comments received in response to this request.


F. Effective Date


The option rules of the proposed regulations were proposed to apply on any testing date on or after November 5, 1992.
Many commentators asked that taxpayers be allowed to apply the new option rules retroactively. These commentators
observed that many of the options that were treated as exercised under the temporary regulations (and thus resulted
in ownership changes) would not be treated as exercised under the rules of the proposed regulations. Thus, if the same
options had been issued after the effective date of the proposed regulations, they would not necessarily have caused
an ownership change. The commentators argued that the application of the section 382 limitation should not depend
on the timing of the issuance of certain options.
The IRS and the Treasury Department have declined to allow taxpayers to apply the new option rules retroactively because
the results of retroactive application of these rules would be inappropriate. The results would be largely the same
as if no option attribution rules had been in effect prior to November 5, 1992, except cases in which attribution favored
the taxpayer. A taxpayer could argue that the options in question could not have had an abusive principal purpose because
the temporary regulations treated an option as exercised whenever an ownership change would result. Accordingly,
a taxpayer who had an ownership change under the prior rules could reverse the ownership change by electing to apply
the new rules retroactively_an election the taxpayer would presumably make unless, in retrospect, the application
of the temporary regulations had proved to be favorable.
In light of the foregoing, the final regulations retain the general effective date of the proposed regulations; the
option rules of the final regulations generally apply on testing dates on or after November 5, 1992.

Although the option rules of the final regulations, and not those of the temporary regulations, generally apply on
testing dates on or after November 5, 1992, the final regulations allow a loss corporation to elect to apply the option
rules of the temporary regulations for an extended period. For most loss corporations, the election applies to all
testing dates that occur before May 17, 1994. If, however, the loss corporation is subject to a title 11 or similar case
filed on or before May 17, 1994, the election applies to all testing dates on or before the time the plan of reorganization
becomes effective.
The final regulations provide an exception to the general effective date for the control test. The test generally
does not apply to an option issued on or before March 17, 1994, or issued within 60 days after that date pursuant to a plan
existing before that date. The control test will apply to such an option, however, on testing dates on or after the date
of a transfer of the option that would itself cause the option to satisfy the control test.


Special Analyses


It has been determined that this Treasury Decision is not a significant regulatory action, as defined in Executive
Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b)
of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do
not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section
7805(f) of the Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business
Administration for comment on its impact on small business.


Drafting Information


The principal author of these regulations is Annette M. Ahlers, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Corporate). However,
other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.

Stock_

(i) 

In general. 

[Reserved] 

(ii) 

Convertible stock. 

The term ``stock'' includes any convertible stock. For rules regarding the treatment of certain convertible stock
as an option, see  1.382-4(d)(9)(ii). 

(4) 

Testing date_

(i) 

In general. 

Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, a loss corporation is required to determine whether an
ownership change has occurred immediately after any owner shift, or issuance or transfer (including an issuance
or transfer described in  1.382-4(d)(8)(i) or (ii)) of an option with respect to stock of the loss corporation
that is treated as exercised under  1.382-4(d)(2). Each date on which a loss corporation is required to
make a determination of whether an ownership change has occurred is referred to as a testing date. All computations
of increases in percentage ownership are to be made as of the close of the testing date and any transactions described
in this paragraph (a)(4) that occur on that date are treated as occurring simultaneously at the close of the testing
date. See  1.382-2T(e)(1) for the definition of owner shift. The term 

option, 

as used in this paragraph (a)(4), includes interests that are treated as options under  1.382-4(d)(9).
For rules regarding the determination of whether dates prior to November 5, 1992, are testing dates, see  1.382-2T(a)(2)(i).


(ii) 

Exceptions. 

A loss corporation is not required to determine whether an ownership change has occurred immediately after_

(A) Any transfer of stock, or an option with respect to stock, of the loss corporation in any of the circumstances described
in section 382(l)(3)(B) (death, gift, divorce, 

etc.

); or 

(B) The transfer of an option described in  1.382-4(d)(11)(i) or (ii) (relating to transfers between
persons who are not 5-percent shareholders or between members of certain public groups). 

(b) 

Effective dates_

[Reserved] 

(2) 

Rules provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section_

(i) 

In general. 

Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the rules provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section
apply with respect to any convertible stock. 

(ii) 

Certain convertible preferred stock. 

Convertible stock that, when issued, would be described in section 1504(a)(4) by disregarding subparagraph (D)
thereof and by ignoring the potential participation in corporate growth that the conversion feature may offer is
treated as stock described in that section (and thus is not treated as stock for the purpose of determining whether
an ownership change occurs, but is taken into account for the purpose of determining the value of the loss corporation
immediately before an ownership change; see sections 382(e)(1) and 382(k)(6)(A)) if_

(A) The stock was issued on or after July 20, 1988, and prior to November 5, 1992; or 

(B) The stock was issued prior to July 20, 1988, and the loss corporation makes the election described in Notice 88-67,
1988-1 C.B. 555, (see  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter for availability of Cumulative Bulletins (C.B.)) on or before the earlier of the date prescribed
in the Notice or December 7, 1992. 

(3) 

Rules provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. 

The rules provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section apply to determine whether dates on or after November 5, 1992,
are testing dates. 



Par. 4.

1. The paragraph heading for paragraph (a)(2)(i) is revised. 

2. A sentence is added at the end of paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B). 

3. Paragraph (f)(18)(iii) is amended by adding a sentence at the end of the concluding text.

(vi) 

Rules provided in paragraph (h)(4) of this section. 

The rules provided in paragraph (h)(4) of this section do not apply on any testing date on or after November 5, 1992.
The rule provided in paragraph (h)(4)(viii) of this section applies to the lapse or forfeiture of any option treated
as exercised under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section. If an option is treated as exercised under paragraph (h)(4)(i)
of this section, and the option is actually exercised on a day that is within 120 days after the date on which the option
is treated as exercised, the rule provided in paragraph (h)(4)(vi)(B) of this section applies (even if the actual
exercise of the option occurs on a date on which the rules of paragraph (h)(4) of this section would not otherwise apply).
Thus, in such a case, the loss corporation may elect to treat paragraphs (h)(4)(i) and (vi)(A) of this section as not
applying to the option and take into account only the acquisition of loss corporation stock resulting from the actual
exercise of the option. 

(vii) 

Rules provided in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. 


The rules provided in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section apply to determine whether dates prior to November 5, 1992,
are testing dates. For rules regarding the determination of whether dates on or after November 5, 1992, are testing
dates, see  1.382-2(a)(4).

Par. 5. 

Section 1.382-4 is revised to read as follows: 
 1.382-4 Constructive ownership of stock. 

(a) 

In general. 

[Reserved] 
(b) 

Attribution from corporations, partnerships, estates and trusts.

 [Reserved] 

(c) 

Attribution to corporations, partnerships, estates and trusts.

 [Reserved] 

(d) 

Treatment of options as exercised

_(1) 

General rule. 

Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an option is not treated as exercised under section 382(l)(3)(A).


(2) 

Options treated as exercised

_(i) 

Issuance or transfer. 

For purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs, an option is treated as exercised on the date of its
issuance or transfer if, on that date, the option satisfies_

(A) The ownership test of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, 

(B) The control test of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, or 

(C) The income test of paragraph (d)(5) of this section. 

(ii) 

Subsequent testing dates. 

Except as provided in paragraph (d)(10) of this section, an option that is treated as exercised on the date of its issuance
or transfer is treated as exercised on any subsequent testing date (as defined in  1.382-2(a)(4)) for
purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs. 

(3) 

The ownership test. 

An option satisfies the ownership test if a principal purpose of the issuance, transfer, or structuring of the option
(alone or in combination with other arrangements) is to avoid or ameliorate the impact of an ownership change of the
loss corporation by providing the holder of the option, prior to its exercise or transfer, with a substantial portion
of the attributes of ownership of the underlying stock. 

(4) 

The control test

_ (i) 

In general. 

An option satisfies the control test if_

(A) A principal purpose of the issuance, transfer, or structuring of the option (alone or in combination with other
arrangements) is to avoid or ameliorate the impact of an ownership change of the loss corporation, and 
(B) The holder of the option and any persons related to the option holder have, in the aggregate, a direct and indirect
ownership interest in the loss corporation of more than 50 percent (determined as if the increase in such persons'
percentage ownership interest that would result from the exercise of the option in question and any other options
to acquire stock held by such persons, and any other intended increases in such persons' percentage ownership interest,
actually occurred on the date the option is issued or transferred). 
(ii) 

Operating rules

_(A) 

Person and related persons. 

For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4)_
(

1

) The term 

person 

includes an individual or entity, but not a public group, as defined in  1.382-2T(f)(13), and 
(

2

) Persons are related if they bear a relationship specified in section 267(b) or 707(b) or if they have a formal or informal
understanding among themselves to make a coordinated acquisition of stock, within the meaning of  1.382-3(a)(1)(i).

(B) 

Indirect ownership interest. 

The indirect ownership interest that the holder of the option and any persons related to the holder have in the loss
corporation is determined by applying the constructive ownership rules of  1.382-2T(h), other than
 1.382-2T(h)(2)(i)(A) (which treats stock attributed pursuant to section 318(a)(2) as no longer being
owned by the entity from which it is attributed) and  1.382-2T(h)(4) (which treats options as exercised
in certain circumstances). If, however, the application of such constructive ownership rules without regard to
 1.382-2T(h)(2)(i)(A) would result in the same stock of the loss corporation being owned by two or more
such persons, appropriate adjustments must be made so that such stock is not counted more than once in computing the
aggregate ownership interests of such persons. 
(5) 

The income test. 

An option satisfies the income test if a principal purpose of the issuance, transfer, or structuring of the option
(alone or in combination with other arrangements) is to avoid or ameliorate the impact of an ownership change of the
loss corporation by facilitating the creation of income (including accelerating income or deferring deductions)
or value (including unrealized built-in gains) prior to the exercise or transfer of the option. 
(6) 

Application of the ownership, control, and income tests

_(i) 

In general. 

Whether an option satisfies the ownership, control, or income test depends on all the relevant facts and circumstances.
Among the factors that are relevant in applying all three tests are any business purposes for the issuance, transfer,
or structure of the option, the likelihood of exercise of the option (taking into account, for example, any contingencies
to its exercise), transactions related to the issuance or transfer of the option, and the consequences of treating
the option as exercised.

An option is not treated as exercised under any of the three tests, however, if a principal purpose of its issuance,
transfer, or structuring is to avoid an ownership change by having it treated as exercised. Paragraphs (d)(6) (ii),
(iii) and (iv) of this section describe additional examples of factors that are relevant in applying each test. The
weight given to any factor depends on all the facts and circumstances. The presence or absence of any factor described
in this paragraph (d)(6) does not create a presumption. 
(ii) 

Application of ownership test. 

Among the additional factors that are taken into account in applying the ownership test are the relationship, at the
time of issuance or transfer of the option, between the exercise price of the option and the value of the underlying
stock, whether the option provides its holder or a related person with the right to participate in the management of
the loss corporation or with other rights that ordinarily would be afforded to owners of the underlying stock, and
the existence of reciprocal options (e.g., a call option held by the prospective purchaser and a corresponding put
option held by the prospective seller). The ability of the holder of an option with a fixed exercise price to share in
future appreciation of the underlying stock is also a relevant factor, but is not sufficient, by itself, for the option
to satisfy the ownership test. Conversely, the fact that the holder of such an option does not bear the risk of loss due
to declines in value of the underlying stock does not preclude the option from satisfying the ownership test.

(iii) 

Application of control test. 

Among the additional factors that are taken into account in applying the control test are the economic interests in
the loss corporation of the option holder or related persons and the influence of those persons over the management
of the loss corporation (in either case, through the option or a related arrangement, or through rights in stock).
(iv) 

Application of income test. 

Among the additional factors that are taken into account in applying the income test are whether, in connection with
the issuance or transfer of the option, the loss corporation engages in income acceleration transactions or the holder
of the option or a related person purchases stock (including section 1504(a)(4) stock) from, or makes a capital contribution
or loan to, the loss corporation that can reasonably be expected to avoid or ameliorate the impact of an ownership change.
Examples of income acceleration transactions are those outside the ordinary course of the loss corporation's business
that accelerate income or gain into the period prior to the exercise of the option (or defer deductions to the period
after the exercise of the option). A stock purchase, capital contribution, or loan is more probative toward an option
satisfying the income test the larger the amount received by the loss corporation in the transaction or related transactions.
A stock purchase, capital contribution, or loan is generally not taken into account in applying the income test if
it is made to enable the loss corporation to continue basic operations of its business (

e.g., 

to meet the monthly payroll or fund other operating expenses of the loss corporation).
(7) 

Safe harbors. 

Except as provided in paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section, an option described in this paragraph (d)(7) is not treated
as exercised pursuant to the ownership, control, or income test. The failure of an option to be described in this paragraph
(d)(7) does not affect the determination of whether the option satisfies the ownership, income, or control test.
The following options are described in this paragraph (d)(7):
(i) 

Contracts to acquire stock. 

A stock purchase agreement or a similar arrangement, the terms of which are commercially reasonable, in which the
parties' obligations to complete the transaction are subject only to reasonable closing conditions, and which is
closed on a change date within one year after it is entered into. An option is not exempt from the income test of paragraph
(d)(5) of this section solely by reason of its description in this paragraph (d)(7)(i).
(ii) 

Escrow, pledge, or other security agreements. 

An option that is part of a security arrangement in a typical lending transaction (including a purchase money loan),
if the arrangement is subject to customary commercial conditions. For this purpose, a security arrangement includes,
for example, an agreement for holding stock in escrow or under a pledge or other security agreement, or an option to
acquire stock contingent upon a default under a loan.
(iii) 

Compensatory options. 

An option to acquire stock in a corporation with customary terms and conditions provided to an employee, director,
or independent contractor in connection with the performance of services for the corporation or a related person
(and that is not excessive by reference to the services performed) and which_
(A) Is nontransferable within the meaning of  1.83-3(d); and
(B) Does not have a readily ascertainable fair market value as defined in  1.83-7(b) on the date the option
is issued.
(iv) 

Options exercisable only upon death, disability, mental incompetency, or retirement. 

An option entered into between stockholders of a corporation (or a stockholder and the corporation) with respect
to stock of either stockholder, that is exercisable only upon the death, disability, mental incompetency of the stockholder,
or, in the case of stock acquired in connection with the performance of services for the corporation or a related person
(and that is not excessive by reference to the services performed), the stockholder's retirement.
(v) 

Rights of first refusal. 

A bona fide right of first refusal with customary terms, entered into between stockholders of a corporation (or between
the corporation and a stockholder), and regarding the corporation's stock.

Options designated in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. 

An option designated by the Internal Revenue Service in the Internal Revenue Bulletin as being exempt from one or more
of the ownership, control, or income tests. See  601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter (relating to the Internal
Revenue Bulletin).
(8) 

Additional rules_

(i) 

Contracts to acquire stock. 

For purposes of this paragraph (d), a contract is considered to be issued or transferred on the date it is entered into
or assigned, respectively.
(ii) 

Indirect transfer of an option. 

If an entity is formed or availed of for a principal purpose of facilitating an indirect transfer of an option by issuing
or transferring interests in the entity, an issuance or transfer of an interest in the entity will be treated as a transfer
of the option for purposes of applying the ownership, control, and income tests of paragraphs (d) (3) through (5) of
this section.
(iii) 

Options related to interests in non-corporate entities. 

The rules of this paragraph (d) apply, with appropriate adjustments, to options to acquire or transfer interests
in non-corporate entities.
(iv) 

Puts. 

In applying the rules of this section to puts, appropriate adjustments must be made to take into account that the put
provides its holder with a right to transfer, instead of acquire, stock.
(9) 

Definition of option_

(i) 

In general. 

Any contingent purchase, warrant, convertible debt, put, stock subject to a risk of forfeiture, contract to acquire
stock, or similar interest is treated as an option for purposes of this paragraph (d), regardless of whether it is contingent
or otherwise not currently exercisable.

(ii) 

Convertible stock. 

Convertible stock is treated as an option for purposes of this paragraph (d) (in addition to being treated as stock
under  1.382-2(a)(3)(ii)) only if the terms of the conversion feature permit or require consideration
other than the stock being converted.
(iii) 

Series of options. 

For purposes of this paragraph (d), an option to acquire an option with respect to the stock of the loss corporation,
and each one of a series of such options, is treated as an option to acquire such stock.
(iv) 

General principles of tax law. 

This paragraph (d) does not affect the determination under general principles of tax law (such as substance over form)
of whether an instrument is an option or stock.
(10) 

Subsequent treatment of options treated as exercised on a change date_

(i) 

In general. 

The following rules apply to options that are treated as exercised under paragraph (d)(2) of this section on a change
date:
(A) The option is not treated as exercised under paragraph (d)(2) of this section on any testing date after the change
date and prior to a transfer of the option that would itself (

i.e., 

without regard to the purposes for the issuance or any prior transfers of the option) cause the option to satisfy the
ownership test of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the control test of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, or the income
test of paragraph (d)(5) of this section; and
(B) The exercise of the option, if by the person who owned the option immediately after the ownership change (or by a
transferee of the option who acquired the option, directly or indirectly, from that person in one or more transfers
described in paragraph (d)(11) of this section), does not contribute to another ownership change on any testing date
on or after the date of exercise.
(ii) 

Alternative look-back rule for options exercised within 3 years after change date. 

If a loss corporation, on its return, as originally filed, for a taxable year that includes a change date, properly
treats an option as exercised under paragraph (d)(2) of this section on the change date, and the option is actually
exercised within three years after the change date, the loss corporation may treat the rules of paragraph (d)(10)(i)
of this section as inapplicable to the option and instead treat the option as having been exercised on the change date
for the purpose of determining whether an ownership change occurs on any and all testing dates after the change date
(filing such amended returns as may be necessary for taxable years ending after the change date and before the date
of exercise of the option). A transfer after the change date of an option to which this paragraph (d)(10)(ii) applies
is treated as a transfer of the stock subject to the option. The exercise of an option to which this paragraph (d)(10)(ii)
applies is not taken into account for the purpose of determining whether an ownership change occurs on or after the
date of exercise.

Transfers not subject to deemed exercise. 

Paragraph (d)(2) of this section does not apply to the transfer of an option (including a transfer described in paragraph
(d)(8)(i) or (ii) of this section), if_

(i) Neither the transferor nor the transferee is a 5-percent shareholder and neither person would be a 5-percent shareholder
if all options held by that person to acquire stock were treated as exercised;

(ii) The transfer is between members of separate public groups resulting from the application of the segregation
rules of  1.382-2T(j)(2) and (3)(iii); or

becomes effective.

(B) 

Additional consequences of election. 

If a loss corporation makes an election under this paragraph (h)(2)(vi)_

(

1

) In determining whether any convertible preferred stock issued by the loss corporation during the period that the
election is in effect is treated as stock or as an option, the convertible preferred stock is treated as if it were issued

(

2

) The special effective date for the control test provided in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section does not apply to
any option with respect to stock of the loss corporation.

(C) 

Time and manner of making the election. 

The election described in paragraph (h)(2)(vi)(A) of this section is made by attaching a statement to the loss corporation's
income tax return for the first taxable year ending after November 4, 1992, in which a testing date (within the meaning
of  1.382-2T(a)(2)(i)) occurs, or if such return is filed on or before May 17, 1994, with its first return
filed after May 17, 1994. However, a loss corporation that is under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or similar
case filed on or before May 17, 1994, may make the election described in paragraph (h)(2)(vi)(A) by attaching a statement
to its tax return for its first taxable year ending after that date. The statement must say ``THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER
 1.382-4(h)(2)(vi) TO APPLY  1.382-2T(h)(4) ON OR AFTER NOVEMBER 5, 1992.'' Any amended
returns required by paragraph (h)(2)(vi)(D) of this section must accompany the return with which the election is
made. An election under paragraph (h)(2)(vi)(A) of this section is irrevocable.

(D) 

Amended returns. 

If an election under this paragraph (h)(2)(vi) affects the amount of taxable income or loss for a prior taxable year,
the loss corporation (or the common parent of any consolidated group of which the loss corporation was a member for
the year) must file an amended return for the year that reflects the effect of the election.

(3) 

Special rule for options subject to attribution under  1.382-2T(h)(4).

 Section  1.382-2T(h)(4)(i) does not apply to any option designated by the Internal Revenue Service in
the Internal Revenue Bulletin as being excepted from the operation of  1.382-2T(h)(4)(i).



Par. 6. 

Section 1.382-9(o)(1) is revised to read as follows:  1.382-9. Special rules under section 382

exercised) applies to the following options to acquire stock of a loss corporation reorganized pursuant to a plan
of reorganization that is confirmed in a title 11 or similar case (within the meaning of section 368(a)(3)(A)) but
only until the time the plan becomes effective_

(i) Any option created by the solicitation or receipt of acceptances to the plan;

(ii) The option created by the confirmation of the plan; and

Limitation on Net Operating Loss Carryforwards and Certain 
Built-In Losses Following Ownership Change; Special Rule for 
Value of a Loss Corporation Under the Jurisdiction of a Court in 
a Title 11 Case 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service, Treasury. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final and temporary regulations.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains final regulations that provide 
guidance on determining the value of a loss corporation following 
an ownership change to which section 382(l)(6) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 applies. Under sections 382 and 383, the 
value of the loss corporation, together with certain other 
factors, determines the rate at which certain pre-change tax 
attributes may be used to offset post-change income and tax 
liability. These rules are needed to provide guidance to 
taxpayers concerning compliance with sections 382 and 383. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Paperwork Reduction Act 



The collections of information contained in these final 
regulations have been reviewed and approved by the Office of 
Management and Budget in accordance with the requirements of the 
Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under control number 
1545-1324. The estimated annual burden per respondent with 
respect to the  1.382-9(i) election varies from 5 to 30 minutes, 
depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average 
of 15 minutes. The estimated annual burden per respondent with 
respect to the  1.382-9(p)(2) election varies from 5 to 30 
minutes, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated 
average of 15 minutes. 

These estimates are approximations of the average time 
expected to be necessary for a collection of information. They 
are based on such information as is available to the Internal 
Revenue Service. Individual respondents or recordkeepers may 
require more or less time, depending on their particular 
circumstances. 

Comments concerning the accuracy of these burden estimates 
and suggestions for reducing these burdens should be directed to 
the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance 
Officer, T:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office of 
Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of 
the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 
Washington, DC 20503. 

The collections of information in this regulation are in 
  1.382-9(i) and 1.382-9(p)(2). This information serves as 
evidence of an election to apply section 382(l)(6) of the 
Internal Revenue Code (Code) in lieu of section 382(l)(5) and an 
election to apply retroactively the provisions of the final 
regulations. The information is required by the Internal Revenue 
Service to assure that a loss corporation uses the proper amount 
of carryover attributes following specified types of ownership 
changes. 



Background 



This document contains final regulations to be added to 26 
CFR part 1 under section 382 of the Code. The Service published 
proposed amendments to the regulations under section 382 in the 


Federal Register

 on August 6, 1992 (57 FR 34736). See also 1992- 
2 C.B. 616. The rules are effective with respect to any 
ownership change occurring on or after March 17, 1994. However, a loss corporation may elect to apply the rules in the
final regulations in their 
entirety to any ownership change occurring before March 17, 1994, including ownership changes to which section 382(l)(5)
applied. Written 
comments were received, but no public hearing was held as none 
was requested. 



Explanation of Provisions 



Section 382(l)(6) of the Code provides a special valuation 
rule for certain ownership changes that result from a title 11 or 
similar case to which section 382(l)(5) does not apply. Under 
this special valuation rule, the value of the loss corporation 
reflects any increase in value resulting from any surrender or 
cancellation of creditors' claims in the bankruptcy transaction. The proposed regulations provide rules regarding
the application of this special valuation rule and the coordination of that rule with other statutory rules related
to the value of a loss corporation.

The proposed regulations, with a few changes to respond to 
comments, are adopted as final regulations. The changes, as well 
as certain comments and suggestions that were not adopted in the 
final regulations, are discussed below. 

The proposed regulations provide that the value of a loss 
corporation under the special valuation rule of section 382(l)(6) 
of the Code is the lesser of the value of its stock immediately 
after the ownership change, or the value of its assets 
(determined without regard to liabilities) immediately before the 
ownership change. The proposed regulations further provide that 
the value of the loss corporation's pre-change assets is reduced 
by the amount of any capital contribution to which section 
382(l)(1) applies. The proposed regulations could be read to 
require such a reduction even in cases in which the value of the 
pre-change assets would not reflect the value of the contributed 
assets, as would be the case, for example, when the contribution 
is concurrent with the ownership change. To avoid this 
possibility, the final regulations provide that the value of the 
pre-change assets of the loss corporation is determined without 
regard to any capital contribution to which section 382(l)(1) 
applies. 


Section 382(l)(5)(H) of the Code allows a loss corporation 
to elect not to have the provisions of section 382(l)(5) apply. 
The proposed regulations provide that this election must be made 
by the due date (including extensions) of the loss corporation's 
return for the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs. 
The proposed regulations also provide that this election is 
irrevocable. One commenter suggested that the final regulations 
allow a taxpayer to file an election after the prescribed due 
date upon a showing of reasonable cause. The commenter also 
suggested that taxpayers be allowed to revoke an election. 

The Treasury and the Service believe that the general 
standards and procedures under  301.9100-1 of the Procedure and 
Administrative Regulations provide adequate relief for taxpayers 
seeking to make a retroactive election under section 382(l)(5)(H) 
of the Code for an ownership change occurring on or after March 17, 1994. A specific regulatory provision allowing
an election after the 
prescribed due date or allowing revocation of an election would 
inappropriately allow the loss corporation the benefit of 
hindsight to determine the relative advantages of sections 
382(l)(5) and 382(l)(6). Therefore, the final regulations retain 
the rules of the proposed regulations that the election is 
irrevocable and must be made on the return of the loss 
corporation for the taxable year including or ending with the 
change date. Because of uncertainties that existed with respect 
to the application of sections 382(l)(5) and 382(l)(6) before 
issuance of final regulations, transitional rules are provided in 
  1.382-9(d)(6)(ii) and (p)(2) that allow taxpayers to 
retroactively file or revoke a prior section 382(l)(5)(H) 
election for an ownership change occurring before March 17, 1994.

A commenter suggested that the final regulations clarify 
that a loss corporation need not use liquidation value in 
determining the value of its gross assets, and that the 
corporation may take into account the value of any intangible 
assets, such as goodwill and going concern value. The Treasury 
and the Service have determined that the proposed clarification 
is unnecessary. The valuation rule refers to ``the value of the 
loss corporation's pre-change assets,'' without limitation to 
either liquidation value or tangible assets. Therefore, if a 
loss corporation is able to establish the existence and value of 
any intangible assets, that value may be taken into account. 

The proposed regulations provide that the amount received by 
a loss corporation for the issuance of debt is treated as a 
capital contribution that must be excluded from the value of its 
pre-change assets if the issuance of the debt is part of a plan a 
principal purpose of which is to increase the value of the loss 
corporation under the rules of the proposed regulations. A 
commenter questioned the appropriateness of treating an issuance 
of debt as a capital contribution. The commenter also suggested 
that, if the proposed rule is retained, it should be subject to 
an exception for cases in which the loss corporation uses the 
proceeds of the debt to fund operating expenses. 

The final regulations retain the rule of the proposed 
regulations regarding the treatment of certain debt issuances as 
capital contributions. The Treasury and the Service believe that 
this rule effectuates the principles of section 382(l)(1) of the 
Code. The Treasury and the Service will consider possible 
exceptions to this rule in the context of providing general 
guidance under section 382(l)(1).

Section 382(l)(5)(D) of the Code provides that, if a second ownership change occurs within two years after an ownership
change to which section 382(l)(5) applies, the section 382 limitation with respect to the second ownership change
is zero. A commenter suggested that the final regulations provide that the zero limitation applies only to losses
incurred prior to the first ownership change. The final regulations do not provide such a rule because it would be inconsistent
with the language of section 382(l)(5)(D). 

The proposed regulations provide that the value of the stock of a loss corporation does not include stock issued with
a principal purpose of increasing the section 382 limitation without subjecting the investment to the entrepreneurial
risks of corporate business operations. A commenter requested that the final regulations provide further guidance
regarding the stock subject to this rule. The Treasury and the Service believe that additional guidance is not necessary
because the test sufficiently limits the scope of this anti-abuse provision. 

The proposed regulations provide that the value of any stock issued in connection with the ownership change cannot
exceed the value of the property received by the loss corporation in consideration for the stock. A commenter questioned
the appropriateness of this limitation. The final regulations, however, retain the limitation to preclude any claims
that the stock is worth more than what was paid for it. The limitation avoids the valuation disputes that would result
from these claims. Further, the limitation on losses provided by section 382(a) of the Code is intended to measure
the earnings power of the corporation. When a loss corporation issues stock, it increases its earnings power by the
value of the property it receives, regardless of whether that value represents a fair price for the stock. 



Special Analyses 



It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive
Order 12866. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter
5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and therefore, a Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking
for the regulations was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment
on their impact on small business. 



Drafting Information 



The principal author of these regulations is Robert Liquerman, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (Corporate),
Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service. However, personnel from other offices of the Internal Revenue
Service and Treasury Department participated in developing the regulations, in matters of both substance and style.

 1.382-9 

Special rules under section 382 for corporations under 
the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or similar case. 


* * * * * 


(f) through (h) [Reserved] 
(i) 

Election not to apply section 382(l)(5).

 Under section 
382(l)(5)(H), a loss corporation may elect not to have the 
provisions of section 382(l)(5) apply to an ownership change in a 
title 11 or similar case. This election is irrevocable and must 
be made by the due date (including any extensions of time) of the 
loss corporation's tax return for the taxable year which includes 
the change date. The election is to be made by attaching the 
following statement to the tax return of the loss corporation for 
that taxable year: ``This is an Election Under  1.382-9(i) not to 
Apply the Provisions of Section 382(l)(5) to the Ownership Change 
Occurring Pursuant to a Plan of Reorganization Confirmed by the 
Court on [Insert Confirmation Date].'' 
(j) 

Value of the loss corporation in an ownership change to 
which section 382(l)(6) applies.

 Section 382(l)(6) applies to 
any ownership change occurring pursuant to a plan of 
reorganization in a title 11 or similar case to which section 
382(l)(5) does not apply. In such case, the value of the loss 
corporation under section 382(e) is equal to the lesser of_
(1) The value of the stock of the loss corporation 
immediately after the ownership change (determined under the 
rules of paragraph (k) of this section); or 
(2) The value of the loss corporation's pre-change assets 
(determined under the rules of paragraph (l) of this section). 
(k) 

Rules for determining the value of the stock of the loss 
corporation

_(1) 

Certain ownership interests treated as stock.

 
For purposes of paragraph (j)(1) of this section_
(i) Stock includes stock described in section 1504(a)(4) and 
any stock that is not treated as stock under 
 1.382-2T(f)(18)(ii) for purposes of determining whether a loss 
corporation has an ownership change; and 
(ii) Stock does not include an ownership interest that is 
treated as stock under  1.382-2T(f)(18)(iii) for purposes of 
determining whether a loss corporation has an ownership change. 
(2) 

Coordination with section 382(e)(2).

 In the case of a 
redemption or other corporate contraction occurring after and in 
connection with the ownership change, the value of the stock of 
the loss corporation under paragraph (j)(1) of this section is 
reduced under section 382(e)(2). 
(3) 

Coordination with section 382(e)(3).

 If the loss 
corporation is a foreign corporation, in determining the value of 
the stock under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, only items 
treated as connected with the conduct of a trade or business in 
the United States are taken into account.

(4) 

Coordination with section 382(l)(1). 

Section 382(l)(1) 
does not apply in determining the value of the stock of the loss 
corporation under paragraph (j)(1) of this section. 

(5) 

Coordination with section 382(l)(4). 

If, immediately 
after the ownership change, the loss corporation has substantial 
nonbusiness assets (as determined under section 382(l)(4)(B) 
taking into account only those assets the loss corporation held 
immediately before the ownership change), the value of the stock 
of the loss corporation under paragraph (j)(1) of this section is 
reduced by the excess of the value of such nonbusiness assets 
over those assets' share of the loss corporation's indebtedness 
(determined under section 382(l)(4)(D) taking into account the 
loss corporation's assets and liabilities immediately after the 
ownership change). 

(6) 

Special rule for stock not subject to the risk of 
corporate business operations

_(i) 

In general. 

The value of the 
stock of the loss corporation under paragraph (j)(1) of this 
section is reduced by the value of stock that is issued as part 
of a plan one of the principal purposes of which is to increase 
the section 382 limitation without subjecting the investment to 
the entrepreneurial risks of corporate business operations. 

(ii) 

Coordination of special rule and other rules affecting 
value. 

If the value of the loss corporation is modified under 
another rule affecting value, appropriate adjustments are to be 
made so that such modification is not duplicated under this 
paragraph (k)(6). 

(7) 

Limitation on value of stock. 

For purposes of paragraph 
(j)(1) of this section, the value of stock of the loss 
corporation issued in connection with the ownership change cannot 
exceed the cash and the value of any property (including 
indebtedness of the loss corporation) received by the loss 
corporation in consideration for the issuance of that stock. 

(l) 

Rules for determining the value of the loss 
corporation's pre-change assets

_(1) 

In general. 

Except as 
otherwise provided in this paragraph (l), the value of the loss 
corporation's pre-change assets is the value of its assets 
(determined without regard to liabilities) immediately before the 
ownership change. 

(2) 

Coordination with section 382(e)(2). 

Section 382(e)(2) 
does not apply in determining the value of the pre-change assets 
of the loss corporation under paragraph (j)(2) of this section. 

(3) 

Coordination with section 382(e)(3). 

If the loss 
corporation is a foreign corporation, in determining the value of 
the pre-change assets under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, 
only assets treated as connected with the conduct of a trade or 
business in the United States are taken into account. 

(4) 

Coordination with section 382(l)(1). 

For purposes of 
paragraph (j)(2) of this section, the value of the pre-change 
assets of the loss corporation is determined without regard to 
the amount of any capital contribution to which section 382(l)(1) 
applies. For purposes of applying this paragraph (l)(4), the 
receipt of cash or property by the loss corporation in exchange 
for the issuance of indebtedness is considered a capital 
contribution if it is part of a plan one of the principal 
purposes of which is to increase the value of the loss 
corporation under paragraph (j) of this section. 

(5) 

Coordination with section 382(l)(4). 

If, immediately 
after the ownership change, the loss corporation has substantial 
nonbusiness assets (as determined under section 382(l)(4)(B) 
taking into account only those assets the loss corporation held 
immediately before the ownership change), the value of the loss 
corporation's pre-change assets is reduced by the value of the 
nonbusiness assets. 

(m) * * * 

(2) 

Under section 382(l)(6). 

If section 382(l)(6) applies 
to an ownership change of a loss corporation, section 382(c) and 
the regulations thereunder apply to the ownership change. 

(n) 

Ownership change in a title 11 or similar case succeeded 
by another ownership change within two years

_(1) 

Section 
382(l)(5) applies to the first ownership change. 

If section 
382(l)(5) applies to an ownership change and, within the two-year 
period immediately following such ownership change, a second 
ownership change occurs, section 382(l)(5) cannot apply to the 
second ownership change and the section 382(a) limitation with 
respect to the second ownership change is zero. 

(2) 

Section 382(l)(6) applies to the first ownership change. 


If the value of a loss corporation in an ownership change was 
determined under section 382(l)(6) and a second ownership change 
occurs within the two-year period immediately following the first 
ownership change, the value of the loss corporation under section 
382(e) with respect to the second ownership change is not reduced 
under section 382(l)(1) for any increase in value of the loss 
corporation previously taken into account under section 382(l)(6) 
with respect to the first ownership change.

(p) 

Effective date for rules relating to section 
382(l)(6)

_(1) 

In general. 

Paragraphs (i), (j), (k), (l), 
(m)(2), and (n)(2) of this section apply to any ownership change 
occurring on or after March 17, 1994.

(2) 

Ownership change to which section 382(l)(6) applies 
occurring before March 17, 1994.

 In the case of an ownership change occurring 
before March 17, 1994, the loss corporation may elect to apply the rules of 
paragraphs (j), (k), (l), (m)(2), and (n)(2) of  1.382-9 in their 
entirety. The election must be made by the later of the due date 
(including any extensions of time) of the loss corporation's tax 
return for the taxable year which includes the change date or the 
date that the loss corporation files its first tax return after 
May 16, 1994. The election is made by 
attaching the following statement to the return: ``This is an 
Election to Apply   1.382-9 (j), (k), (l), (m)(2), and (n)(2) of 
the Income Tax Regulations to the Ownership Change Occurring 
Pursuant to a Plan of Reorganization Confirmed by the Court on 
[Insert Confirmation Date].'' In connection with making this 
election, on the same return the loss corporation may also elect 
not to apply section 382(l)(5) to the ownership change under 
paragraph (i) of this section (if the loss corporation has not 
already done so pursuant to  301.9100-7T(a) of this chapter). 
If, under the applicable statute of limitations, the loss 
corporation may file amended returns for the year of the 
ownership change and all subsequent years (an open year), an 
electing loss corporation must file an amended return for each 
prior affected year to reflect the elections. If, under the 
applicable statute of limitations, the loss corporation may not 
file an amended return for the year of the ownership change or 
any subsequent year (a closed year), an electing loss corporation 
must file an amended return for each affected open year to 
reflect the elections and the section 382 limitation resulting 
from the ownership change must be appropriately adjusted for the 
earliest open year (or years) to reflect the difference between 
the amount of pre-change losses actually used in closed years and 
the amount of pre-change losses that would have been used in such 
years applying the rules of paragraphs (j), (k), (l), (m)(2), 
(n)(2) of this section to the ownership change.

Limitations on Corporate Net Operating Loss Carryforwards



<AGENCY>

Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final regulations.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document contains final income tax regulations relating to the determination of whether stock of a loss corporation
is owned as a result of being a qualified creditor for purposes of section 382(l)(5)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended. These rules will help a loss corporation determine whether it is eligible for the special rules
of section 382(l)(5).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Paperwork Reduction Act


The collections of information contained in these final regulations have been reviewed and approved by the Office
of Management and Budget in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under control number
1545-1275. The estimated annual burden per respondent with respect to the   1.382-9(d)(2)(iii)
and (d)(4)(iv) statements varies from 10 minutes to 1 hour, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated
average of 15 minutes. The estimated annual burden per respondent with respect to the  1.382-9(d)(6)(ii)
elections varies from 10 minutes to 2 hours, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of
1 hour.

These estimates are approximations of the average time expected to be necessary for a collection of information.
They are based on such information as is available to the Internal Revenue Service. Individual respondents or recordkeepers
may require more or less time, depending on their particular circumstances.

Comments concerning the accuracy of these burden estimates and suggestions for reducing these burdens should be
directed to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and
to the Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503.

This document also amends the table of control numbers in  602.101 by restoring a control number (1545-1281)
for  1.382-3 that was removed by T.D. 8490 (58 FR 51571 (1993)).


Background



This document contains final regulations to be added to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 382
of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The final regulations provide rules relating to the determination of whether
stock of a loss corporation is owned as a result of being a qualified creditor for purposes of section 382(l)(5)(E)
of the Code.
Proposed regulations on this subject were set forth in a notice of proposed rulemaking published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 10, 1993. See 58 FR 27498 (1993). (That document also withdrew earlier proposed regulations on this subject
that had been published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 23, 1991 (56 FR 47921 (1991))). The IRS received comments on the proposed regulations and held a public
hearing on July 16, 1993. Having considered the comments and the statements made at the hearing, the IRS and the Treasury
Department adopt the proposed regulations as revised by this Treasury decision.



Explanation of Provisions


Section 382(l)(5) of the Code provides special rules for ownership changes resulting from bankruptcy proceedings.
A loss corporation that qualifies for the special rules can use its loss carryforwards, after certain reductions,
against its post-change income without limitation by section 382(a). A loss corporation qualifies only if its pre-change
shareholders and creditors own at least 50 percent of its stock after the ownership change. Section 382(l)(5)(E)
provides that stock issued in exchange for indebtedness counts toward the 50 percent threshold of section 382(l)(5)
only if the indebtedness (1) was held by the creditor at least 18 months before the bankruptcy filing, or (2) arose in
the ordinary course of the trade or business of the loss corporation and was held at all times by the same beneficial
owner. The proposed regulations published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 10, 1993, contain rules for determining if stock received by creditors counts toward the 50 percent threshold
of section 382(l)(5).

The final regulations adopt the proposed regulations with several changes to respond to comments. The changes, as
well as certain comments that were not adopted in the final regulations, are discussed below.



A. Treatment of Certain Indebtedness As Continuously Owned by the Same Owner



The proposed regulations include a de minimis rule that allows a loss corporation to treat indebtedness as always
having been owned by the beneficial owner of the indebtedness immediately before the ownership change if the beneficial
owner is not, immediately after the ownership change, either a 5-percent shareholder or an entity through which a
5-percent shareholder owns an indirect ownership interest in the loss corporation (a 

5-percent entity). 

The 

de minimis 

rule does not apply to indebtedness owned by a person whose participation in formulating a plan of reorganization
makes evident to the loss corporation that the person has not owned the indebtedness for the requisite period. This
exception applies regardless of whether the participant exchanges the indebtedness for stock pursuant to the plan
or transfers the indebtedness to other persons prior to the effective date of the plan.

One commentator recommended that the exception to the de minimis rule be deleted because it is unclear and unlikely
to work well in practice. The commentator suggested that the speculative investors who are the target of the rule are
likely to sell their debt prior to the effective date of the plan. Unless the loss corporation could identify the purchasers
of the debt, it would have difficulty applying the exception.

The final regulations retain the exception to the de minimis rule. The loss corporation should not be able to disregard
the fact that a creditor has not held its debt for the period required by section 382(l)(5)(E) if that fact is made evident
by the creditor's participation in the formulation of the plan of reorganization. The need for the requirement that
the loss corporation take these facts into account outweighs any potential difficulty the loss corporation may have
in applying the requirement if the creditor that participates in formulating the plan transfers its debt prior to
the effective date of the plan.



B. Tacking Rules



The proposed regulations allow the tacking of the ownership periods of a transferee and transferor of debt in certain
circumstances for the purpose of determining whether the debt meets the continuous ownership requirement of section
382(l)(5)(E).

The proposed regulations include a rule which permits tacking for a transfer pursuant to a subrogation in which a bank
or insurance company acquires a claim against a loss corporation by reason of a payment to the claimant under a letter
of credit or insurance policy. Commentators recommended that the rule be expanded to cover transfers pursuant to
security arrangements regardless of whether the transferee is a bank or the arrangement is evidenced by a letter of
credit. The final regulations adopt this recommendation.

Commentators also recommended that a tacking rule be added to cover factoring transactions. Corporations in certain
industries customarily sell (or ``factor'') their accounts receivable as a means of financing their operations.
In response to this recommendation, an additional tacking rule has been added to the final regulations. This rule
applies to a transfer of an account receivable in a customary commercial factoring transaction made within 30 days
after the account arose to a transferee that regularly engages in such transactions.

C. Treatment of Accrued Interest on Qualified Indebtedness



The proposed (and final) regulations generally provide that stock received by a creditor counts toward the 50 percent
threshold of section 382(l)(5) only to the extent that the creditor receives the stock in full or partial satisfaction
of qualifying indebtedness held for the requisite period. In response to a comment, the final regulations clarify
that such indebtedness held by a creditor includes interest accrued thereon.



D. Effective Date



The proposed regulations were to apply to ownership changes occurring on or after the date the Treasury decision adopting
the regulations was filed with the 

Federal Register. 

The preamble to the proposed regulations expressed an intent that taxpayers not be disadvantaged by the withdrawal
of the earlier proposed regulations and requested comments on ways to achieve that result.

The final regulations apply to ownership changes occurring on or after the date the Treasury decision adopting the
proposed regulations is filed with the 

Federal Register. 

As commentators recommended, however, the final regulations allow elective retroactive application of the rules
of the regulations to ownership changes that occurred on or after January 1, 1987. If the loss corporation elects retroactive
application, it may also revoke any prior election made under section 382(l)(5)(H) to not have section 382(l)(5)
apply.



Special Analyses



It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive
Order 12866. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter
5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and therefore, a Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking
was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small
business.



Drafting Information



The principal author of these regulations is Diana MacKeen Fulton, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Corporate),
Internal Revenue Service. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.

Special rules under section 382 for corporations under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or similar case.


(a) * * * Terms and nomenclature used in this section, and not otherwise defined herein (including
the nomenclature and assumptions in  1.382-2T(b) relating to the examples) have the same respective
meanings as in section 382 and the regulations thereunder.


* * * * *


(d) 

Rules for determining whether stock of the loss corporation is owned as a result of being a qualified creditor

_(1) 

Qualified creditor. 

A qualified creditor is the beneficial owner, immediately before the ownership change, of qualified indebtedness
of the loss corporation. A qualified creditor owns stock of the new loss corporation (or a controlling corporation)
as a result of being a qualified creditor only to the extent that the qualified creditor receives stock in full or partial
satisfaction of qualified indebtedness (including interest accrued on such indebtedness) in a transaction that
is ordered by the court or is pursuant to a plan approved by the court in a title 11 or similar case. For purposes of this
paragraph (d)(1), ownership of stock after the ownership change is determined without applying the attribution
rules generally applicable under section 382(l)(3)(A) or  1.382-2T(h).
(2) 

General rules for determining whether indebtedness is qualified indebtedness

_(i) 

Definition. 

Indebtedness of the loss corporation is qualified indebtedness if it_
(A) Has been owned by the same beneficial owner since the date that is 18 months before the date of the filing of the title
11 or similar case; or
(B) Arose in the ordinary course of the trade or business of the loss corporation and has been owned at all times by the
same beneficial owner.
(ii) 

Determination of beneficial ownership. 

For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, beneficial ownership of indebtedness is determined without
applying attribution rules.

<TEXT>
 

(iii) 

Duty of inquiry. 

The loss corporation must determine that indebtedness that the loss corporation treats as qualified indebtedness,
other than indebtedness to which paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section applies, has been owned for the requisite period
by the beneficial owner who owns the indebtedness immediately before the ownership change. The loss corporation
may rely on a statement, signed under penalties of perjury, by a beneficial owner regarding the amount of indebtedness
the beneficial owner owns and the length of time that the beneficial owner has owned the indebtedness.
(iv) 

Ordinary course indebtedness. 

For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), indebtedness arises in the ordinary course of the loss corporation's trade
or business only if the indebtedness is incurred by the loss corporation in connection with the normal, usual, or customary
conduct of business, determined without regard to whether the indebtedness funds ordinary or capital expenditures
of the loss corporation. For example, indebtedness (other than indebtedness acquired for a principal purpose of
being exchanged for stock) arises in the ordinary course of the loss corporation's trade or business if it is trade
debt; a tax liability; a liability arising from a past or present employment relationship, a past or present business
relationship with a supplier, customer, or competitor of the loss corporation, a tort, a breach of warranty, or a breach
of statutory duty; or indebtedness incurred to pay an expense deductible under section 162 or included in the cost
of goods sold. A claim that arises upon the rejection of a burdensome contract or lease pursuant to the title 11 or similar
case is treated as arising in the ordinary course of the loss corporation's trade or business if the contract or lease
so arose.
(3) 

Treatment of certain indebtedness as continuously owned by the same owner

_(i) 

In general. 

For purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a loss corporation may treat indebtedness as always having been
owned by the beneficial owner of the indebtedness immediately before the ownership change if the beneficial owner
is not, immediately after the ownership change, either a 5-percent shareholder or an entity through which a 5-percent
shareholder owns an indirect ownership interest in the loss corporation (a 

5-percent entity

). This paragraph (d)(3)(i) does not apply to indebtedness beneficially owned by a person whose participation in
formulating a plan of reorganization makes evident to the loss corporation (whether or not the loss corporation had
previous knowledge) that the person has not owned the indebtedness for the requisite period.
(ii) 

Operating rules. 

For purposes of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section: (A) If a loss corporation has actual knowledge of a coordinated
acquisition of its indebtedness by a group of persons, through a formal or informal understanding among themselves,
for a principal purpose of exchanging the indebtedness for stock, the indebtedness (and any stock received in exchange
therefor) is treated as owned by an entity. A principal element in determining if an understanding exists among members
of a group is whether the investment decision of each member is based upon the investment decision of one or more other
members.
(B) If the loss corporation has actual knowledge regarding stock ownership described in  1.382-2T(k)(2),
the loss corporation must take that ownership into account in determining which beneficial owners of indebtedness
are, immediately after the ownership change, 5-percent shareholders or 5-percent entities. The loss corporation
is not required to take into account an ownership interest described in  1.382-2T(k)(4) unless the loss
corporation has actual knowledge of the ownership interest.
(C) The term 

5-percent shareholder

 includes any person who is a 5-percent shareholder of the loss corporation within the meaning of  1.382-2T(g),
without regard to the option attribution rules of section 382(l)(3)(A) or  1.382-4(d) (or, if applicable,
 1.382-2T(h)(4)).
(D) Paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to indebtedness if the loss corporation has actual knowledge
immediately after the ownership change that the exercise of an option to acquire or dispose of stock of the loss corporation
would cause the beneficial owner of the indebtedness immediately before the ownership change to be, after the ownership
change, either a 5-percent shareholder or a 5-percent entity. An interest that is treated as an option under  1.382-4(d)(9)
(or  1.382-2T(h)(4)(v) if applicable) is treated as an option for purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D).

(iii) 

Indebtedness owned by beneficial owner who becomes a 5-percent shareholder or 5-percent entity.

 If the beneficial owner of indebtedness immediately before the ownership change is a 5-percent shareholder or 5-percent
entity immediately after the ownership change, the general rules of paragraph (d)(2) of this section apply to determine
whether the indebtedness has been owned for the requisite period by the beneficial owner. 
(iv) 

Example.

 The following example illustrates paragraph (d)(3) of this section. 





(A)(1) L is a loss corporation in a title 11 case. The plan of reorganization of L approved by the bankruptcy court provides
for the satisfaction of claims by the issuance of new L common stock to its creditors as follows:




A_2 percent 
B_7.5 percent 
C_2.5 percent 
P1_3 percent 
P2_10 percent 
P3_4.9 percent 
P4_4.9 percent 
P5_4.9 percent 




(2) P2 is owned by Public P2. B owns 10 percent of the stock of P1 and L has no actual knowledge of this ownership. L has actual
knowledge that D owns P3, P4 and P5. In addition, L has actual knowledge, immediately after the ownership change, that
C owns an option to acquire newly-issued stock of L that, if exercised, would increase C's percentage ownership of
L stock from 2.5 percent to 8 percent. An ownership change of L occurs on the date the plan becomes effective.

(B) Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, L may treat the indebtedness owned by A and P1 immediately before the
ownership change as always having been owned by A and P1. Neither A nor P1 is a 5-percent shareholder immediately after
the ownership change. Further, because P1 owns less than 5 percent of the L stock (and L has no actual knowledge of B's
ownership interest in P1), P1 is treated as an individual, and the L stock owned by P1 is not attributed to any other person,
including B. See  1.382-2T(h)(2)(iii). Therefore, P1 is not a 5-percent entity.

(C) Paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to the indebtedness owned by B, C, P2, P3, P4, or P5. B is a 5-percent
shareholder immediately after the ownership change. L has actual knowledge immediately after the ownership change
that the exercise of C's option would cause C to be a 5-percent shareholder immediately after the ownership change.
(L does not take into account the effect of the exercise of the option, however, in determining the percentage stock
ownership of any person other than C because the deemed exercise would not cause any other person to be a 5-percent shareholder
or a 5-percent entity after the ownership change.) P2 is a 5-percent entity, because Public P2, a 5-percent shareholder,
owns an indirect ownership interest in L through P2. P3, P4, and P5 are 5-percent entities because D, a 5-percent shareholder,
owns an indirect ownership interest in L through P3, P4, and P5. Because L has actual knowledge that D would be a 5-percent
shareholder but for the application of  1.382-2T(h)(2)(iii), that section does not apply to P3, P4, or
P5. See  1.382-2T(k)(2). Thus, under  1.382-2T(h)(2)(i), the L stock owned by P3, P4, and
P5 is attributed to D, and D is a 5-percent shareholder. Because paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section does not apply
to the indebtedness owned by B, C, P2, P3, P4, and P5, L may treat as qualified indebtedness only indebtedness that it
determines had been owned by such persons for the requisite period. See paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section.




(4) 

Special rule if indebtedness is a large portion of creditor's assets

_(i) 

In general

. Indebtedness is not qualified indebtedness if_
(A) The beneficial owner of the indebtedness is a corporation or other entity that had an ownership change on any day
during the applicable period;
(B) The indebtedness represents more than 25 percent of the fair market value of the total gross assets (excluding
cash or cash equivalents) of the beneficial owner on its change date; and
(C) The beneficial owner is a 5-percent entity immediately after the ownership change of the loss corporation (determined
by applying the rules of paragraph (d)(3) of this section). 
(ii) 

Applicable period.

 For purposes of paragraph 
(d)(4)(i) of this section, the term 

applicable period

 means the period beginning on the day 18 months before the filing of the title 11 or similar case (or the day on which the
beneficial owner acquired the indebtedness, if later) and ending with the change date of the loss corporation. 
(iii) 

Determination of ownership change.

 For purposes of paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, the determination whether a beneficial owner of indebtedness
has an ownership change is made under the principles of section 382 and the regulations thereunder, without regard
to whether the beneficial owner is a loss corporation and by beginning the testing period no earlier than the latest
of the day three years before the change date, the day 18 months before the filing of the title 11 or similar case, or the
day on which the beneficial owner acquired the indebtedness.
(iv) 

Reliance on statement.

 Paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section does not apply to indebtedness if the loss corporation obtains a statement, signed
under penalties of perjury, by the beneficial owner of the indebtedness that states that paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this
section does not apply to the indebtedness.

(5) 

Tacking of ownership periods

_(i) 

Transferee treated as owning indebtedness for period owned by transferor.

 To determine whether indebtedness transferred in a qualified transfer is qualified indebtedness, the transferee
is treated as having owned the indebtedness for the period that it was owned by the transferor.
(ii) 

Qualified transfer.

 For purposes of paragraph 
(d)(5)(i) of this section, a transfer of indebtedness is a qualified transfer if_
(A) The transfer is between parties who bear a relationship to each other described in section 267(b) or 707(b) (substituting
at least 80 percent for more than 50 percent each place it appears in section 267(b) (and section 267(f)(1)) or 707(b));

(B) The transfer is a transfer of a loan within 90 days after its origination, pursuant to a customary syndication transaction;
(C) The transfer is a transfer of newly incurred indebtedness by an underwriter that owned the indebtedness for a transitory
period pursuant to an underwriting;
(D) The transferee's basis in the indebtedness is determined under section 1014 or 1015 or with reference to the transferor's
basis in the indebtedness;
(E) The transfer is in satisfaction of a right to receive a pecuniary bequest;
(F) The transfer is pursuant to any divorce or separation instrument (within the meaning of section 71(b)(2));
(G) The transfer is pursuant to a subrogation in which the transferee acquires a claim against the loss corporation
by reason of a payment to the claimant pursuant to an insurance policy or a guarantee, letter of credit or similar security
arrangement; or
(H) The transfer is a transfer of an account receivable in a customary commercial factoring transaction made within
30 days after the account arose to a transferee that regularly engages in such transactions.
(iii) 

Exception.

 A transfer of indebtedness is not a qualified transfer for purposes of paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section if the transferee
acquired the indebtedness for a principal purpose of benefiting from the losses of the loss corporation by_
 (A) Exchanging the indebtedness for stock of the loss corporation pursuant to the title 11 or similar case; or 
(B) Selling the indebtedness at a profit that reflects the expectation that, by reason of section 382(l)(5), section
382(a) will not apply to any ownership change resulting from the title 11 or similar case.
(iv) 

Debt-for-debt exchanges.

 If the loss corporation satisfies its indebtedness with new indebtedness, either through an exchange of new indebtedness
for old indebtedness or a change in the terms of indebtedness that results in an exchange under section 1001_
(A) The owner of the new indebtedness is treated as having owned that indebtedness for the period that it owned the old
indebtedness; and
(B) The new indebtedness is treated as having arisen in the ordinary course of the trade or business of the loss corporation
if the old indebtedness so arose.
(6) 

Effective date

_(i) 

In general.

 This paragraph (d) applies to ownership changes occurring on or after March 17, 1994.
(ii) 

Elections and amended returns

_(A) 

Election to apply this paragraph (d) retroactively.

 A loss corporation may elect to apply this paragraph (d) to an ownership change occurring prior to March 17, 1994. This
election must be made by the later of the due date (including any extensions of time) of the loss corporation's tax return
for the taxable year which includes the change date or the date that the loss corporation files its first tax return
after May 16, 1994. The election is made by attaching the following statement to the return: ``This is an Election to
Apply  1.382-9(d) Retroactively with Respect to the Ownership Change on [Insert Date of Ownership Change]
That Occurred in Connection with the Title 11 or Similar Case filed on [Insert Date of Filing].'' This statement must
be accompanied by the amended returns described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(C) of this section. An election under this
paragraph (d)(6) is irrevocable.

(B) 

Election to revoke section 382(l)(5)(H) election.

 A loss corporation may elect to revoke a prior election made under section 382(l)(5)(H) with respect to an ownership
change occurring before March 17, 1994 by including the following statement with its election to apply  1.382-9(d)
retroactively: ``This is an Election to Revoke a Prior Election Made Under Section 382(l)(5)(H) With Respect to the
Ownership Change on [Insert Date of Ownership Change] That Occurred in Connection With the Title 11 or Similar Case
Filed on [Insert Date of Filing].''

(C) 

Amended returns.

 If the retroactive application of this paragraph (d) affects the amount of taxable income or loss for a prior taxable
year, then, except as precluded by the applicable statute of limitations, the loss corporation (or the common parent
of any consolidated group of which the loss corporation was a member for the year) must file an amended return for the
year that reflects the effects of the retroactive application of the rules of this paragraph (d). If the statute of
limitations precludes the filing of an amended return for one or more such prior taxable years, the loss corporation
(or the common parent) must make appropriate adjustments under the principles of section 382(l)(2)(A) in subsequent
taxable years to reflect the difference between the losses and credits actually used in such prior taxable years and
the amount that would have been used in those years applying the rules of this paragraph (d).

(e) 

Option attribution for purposes of determining stock ownership under section 382(l)(5)(A)(ii)

_(1) 

In general.

 * * * An option that is owned as a result of being a pre-change shareholder or qualified creditor and
that, if exercised, would result in the ownership of stock by a pre-change shareholder or qualified creditor is not
treated as exercised under this paragraph (e). * * *

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans Mississippi: Title V, Section 507, Small Business Stationary
Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Mississippi through the
Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary
Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), which will be fully implemented by
November 1994. This implementation plan was submitted by MDEQ on November 19, 1992, to satisfy the Federal mandate
of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA), to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance
and regulatory information necessary to comply with the CAA.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Implementation of the CAA will require small businesses to comply with specific regulations in order for areas to
attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. In anticipation
of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that states adopt a PROGRAM, and submit this
PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the EPA to oversee the small business
assistance program and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM
are set out in section 507 of the CAA and the EPA guidance document Guidelines for the Implementation of section 507
of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. In order to gain full approval, the state submittal must provide for each of the
following PROGRAM elements: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical
and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a state Small Business Ombudsman to represent
the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP)
to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP. 



MDEQ has met or will meet all of the following requirements of section 507 of the CAA by submitting a SIP revision that
implements the following required PROGRAM elements and implementation schedules. 


12/31/92 Reviewed legal authority and draft legislation.
05/30/93 Passage of all needed legislation accomplished.
09/15/93 Selection of Small Business Ombudsman and SBAP Manager-A person has been named to serve in an acting
capacity for both positions pending authorization of funding by the State legislature. Funding is expected to be
in place by 07/01/94, 
and positions will be filled as soon as possible following that date. 
07/31/94 Organization of Compliance Advisory Panel-The CAP has been appointed and organized and held meetings
on 10/28/93 and 01/20/94. 
11/15/94 Full Implementation of PROGRAM.



EPA concurs with the above listed implementation schedule. 



1. Small Business Assistance Program


MDEQ has named an Acting Small Business Assistance Program Manager and established a Small Business Assistance Program
(SBAP) which will incorporate the following six requirements set forth in section 507 of the CAA:




A. The establishment of adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting and coordinating information concerning
compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation
among such sources and other persons to further comply with the CAA; 

B. The establishment of adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with pollution prevention
and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning alternative technologies,
process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution; 

C. The development of a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary sources which
assists small businesses in determining applicable permit requirements under the CAA in a timely and efficient manner;


D. The development of adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive notice of their
rights under the CAA in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to evaluate compliance
methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under the CAA; 

E. The development of adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their obligations
under the CAA, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors, or at the option of the state,
for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the CAA; and 

F. The development of procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source for modification
of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance; or (B) the schedule of milestones for implementing
such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the technological
and financial capability of any such small business stationary source. 

It is anticipated these goals will be achieved by the proposed implementation date.
 


2. Ombudsman 


MDEQ has appointed an Acting Small Business Ombudsman and established a Small Business Ombudsman's office which
reports directly to the head of the Office of Pollution Control and also which will act as the small business community's
representative as required by section 507(a)(3) of the CAA. A fully operational ombudsman's office is expected to
be in place by the proposed implementation date.



3. Compliance Advisory Panel


In accordance with the State statute dated April 4, 1993, MDEQ established a Small Business Air Pollution Compliance
Advisory Council (SBAP CAP) to meet the requirements section 507(e) of the CAA. As described in a January 20, 1994,
letter from the Department of Environmental Quality, Mississippi does not have majority and minority leaderships
in its Senate and House of Representatives. To reflect political realities within the State of Mississippi, the SBAP
CAP is composed of seven members appointed as follows:


 

A. One member representing the Air Pollution Control Program of the Department of Environmental Quality; 

B. Two members who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses, appointed by the Governor; 
 
C. Two members who each shall be the owner or representative of owners of small businesses, appointed by the Speaker
of the House of Representatives; and 

D. Two members who each shall be the owner or representative of owners of small businesses, appointed by the Lieutenant
Governor (who presides over the Senate). 

The SBAP CAP has the following three responsibilities: (1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness
of the SBAP, difficulties encountered and the degree and severity of enforcement actions; (2) to periodically report
to EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Equal Access to Justice
Act, and the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act

3

; and (3) to review and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable.





4. Eligibility


MDEQ has incorporated section 507(c)(1) and defined a Small Business Stationary Source as a source that:



(A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; 
(B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act, 13 CFR Part 121; 
(C) Is not a major stationary source as defined in titles I and III of the CAA; 
(D) Does not emit 50 tons or more per year of any regulated air pollutant; and 
(E) Emits less than 75 tons per year of all regulated air pollutants. 

MDEQ has established the following mechanisms as required by section 507: (1) A process for ascertaining the eligibility
of a source to receive assistance under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria
in section 507(c)(1) of the CAA; and (2) A process for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources
that do not meet the provisions of sections 507(c)(1)(C), (D), and (E) of the CAA, but do not emit more than 100 tpy of
all regulated pollutants. 


Final Action


In this action, EPA is approving the PROGRAM SIP revision submitted by the State of Mississippi through the MDEQ. This
action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial and EPA anticipates no significant
comments on them. The public should be advised that this action will be effective May 17, 1994. However, if notice is
received by April 18, 1994, that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments, this action will be withdrawn
and two subsequent documents will be published before the effective date. One document will withdraw the final action
and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed
in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by May 17, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration
by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2).)

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent
waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it
rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive
Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
By this action, EPA is approving a State program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being proposed for approval today does not impose
any new regulatory burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage
of assistance provided by the State. Because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory
requirements on small businesses, I therefore certify it does not have a significant economic impact on any small
entities affected.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 USEPA is taking action to approve a revision to Wisconsin's State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. USEPA's action
is based upon a revision request which was submitted by the State to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as
amended November 15, 1990 (Act), and the Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) regulations. The
PAMS regulation requires the State to provide for establishment and maintenance of an enhanced ambient air quality
monitoring network in the form of PAMS by November 12, 1993.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Summary of State Submittal


On November 15, 1993, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) submitted to the USEPA a SIP revision,
incorporating PAMS into the ambient air quality monitoring network of State or Local Air Monitoring Stations (SLAMS)
and National Air Monitoring Stations (NAMS). The State will establish and maintain PAMS as part of the overall ambient
air quality monitoring network. 
Section 182(c)(1) of the Act and the General Preamble (57 FR 13515) require that USEPA promulgate rules for enhanced
monitoring of ozone, oxides of nitrogen (NO

x

), and volatile organic compounds (VOC) no later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of the Act. In addition,
the Act requires that, following the promulgation of the rules relating to enhanced ambient monitoring, the State
must commence actions to adopt and implement a program based on these rules, to improve monitoring for ambient concentrations
of ozone, NO

x

, and VOC and to improve monitoring of emissions of NO

x

 and VOC.
The final PAMS rule was promulgated by USEPA on February 12, 1993 (58 FR 8452). Section 58.40(a) of the revised rule
requires the State to submit a photochemical assessment monitoring network description, including a schedule for
implementation, to the Administrator within 6 months after promulgation or by August 12, 1993. Further,  58.20(f)
requires the State to provide for the establishment and maintenance of a PAMS network within 9 months after promulgation
of the final rule or November 12, 1993. 
On August 12, 1993, the Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium (LADCO) submitted an alternative PAMS network description
on behalf of the LADCO States of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana, including a schedule for implementation. This
submittal is currently being reviewed by the USEPA and is intended to satisfy the requirements of  58.40(a).
A joint network description and implementation schedule is allowed by  58.40(a)(3) for States where the State's
PAMS network requires monitoring stations in different States and/or Regions. Since network descriptions may change
annually, they are not part of the SIP as recommended by the 

Guideline for the Implementation of the Ambient Air Monitoring Regulations 40 CFR 58

. However, the network description is negotiated and approved during an annual review as required by 40 CFR 58.25 and
58.36 and the revision to be codified at  58.46. 
On November 15, 1993, Wisconsin submitted to the USEPA a proposed revision to the Wisconsin ozone SIP. This submittal
included a copy of rule 144.31(1)(g) of the Wisconsin Administrative Rule, ``Air pollution control; powers and duties,''
and supplementary information demonstrating that the WDNR has the authority to conduct ambient air quality monitoring
and other activities to determine the magnitude of air pollution throughout the State. This would encompass establishing
and maintaining a PAMS network. A letter finding the submittal complete was sent to the State on January 4, 1994.
The Wisconsin PAMS SIP revision is intended to meet the requirements of section 182(c)(1) of the Act and affect compliance
with the PAMS regulations, to be codified at 40 CFR part 58, as promulgated on February 12, 1993.


The WDNR held a public hearing on the PAMS on November 11, 1993.


II. Analysis of State Submittal


The Wisconsin PAMS SIP revision will provide Wisconsin with the authority to establish and operate the PAMS sites,
secure State funds for PAMS and provide the USEPA with authority to enforce the implementation of PAMS, since their
implementation is required by the Act.


The criteria used to review the proposed SIP revision are derived from the PAMS regulations, to be codified at 40 CFR
part 58, the 

Guideline for the Implementation of the Ambient Air Monitoring Regulations 40 CFR Part 58

 (USEPA-450/4-78-038, OAQPS, November 1979), the September 2, 1993 memorandum from G. T. Helms
entitled 

Final Boilerplate Language for the PAMS SIP Submittal

, the Act and the General Preamble. 
The September 2, 1993 memorandum from G. T. Helms entitled 

Final Boilerplate Language for the PAMS SIP Submittal

 stipulates that the PAMS SIP, at a minimum, must: enable the monitoring of criteria pollutants, such as ozone and NO

2

 and non-criteria pollutants, such as NO

x

, NO, speciated VOC, including carbonyls, as well as meteorological parameters; provide a copy of the approved (or
proposed) PAMS network description, including the phase-in schedule, for public inspection during the public notice
and/or comment period provided for in the SIP revision or, alternatively, provide information to the public upon
request concerning the State's plans for implementing the rules; make reference to the fact that PAMS will become
a part of the State or local air monitoring stations (SLAMS) network; and provide a statement that SLAMS will employ
Federal reference (FRM) or equivalent methods while most PAMS sampling will be conducted using methods approved
by the USEPA which are not FRM or equivalent.
The Wisconsin SIP revision provides that the network will measure ambient levels of ozone, NO

x

, speciated VOC, including hydrocarbons and carbonyls and meteorological data. During the public comment period
and hearing, Wisconsin provided a copy of the proposed alternative PAMS network description, including a schedule
of implementation, to the public upon request to Ralph Patterson of the WDNR. The SIP revision provides that each station
in the air quality surveillance network provided for by this SIP will be termed a SLAMS. Finally, the SIP revision provides
that the methods used in SLAMS will be reference or equivalent methods as defined by USEPA at 40 CFR 50.1, while the methods
used in PAMS will be approved by USEPA on a regional basis as part of its approval of the network descriptions.


III. Rulemaking Action


USEPA approves the revision to the Wisconsin ozone SIP for PAMS. 
Because USEPA considers today's action noncontroversial and routine, we are approving it today without prior proposal.
The action will become effective on May 17, 1994. However, if we receive notice by April 18, 1994, that someone wishes
to submit adverse comments, then USEPA will publish: (1) A document that withdraws the action, and (2) a document that
begins a new rulemaking by proposing the action and establishing a comment period.
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. The USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting
Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional
Administrators). A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. Under the revised tables this action
remains classified as a Table 2. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP
revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years (54 FR 2222). The USEPA
has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver
until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continued in effect under Executive Order 12866 which
superseded Executive order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
Because the USEPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements on small businesses,
I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected.
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by May 17, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. See section 307(b)(2).
The Agency has reviewed this request for revision of the federally approved State Implementation Plan for conformance
with the provisions of the Act enacted on November 15, 1990.

SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP)

incorporates the class I and class II Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD)NO

2

 increments and related requirements. The intended effect of this action is to 
approve a program to implement the NO

 increments in the State of 
Maine in accordance with the federal PSD regulations. This 
action is being taken in accordance with section 110 of the Clean 
Air Act.

 
 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On July 16, 1990 and September 5, 
1990, the State of Maine submitted a formal revision to its SIP. 
The SIP revision consists of a program to implement the NO

2

 
increments to prevent the significant deterioration of air 
quality in the State of Maine. 



Background 



On October 17, 1988 (53 FR 40656), EPA promulgated regulations 
pursuant to section 166 of the Clean Air Act (the Act) to prevent 
significant deterioration of air quality from emissions of 
nitrogen oxides (NO

x

). These regulations establish the maximum 
allowable increase in the ambient NO

2

 concentration above the 
baseline concentration in an area. These maximum allowable 
increases are called ``increments.'' The increments use NO

2

 as the 
numerical measure because NO

2

 is the pollutant on which the 
national ambient air quality standards for NO

x

 were based. In 
addition, NO

x

 emissions from stationary sources convert to NO

2

 in 
the atmosphere. 

The NO

2

 increment program has a three-tiered area classification 
system which was established by Congress in section 163 for 
increments of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. Class I 
areas (including certain national parks and wilderness areas) 
were designated by Congress as areas of special national concern, 
where the need to prevent the significant deterioration in air 
quality is the greatest. Therefore, the increment levels in 
class I areas are the most stringent. Class II increments allow 
for a moderate degree of growth. Class III increments allow for 
higher levels of industrial growth. There are no class III areas 
in the country yet. (All areas not specifically designated in 
the Act as Class I are designated as class II, unless the state 
chooses to redesignate an area to class I or class III.) 

The NO

2

 increments for the three areas are the following:




Class I: 2.5  u g/m

3

 annual arithmetic mean 
Class II: 25  u g/m

3

 annual arithmetic mean 
Class III: 50  u g/m

3

 annual arithmetic mean.




Forty CFR 51.166 sets forth the minimum federal requirements for 
the PSD program. State PSD programs must meet all of these 
requirements. The effective date of the amendments to 40 CFR 
51.166 which incorporate the NO

2

 increments was October 17, 1989. 
The Act allows states 9 months after the effective date to submit 
revised SIPs incorporating the NO

2

 increments.

Summary of Maine's SIP Revision 



The Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) made 
amendments to its regulations and statute which incorporate the 
PSD NO

2

 increments and related requirements. On June 13, 1990, 
the Maine Board of Environmental Protection (BEP) adopted the NO

2

 
increments and related revisions to its regulations. 

The State amended Chapter 100 ``Definitions Regulation,'' Chapter 
110 ``Ambient Air Quality Standards,'' Chapter 113 ``Growth Offset 
Regulation,'' and Chapter 115 ``Emission License Regulations.'' The 
State also amended its New Source Review (NSR) SIP narrative. In 
addition, the State deleted Chapter 108 (its former Emission 
Licensing Regulation) which is no longer applicable in the State 
of Maine. Chapter 115 now supersedes Chapter 108. This deletion 
is not part of this rulemaking because Maine requested that EPA 
withdraw Chapter 108 from the SIP and EPA took action in a 
previous final rulemaking document. EPA is approving an 
associated minor change to Chapter 115(l)(B) which deletes the 
grandfathering provisions for licensing. The Maine DEP now 
requires all sources to comply with Chapter 115. Finally, the 
State amended its definition of ``fuel burning equipment'' to 
clarify that equipment which combusts fuel to produce heat and 
power (i.e., steam for heating, process use, and/or electrical 
generation) is covered under the definition. The definition 
would not apply to equipment that combusts fuel for the purpose 
of drying material by direct contact with the combustion gases. 
This equipment would be covered by the general process source 
particulate matter emissions regulation. 

The revisions establish the ambient air increments and require 
applicants for PSD permits to assess increment consumption in 
class I and class II areas. The Maine DEP did not submit the 
class III increment and there are no class III areas in Maine. 
In the future, if Maine redesignates an area to class III, it 
has committed to submitting the class III increment for EPA 
approval. In addition, the Maine DEP committed to developing a 
NO

x

 emissions inventory, tracking increment consumption 
periodically, determining increment consumption between February 
8, 1988 and July 14, 1990, and correcting any NO

2

 increment 
violations it may discover in the future. 

On April 14, 1990, the Maine State Legislature adopted the NO

2

 
increments in its statute, which became effective in the State of 
Maine on July 14, 1990. The Maine Board of Environmental 
Protection adopted these amendments to the regulations and they 
became effective in the State of Maine on July 10, 1990. On July 
16, 1990, September 5, 1990, and November 2, 1990 the Maine DEP 
submitted these revisions as a SIP revision to EPA. 

EPA has evaluated these revisions and found they are equivalent 
to, or in some instances, more stringent than, the requirements 
in 40 CFR  51.166. Maine's NO

2

 increment program and EPA's 
evaluation are detailed in a memorandum dated September 13, 1990 
entitled ``Technical Support Document_Maine Prevention of 
Significant Deterioration (PSD) Nitrogen Dioxide (NO

2

) Increment 
Regulations.'' Copies of this memorandum are available, upon 
request, from the EPA Regional Office listed in the 

ADDRESSES

 
section of this document. EPA has reviewed this SIP revision for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 Clean
Air Act 
Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. This SIP revision 
addresses the NO

2

 increments and related requirements. These NO

2

 
increment requirements were promulgated by EPA prior to November 
15, 1990. These requirements are still mandated under the Act; 
therefore, EPA is approving them in this action. Maine is 
required to adopt other new source review revisions, however, in 
accordance with the deadlines imposed in the Clean Air Act.
 
EPA's approval of the NO

2

 increments in no way relieves Maine of 
the obligation to submit further revisions to its SIP to meet the 
Act's new requirements according to the schedule contained in the 
Act. Maine will be submitting these revisions to EPA as a 
separate package. 





EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because 
the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and 
anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective May 17, 1994 unless, by April 18, 1994, notice is received
that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If 
such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the 
effective date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent 
documents. One document will withdraw the final action and 
another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of 
the action and establishing a comment period. If no such 
comments are received, the public is advised that this action 
will be effective on May 17, 1994.

Final Action 



EPA is approving the revisions to the definitions of ``actual emissions'' and ``baseline concentration'' in Chapter
100(1) and Chapter 100(9) of Maine's Definitions Regulation and Chapter 110(10) (except for Chapter 110(10)(C)(3))
of Maine's Ambient Air Quality Standards Regulation, Chapter 113(II)(A) of Maine's Growth Offset Regulation and
Chapter 115(I)(B), (VII)(A), (VII)(B)(3), and (VII)(D)(3) of Maine's Emission License Regulations which adopt
an NO

2

 increment program. In addition EPA is approving the new source review narrative changes to Chapter 6 ``Review of New
Sources and Modifications.'' Finally, EPA is approving a change to the definition of ``fuel burning equipment''
in Chapter 100(29). 


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 


This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On
January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirement
of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The US EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on US EPA's
request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded 
Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

U.S. E.P.A.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). 

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements. 

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by May 17, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document establishes a time-limited tolerance for residues of 

N,N

-diallyl dichloroacetamide (CAS Reg. No. 37764-253) when used as an inert ingredient (safener) in pesticide formulations
applied to corn fields before the corn plants emerge from the soil with a maximum use level of 1.0 pound of this safener
per acre per year in or on corn, fodder at 0.05 part per million (ppm), corn, forage at 0.05 ppm and corn, grain at 0.05
ppm. A request to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of the inert ingredient in or on the commodity
was requested by the Zeneca Ag Products. This time-limited tolerance expires December 31, 1998.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Background


EPA is charged with administration of section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346.
Section 408 authorizes EPA to establish tolerance levels and exemptions from the requirements of a tolerance for
residues of pesticide chemicals in or on raw agricultural commodities. Inert ingredients are all ingredients that
are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 162.3(c), and include, but are not limited to, the following types of
ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own): solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons;
surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners
such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting and spreading agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; and
emulsifiers. The term ``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically
active.
The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statement
on inert ingredients published in the 

Federal Register

 of Arpil 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks
posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. Where it can be determined that the inert ingredient
will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not need some or all of the listed studies to rule on the proposed
tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for an inert ingredient. The Agency has evaluated data
pertaining to all of the listed studies in developing this proposed rule.
In those cases where the toxicity of an inert ingredient is such that exposure to the inert ingredient must be restricted
to assure that the use of the inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation is not injurious to the public health, EPA
will propose to establish a tolerance for residues of the inert ingredient on raw agricultural commodities.


II. Provisions of Rule


Zeneca Ag Products, 1800 Concord Pike, P.O. Box 751, Wilmington, DE 19897, submitted pesticide petition (PP) 6F3344
proposing to amend 40 CFR 180.1026 by establishing a regulation to permit residues of N,N-diallyl dichloroacetamide
when used as an inert ingredient (safener) in formulations applied to corn fields before the corn plants emerge from
the soil with a maximum use level of 1.0 pound of this safener per acre per year in or on corn, fodder at 0.05 ppm, corn,
forage at 0.05 ppm and corn, grain at 0.05 ppm. EPA issued a notice, published in the 

Federal Register

 of November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62123), announcing receipt of this petition. No comments were received in response to the
notice of filing. A safener is a herbicidal antidote that protects desirous crops while allowing the herbicide to
act on the intended weed targets. This safener will be used with the active ingredient acetochlor. 
The data submitted in the petitions and other relevant material have been evaluated. This inert ingredient is considered
useful for the purpose for which the tolerance is sought. The toxicological, ecological, and environmental fate
data considered in support of the proposed tolerance include:
1. An acute rat oral toxicity study with an acute oral LD

50

 of 2,055 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg).
2. An acute rabbit dermal toxicity study with an acute dermal LD

50

 of > 5,000 mg/kg.
3. A rabbit eye irritation study in which 

N,N

-diallyl dichloroacetamide is determined not to be an eye irritant.
4. An acute rat inhalation toxicity study with a 4-hour inhalation LC

50

 of > 5.6 mg/L.
5. A rabbit primary dermal irritation study indicating that dichlormid is a mild dermal irritant.
6. A 90-day rat oral toxicity study with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 200 parts per million (ppm) or 10 mg/kg/day.
7. A 90-day dog oral toxicity study with a NOEL of 5 mg/kg/day or 200 ppm. 8. A rat developmental effects study with a NOEL
for maternal toxicity of 40 mg/kg/day and developmental toxicity of 40 mg/kg/day. 
9. A 14-week rat inhalation study with a NOEL of 2 mg/m

3

.
10. Mutagenicity studies including 

in vivo/in vitro

 unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes, Mammalian Cells in Culture Cytogenetic Assay in human lymphocytes,


in vivo

 Micronucleus Assay in Mice, Salmonella typhimurium/mammalian plate incorporation (Ames) assay with and without
metabolic activation were negative.
11. An acute mallard duck oral toxicity study with an LD

50

 of > 5,620 mg/kg.
12. An acute bobwhite quail oral toxicity study with an LD

50

 of 1,545 mg/kg. 
13. A bobwhite quail dietary toxicity (LC

50

) study with an LC

50

 of > 5,200 ppm. 
14. A 96-hour rainbow trout static acute toxicity study with an LC

50

 of 103 mg/liter (L).
15. A 48-hour daphnia magna static toxicity study with an EC

50

 of 161 mg/L.
16. Environmental fate studies including hydrolysis, photodegradation in water and on soil, aerobic soil metabolism,
mobility (batch equilibrium) studies.
A reference dose (RfD) has not been established for this chemical. However, a Provisional Acceptable Daily Intake
(PADI) has been established at 0.005 mg/kg/day based on the 90-day dog oral toxicity study NOEL of 5 mg/kg/day. The
theoretical worst-case maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from the proposed tolerance is estimated to be 0.000017
mg/kg/bwt (bodyweight)/day for the overall U.S. population, representing 0.3% of the PADI for dichlormid. The TMRC
for the most highly exposed subgroup, non-nursing infants less than 1 year, is 0.000049 mg/kg/bwt/day, or approximately
1% of the PADI.
This tolerance is being established as a time-limited tolerance because the Agency does not have data from two chronic
feeding/oncogenicity studies which are part of the toxicology data typically required to be submitted in support
of a tolerance request. These studies will be required to be submitted to the Agency by January 31, 1998. In addition,
product chemistry data to fulfill Guidelines Nos. 61, 62, 63-2 through 63-6, 63-8, and 63-13 must be submitted within
6 months of the date of this notice. When the Agency receives these chronic feeding/oncogenicity studies it will reassess
the tolerance. However, based upon the data considered in support of the tolerance and the low degree of dietary exposure,
the Agency does not believe that this time-limited tolerance poses significant risks. 

The Agency believes that this use will not result in residues in processed food requiring additional food additive
regulations because of the low residues in the raw agricultural commodities, the structural similarity to acetochlor,
and the rapid metabolism of the safener in plants. However, the Agency is requiring that a processing study on the safener
be submitted by March 31, 1996, to confirm that food additive regulations are not needed.

This tolerance will expire December 31, 1998. Residues not in excess of these tolerances will not be considered actionable
if a pesticide containing this inert ingredient is legally applied during the term of a conditional registration
under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended and in accordance with the acceptable
labeling under a conditional registration. This tolerance will be revoked if any data indicate such revocation is
necessary to protect the public health. 
An analytical method for determination of the nature of the residue, gas-liquid chromatography using an electron-capture
detector, has been reviewed by the Agency, and upon successful completion of an Agency method validation, will be
made available in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II (PAM II), for enforcement purposes. In the interim, the
method will be available at the address given below. By mail: Calvin Furlow, Public Response and Program Resources
Branch, Field Operations Division (H7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401
M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 1130A, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy.,
Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-305-5937.
Based upon the above information considered by the Agency, the tolerance established by amending 40 CFR part 180 would
protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerance is established as set forth below. 
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat.
1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising
tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Mississippi; Final Authorization of Revisions to State Hazardous Waste Management Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Immediate final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Mississippi has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA). Mississippi's revisions consist of the provisions contained in HSWA Cluster I except checklist
17L Corrective Action and checklist 17P Interim Status. These requirements are listed in section B of this notice.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Mississippi's application and has made a decision, subject
to public review and comment, that Mississippi's hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements
necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve Mississippi's hazardous waste program
revisions. Mississippi's application for program revisions is available for public review and comment. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background 


States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or
``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. 
In addition, as an interim measure, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-616, November
8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead
of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive
``interim authorization'' for the HSWA requirements under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later
apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements. Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary
when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly,
State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268 and 270.



B. Mississippi 


Mississippi initially received final authorization for its base RCRA program effective on June 27, 1984. Mississippi
received authorization for revisions to its program on October 17, 1988, October 9, 1990, May 28, 1991, August 27,
1991, July 10, 1992, June 7, 1993, and December 20, 1993. 
On October 26, 1989, and November 25, 1992, Mississippi submitted a program revision application for additional
program approvals. Today, Mississippi is seeking approval of its program revisions in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3).

EPA has reviewed Mississippi's application and has made an immediate final decision that Mississippi's hazardous
waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently,
EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to Mississippi. The public may
submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until April 18, 1994.

Copies of Mississippi's application for these program revisions are available for inspection and copying at the
locations indicated in the ``Addresses'' 

section of this notice. Approval of Mississippi's program revisions shall become effective May 17, 1994, unless
an adverse comment pertaining to the State's revisions discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment
period. 

If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision; or (2)
a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or
reverses the decision. 

EPA shall administer any RCRA hazardous waste permits, or portions of permits that contain conditions based upon
the Federal program provisions for which the State is applying for authorization and which were issued by EPA prior
to the effective date of this authorization. EPA will suspend issuance of any further permits under the provisions
for which the State is being authorized on the effective date of this authorization.

Mississippi's application for these program revisions meet all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established
by RCRA. Accordingly, Mississippi is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised.


Mississippi now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders
and carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitations of its program revision application
and previously approved authorities. Mississippi also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA
retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under sections
3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA. 



Compliance With Executive Order 12866 



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.




Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 




Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of Mississippi's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements
for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. 

This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

Aid to Families With Dependent Children Program; Adult Assistance Programs; Provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993 To Eliminate Enhanced Federal Funding


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Administration for Children and Families (ACF), HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rules.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

These final rules implement provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which eliminate enhanced
Federal funding rates for the optional fraud control program conducted under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children
(AFDC) program and training activities conducted under the Adult Assistance programs.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 13741 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93), Public Law 103-66, amended
section 403 of the Social Security Act (the Act) by eliminating enhanced Federal matching funding rates for certain
categories of AFDC expenditures. The AFDC program expenditures affected pertain to: (1) The planning, design, and
development or installation of an approved Family Assistance Management Information System (FAMIS), (2) the operation
of an optional AFDC Fraud Control Program, and (3) the alien status verification system with the Immigration and Naturalization
Service designated Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program.


The current enhanced Federal matching rates are: (1) 90 percent for FAMIS, (2) 75 percent for AFDC Fraud Control, and
(3) 100 percent for SAVE. These rates are reduced to 50 percent.

</SUPPLEM>

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940318-0-00105 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940318-0-00021 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This legislation also eliminated the enhanced Federal matching rates for the Adult Assistance programs in Guam,
Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. These programs are the Old-Age Assistance for the Aged; Aid to the Blind; Aid to
the Permanently and Totally Disabled; and Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled under titles I, X, XIV, and XVI (AABD)
of the Social Security Act respectively. The current Federal matching rates for training and SAVE, which are 75 percent
and 100 percent respectively, are reduced to 50 percent.

Reductions in the Federal matching rates for the AFDC Fraud Control Program and for training under the Adult Assistance
Programs are addressed in these regulations. Separate regulations will be issued pertaining to the FAMIS system.

The statutory SAVE requirements were implemented without regulations via program action transmittals and information
memoranda. In an action transmittal, ACF-AT-93-16, we provided instructions regarding the reduction
of 100 percent Federal funding for the SAVE program, applicable to both the AFDC and Adult Assistance Programs, to
50 percent Federal matching.



Optional AFDC Fraud Control Program



Section 9102 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 added section 416 to the Act permitting State agencies
to establish and operate an optional fraud control program. This authorized States to impose disqualification penalties
on an individual found to have committed an intentional program violation(s) by a State administrative disqualification
hearing or by a Federal or State court, and to claim Federal matching at a 75 percent Federal matching rate for costs
directly attributed to the operation of an AFDC fraud control program.

Section 13741 of OBRA-93 reduced all the AFDC enhanced Federal matching rates, including the 75 percent rate
for operation of the AFDC Fraud Control Program. The new rate is 50 percent. The funding provisions at 45 CFR 235.112
are revised accordingly including the distinction between regular and enhanced funding for pre-eligibility fraud
detection activities.



Training Programs for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled



Staff development and training activities pertaining to the Adult Assistance programs conducted under titles I,
X, XIV, and XVI (AABD) in Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have historically been matched at the 75 percent
Federal matching rate. Final rules on the transfer of these training provisions from the Handbook of Public Assistance
Administration to the Code of Federal Regulations were published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 27, 1971 (36 FR 3863). These rules included the transfer of the 75 percent Federal financial participation
rate. 

Section 13741 of OBRA-93 amended sections 3(a)(4), 1003(a)(3), 1403(a)(3), and 1603(a)(4) of the Social Security
Act to reduce all of the Adult Assistance program enhanced Federal matching rates. This change includes the 75 percent
Federal financial participation rate for training. That rate is changed to 50 percent. The funding provisions at
45 CFR 235.64 are revised accordingly.



Regulatory Procedures



Justification for Dispensing With Notice of Proposed Rulemaking



The amendments to these regulations are being published as final rules. The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.
553(b)(B), provides that, if the Department for good cause finds that the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is unnecessary,
impracticable or contrary to the public interest, it may dispense with such notice if it incorporates a brief statement
of the reasons for doing so in the rules issued. The Department finds that there is good cause to dispense with a Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking with respect to these amendments. Publication of these rules in proposed form is unnecessary
as the amendments simply implement the statutory provisions and do not involve administrative discretion.

Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities
and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Deapartment has determined that this rule is consistent with
these priorities and principles. An assessment of the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives (including
not regulating) demonstrated that the approach taken in the regulation is the most cost-effective and least burdensome
while still achieving the regulatory objectives.



Paperwork Reduction Act



These final rules do not contain any information collection activities and, therefore, no approvals are necessary
under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511).



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Regulatory flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354) requires the Federal government to anticipate and reduce the
impact of regulations and paperwork requirements on small businesses.

The primary impact of these final rules is on State governments and individuals. Therefore, we certify that these
final rules will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they affect
payments to individuals and States. Thus, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.

approved plan to establish and operate a fraud control program pursuant to section 416 of the Social Security Act.
All costs must adhere to cost principles found at OMB Circular No. A-87 (available from the Executive Office
of the President, Publications Unit, room 2200, New Executive Office Building, 725 17th Street NW., Washington,
DC 20503) and to cost allocation provisions found at  205.150 of this chapter.
(2) 

Cost allocation. 

Where common activities or efforts are undertaken in support of both the AFDC and Food Stamp programs, the cost allocation
plan pursuant to  205.150 of this chapter must provide for a distribution of these costs to both programs.

Construction of Cargo Tank Motor Vehicles; Confirmation of Effective Date 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), DOT.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice; confirmation of effective date.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On January 12, 1994, RSPA published a final rule to extend the compliance date for the continued construction of cargo
tank motor vehicles to the MC 306, MC 307, MC 312, MC 331, and MC 338 specifications. The effective date of the rule was
March 14, 1994, contingent upon RSPA receiving no comments opposing the extension by February 11, 1994. This document
confirms that RSPA received no opposing comments and, therefore, the effective date of the final rule is March 14,
1994.


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On January 12, 1994, RSPA published a final rule to extend the compliance date for the continued construction of cargo
tank motor vehicles to the MC 306, MC 307, MC 312, MC 331, and MC 338 specifications from April 21, 1994 to August 31, 1995
(Docket HM-183, Amdt. Nos. 173-212 and 180-2, 59 FR 1784). The January 12 rule was in response to comments
received from several cargo tank manufacturers requesting an extension to allow them additional time to implement
engineering procedures and design modifications required for manufacture of cargo tank motor vehicles to the new
DOT 406, DOT 407 and DOT 412 specifications and to the revised MC 331 and MC 338 specifications. RSPA stated in the final
rule that the effective date would be March 14, 1994, unless by February 11, 1994, RSPA received comments that illustrated
extension of the compliance date would not be in the public interest. RSPA received three comments to the final rule;
all comments were in support of the extension. Therefore, this document confirms that the effective date of the January
12 final rule is March 14, 1994.

 Final rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule promulgates the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) program for evaluating and regulating
substitutes for ozone-depleting chemicals being phased out under the stratospheric ozone protection provisions
of the Clean Air Act (CAA). In section 612 of the CAA, the Agency is authorized to identify and restrict the use of substitutes
for class I and II ozone-depleting substances where the Administrator has determined that other alternatives exist
that reduce overall risk to human health and the environment. EPA is referring to the program that provides these determinations
as the Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program. The intended effect of this final rule is to expedite movement
away from ozone-depleting compounds by identifying substitutes that 
offer lower overall risks to human health and the environment. 



In this final rule, EPA is both issuing decisions on the acceptability and 
unacceptability of substitutes and promulgating its plan for administering the SNAP program. To arrive at determinations
on the acceptability of substitutes, the Agency completed a crossmedia analysis of risks to human health and the environment
from the use of various substitutes in different industrial end-uses. Results of this analysis are summarized in
this final rule, which covers substitutes in the following sectors: Refrigeration and air conditioning, foam blowing,
solvents cleaning, fire suppression and explosion protection, 
tobacco expansion, adhesives, coatings and inks, aerosols, and sterilants. Analysis of substitutes in a ninth sector,
pesticides, will be completed, and the resulting decisions will be added to future SNAP determinations published
in the 

Federal Register

. These sectors comprise the principal United States industrial sectors that historically consumed large volumes
of ozone-depleting compounds.

II. Background 


A. Regulatory History 



The stratospheric ozone layer protects the earth from dangerous ultraviolet-B (UV-B) 
radiation. Depletion of stratospheric ozone allows more UV-B radiation to penetrate to the 
earth's surface. Increased radiation, in turn, has been linked to higher incidence of certain 
skin cancers and cataracts, suppression of the human immune system, damage to crops and 
aquatic organisms, and increased formation of ground-level ozone. Further, increased 
radiation can cause economic losses from materials damage such as more rapid weathering of 
outdoor plastics. (See 53 FR 30566 (August 12, 1988) for more information on the effects of 
ozone depletion.) 

In response to scientific concerns and findings on ozone depletion, the United States 
and twenty-three other nations signed the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the 
Ozone Layer on September 16, 1987. The original agreement set forth a timetable for 
reducing the production and consumption of specific ozone-depleting substances, including 
CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-114, CFC-115, Halon 1211, Halon 1301, and Halon 2402.

EPA implemented the original Protocol through regulations allocating production and 
consumption allowances equal to the total amount of production and consumption granted to 
the United States under the Protocol. (See 53 FR 30566.) 

The Parties to the Montreal Protocol met in London June 27-29, 1990 to consider 
amendments to the Protocol. In response to scientific evidence indicating greater than 
expected stratospheric ozone depletion, the Parties agreed to accelerate the phaseout schedules 
for the substances already controlled by the Protocol. They also added phaseout requirements 
for other ozone-depleting chemicals, including methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, and 
other fully-halogenated chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). 

On November 15, 1990, then-President Bush signed the Clean Air Act Amendments 
(CAAA) of 1990. Title VI, section 604 of the amended CAA requires a phaseout of CFCs, 
halons, and carbon tetrachloride by 2000, which is identical to the London Amendments to 
the Montreal Protocol, but with more stringent interim reductions. Title VI also differs from 
the London Amendments by mandating a faster phaseout of methyl chloroform (2002 instead 
of 2005), a restriction on the use of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) after 2015, and a ban 
on the production of HCFCs after 2030. In Title VI, section 602, the CFCs, halons, carbon 
tetrachloride, and methyl chloroform are defined as class I substances; HCFCs are referred to 
as class II substances. Appendix A of this final rule lists the class I and class II substances 
identified in the CAA. 

In addition to the phaseout requirements, Title VI includes provisions to reduce 
emissions of class I and II substances to the ``lowest achievable level'' in the refrigeration 
sector and to maximize the use of recycling and recovery upon disposal (section 608). It also 
requires EPA to ban certain nonessential products containing ozone-depleting substances 
(section 610); establish standards and requirements for the servicing of motor vehicle air 
conditioners (section 609); mandate warning labels on products made with or containing 
class I or containing class II substances (section 611); and establish a safe alternatives 
program (section 612). The development and implementation of the safe alternatives program 
under section 612 is the subject of this final rule. 

In October 1991, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
announced new findings documenting ozone depletion over the last decade that was more 
severe than had previously been predicted by atmospheric modeling or measurements. In 
particular, NASA found 2.9 percent ozone depletion over the northern mid-latitudes over the 
past decade in summertime_the first time a trend showing ozone depletion had been detected 
in the U.S. during that time of year, when risks from depletion are greatest. 

Partly in response to these findings, on February 11, 1992, then-President Bush 
announced an accelerated phaseout schedule for class I substances as identified in the CAA, 
as amended, section 606. This final schedule, published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 
65018; December 10, 1993), implements a January 1, 1996 phaseout of class I chemicals. 
The President also ordered an accelerated review of substitutes that reduce damage to the 
ozone layer. The expedited phaseout schedule and the President's directive regarding 
alternatives added urgency to EPA's effort to review and list substitutes for class I and II 
substances under section 612.

In 1989, EPA organized the Stratospheric Ozone Protection Advisory Committee 
(STOPAC) in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 
U.S.C. app. section 9(c). The STOPAC consisted of members selected on the basis of their 
professional qualifications and diversity of perspectives and provided representation from 
industry, academia, federal, state, and local government agencies, non-governmental and 
environmental groups, as well as international organizations. The purpose of STOPAC was to 
provide advice to the Agency on policy and technical issues related to the protection of 
stratospheric ozone. 
In 1991, the Agency asked STOPAC members to participate in subgroups to assist in 
developing regulations under title VI of the CAA. EPA established a subgroup of the 
standing STOPAC to guide the Agency specifically on development of the safe alternatives 
program. The subgroup on safe alternatives met twice. At the first meeting in May 1991, 
subgroup members reviewed a detailed description of EPA's plans for implementing section 
612. At this meeting, there was general agreement on the need to issue a request for data to 
provide the general public with an opportunity to furnish the Agency with information on 
substitutes. The group also agreed on the need to review substitutes as quickly as possible to 
avoid any delay in industry's efforts to phase out ozone-depleting substances. 

At the second meeting of the subgroup, in July 1991, subgroup members provided 
EPA with comments on a draft of the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM), 
which was prepared in response to the conclusions of the first meeting. The comments 
focused primarily on the draft discussion of EPA's plans for implementing section 612 and 
refinements to a list of preliminary substitutes that the Agency intended to review. Based on 
comments received from the subgroup and other offices within EPA, a final ANPRM was 
prepared and published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1984). Because 
the bulk of regulatory development required under title VI has been completed, the STOPAC 
has since been disbanded. 





III. Section 612 Program 


A. Statutory Requirements 



Section 612 of the Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to develop a program for evaluating 
alternatives to ozone-depleting substances. EPA is referring to this new program as the 
Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program. The major provisions of section 612 
are: 
 Rulemaking_Section 612(c) requires EPA to promulgate rules making it 
unlawful to replace any class I or class II substance with any substitute that the 
Administrator determines may present adverse effects to human health or the 
environment where the Administrator has identified an alternative that (1) 
reduces the overall risk to human health and the environment, and (2) is 
currently or potentially available. 
 Listing of Unacceptable/Acceptable Substitutes_Section 612(c) also requires 
EPA to publish a list of the substitutes unacceptable for specific uses. EPA 
must publish a corresponding list of acceptable alternatives for specific uses. 
 Petition Process_Section 612(d) grants the right to any person to petition EPA 
to add a substance to or delete a substance from the lists published in 
accordance with section 612(c). The Agency has 90 days to grant or deny a 
petition. Where the Agency grants the petition, EPA must publish the revised 
lists within an additional 6 months. 
 90-day Notification_Section 612(e) requires EPA to require any person who 
produces a chemical substitute for a class I substance to notify the Agency not 
less than 90 days before new or existing chemicals are introduced into 
interstate commerce for significant new uses as substitutes for a class I 
substance. The producer must also provide the Agency with the producer's 
unpublished health and safety studies on such substitutes. 
 Outreach_Section 612(b)(1) states that the Administrator shall seek to 
maximize the use of federal research facilities and resources to assist users of 
class I and II substances in identifying and developing alternatives to the use of 
such substances in key commercial applications. 
 Clearinghouse_Section 612(b)(4) requires the Agency to set up a public 
clearinghouse of alternative chemicals, product substitutes, and alternative 
manufacturing processes that are available for products and manufacturing 
processes which use class I and II substances. 


B. Guiding Principles 


EPA has followed several guiding principles in developing the SNAP program: 


1. Evaluate Substitutes Within a Comparative Risk Framework 



The Agency's risk evaluation compares risks of substitutes to risks from 
continued use of ozone-depleting compounds as well as to risks 
associated with other substitutes. This evaluation considers effects due 
to ozone depletion as well as effects due to direct toxicity of substitutes. 
Other risk factors considered include effects on water and air quality, 
the potential for direct and indirect contributions to global warming, and 
occupational health and safety. Any effects found to pose a concern 
will be evaluated further to determine if controls are required. EPA 
does not believe that a numerical scheme producing a single index to 
rank all substitutes based on risks is appropriate. A strict quantitative 
index would not allow for sufficient flexibility in making appropriate 
risk management decisions that consider issues such as the quality of 
information supporting the decision, the degree of uncertainty in the 
data, the availability of other substitutes, and economic feasibility. 



2. Do Not Require That Substitutes Be Risk-Free To Be Found Acceptable 



Section 612(c) requires the Agency to publish a list of acceptable and 
unacceptable substitutes. The Agency interprets this as a mandate to 
identify substitutes that reduce risks compared to use of class I or II 
compounds or to other substitutes for class I or II substances, rather 
than a mandate to list as acceptable only those substitutes with zero 
risks. In keeping with this interpretation, the Agency believes that a 
key goal of the SNAP program is to promote the use of substitutes for 
class I and II chemicals that minimize risks to human health and the 
environment relative to other alternatives. In some cases, this approach 
may involve designating a substitute acceptable even though the 
compound may be toxic, or pose other environmental risk of some type, 
provided its use reduces overall risk to human health and the 
environment as compared to use of class I or class II substances or 
other potential substitutes.

3. Restrict Only Those Substitutes That are Significantly Worse




As a corollary to the above point, EPA does not intend to restrict a substitute 
if it poses only marginally greater risk than another substitute. Drawing 
fine distinctions concerning the acceptability of substitutes would be 
extremely difficult given the variability in how each substitute can be 
used within a specific application and the resulting uncertainties 
surrounding potential health and environmental effects. The Agency 
also does not want to intercede in the market's choice of available 
substitutes, unless a substitute has been proposed or is being used that is 
clearly more harmful to human health and the environment than other 
alternatives. 




4. Evaluate Risks by Use




Section 612 requires that substitutes be evaluated 
by use. Environmental and human health exposures can vary 
significantly depending on the particular application of a substitute. 
Thus, the risk characterizations must be designed to represent 
differences in the environmental and human health effects associated 
with diverse uses. This approach cannot, however, imply fundamental 
tradeoffs with respect to different types of risk to either the environment 
or to human health. For example, in the Agency's consideration of 
global warming as a criterion under SNAP, EPA has principally 
compared different global warming gases among themselves, as opposed 
to attempting to establish some methodology for comparing directly the 
effects of global warming and ozone depletion. 




5. Provide the Regulated Community With Information as Soon as Possible



The Agency recognizes the need to provide the regulated community 
with information on the acceptability of various substitutes as soon as 
possible. Given this need, EPA has decided to expedite the review 
process by conducting initial risk screens for the major substitutes now 
known to the Agency and to include them in this final rulemaking. 
Future determinations on the acceptability of new substitutes will be 
published in quarterly updates to the SNAP lists. 




6. Do Not Endorse Products Manufactured by Specific Companies 




While the goal of the SNAP program is to identify acceptable substitutes, the 
Agency will not issue company-specific product endorsements. In many 
cases, the Agency may base its analysis on data received on individual 
products, but the addition of a substitute to the acceptable list based on 
that analysis does not represent endorsement of that company's 
products. Generally, placement on the list merely constitutes an 
acknowledgement that a particular product made by a company has been 
found to be acceptable under SNAP. 




7. Defer to Other Environmental Regulations When Warranted



In some cases, EPA and other federal agencies have developed extensive 
regulations under other statutes or other parts of the CAA that address 
any potential cross- or inter-media transfers that may result from the use 
of alternatives to class I and II substances. For example, ceasing to use 
an ozone-depleting compound may in some cases entail increased use of 
chemicals that contribute to tropospheric air pollution. These chemicals, 
such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or hazardous air pollutants 
(HAPs), are already regulated under other sections of the CAA, and 
determinations under the SNAP program will take these existing 
regulations into account. Where necessary, the Office of Air and 
Radiation will confer with other EPA program offices or federal 
agencies to ensure that any regulatory overlap is handled efficiently. 




C. Implementation Strategy 



Implementation of the SNAP program is directed towards fulfilling the general policy 
contained in section 612 of identifying substitutes that can serve as replacements for ozone depleting substances,
evaluating their effects on human health and the environment, and 
encouraging the use of those substitutes believed to present lower overall risks relative both to 
the ozone depleting compounds being replaced and to other substitutes available for the same 
end-use. Implementation of this policy involves four key activities. The first is to develop, 
promulgate, and administer a regulatory program for identifying and evaluating substitutes. 
The second activity is to undertake a review of the existing substitutes based on criteria 
established for the program and then to publish a list of acceptable and unacceptable 
substitutes by application. The third activity is to review additional substitutes as they are 
developed to allow their timely introduction into the marketplace. The fourth is to 
aggressively disseminate information about those substitutes found to pose lower overall risk 
through a clearinghouse and outreach program. 

To expedite implementation of the SNAP program, EPA has not only developed a 
screening process for examining the alternatives, as discussed in this final rule, but has also 
completed an analysis of many key substitutes based on the criteria presented here. Section 
IX summarizes the results of this assessment. More detail on the steps leading up to this 
final rule and the implementation of the SNAP program is given below. 




1. ANPRM and Request for Data 



On January 16, 1992, EPA published in the 

Federal Register

 an Advance Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) and Request for Data (57 FR 1984). The ANPRM 
described in general terms EPA's plans for developing the SNAP program and solicited 
public comment on the Agency's planned approach. The ANPRM also included an appendix 
listing substitutes that the Agency planned to include in its initial substitute determinations. 
The ANPRM invited industry to submit information on these substitutes and to identify 
additional alternatives to be considered in the SNAP program. The Agency received 
approximately one hundred comments from industry, trade groups, and other federal agencies. 
These comments contained information on potential substitutes for ozone-depleting chemicals, 
as well as comments on the SNAP program as described in the ANPRM.

2. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on SNAP Process and Proposed 
Determinations 



On May 12, 1993 EPA published in the 

Federal Register

 a Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (NPRM) for SNAP (58 FR 28094). The NPRM described the proposed structure 
and process for administering the SNAP program and proposed determinations on the 
acceptability of key substitutes. The Notice also contained the proposed regulatory language 
that would serve as the legal basis for administering and enforcing the SNAP program. 


In the NPRM, EPA recognized that notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures were 
necessary to establish regulations governing SNAP. EPA further concluded that rulemaking 
was required to place any substance on the list of unacceptable substances, to list a substance 
as acceptable only with certain use restrictions, or to remove a substance from either the list 
of unacceptable or acceptable substitutes. EPA did not believe, however, that rulemaking 
procedures were required to list alternatives as acceptable with no restrictions. Such listings 
would not impose any sanction, nor remove any prior license to use a substance. 



3. Final Rulemaking 



This final rule promulgates the SNAP process and the first set of determinations on 
SNAP substitutes. The Agency may revise these decisions in the future as it reviews 
additional substitutes and receives more data on substitutes already covered by the program. 
However, EPA expects future changes to the SNAP lists to be minor, and thus not to 
represent an undue burden on the regulated community. The principal changes the Agency 
expects to make in the future are to add new substitutes or sectors to the lists, rather than to 
change a substitute's acceptability. Further, once a substitute has been placed on either the 
acceptable or the unacceptable list, EPA will conduct notice-and-comment rulemaking to 
subsequently remove a substitute from either list, as described below in section VII. This 
final rule also addresses comments that the Agency received on the NPRM, and incorporates 
further data on substitutes received during the comment period. 




4. Updates of SNAP Determinations 



Three mechanisms exist for revising or expanding the list of SNAP determinations 
published in this final regulation. First, under section 612(d), the Agency will review and 
either grant or deny petitions to add or delete substances from the SNAP list of acceptable or 
unacceptable alternatives. Section VIII of this final rule presents EPA's method for handling 
petitions. 

The second means of revising or expanding the list of SNAP determinations is through 
the notifications, described below, which must be submitted to EPA 90 days before 
introduction of a substitute into interstate commerce for significant new use as an alternative 
to a class I or class II substance. These 90-day notifications are required by section 612(e) of 
the CAA for producers of alternatives to class I substances for new uses and by EPA 
regulations issued under sections 114 and 301 of the Act to implement section 612(c) in all 
other cases. Section VII of this final rule discusses the Agency's approach for processing 
these notifications, including a strategy for integrating SNAP notifications with other chemical 
review programs already being implemented by EPA under authorities provided in the Toxic 
Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act 
(FIFRA). Other parts of this final rule also explain how the Agency addresses the overlap 
between SNAP regulations and regulations issued under other titles of the CAA. 


Finally, the Agency believes that section 612 authorizes it to initiate changes to the 
SNAP determinations independent of any petitions or notifications received. These 
amendments can be based on new data on either additional substitutes or on characteristics of 
substitutes previously reviewed. 



5. Outreach and Substitute Clearinghouse 




Public outreach and the substitute information clearinghouse comprise the technical 
assistance component of the SNAP program. The purpose of this effort is to provide 
information for the public to use in selecting acceptable substitutes. Sections VII.A.3.f. and 
VII.A.3.g describe the Agency's approach for establishing the clearinghouse and performing 
outreach.

D. Response to Public Comment 



A document summarizing public comment on the NPRM in greater detail is available in the public docket supporting this
final rule. The major programmatic issues raised by the commenters and the Agency's response to them are described
below. Major comments specific to the eight SNAP industry sectors are addressed in sections IX.D. through IX.K. of
this final rule. 



1. Scope of the SNAP Rule 



a. 

Class II substances. 

One commenter supported EPA's position that the Agency has the authority to review class II substances under SNAP,
particularly EPA's view that where little reduction in ozone depletion potential (ODP) can be gained in going from
a class I substance to a class II substance, such as from methyl chloroform to HCFC-141b, the substitution should
be disallowed under SNAP. Other commenters criticized this position, arguing that the omission of any reference
to class II substitutes in section 612(e) clearly indicated Congressional intent that class II substitutes not be
subject to the SNAP program. 

For this final rule, the Agency is including class II substances under the scope of SNAP. The Agency disagrees with
one commenter's interpretation of the limitation in section 612(e). Section 612(c) specifically mandates that
the Agency list unacceptable and acceptable alternatives for class I or II substances. In addition, the Agency believes
that Congressional intent under section 612 is to reduce the overall risk from the continued use of ozone depleting
substances (ODSs). The class II substances range in ozone depletion potential (ODP) from 0.11 for HCFC-141b
to 0.02 for HCFC-123. In the evaluation of substitutes completed for the NPRM, use of some class II substitutes
up to the time of their phaseout was identified as representing significantly greater overall risk than use of other
alternatives available for a number of end-uses. Consequently, the Agency believes lower overall risk to human health
and the environment can be achieved by including class II substitutes in SNAP. Despite the limitation in section 612(e)
to producers of class I substances, EPA believes it has authority under section 114 and section 301(a) to require submission
of SNAP notifications with respect to class II substances as necessary to enable EPA to carry out its obligation under
section 612 to evaluate both class I and class II substances, as explained in the NPRM. 

b. 

Review of existing versus new substitutes. 

A number of commenters believed that EPA's SNAP program has no authority to restrict existing substitutes, which
companies may have switched to in an effort to eliminate the use of CFCs prior to the publication of this final rule.
Arguments in support of this position include the prospective language of the statute, which says EPA must make it
``unlawful to replace'' an ODS with a substitute deemed unacceptable. Many of these commenters recommended grandfathering
of these existing uses, so as not to disrupt industry's transition away from ODSs. An extension of this concern appears
in several comments, in which commenters expressed the fear that SNAP will revisit prior decisions, removing substitutes
previously deemed acceptable as newer and more environmentally benign substitutes are developed. 

Under the Agency's interpretation of section 612, in order to fulfill the Congressional mandate to review ``any''
substitute substance that may present adverse effects to human health and the environment, both new and existing
substitutes must be included under SNAP. In addition, section 612(e) specifically requires notifying the Agency
before new or existing 
chemicals are introduced into interstate commerce. EPA believes that class I and II substances are ``replaced''
within the meaning of section 612(c) each time a substitute is used, so that once EPA identifies an unacceptable substitute,
any future use of such substitute is prohibited. Under any other interpretation, EPA could never effectively prohibit
the use of any substitute, as some user could always start to use it prior to EPA's completion of the rulemaking required
to list it as unacceptable. EPA believes Congress could not have intended such a result, and must therefore have intended
to cover future use of existing substitutes. 

c. 

Grandfathering in SNAP.

 Many commenters supported the idea of grandfathering uses of existing substitutes, but felt that the grandfathering
should be broadened to include existing uses of all substitutes which companies have invested in prior to the promulgation
of the SNAP final rule, and not just HCFC-141b as proposed in the NPRM. Commenters argued that not doing so would
delay transition by creating uncertainty about the useful life of alternatives. 

One commenter argued that the grandfathering scheme EPA has proposed with respect to HCFC-141b should be extended
to existing uses of perfluorocarbons (PFCs). The commenter notes that title VI calls for regulation and elimination
of ozone-depleting substances while in the commenter's opinion precluding regulation based on global warming potential.
Since PFCs have no ozone depletion potential, the commenter argued that they are a better candidate than HCFC-141b
for grandfathering. One commenter proposed two years past the date of an unacceptability determination as the general
grandfathering period.

In this final rule, the Agency will not grandfather existing uses except in specifically identified cases. The grandfathering
provisions under SNAP do give the Agency flexibility to address unacceptable listings that might disrupt industry's
transition away from ODSs. For this final rule, the Agency was not presented with significant evidence from the public
comments to believe universal grandfathering of existing substitutes is warranted. The Agency believes that given
the diversity of the industries covered under the SNAP program, a case-by-case review of applications using the banned
substitute would be necessary to protect human health and the environment. Moreover, EPA must be able to justify any
grandfathering on a case-by-case basis under the grandfathering criteria established in the Sierra Club case, as
described below in section VI.B. 

In the case of HCFC-141b, the Agency has elected to maintain the proposed grandfathering period for existing
uses, since many users switched to HCFC-141b when it was believed to offer sufficient risk reduction. In comparison,
for perfluorocarbons, the Agency has made clear from the beginning of their suggested use as substitutes that the
Agency has concerns about the global warming potential of these chemicals. EPA believes, therefore, that an extended
grandfathering period in this case is not warranted. 

However, the Agency agrees to grandfather for use, existing supplies of a substitute in the possession of an end-user
as of March 18, 1994. Therefore, persons who transitioned to a substitute for an end-use prior to this final rule may
continue use of all existing supplies of the substitute purchased prior to March 18, 1994 until that supply is exhausted.
As of the effective date of this final rule, only substitutes purchased prior to March 18, 1994 can be used. Under the
four-part test to judge the appropriateness of grandfathering (see section VI.B of this final rule), the Agency determined
that, on balance, the results of this test favors this action. 

Existing inventory of final products manufactured with or containing a substitute designated unacceptable as a
result of final EPA rule-making within an end-use covered under SNAP could theoretically be legally sold after listing.
Producers should be aware, however, that they will be effectively barred from selling a substitute for use once it
has been deemed unacceptable under SNAP, because potential purchasers will not be able to use it. After the effective
date of this final rule, users will not be able to use any additional supply of a banned substitute purchased after the
publication date of the unacceptable listing. 

d. 

Exemption for small sectors and small volume uses. 

In the NPRM, EPA proposed to exempt small volume use applications requiring less than 10,000 pounds per year of an ODS
substitute from SNAP review. This proposal generated substantial confusion. Many commenters pointed out that the
10,000 pounds exemption from reporting and review under SNAP was vague, and asked for additional clarification.
Specifically, commenters asked whether EPA intended the 10,000 pound limit to apply at the process, plant, company,
or sector level. If applied at the sector level, some commenters noted that an individual end-user might have enormous
difficulty compiling volume information related to the behavior of an entire industry sector. 

In response to these comments, EPA has decided to maintain the small use exemption but provide the needed additional
clarification of the Agency's intent. The Agency will exempt from the section 612(e) notification requirements
substitutes used in quantities of 10,000 pounds or less per year within a major industrial sector covered under SNAP.
The responsibility for reporting under the notification requirement for SNAP falls on those introducing substitutes
into interstate commerce, not on the individual end-user. Similarly, relief from reporting, if within the bounds
of the small use and sector exemption as defined, rests with the same person.

The Agency believes the burden of responsibility for determining whether use of a 
substitute will be small should reside at the same level as the notification requirement. That 
is, it should be the responsibility of the introducing agent to determine whether use of a 
particular substitute in a given sector is likely to remain below 10,000 pounds per year. The 
Agency continues to believe that focusing the listing decisions on the substitutes sold in the 
largest volumes will allow the Agency to target its regulatory efforts to those applications that 
offer the maximum risk reduction potential. 
Many commenters generally supported EPA's exemption for small industrial sectors, 
arguing that the administrative burden imposed by a SNAP review of all possible substitutions 
is unjustified by the likely risks posed by these uses. For this final rule, the Agency will 
continue to exempt small sectors and small volume uses within major industrial sectors from 
reporting responsibilities under SNAP. 
e. 

Designation of submitters/reporting responsibilities. 


Many of the public comments on the NPRM expressed general support for the 
flexibility of the reporting requirements, noting it is sensible to require notification from the 
person most suited to have the relevant information. However, some confusion has arisen as 
to the implementation and enforcement of these requirements. 
The Agency agrees with public comment that the designation of submitters or 
reporting responsibility needed clarification in this final rule. For this final rule then, 
reporting responsibility rests with the person who introduced the substitute into interstate 
commerce in its final form. As such, the producer could potentially be a manufacturer, 
formulator, or an end-user. Identification of designated submitters is further detailed in 
section IV.B. 
f. 

Exemption for second-generation substitutes. 


Many commenters supported EPA's exemption for second-generation substitutes. 
However, several asked for clarification of regulatory language setting out this exemption. 
They note that the definition left plenty of room for advances in the science to calculate 
increasingly small contributions to ozone depletion added by hitherto unsuspected compounds, 
thereby constantly broadening the scope of SNAP as new concerns develop. They ask that 
EPA clarify that SNAP should only apply to substitutes for class I or class II compounds. 
EPA agrees with these comments and has clarified in section IV.A.2.f. that the 
definition of second-generation applies only to substitutes for class I or class II compounds in 
this final rule. 


2. SNAP Determination and Listing Process 


a. 

Allowing for assured minimum periods of use. 


Numerous commenters expressed a need for a minimum assured time period of use for 
acceptable substitutes in order to facilitate the fastest possible transition away from class I 
substances. Some commenters suggested that this assured minimum period should be 
established based on some economic measure, such as the lifetime of equipment in which the 
compound is to be used, or the overall payback period for investment in modifications to 
allow the use of a transitional compound. One commenter suggested the use of risk analysis 
to define the assured minimum period. Other commenters suggested 10 years as the 
appropriate period. 
The Agency believes Congress enacted provisions under section 612 which make a 
minimum assured time period for use of a substitute neither authorized nor necessary under 
SNAP. As described in section VIII of this final rule, a petition under section 612(d) to 
change a listing from acceptable to unacceptable or vice versa must include adequate data. In 
addition, any change will be formally promulgated as a rulemaking, which requires EPA to 
propose, take public comment, and complete final action for any decision. If the decision is 
made to change a listing for a substitute from acceptable to unacceptable, the grandfathering 
provisions of this final rule provide the Agency with the flexibility in appropriate cases to 
provide time after a substitute is removed from the list of acceptable substitutes to allow 
persons who are then using the substance, or who have expended considerable efforts in good 
faith toward its use, to find a different substitute and recover their investment in prior 
substitutes. 


3. SNAP Information Form 


a. 

Use of global warming potential. 


Some commenters argue that EPA has no legal authority under section 612 to regulate 
substitutes based on global warming. One commenter noted that during the development of 
title VI, Congress deliberately excised global warming from the statute, and that legislative 
history of title VI thus argues against reliance on global warming as a regulatory criterion 
under SNAP. Finally, a commenter asserted that not only the Congress, but the President also 
believes that ozone depletion and global warming should be treated separately.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940318-0-00118 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940318-0-00023 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Agency believes that the Congressional mandate to evaluate substitutes based on 
reducing overall risk to human health and the environment authorizes use of global warming 
as one of the SNAP evaluation criteria. Public comment failed to identify any definition of 
overall risk that warranted excluding global warming. Further, in October 1993, the President 
directed EPA through the Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP) to use its authority under 
section 612 of the Clean Air Act to narrow the uses allowed for hydrofluorocarbons and 
perfluorocarbons with high global warming potential. 
EPA disagrees with the statutory and legislative history arguments raised by the 
commenter. The commenter points to language that relates only to the listing of ozone 
depleting and global warming substances, which is not relevant to EPA's authority under 
section 612(c) to regulate substitutes based on an assessment of overall risk. The fact that 
Congress may have deleted authority for EPA to phase out use of substances based solely on 
their global warming potential without regard to available substitutes certainly imposes no 
limitation on consideration of global warming potential as a factor in assessing the overall 
risk of using any class I or II substitute. Especially in light of President Clinton's recent 
commitment to use section 612 authority specifically to narrow uses of high global warming 
potential CFC substitutes based on an overall risk assessment, EPA has concluded that it is 
appropriate to consider global warming potential as one factor in the SNAP analysis. 
Therefore, in this final rule, the Agency will continue to exercise its statutory authority to 
review substitutes for listing as unacceptable or acceptable alternatives, using the criteria for 
evaluation set out in the NPRM, including global warming. 


4. Definitions 


a. 

Definition of potentially available. 


Several commenters supported EPA's definition of potentially available because it 
would speed the review process and encourage innovation in development of new substitutes. 
Other commenters expressed the concern that EPA's definition of ``potentially available'' 
could allow EPA to review and accept a substitute which may be several years from general 
commercial availability, and on that basis to ban some other commonly used chemical with 
relatively higher risk. These commenters argued that EPA should at least wait until test 
marketing has begun to consider an alternative ``potentially available'' for the purpose of 
SNAP review. Another commenter argued that a knowledge of the economic viability of a 
substitute is crucial in assessing its potential availability as a substitute under SNAP. 
Under section 612(c) of the CAA, the Agency is specifically required to identify 
alternatives that are either ``currently or potentially available.'' For this final rule, the Agency 
is defining as potentially available any alternative for which adequate health, safety, and 
environmental data, as required for the SNAP notification process, exist to make a 
determination of acceptability, and which the Agency reasonably believes to be technically 
feasible, even if not all testing has yet been completed and the alternative is not yet produced 
or sold. EPA would not prohibit use of a substitute where no substitute that reduces overall 
risk is currently available, to avoid situations where the only available substitute to allow 
transition away from ozone-depleting compounds is unacceptable under SNAP. 
b. 

Definition of a substitute. 


Several commenters expressed support for EPA's definition of a substitute as used in 
the NPRM. One commenter proposed the use of the word ``alternative'' instead of 
``substitute,'' while supporting the Agency's general construction of the statute to allow 
SNAP's purview to extend beyond chemical substitutes to a broader range of alternative 
technologies, including process changes. Another commenter, while also generally supporting 
EPA's definition of a substitute, pointed out that the language ``could replace'' is overly broad. 
This commenter noted that this language suggests that someone who is not using a compound 
as an ODS replacement, but is aware that it could be used in this way, should report to EPA 
under SNAP. 
For the purpose of this final rule the Agency is using the word ``substitute'' as a 
synonym for alternative. As discussed in section IV.A, this definition includes chemical 
substitutes, alternative manufacturing processes, and alternative technologies. In response to 
the public comment described above, the Agency has also clarified in this final rule that 
SNAP addresses only those substitutes or alternatives actually replacing the class I and II 
compounds listed under section 602 of the CAA within the eight industrial sectors identified 
in sections IX.D. through K. 


5. General Comments on Substitutes 


a. 

Perfluorocarbons. 


Under the NPRM for SNAP, EPA proposed perfluorocarbons (PFCs) as acceptable for 
limited use as replacements for ozone depleting chemicals in the solvent cleaning, and fire 
suppression and explosion protection sectors. Several commenters supported the Agency's 
cautious approach toward PFCs, given the high global warming potential of these compounds 
as well as their extreme atmospheric persistence. Other commenters sought clarification with 
respect to the scope of the Agency's proposed restrictions on PFCs. 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940318-0-00119 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940318-0-00023 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

PFCs are fully fluorinated compounds, unlike CFCs, HCFCs, or hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs). These chemicals are nonflammable, have low toxicity, are exempt from federal VOC 
regulations, and do not contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion. The environmental 
characteristics of concern for these compounds are high global warming potential (5,000-10,000 times greater
than CO

2

) and long atmospheric lifetimes (3,000-5,000 years). Although 
the actual contributions to global warming depend upon the quantities emitted, because of 
their long atmospheric lifetimes, the warming effects of PFCs are essentially irreversible. 


In the proposed rule, EPA identified specific solvent cleaning applications for which 
PFCs were acceptable. In response to public comment seeking clarification of these 
limitations, EPA is finding PFC use acceptable in electronics and precision cleaning for only 
high-performance, precision-engineered applications where no other substitute for CFC-113 or 
MCF would meet performance or safety requirements. Additional detail on PFC use in the 
solvent cleaning sector can be found in section IX.F. 

In this final rule, EPA has also clarified the limitations placed in its proposed rule on 
the use of PFCs to replace halons. PFC-410 (C

4

F

10

) and PFC-614 (C

6

F

14

) will be limited to 
fire suppression and explosion protection applications where other alternatives are not 
technically feasible to meet safety or performance requirements due to the physical or 
chemical properties of the agent, or where human exposure to the extinguishing agent may 
approach cardiosensitization levels or result in other unacceptable health effects under normal 
operating conditions. Additional detail on PFC use in the fire suppression and explosion 
protection sector can be found in section IX.G. 

Before replacing ozone-depleting compounds with PFCs, users must first investigate 
whether other alternatives would meet performance or safety standards. This may include 
contacting vendors or testing using other substitutes and equipment. Although special forms 
or reporting to EPA is not required, companies must maintain documentation of the review of 
alternatives on file. Where users must rely on PFCs for lack of other options, they should 
make every effort to adopt closed systems and recover, recycle and destroy the chemicals 
where possible. EPA also encourages PFC users to reduce emissions to a minimum through 
conservation practices that address idling losses and operator variables. Above all, PFC users 
should continue the search for long-term alternatives. 



IV. Scope of Coverage 



A. Definition of Substitute 



1. Statutory Language 



Based on the language of section 612(a) of the CAA, the Agency defines within the 
SNAP program a ``substitute'' as any chemical, product substitute, or alternative manufacturing 
process, existing or new, that could replace a class I or II substance. While subsequent 
subsections of section 612 refer only to ``substitute substances'' or ``substitute chemicals,'' EPA 
interprets these provisions for purposes of the SNAP program as incorporating the general 
definition of substitute presented in section 612(a). The Agency believes that this definition is 
consistent with the overall intent of section 612 and is necessary to enable EPA to identify 
and analyze the universe of substitutes for class I and II substances. 

Section 612(c) prohibits users from replacing class I or II substances with any 
substitute substance which the Administrator determines may present adverse effects to human 
health and the environment, where the Administrator has identified an alternative to such 
replacement that: (1) Reduces overall risk to human health and the environment, and (2) is 
currently or potentially available. EPA believes that in addition to authorizing the Agency to 
ban the use of a given substitute substance where other alternatives exist, section 612 confers 
the legal authority to allow the use of a substance only with certain restrictions_conditions of 
use or narrowed use limits_while banning its use otherwise. This authority is inherent in the 
Administrator's authority to totally ban use of the substitute where other acceptable 
alternatives exist that reduce overall risk. EPA only intends to use this authority where a 
viable substitute exists that would otherwise have to be disallowed because of risk associated 
with its uncontrolled use. 

a. 

Use conditions. 


In imposing conditions on use, EPA does not intend to preempt other regulatory 
authorities, such as those exercised by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) or other government or industrial standard-setting bodies. Rather, EPA hopes to fill 
existing regulatory gaps during the interim period of substitution away from ozone-depleting 
compounds and provide the needed margin of protection to human health and the environment 
until other regulatory controls or standards are developed under appropriate authorities. 

EPA anticipates applying use conditions only in the rare instances where clear 
regulatory gaps exist, and where an unreasonable risk would exist in the absence of any 
condition. These restrictions will remain in place only until the appropriate standard-setting 
agency acts. Where appropriate, EPA's use conditions will terminate by their own terms once 
the appropriate standard-setting Agency takes action. The mechanism for informing the 
public of this change will be the quarterly 

Federal Register

 notices updating the status of the 
SNAP lists. These are discussed further in Section VII.A below. 

b. 

Narrowed use limits. 


In imposing narrowed use limits, the Agency has sought to expand the list of 
alternatives available to all applications within a sector end-use category. EPA recognizes 
that certain sector end-uses encompass a broad range of applications, manufacturing 
processes, and products. Where EPA narrows uses, a substitute will be acceptable for use 
only in certain applications, as where other alternatives are not technically feasible due to 
performance or safety requirements. Conditions on use discussed in section IV.A.1.a. above 
refer to how (under what operating conditions) an otherwise unacceptable substitute may be 
used; narrowed use limits define where (in which end-uses and applications) an otherwise 
unacceptable substitute may be used. 

c. 

Potentially available. 


Section 612(e) makes clear that a chemical can be a substitute whether it is existing or 
new. Also, the language in section 612(c) clearly states that a new substitute may be 
currently or potentially available. In this final rule, the Agency is defining as potentially 
available any alternative for which adequate information exists to make a determination of 
acceptability, and which the Agency reasonably believes to be technically feasible, even if not 
all testing has yet been completed and the substitute is not yet produced and sold. 



2. Additional Clarification

EPA believes that the statutory language included in section 612 is written broadly to 
allow for a reasonably comprehensive evaluation of substitutes that will be introduced as 
replacements for ozone-depleting chemicals. However, additional clarification is presented 
below to further explain the Agency's definition of a ``substitute'' in specific circumstances 
based on section 612. 

a. 

Chemicals already listed under TSCA. 


Section 612(e) explicitly requires producers of chemicals, both new and existing, to 
notify the Agency before introducing such chemicals into interstate commerce for significant 
new uses as class I alternatives. In addition, section 612(c) requires the Agency to produce 
lists of acceptable and unacceptable substitutes, without regard to the status of each chemical 
alternative, whether new or existing. 

These interrelated provisions of section 612 serve as the basis for the Agency's belief 
that all substitutes, whether ``new or existing'' chemicals, should be subject to SNAP review. 
This regulatory purview would thus necessarily extend to those chemicals already listed on 
the TSCA inventory of existing chemicals. EPA believes SNAP review is critical for such 
chemicals given the differing statutory objectives of TSCA and the CAA, and the new and 
expanded applications of many existing chemicals as class I and II replacements, which could 
alter existing release and exposure profiles. 

b. 

Significant new use of existing alternatives. 


There has also been some question regarding whether an existing alternative already 
being sold commercially within a SNAP sector (e.g., use of semi-aqueous cleaners in the 
electronics industry) would be subject to review under section 612. The Agency believes that 
it should be subject to review under SNAP. Because of the phaseout, uses of existing 
substitutes can reasonably be expected to increase significantly beyond current consumption, 
which could translate into greater releases and risks from use of a substitute. Existing 
substitutes are therefore subject to SNAP review because EPA believes that their use can be 
expected to significantly expand to new users or product lines. Users should note that the 
SNAP determinations discussed in section IX of this final rule demonstrate that with few 
exceptions, all substitutes already on the market meet the conditions for acceptability under 
the SNAP program. 

c. 

Authority to review substitutes for class II compounds. 


Section 612(c) authorizes the Administrator to prohibit the use of substitutes for class 
II, as well as class I substances, and requires the Agency to compile lists of substitutes for 
class II as well as class I compounds upon making the requisite findings. EPA believes that 
this is in part because of the considerable overlap in sectors that use class I and II substances. 
More importantly, this mirrors the statute's general emphasis on moving away from class I 
compounds in a way that does not create new and unintended environmental problems. 
Clearly, for the same reasons class I substitutes require review under the SNAP program, 
class II substitutes should also be reviewed. 

To obtain the data necessary to analyze class II substitutes, the Agency is using 
statutory authority provided in sections 114 and 301 of the CAA in conjunction with 612(c). 
As explained in the NPRM, these sections, when read together, authorize the Administrator to 
promulgate such regulations as needed to require companies to provide information EPA may 
reasonably need to identify acceptable and unacceptable substitutes for class II substances. 
EPA is exercising this authority to subject class I and II substitutes to the same information 
reporting requirements and listing process. 

d. 

Designation of class I and II chemicals as substitutes. 


EPA believes that review authority under section 612 extends also to use of class I 
and II chemicals as substitutes, even though these chemicals are subject to the phaseout 
provisions of the CAA. While one comment received by the Agency in response to the 
NPRM questions EPA's authority under section 612 to review class I and II chemicals as 
substitutes (e.g., methyl chloroform used to replace CFC-113), it is clear that these 
compounds can be used as substitutes for other class I and II substances in certain 
applications. Since section 612 authority extends to ``any'' substitutes, both class I and II 
substances are subject to review under the SNAP program just as any other substitute. Given 
the potential for the class I and II chemicals used as substitutes for other ozone-depleting 
chemicals to continue depleting stratospheric ozone and thus affect human health and the 
environment, a close examination of these alternatives in the context of both their effect on 
the environment and the availability of other substitutes for particular uses is especially 
warranted under section 612. 

e. 

Alternative products and manufacturing processes. 

EPA believes that section 612(c) broadly charges EPA to identify alternatives to 
ozone-depleting substances. For example, EPA believes that alternative products can include 
no-clean fluxes in electronics manufacturing processes that currently use class I or II 
compounds as cleaning solvents. EPA believes it appropriate to consider substitute processes 
and products for review under the SNAP program, since many of these alternatives are viable 
substitutes and could reduce overall risks to human health and the environment. EPA 
believes that such alternative products and processes, therefore, fall within the definition of 
substitutes under section 612. 

Similarly, new production techniques and/or processing equipment are important 
developments that can minimize environmental releases. Accordingly, alternative 
manufacturing processes will also be examined under section 612 in the context of use and 
emissions of substitutes. EPA believes that section 612's reference to ``alternative,'' instead of 
``alternative substance,'' or ``alternative chemical,'' implies a statutory intent that ``alternative'' 
be read broadly. This furthers the statutory desire to shift use to alternatives that reduce 
overall risk.

<TEXT>
 

EPA will encourage, where appropriate, alternative processes and technologies that reduce environmental and human
health effects. In many applications, reliance on alternative processes and/or equipment may be associated with
the use of particular substitute chemicals. In these instances, EPA encourages the filing of joint submissions where
information is provided by both the chemical manufacturer and, for example, an equipment manufacturer whose equipment
makes use of such a substitute. Such joint filings will provide the most comprehensive data on an alternative and its
effect on human health and the environment.

f. 

Second-generation substitutes.

 A key issue is whether there exists a point at which an alternative should no longer be considered a class I or II substitute
as defined by section 612. The Agency believes that as long as class I or II chemicals are being used, any substitute
designed to replace these chemicals is subject to review under section 612. In this final rule, the Agency has determined
that second-generation replacements, if they are non-ozone depleting and are replacing non-ozone depleting first-generation
alternatives, are exempt from reporting requirements under section 612. Other regulatory programs (e.g., other
sections of the CAA, or section 6 of TSCA) exist to ensure protection of human health and the environment in these situations.

Where second-generation substitutes replace first-generation substitutes that are themselves ozone-depleters
(e.g., HCFCs), these second-generation substitutes are bound by the same notification and review requirements
under section 612 as first-generation substitutes to ozone-depleting chemicals. For example, if a hydrofluorocarbon
(HFC) is introduced as a first-generation refrigerant substitute for either a class I (e.g., CFC-12) or class
II chemical (e.g., HCFC-22), it is subject to review and listing under section 612. Future substitutions to
replace the HFC would then be exempt from reporting under section 612 because the first-generation alternative did
not deplete stratospheric ozone. If, however, a class I or class II chemical is used as a first-generation substitute
(e.g., use of HCFC-141b as a transitional replacement in foam blowing), the second-generation substitute
is still subject to review under section 612 because it is replacing a class I or class II chemical.

The key to determining whether a substitute is exempt or not as a second-generation substitute is, as discussed above,
what it is designed to replace. For example, SNAP reviews are not meant to cover cases in which a technology is designed
for use primarily in replacing existing non-ozone depleting evaporative cooling systems. In general, if most intended
uses for a possible substitute are to replace a non-OD substitute for a class I or class II substance, then this substance
would therefore be a second-generation substitute, and SNAP review is unlikely to be required. In those situations
where class I or class II substitutes have already been replaced in most applications, the small use exemption could
also eliminate the need for review of next generation substitutes.

g. 

Applicability to existing uses.

 The prohibition on use of an alternative applies only to substitutions to unacceptable substitutes made after the
effective date of any final rulemaking for unacceptability. However, for this final rule, any person who has transitioned
to a substitute for an end-use prior to any SNAP final rulemaking designating it as unacceptable may continue to use
the substitute until their existing supply of the chemical, as of March 18, 1994, is depleted.

Existing inventory of final products manufactured with or containing a substitute designated unacceptable as a
result of final EPA rule-making within an end-use covered under SNAP could theoretically be legally sold after listing.
Producers should be aware, however, that they will be effectively barred from selling a substitute for use once it
has been deemed unacceptable under SNAP, because potential purchasers will not be able to use it. After the effective
date of this final rule, users will not be able to use any additional supply of a banned substitute purchased after the
publication date of the unacceptable listing.

h. 

Substitutes produced outside of the United States.

 Companies manufacturing substitutes outside the U.S. who are producing solely for use by entities outside the U.S.
are not subject to the requirements of these section 612 rules. EPA believes that its authority under section 612 extends
only to use of substitutes in areas under the jurisdiction of the United States government. This principle does not
apply to substitutes introduced as replacements for class I and II chemicals at offshore U.S. installations (e.g.,
U.S. military bases located in foreign countries) that are subject to the legal provisions of section 612.

Substitutes manufactured within the U.S. exclusively for export are subject to SNAP since the definition of use in
the rule includes use in the manufacturing process, which occurs within the United States.



B. Who Must Report



1. General Provisions



As required by section 612(e), anyone who produces a substitute for a class I substance must provide the Agency with
that person's unpublished health and safety studies on the substitute, as well as notify the Agency at least 90 days
before introducing the substitute into interstate commerce for significant new use as an alternative. Also, as discussed
in section IV.A.2.c. of this final rule, pursuant to sections 114, 301 and 612(c) of the CAA, producers of class II substitutes
must abide by the same reporting requirements. Under the authority of sections 114, 301(a) and 612(c), EPA has determined
that in certain cases, formulators or end-users of substitutes could be considered to be producers and would therefore
be subject to reporting requirements. This approach is discussed below, in section IV.B.2. To analyze substitutes
under section 612(c), the Agency finds it necessary under section 301(a) to require that any person who introduces
a substitute in its final form into interstate commerce be considered to be a producer of the substitute and required
to submit information describing the substitute under section 114. With respect to substitutes for both class I and
II substances, EPA needs all of the types of information described below, not just health and safety studies. Such
data are needed to allow EPA to fully analyze the overall risks to human health and the environment presented by alternative
substitutes, as required by section 612(c).

2. Designated Submitters



Several commenters requested clarification on who has primary responsibility to notify EPA under SNAP. EPA recognizes
that a potential substitute can be developed for introduction into one of the SNAP sectors at several points in the
manufacture-to-use chain. EPA considers responsibility for notification under SNAP to reside with the person who
first introduces a substitute not otherwise exempted from reporting requirements into interstate commerce. Therefore,
for example, if a chemical manufacturer introduces a substitute into interstate commerce for sale as a fire extinguishing
agent to replace an ODS-based extinguishing method, the manufacturer is a designated submitter under SNAP. If a system
manufacturer or a chemical formulator buys an agent from a chemical manufacturer and subsequently formulates or
engineers it for introduction into interstate commerce as a substitute for an ozone-depleting means of fire suppression,
then in this case, the system manufacturer or formulator is the designated submitter. If an end-user develops a proprietary
blend or means of fire suppression using chemical or physical inputs purchased from manufacturers or formulators
and then enters that product into interstate commerce as a replacement for ozone-depleting means of fire suppression,
then the end-user is in this case the designated submitter.

a. 

Chemical manufacturers.

 Chemical manufacturers producing a substitute in its final form are required to notify the Agency of the existence
of that substitute. For instance, if a chemical manufacturer intends to market a new chemical as a substitute foam
blowing agent to companies that manufacture insulation products, the chemical manufacturer would be required to
notify the Agency about the existence of the substitute.

b. 

Formulators.

 A formulator is engaged in the preparation or formulation of a substitute, after chemical manufacture of the substitute
or its components, for distribution or use in commerce. Formulators usually only sell substitutes based on existing
chemicals, since they do not ordinarily possess chemical manufacturing capabilities. Chemicals used in such substitutes
are frequently in common use and have already been accepted for general use through other chemical review programs
such as under TSCA or FIFRA.

However, to the extent that these formulators can be considered to be directly responsible for production of the substitute
for an end-use, for example by offering a tailored formulation for an industrial cleaning process, these formulators
would be subject to reporting requirements as outlined in this final rule. In such cases, the formulator is best suited
in the manufacture-to-use chain to present information on how substitutes based on existing chemicals are or could
be used. In cases where the manufacturer of a chemical is also the formulator of a blend, the manufacturer would be responsible
for meeting reporting requirements on the substitute.

The Agency does not foresee a situation where any person who simply re-packages a substitute, i.e. does not in any way
alter the chemical or physical characteristics of the substitute, would be the designated submitter. However, if
the act of re-packaging a product is intended solely to allow for the introduction of a substitute into interstate
commerce, that person would be the designated submitter under SNAP.

c. 

End-users.

 In general, end-users of substitutes will not be obligated to meet the reporting requirements discussed in this final
rule, except in rare cases where the end-user and the producer of the substitute for commercial introduction in final
form are the same person. While the Agency expects that this situation will occur infrequently, several large companies
have developed substitutes for their own use and subsequently have notified EPA of their intent to offer those substitutes
for commercial sale. Because EPA intends to require end-users to report only on those substitutes they plan to introduce
into interstate commerce, evaluating and listing such substitutes will not stifle research and development innovations
by end-users.



3. Exemptions From Reporting



The Agency has identified several situations in which notification under the provisions of section 612 will not be
required. These exemptions from reporting are discussed below.

a. 

Substitutes already listed by EPA.

 As part of this final rule, the Agency has already completed the review of numerous class I and II alternatives and has
determined that these substitutes are either acceptable or unacceptable. In preparing these determinations, the
Agency evaluated information either on file or supplied in response to the NPRM published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 12, 1993. The substitutes list and supporting risk screens are described in more detail in section IX. No further
submission is needed for any of those substitutes already listed as acceptable or unacceptable in this final rule.
However, further information may be required for those substitutes listed as pending review in appendix B.

b. 

Small sectors.

 Most ozone-depleting substances have been or are currently used in large industrial sectors such as refrigeration
and air conditioning or foam blowing. However, there are also numerous small uses of class I or II substances that fall
outside of these major use sectors. While small use applications for class I and II compounds are varied and numerous,
in the aggregate these small uses do not contribute substantially to ozone depletion. The Agency estimates that across
all sectors these varied but small sector uses comprise in aggregate at most seven percent of total U.S. consumption
of ozone-depleting substances. For more detail on the Agency's analysis and rationale for exempting small sectors,
readers should refer to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for SNAP (58 FR 28094) published May 12, 1993.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940318-0-00123 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940318-0-00023 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Accordingly, eight major industrial use sectors are covered in this final rule. They are refrigeration and air conditioning,
foam blowing, fire suppression and explosion protection, solvents cleaning, adhesives, coatings, and inks, aerosols,
sterilization and tobacco expansion. Analysis of substitutes in a ninth sector, pesticides, will be completed,
and the resulting decisions will be added to future SNAP determinations published in the 

Federal Register

 as part of EPA's quarterly updates to the lists of acceptable and unacceptable substitutes. EPA does not plan to add
sectors other than the nine principal sectors listed above to the formal analyses performed under SNAP, unless the
Agency receives additional data indicating that inclusion of additional sectors is warranted based on the potential
for high risks to human health and the environment due to class I and II alternatives.

c. 

Small volume use within SNAP sectors.

 As noted above, most ozone-depleting substances have been or are currently used in large industrial sectors such
as refrigeration or fire extinguishing. However, even within these sectors, the potential for adverse effects on
human health and the environment is related to the aggregate amount of ozone-depleting material consumed in an end-use.
Thus, the Agency is focusing the SNAP determinations on large-volume uses in the major industrial sectors. Given
the breadth of EPA's required overall risk assessment, the imposition on small volume uses within any sector of a requirement
for a full SNAP submission seems unjustified by the potential for risk posed by these small uses.

Moreover, a key policy interest in the SNAP program is promoting the quickest possible shift from the ODSs into alternatives
posing lower overall risk. The speed and orderliness of this shift depends in part on clear early determinations from
EPA on the acceptability of key substitutes. Focusing the SNAP program on all possible substitutes in every conceivable
use could diminish EPA's ability to provide an early and clear message on those substitutes which can contribute most
to solving the problem of general reliance on ozone-depleting chemicals.

Further, the small volume use exemption is an exemption from the notification requirement only. It does not, for example,
authorize the use in any quantity of a substitute otherwise deemed unacceptable under SNAP. Since the responsibility
for meeting the notification requirement resides with the person introducing the substitute into interstate commerce,
whether manufacturer, formulator, or end-user, this person is also responsible for ascertaining whether annual
use of the substitute in its intended sector will exceed 10,000 pounds per year.

Thus, those introducing substitutes for ozone-depleting compounds in annual quantities of 10,000 pounds per year
or less for any given major industrial sector identified in this rule need not notify EPA of their activities under
SNAP. The exemption applies regardless of whether the Agency is notified for the same substitute for any conceivable
application in the other major sectors covered under SNAP, or whether the introducer's total sales are 10,000 pounds
or less for any or all of the other major SNAP sectors.

Those taking advantage of the exemption for small uses must maintain documentation describing the basis for their
view that any substitute being used meets this small use definition. This documentation must include annual production
and sales information by sector, and could be necessary in the event the Agency receives a petition to add such substitutes
to its evaluations under SNAP, or to assure adequate enforcement of the notification requirement.

d. 

Research and development.

 Substitutes manufactured or imported solely for research and development are exempt from reporting requirements
under section 612. Several commenters, including Federal agencies involved in research on CFC-related substitutes,
support this exemption. Amounts used in research are assumed to be the minimum necessary for reasonable scientific
experimentation. For new chemicals, the provisions of 720.36 of the PMN rule (40 CFR part 720) are in effect.

<PARENT> FR940318-0-00023 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

e. 

Test marketing. 

Use of alternatives for the sole purpose of test marketing is exempt from any reporting requirements under section
612. Persons taking advantage of this exemption, are, however, required to notify the Agency in writing that they
are conducting test marketing prior to the commencement of sale into interstate commerce. Notification must be sent
30 days prior to the test marketing period, and must include the name of the substitute used, the volume used in the test
marketing, and the expected duration of the test marketing. Once a company decides to sell an alternative as a class
I or II substitute, it must provide the Agency with formal notification at least 90 days prior to the introduction of
the substitute into interstate commerce for significant new use as a substitute for a class I or II chemical.

For new substitute chemicals that are being test marketed, the producer must abide by the provisions of section 5(h)(1)
of TSCA, which authorizes the EPA, upon application, to grant exemptions from TSCA-reporting requirements, provided
that test marketing will not present an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment.

f. 

Formulation changes.

 In general, the Agency believes that changes in formulation needed to accommodate replacement of class I and II compounds
should not be subject to the provisions of section 612. Such changes may be necessary, for example, when a new blowing
agent in foam manufacture necessitates the replacement of the catalyst formerly used with the class I blowing agent.
The Agency believes that other regulatory mechanisms (e.g., TSCA) are available for examining and controlling,
as needed, any adverse environmental and human health effects associated with subsequent formulation modifications.
However, the manufacturer overseeing the formulation change is required to notify the Agency if these modifications
may significantly influence the environmental and human health risk characteristics associated with the class
I or II substitute. Also, the Agency reserves the right to exercise its discretion to examine formulation changes
if a problem appears to exist.

g. 

Substitutes used as feedstock.

 Commenters to the NPRM supported the Agency's proposal to exempt substitutes that could replace class I chemicals
used solely as intermediates in the production of other chemicals. To the extent that any feedstock substitutions
occur, the Agency believes that they will not contribute substantially to any incremental risk to human health and
the environment. This is because intermediates are used as inputs in production of other compounds, and as a result
are largely consumed in the chemical manufacturing process.



V. Information Submission



A. 

Overview



To develop the list of unacceptable and acceptable substitutes for various end-uses as required by section 612(c),
the Agency must assess and compare the ``overall risks to human health and the environment'' posed by use of substitutes,
and this assessment must be performed in the context of particular applications. To conduct this overall examination,
the Agency must consider a wide range of health and environmental factors. In order to reduce the burden on the regulated
community, the Agency will defer to data collection requirements under other regulatory authorities to the maximum
extent practicable. In the section that follows, the Agency presents information required by the SNAP program to
evaluate class I and II substitutes. A copy of the SNAP Information Notice can be obtained from the SNAP program at the
address listed in the beginning of this final rule.



B. Information Required



1. Name and Description of the Substitute



A chemical substitute should be identified by its chemical name, trade name(s), identification numbers (e.g. Chemical
Abstract Service (CAS) registry), chemical formula and chemical structure. If a substitute is a blend, the percentage
of each component must also be provided. Alternative technologies or manufacturing processes should be described
in sufficient detail as to uniquely identify its use as a class I and II substitute.



2. Physical and Chemical Information



Key properties needed to characterize chemical substitutes include: molecular weight; physical state; melting
point; boiling point; density; odor threshold; solubility; partition coefficients (Log K

ow

, Log K

oc

); and vapor pressure. For alternative technologies or manufacturing processes, technical details on health, environmental
or safety issues associated with use should be provided.



3. Substitute Applications



Identification of the end-use in which the substitute is likely to be used is required. It is essential to provide a
complete list of potential end-uses and of applications within those end-uses because section 612(c) requires the
Agency to list substitutes by specific uses.



4. Process Description



For each identified end-use application, the Agency requires descriptive data on processing, including in-place
pollution controls. Such information will be used to characterize workplace and environmental releases and exposures.




5. Ozone Depletion Potential



The predicted 100-year ozone depletion potential (ODP) of substitute chemicals relative to CFC-11 is required.
The submitter should also provide sufficient supporting documentation_either a citation or the background information
used to develop the ODP. For purposes of calculating ODP, the Agency recommends the methodology used in the most recent


Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion: 1991,

 which was prepared for the United Nations Environment Programme. (1)

<PARENT> FR940318-0-00023 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

6. Global Warming Potential



The Agency requires data on the potential total global warming of the substitute in its particular end-use (e.g.,
as a refrigerant, foam blowing agent, etc.). The total global warming considers both direct and indirect impacts.
Direct impacts refer to the direct contribution to global warming of using a substitute. Calculation of the global
warming potential (GWP) index for a 100, 500, and 1000 year time horizon, as well as the atmospheric lifetime and infrared
adsorption spectrum of the substitute used to calculate the GWP is required. The Agency is requesting that all GWPs
be referenced to CO

2

 using the methodology recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel 
for Climate Change (IPCC).(2) Indirect impacts explicitly consider the effect on global warming arising from changes
in energy consumption associated with the use of a substitute (e.g., an alternative refrigerant). This latter measure
can be identified as changes in energy efficiency resulting from use of the substitute relative to that of the substance
being replaced. 




7. Toxicity Data




To assess the overall risks to human health and the environment, information is required on the acute and chronic toxicity
of a substitute chemical, its impurities, and its degradation products on any organism (e.g., humans and other mammals,
fish, wildlife, and plants). To characterize the risk to humans, the Agency is requesting a minimum submission of
the following mammalian tests: A rangefinding study that considers the appropriate exposure pathway for the specific
use (e.g. inhalation, oral, etc), and a 90-day subchronic repeated dose study in an appropriate rodent species (e.g.
rats or mice). For some substitutes, a cardiotoxicity study, usually measuring cardiotoxic effects in the dog, is
also required. Additional mammalian toxicity tests will be identified by EPA on a case-by-case basis depending on
the particular substitute and application being evaluated. To characterize aquatic toxicity, both acute and chronic
toxicity data for a variety of species are required. The Agency requires a minimum aquatic data set to be submitted
as described in ``Guidelines for Deriving Numerical National Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Aquatic
Organisms and Their Uses,'' which is available through the National Technical Information Service (

#

PB 85-227049). All toxicity data in the submitter's possession and any other available hazard information,
including Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), must also be submitted. Submission of the actual toxicity studies
is recommended; however, it is not necessary to submit these reports if they have been supplied to the Agency as part
of other regulatory submissions. If studies are not submitted, however, the submitter must provide sufficiently
clear references that the Agency can locate the studies without delay. As 
discussed below in section V.C.3., data concerning the objectives, methodology, results or significance of any
toxicity, metabolism, translocation, or persistence test for a substitute and its degradation products cannot
be held as CBI where such data are also submitted under TSCA and FIFRA to the extent that confidential treatment is prohibited
under those statutes. Submitters providing information on new chemicals for joint review under the TSCA and SNAP
programs may be required to supply additional toxicity data under TSCA section 5.

8. Environmental Fate and Transport 



Where available, EPA requests information on the environmental fate and transport of substitutes. Such data shall
include information on bioaccumulation, biodegradation, adsorption, volatility, transformation, and other
data necessary to characterize a substitute's movement and reaction in the environment. 




9. Flammability



Data on the flammability of a substitute chemical or mixture is required. Specifically, the flash point and flammability
limits are needed, as well as information on the procedures used for determining the flammability limits. Testing
of blends should identify the compositions at which the blend itself is flammable, and the changes in the composition
of the blend during various leak scenarios. For substitutes that will be used in consumer applications, documentation
of testing results conducted by independent laboratories (e.g., Underwriters Laboratories) should be submitted,
where available. If a substitute is flammable, the submitter must analyze the risk of fire resulting from the use of
such a substitute and suggest measures to minimize these risks. 




10. Exposure Data



The submitter must provide available modeling or monitoring data on exposures associated with the manufacture,
formulation, transport, and use of a substitute. Descriptive process information for each substitute application,
as required above, will be used to develop exposure estimates where exposure data are not readily available. Depending
on the end-use, exposure profiles will be needed for workers, consumers, and the general population. 




11. Environmental Release Data



Data on emissions from the substitute application and equipment, as well as pollutant releases or discharge to all
environmental media (ambient air, surface and groundwater, hazardous/solid waste) are needed to complete the risk
characterization. Submitters should provide information on release locations, if known. Available information
on pollution controls that are used or could be used in association with the substitute (e.g., emissions reduction

technologies, wastewater treatment, treatment of hazardous waste) and the costs of such technology is also requested.





12. Replacement Ratio for a Chemical Substitute




The Agency requires information on the replacement ratio for a chemical substitute versus the class I or II substances
being replaced. The term ``replacement ratio'' refers to how much more or less of the substitute chemical is needed
to substitute for the original ozone-depleting compound being replaced. This ratio will affect the estimated incremental
cost and environmental effects associated with use of the substitute. 




13. Required Changes in Technology



Data on any changes in technology needed to use the alternative are required. Such information should include a description
of whether the substitute can be used in existing equipment_with or without some retrofit_or only in new equipment.




14. Cost of Substitute



The Agency requires data on the expected average cost of the alternative. The cost of the substitute can be expressed,
for example, in terms of 
$/pound (for a chemical substitute) or as incremental capital and operating costs associated with a retrofit or new
equipment. In addition, information is needed on the expected equipment life for an alternative technology. Other
critical cost considerations should be identified, as appropriate. For example, it is important to understand the
incremental costs associated with losses or gains in energy efficiency associated with use of a substitute relative
to current experience with existing substances. 




15. Availability of Substitute



The Agency needs to understand the extent to which a substitute is already commercially available or the date on which
it is expected to become available. The timing of availability is an important factor in assessing the overall health
and environmental effects of the substitute. 




16. Anticipated Market Share



Data on the anticipated near-term and long-term (over the next ten years) nationwide substitute sales are also required.
This information can be presented in several ways, for example: a percentage of existing nationwide use of class I
or II chemicals that would be replaced in a particular end-use; number of units/products to be produced; or pounds
of substitute to be sold. This information is required to assess the potential effects of a substitute 
related to total consumption and environmental releases. 




17. Applicable Regulations Under Other Environmental Statutes



The submitter is required to provide information on whether the substitute is regulated under other statutory authorities,
in particular the Clean Water 
Act; the Safe Drinking Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide,
and Rodenticide Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act; the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, and other titles of the CAA. The Agency
will evaluate substitutes under the SNAP program subject to existing regulatory constraints. 




18. Information Already Submitted to the Agency



Individuals may have already submitted information required in the SNAP Information Notice to the Agency as part
of past regulatory and information-gathering activities. In this case, to minimize reporting burden, the submitter
need not resubmit the data but instead should provide the following 
information to help EPA locate the data already maintained at EPA: Type of information submitted; the date of submission;
the EPA office to which the data were sent; description of the regulatory program under which the data were submitted;
and a document-control number, if assigned (e.g., a PMN number). If the submitter cannot provide adequate references
for data sent previously to the Agency as described above, all required information should be included in the SNAP
notice. To facilitate review under SNAP, reports already submitted to the Agency as part of other regulatory submissions
should be resubmitted if the original information was claimed as Confidential Business Information when previously
submitted.

<TEXT>
 

19. Information Already Available in the Literature 



If any of the data needed 
to complete the SNAP program notice are available in the literature, the 
submitter should provide the Agency with references for such 
information. Failure to provide the Agency with an accurate and 
complete citation may delay review of the notice. Additionally, 
submitters are encouraged to provide copies of any literature to expedite 
review, particularly if the citation is from a source not readily available. 
Any references from sources in foreign languages should be translated 
into English prior to submission. 

Submissions should be sent to the SNAP Coordinator at the address referenced at the 
beginning of this final rule. All submissions must be provided in three complete copies. If 
information is claimed as confidential, all confidential information must be excised from one 
of the three copies. This copy will be placed in the public docket. The other two copies 
should include the confidential material. If no claims of confidentiality are made for the 
submission, all three copies should be identical. (See below, as well as appendix C, for 
further guidance on handling of confidential information under SNAP.) 



C. Submission of Confidential Business Information 



1. Clean Air Act Provisions 



Anyone submitting information for which Confidential Business Information (CBI) 
status is requested must assert a claim of confidentiality at the time of submission. Failure to 
assert a claim of confidentiality at the time of submission may result in disclosure of the 
information by the Agency without further notice to the submitter. Further, it should be noted 
that information which is publicly available (e.g., in journals, trade magazines, product 
literature, etc.) cannot be claimed as CBI. Requesting CBI status for such information could 
delay review under section 612. All claims of confidentiality will be treated in a manner 
consistent with 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. 

The submitter should be advised that under CAA section 114(c), emissions data may 
not be claimed as confidential. Moreover, there are further instances in which confidentiality 
assertions may later be reconsidered by the Agency even when confidentiality claims are 
originally received. These circumstances are provided in the provisions of 40 
CFR part 2, subpart B. 

The submitter will be contacted as part of this evaluation process when such a 
circumstance occurs. 



2. Substantiation of Confidentiality Claims 



In the NPRM, EPA proposed to require substantiation of any confidentiality claims at 
the time of submission. In making these claims, the following provisions apply:

 


_The specific information to which the claim applies must be clearly marked in the 
body of the study as subject to a claim of confidentiality; 
_A Supplemental Statement of Data Confidentiality Claims must be submitted, 
identifying each section claimed confidential and describing in detail the basis for the 
claim. (A list of points to address in such a statement is included in appendix C); 
_The Supplemental Statement of Data Confidentiality Claims must be signed and dated 
and must include the typed name and title of the official who signed it.

 


EPA also stated that if required substantiation is not provided when submitting information 
claimed as confidential, the complete submitted information may be made available to the 
public without further notice to the submitter. 

Several commenters indicated that EPA should contact the submitter before releasing 
information marked as confidential to the public even if it does not contain adequate 
substantiation. One commenter also indicated that complete substantiation should not be 
required until the end of the 90 day review period and that any issue regarding the adequacy 
of CBI substantiation should not delay the review process. 

EPA agrees with the comment that submitters should be notified prior to disclosure to 
the public of information marked as confidential where substantiation, although it may be 
inadequate, has been provided. This will give the submitter opportunity to provide the 
necessary additional substantiation or withdraw the submission. However, an acceptability 
determination on a substitute will not be published until all claims of CBI have been fully 
substantiated under the provisions described above. Additionally, should no substantiation of 
CBI claims be provided, EPA may make the complete submittal available to the public 
without further notice to the submitter. 



3. Confidentiality Provisions for Toxicity Data 



In the event that toxicity or health and safety studies are listed as confidential, the 
submitter should be advised that this information cannot be maintained as confidential where 
such data are also submitted under TSCA or FIFRA to the extent that confidential treatment 
is prohibited under those statutes. However, any information other than emissions data 
contained in the toxicity study that is not health and safety data and is not relevant to the 
effects of a substance on human health and the environment (e.g., discussion of process 
information, proprietary blends) can be maintained as confidential subject to the provisions of 
40 CFR part 2, subpart B. The Agency is therefore requesting that submitters not identify 
the following information as confidential when submitting information under TSCA or 
FIFRA: All information concerning the objectives, methodology, results, or significance of 
any toxicity test or experiment performed on or with a substitute or its degradation products; 
any information concerning the effects of the substitute on any organism (e.g., fish, wildlife, 
humans and other mammals) or the environment (e.g., studies related to persistence, 
translocation, and fate); and pharmacokinetics/metabolism studies.

4. Federal Register Requirements 



As discussed below in Section VII.A.3.g., the Agency will publish quarterly notices in the 

Federal Register

 updating the list of acceptable and unacceptable alternatives. If the name of a specific substitute contained in
any studies supporting such notices must be maintained as confidential, the submitter and the Agency will together
develop a generic name that will protect the proprietary nature of the substitute, but will provide sufficient detail
for the public to evaluate the health and safety studies. If appropriate, the submitter may reference any generic
names identified for use in the PMN program. 



D. Display of OMB Control Numbers 



EPA is also amending the table of currently approved information collection request (ICR) control numbers issued
by OMB for various regulations. This amendment updates the table to accurately display those information requirements
contained in this final rule. This display of the OMB control number and its subsequent codification in the Code of
Federal Regulations satisfies the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

) and OMB's implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320. 
The ICR was subject to public notice and comment prior to OMB approval. As a result, EPA finds that there is ``good cause''
under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) to amend this table without prior
notice and comment. Due to the technical nature of the table, further notice and comment would be unnecessary. For
the same reasons, EPA also finds that there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). 



VI. Effective Date of Coverage 



A. General Provisions 



This final rule includes a list of acceptable substitutes and a list of unacceptable substitutes. Unacceptable substitutes
cannot be used in manufacturing or in final applications as substitutes for ozone-depleting compounds. The list
of unacceptable substitutes and acceptable substitutes subject to use restrictions becomes binding 30 days after
March 18, 1994. In contrast, the list of fully acceptable substitutes is furnished for the purpose of assisting users
in understanding the full range of available, acceptable substitutes in each application. Many of the substitutes
listed as pending or proposed in the NPRM have since been added to the final acceptable or unacceptable lists. 

As noted above, the Agency does not believe that determinations on substitutes that are acceptable with no use restrictions
need be made through rulemaking. Consequently, EPA believes that it is within its discretion to supplement the list
of acceptable substitutes at any time upon making determinations consistent with the criteria established in this
rulemaking. Until the Agency reaches a final decision restricting the use of a substitute, vendors are not barred
from selling such substitutes once notification is given and the 90 day prior-to-sale notification period expires.




B. Grandfathering of Unacceptable Substitutes 



EPA is authorized to permit the continuation of activities otherwise restricted where the balance of equities supports
such grandfathering. Consequently, where appropriate, EPA may grandfather the production and use of particular
substitutes by setting the effective date of unacceptability listings in the future. 

The United States District Court for the District of Columbia Circuit has established a four-part test to judge the
appropriateness of Agency grandfathering (see 

Sierra Club 

v. 

EPA, 

719 F.2d 436 (DC Cir. 1983)). This test involves balancing the results of four analyses, including whether the new
rule represents an abrupt departure from previously established practice, the extent to which a party relied on the
previous rule, the degree of burden which application of the new rule would impose on the party, and the statutory interest
in applying the new rule immediately. In each rulemaking listing a substitute as unacceptable where grandfathering
seems appropriate, EPA will conduct these four analyses and weigh their results. Where the balance of equities favors
grandfathering, EPA will set a delayed effective date for such listings. 

Setting future effective dates to ban the sale and distribution of specific substitutes will allow the Agency to avoid
penalizing those who in specific applications may have already invested in good faith in alternatives the SNAP program
determines to be unacceptable. For example, the Agency in this final rule finds unacceptable the use of HCFC-141b
in solvent applications. New information on stratospheric ozone depletion has increased concern over possible
adverse human health and environmental effects, and the Agency's unacceptable determination in the case of HCFC-141b
reflects these concerns. 

However, the Agency recognizes that some solvent users may have switched to HCFC-141b in good faith, expecting
that this substitute would sufficiently lower the risk of ozone depletion relative to earlier materials. To provide
for these users, the Agency has extended the effective date for certain end users of HCFC-141b. See the listing
determination narrative discussion in section IX.F., as well as the listing tables in appendix B, for a full discussion
of HCFC-141b and associated effective dates. Finally, to balance the desire not to penalize those who switched
early in good faith with the need to avoid creating an incentive for continued investment in alternatives the Agency
wishes to discourage, the longer-term effective dates discussed above will affect only existing uses. 


VII. Notice, Review, and Decision-making Procedures 



The purpose of this section is to summarize the procedures for submitting the required information to the Agency,
the steps EPA will take in reviewing SNAP submissions, and the process of making determinations based on these reviews.
This section focuses on three procedures, summarized in Exhibit 1, depending on the nature of the submission received
by the Agency. Some substitutes may already be approved or may not need approval under other environmental statutes,
especially TSCA and FIFRA. These substitutes, in consequence, would only require review under the SNAP program.
Section VII.A. discusses in greater detail the submission and review process for alternatives that fall into this
category. In other cases, a substitute will require review under section 612 as well as relevant provisions of TSCA
and FIFRA. With respect to any substitute that is a new chemical (i.e., not currently listed on the TSCA inventory),
information must be submitted to the Agency for review both under the SNAP program and the PMN program. Section VII.B.
describes steps for this review in more detail. For alternatives to class I and II chemicals that will be used in pesticide
products, the substitute manufacturer will need to file notification jointly with EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs
(OPP) and EPA's SNAP program. Section VII.C. discusses the latter procedure. The SNAP program has coordinated closely
with each of these regulatory programs to establish a joint review process that will ensure consistency in the final
decisions, while minimizing the time for review, the reporting burden, and the costs for both the submitter and the
Agency.

A. Substitutes Reviewed under SNAP Only 


1. Applicability 


Sections IV. and V. describe the conditions dictating review under the SNAP program only and the general reporting
requirements under section 612. If any of these conditions are met and the substitutes are not exempt as described
in section IV.B.3., Exemptions from Reporting, a SNAP notice must be submitted. 


2. Pre-Notice Communication 


Prior to submitting the SNAP notice, each submitter is encouraged to contact EPA's SNAP Coordinator to discuss the
notification process. Among other things, the SNAP Coordinator will: (1) Assist the potential submitter in determining
whether a SNAP notice is needed; (2) answer questions regarding how to complete a submission; (3) provide all necessary
forms and the guidance manual; (4) serve as the initial point of contact when the notice is submitted; and (5) oversee
the assignment of a SNAP program tracking number to the notice once it is received by the Agency. A copy of the SNAP Information
Notice and Guidance Manual may be obtained from the SNAP Coordinator at the address listed at the beginning of this
final rule. Specific data requested are described in section V. 


3. Processing of Completed SNAP Submission 


a. 

90-Day review process.

 As required under section 612(e), a manufacturer of a substitute for a class I chemical must provide the Agency with
notification at least 90 days prior to introducing into interstate commerce any new or existing chemicals for significant
new uses as class I alternatives. The same requirements apply to manufacturers of substitutes for class II substances,
although in this case the Agency is drawing on general authorities contained in sections 114 and 301 of the CAA in order
to fulfill the purpose of section 612(c). EPA intends to review these substitutes within a 90-day period to ensure
prompt response for manufacturers initiating production of substitutes. EPA's 90-day review period for SNAP submissions
begins once EPA receives a submission, as described in section V.B. above. If a submission does not include adequate
data, EPA may return the submission to request specific additional information. Section 114 and, in the case of petitions,
section 612(d) authorizes EPA to require manufacturers to support their SNAP submissions with data adequate to facilitate
EPA's review. 
b. 

Initial receipt of the SNAP submission. 

(1) Initial review of submission. EPA will conclude a completeness review of each submission within fifteen days
of receipt of the submission. Within the 15-day period, EPA will inform the submitter of any additional information
needed. If EPA makes no such request, then after the 15-day period is concluded, the 90-day review period will automatically
commence. If EPA does request any additional data, the 90-day period shall not commence until the additional data
are received and themselves reviewed for completeness. 
During the 15-day completeness review, the SNAP Coordinator will first review the SNAP Information Notice to ensure
that basic information necessary to process the submission is present (i.e., name of company, identification of
substitute, etc.). A more detailed review of supporting technical data will then ensue, as well as an examination
of substantiation provided for any claim for confidentiality of information. Should additional information be
required, EPA will contact the submitter within 15 days of receipt of the original submission. 
During the 90-day review period, EPA may ask for additional information from submitters as necessary, although manufacturers
of a new substitute may introduce the substitute into interstate commerce 90 days after EPA receives a submission
for the product if the Agency has not already rendered an unacceptability determination. In the case of a substitute
which already exists in the marketplace prior to the issuance of this final rule, manufacturers must submit a completed
SNAP Information Notice as soon as possible, and not later than 90 days after the effective date of this rule. During
EPA's review, use of an existing substitute may continue, and need not cease unless and until EPA adds the substitute
to the list of unacceptable substitutes as a result of notice-and-comment rulemaking. 


(2) Letter of receipt.

 The SNAP Coordinator will send a letter of confirmation to the submitter once the Agency has received the SNAP Information
Notice and reviewed it for completeness. This letter will include the date of advance notification to the Agency,
the starting date of EPA's 90-day review period, and the SNAP program tracking number assigned to the submission.

c. 

Determination of data adequacy.

 As part of the review for a SNAP submission, the Agency will complete a preliminary determination of the adequacy of
data supporting the application. The Agency will issue this determination within 15 days after receipt of the application.
At any time during the review period, if information is not adequate to allow the Agency to reach a SNAP determination,
EPA will contact the submitter and request the missing data. EPA believes it appropriate and authorized under section
114 to require the submitter to provide all data needed to complete the review of the SNAP notice. Depending on the type
of information needed and the time necessary to compile and submit the requested data to the Agency, EPA may suspend
or extend the review period. This will not affect the ability of a manufacturer to begin marketing a new substitute
90 days after advance notification to the Agency, or in the case of a pre-existing substitute, to continue marketing.

In a few cases, the Agency and the submitter may disagree on a schedule for furnishing additional data EPA deems necessary
to determine the acceptability of the substitute. If in these cases EPA has reason to believe that such a substitute
may be unacceptable, the Agency may exercise the option of proposing to list the substitute as unacceptable based
on existing data until the necessary data are provided, due to the uncertainty of the risks associated with use of the
substitute.

d. 

Availability of new information during review period.

 If critical new information becomes available during the review period that may influence the Agency's evaluation
of a substitute, the submitter must notify the Agency about the existence of such information within ten days of receiving
such data. The submitter must also inform the Agency of new studies under way, even if the results will not be available
within the 90-day review period. The Agency may extend or suspend the review period depending on the type of information
at issue and the stage of review. Again, this will not affect a manufacturer's ability to market a substitute 90 days
after initial notification to the Agency. 
e. 

Completion of detailed review.

 Once the submission is found to be supported by adequate data, the Agency will commence a detailed evaluation of the
notice. As this review proceeds, EPA may contact the submitter for additional scientific and technical information
to assist in the evaluation. This will ensure that the review is completed quickly and that it reflects the best available
information. Final decisions will be based on detailed analysis completed during this stage of review. 
f.

 Vendor lists.

 As part of EPA's outreach and clearinghouse under SNAP, the Agency will use the SNAP determinations to compile a list
of vendors for the convenience of potential users. Companies could then ask EPA to review their specific substitute,
to ensure that it is covered by the listing decisions on acceptable substitutes, and to add the company to the vendor
list. The Agency believes that specific information on vendors of acceptable substitutes would be useful to companies
switching out of class I and II compounds. 
g.

 Communication of SNAP determination. (1) SNAP determinations on 90-Day notifications.

 EPA's determinations on SNAP submissions that come as a result of the 90-day advance notification requirement will
take the form of either adding substances to the list of acceptable substitutes or by proposing to add them to one of
the following lists: acceptable subject to use conditions, acceptable subject to narrowed use limits, or unacceptable
substitutes. 
(2) 

Communication of SNAP determination to the submitter.

 Once Agency review has been completed, the submitter will be notified in writing of the determination under SNAP.
At this time, the submitter will also be informed if any restrictions are attached to the acceptability of a substitute.
Following the expiration of 90 days after submitting advance notification to EPA, companies may begin sale or manufacture
of a new substitute. They may continue to sell or manufacture an existing substitute through the review period, unless
and until the Agency places such substitute on the list of unacceptable substitutes as a result of rulemaking. Sale
or manufacture may begin and continue even if the Agency fails to reach a decision or notify the submitter of that decision
within 90 days of advance notification of EPA. 
(3) 

Communication of SNAP determination to the public.

 (a) Federal Register notice. To provide the public with updated information on SNAP determinations, the Agency will
publish in the 

Federal Register

 a complete list of the acceptable and unacceptable alternatives reviewed to date. This list will be published four
times each year and will include recent decisions made under the SNAP program. In addition to the quarterly publications,
the Agency will communicate decisions through a clearinghouse and outreach program, as discussed in the next section,
as well as through the Stratospheric Ozone Protection hotline. 
(b) 

Outreach and clearinghouse.

 Section 612(b)(4) requires the Agency to maintain a public clearinghouse of alternative chemicals, product substitutes,
and alternative manufacturing processes that are available as replacements for class I and II chemicals. The clearinghouse
will distribute information on substitutes that are acceptable under the SNAP program. For the convenience of companies
wishing to identify substitutes, the Agency will maintain a list of vendors selling substitutes as discussed in section
VII.A.3.f. 
In addition, the Agency will enter data on substitutes into the Pollution Prevention Information Exchange System
(PPIES) database, which is maintained by EPA's Office of Research and Development. This database contains information
on numerous pollution prevention options for a wide variety of industrial sectors and chemicals. PPIES can also be
accessed from a variety of other pollution prevention databases maintained by other federal agencies and industry.



4. Decision-Making Framework 


a. 

Decisions by substitute and use.

 As required by section 612(c), the Agency must publish a list of substitutes unacceptable under the SNAP program and
a list of acceptable alternatives for specific uses. Given that environmental exposure and risk profiles can change
significantly from one end-use to the next, it is essential to evaluate and list substitutes in the context of their
intended use. The Agency identified a number of end-uses in each sector by which to list substitutes, and section IX
provides risk management decisions for many existing substitutes in each of the principal sectors. 
The Agency will be as specific as possible in listing substitutes by providing exact chemical names of substitutes.
For most substitutes, a broad chemical classification (e.g., aromatic hydrocarbons, or HCFCs) is not specific enough
because of differences among chemicals belonging to each of these groups. Thus, where appropriate, EPA will provide
a more specific description of the substitute by application.

<DOCNO> FR940318-0-00131 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940318-0-00023 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Agency anticipates two possible exceptions to this practice. The first is where 
release of the chemical identity of a substitute constitutes release of proprietary information. 
In that event, the Agency will report generic chemical names based on chemical classes as 
described in section V.C. The other exception would be in cases where the Agency believes 
that a more general categorization is needed to account for the diversity of possible chemicals 
used in a particular set of substitutes. For example, in the solvents cleaning sector, many 
substitutes are formulations composed of compounds drawn from several categories of 
chemicals. In this case, the toxicity profile of each chemical is similar to those of other 
chemicals in that class. 
b. 

Decision categories.

 
Under section 612, the Agency has considerable discretion in the risk management 
decisions it can make in SNAP. In this final rule, the Agency has identified five possible 
decision categories, as described below. Commenters suggested that there was confusion with 
the Agency's intent to designate some substitutes as acceptable subject to narrowed use limits 
versus unacceptable except for critical use exemptions. In response to these comments, the 
Agency has determined that the goal of both categories was to limit the use of a substitute 
that had generally unacceptable characteristics yet provide relief for specialized applications 
within an end-use where no other alternatives exist. Given the similarity in goals, the 
decision categories have been streamlined by eliminating the category listed in the NPRM as 
``unacceptable except for critical use exemptions.'' Those substitutes that were listed in the 
NPRM as proposed unacceptable except for critical use exemptions are listed as unacceptable 
in this final rule, and the concerns which the critical use exemption petition process was 
created to address will now be addressed as part of EPA's responsibilities under the section 612(d) 
petition process. 
(1) Acceptable. 
Where the Agency has reviewed a substitute and found no reason to prohibit its use, it 
will list the alternative as acceptable in the end-uses for which the submitter provided 
information. Where appropriate, the Agency may provide some additional comment (e.g., 
general recommendations encouraging recapture and recycling). However, these comments 
are not conditions for use of the substitute. 
(2) Acceptable subject to use conditions. 
As proposed in the NPRM, after reviewing a submission, the Agency may determine 
that a substitute is acceptable if certain conditions on use are adopted. The Agency cannot 
predict at this time all necessary restrictions, but has imposed some conditions based on 
substitute reviews already completed for this final rule. Several commenters supported the 
application of use conditions as necessary in providing important guidance to companies in 
reviewing alternative replacements for ODSs. While also supporting use conditions generally, 
other commenters noted that they should be used sparingly, so as to create the minimum 
uncertainty in the regulated community and encourage swift transition. 
The Agency agrees with these comments. In this final rule, any conditions imposed 
will depend on the risks involved and the substitute and application in question. For example, 
the Agency may impose conditions on the use of a substitute and require recycling equipment 
to limit workplace and ambient releases or require use of other control practices within a 
certain application. Where a substitute is found acceptable subject to conditions on uses, use 
without adherence to the conditions in the relevant end-use is prohibited in this final rule. 
Determinations of acceptability subject to use conditions will only be made pursuant to 
notice-and-comment rulemaking. 
In implementing conditions on use, the Agency has sought to avoid overlap with 
existing regulatory authorities. EPA has taken a number of steps to mitigate this potential for 
duplication. First, EPA intends to restrict the use of conditions to cases in which clear 
regulatory gaps exist. Second, these existing regulatory gaps must render the use of a 
substitute an unreasonable risk in the absence of any additional controls. Third, in the limited 
cases in which conditions may be necessary, the Agency will impose them only as a result of 
formal notice-and-comment rulemaking. Finally, use conditions will be effective only until 
other appropriate regulatory controls are imposed under other authorities and will be 
withdrawn by the Agency when they are superseded by such controls. 
(3) Acceptable subject to narrowed use limits. 
The Agency cannot restrict use of a substitute under SNAP if there are no technically 
feasible alternatives to the use of an ozone-depleting compound. Thus, EPA may approve a 
compound not for general use within a sector, but for use only within certain specialized 
applications within a sector end-use. EPA refers to these restrictions as narrowed use limits. 
For example, the Agency could list a substitute with a generally unfavorable environmental or 
human health effect as acceptable in certain specific metals cleaning applications in the 
solvents cleaning sector. This would allow transition away from the damaging ozone-depleting compounds to proceed,
by allowing industry the flexibility to use in narrow niche 
applications a substitute which provides the only means of transition. At the same time, the 
narrowed use determination prevents a widespread shift of an entire sector to substitutes 
which overall do not offer the risk reduction available through the use of other alternatives.

Clearly, any limits imposed will depend on the risks involved and the substitute and 
application in question. To provide adequate opportunity for comment by the regulated 
community, EPA will complete notice-and-comment rulemaking before promulgating any 
finding that a substitute is acceptable only subject to a narrowed use limit. 
In implementing narrowed use limitations, the Agency has sought to allow agents for 
specific uses that would otherwise be deemed unacceptable. This policy serves the larger 
goal of facilitating the fastest possible transition from ozone-depleting compounds by 
expanding the list of alternatives available to all applications within a sector end-use category. 
EPA recognizes that certain sector end-uses encompass a broad range of applications, 
manufacturing processes and products. Under the acceptable for narrow use category, EPA 
will accept a substitute for use only in certain specialized uses within the broader end-use. 
The intent of the narrowed use limitation is to restrict the use of a substitute that the Agency 
deems unacceptable for the full range of applications or products within a sector end-use 
category. Where a substitute is found acceptable subject to narrowed use limits, general use 
within the relevant end-use is prohibited. 
Before users adopt a restricted agent within the narrowed use limits category, they 
must make a reasonable effort to ascertain that other substitutes or alternatives are not 
technically feasible. Users are expected to undertake a thorough technical investigation of 
alternatives before implementing the otherwise restricted substitute. The Agency expects 
users to contact vendors of alternatives to explore with experts whether or not other 
acceptable substitutes are technically feasible for the process, product or system in question. 
To further assist users in their evaluation, EPA has prepared a list of vendors manufacturing 
other substitutes. Although users are not required to report the results of their investigation to 
EPA, companies must document these results, and retain them in company files for the 
purpose of demonstrating compliance. Both the Vendor List and the Guidance Manual are 
available from the SNAP program, or through EPA's Stratospheric Ozone Protection Hotline. 
In October 1993, the President directed EPA through the Climate Change Action Plan 
(CCAP) to use its authority under section 612 of the Clean Air Act to narrow the uses of 
CFC substitutes with high global warming potential. Because EPA is simultaneously also 
interested in promoting the broader shift away from ozone-depleting compounds, EPA will 
make every effort to assure that these limits on use will be imposed in ways that preserve as 
much flexibility as possible for those trying to move to alternatives. 
In this final rule, EPA has imposed narrowed use limitations on the acceptability of 
perfluorocarbon (PFC) substitutes when used in solvent cleaning, and fire suppression. EPA 
has imposed these limitations because of the high global warming potential and long 
atmospheric lifetimes of the PFC compounds as compared with other alternatives available for 
the same end-uses. Comparable limitations on the use of refrigerants and aerosols containing 
PFCs are also likely to be proposed shortly. In the case of fire suppression and explosion 
protection, EPA has taken the approach of narrowing uses to prevent or delay emissions of 
global warming gases. This is preferable to the outright prohibitions EPA would otherwise be 
authorized to impose where other alternatives are available, because in these limited cases 
users may have no other feasible alternatives to continued reliance on ozone-depleters. 
Through the notice and comment rulemaking process, other companies or vendors will 
be able to scrutinize the proposed narrowed use limits. This may bring to light new 
alternatives or processes of which the user and EPA are unaware, and these new alternatives 
may pose lower overall risks than the substances which have been the subject of the narrowed 
use designation. If an acceptable listing is revoked based on the availability of a new, lower-risk alternative,
companies that have made investments in technology which was earlier 
deemed as having no alternatives available may be granted permission to extend their use for 
a limited period of time, consistent with EPA's grandfathering approach described above in 
section VI.B. 
The Agency has prepared guidance describing additional documentation users should 
include for narrowed use applications. This information includes descriptions of: 
 Process or product in which the substitute is needed; 
 Substitutes examined and rejected; 
 Reason for rejection of other alternatives, e.g., performance, technical or safety 
standards; and/or 
 Anticipated date other substitutes will be available and projected time for 
switching. 
In addition to this basic information, the guidance includes specific data for end-uses 
in each sector. The guidance is available from the SNAP program. 
(4) 

Unacceptable.

 
The Agency has the authority under section 612(c) to prohibit the use of a substitute 
believed to present adverse effects to human health and the environment where alternatives 
that reduce overall risk are available. The Agency will only use this provision where it has 
identified other substitutes that are currently or potentially available and that pose lower 
overall risks. Substitutes will be listed as unacceptable through the rulemaking process. 
(5) 

Pending.

 
The Agency will describe submissions for which the 90-day review period is 
underway and for which EPA has not yet reached a final decision as pending. For all 
substitutes in the pending category, the Agency will contact the submitter to determine a 
schedule for providing the missing information if the Agency needs to extend the 90-day 
review period. EPA will use the authority under section 114 to gather this information, if 
necessary. Again, a delay of the review period will not affect a manufacturer's ability to sell 
a product 90 days after notification of the Agency as described above.

c. 

Implications of other regulatory requirements.

 In evaluating substitutes, the SNAP program takes into consideration the regulatory requirements of other environmental
and health protection statutes (e.g., the Clean Water Act or the Occupational Safety and Health Act). In considering
the framework of existing regulatory constraints, the Agency's evaluation of alternatives will assume compliance
with their provisions. 

However, it will not be possible to factor in regulatory requirements that are still under development (e.g., more
stringent requirements to control volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants under title I and title
III of the CAA). In these instances, a substitute may be deemed acceptable under SNAP, but is not thereby excused from
compliance with any future regulations. The Agency does not believe that it was the intent of Congress to use the authority
under section 612 to compromise other regulatory requirements. Should future regulations severely limit the availability
of the only acceptable substitute for a specific end-use, EPA would reconsider the advisability of keeping any other
alternatives which could be used in that application on the list of unacceptable substitutes. 



5. EPA-Generated Review of Substitutes 



In addition to SNAP notifications received under section 612 for substitute review, the Agency is authorized by section
612(c) to add or delete alternatives to the list of reviewed substitutes on its own initiative. EPA has many efforts
under way to identify and communicate the availability of promising new alternatives. These include support for
research efforts to study and focus attention on future substitutes, involvement in the United Nations Environment
Programme's biannual assessment of technologies for key sectors currently using ozone-depleting chemicals, and
technology transfer projects with industry, other federal agencies, and developing nations. Based on information
available through these activities, EPA may initiate review of new substitutes under section 612. In each case, the
next planned quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice updating the status of SNAP determinations will inform the public that EPA is initiating a review, subject
to the provisions discussed in this final rule. Similarly, determinations ultimately reached as a result of these
internally-generated reviews will be included in these quarterly updates. 



B. Joint Review of New Substitutes under SNAP and TSCA PMN 



1. Applicability 



Any potential SNAP submitter who intends to introduce a new chemical (i.e., a chemical not currently included in the
TSCA inventory) as an alternative for a class I or class II chemical must undergo review not only under section 612,
but under section 5 of TSCA (the Premanufacture Notice program) as well. Because of the overlap in statutory authority,
the Agency has established a joint review process between the SNAP and TSCA Premanufacture Notice (PMN) programs.
This process has been structured to minimize reporting burden and to ensure consistency in decisions between the
two programs. The following sections describe the joint review and decision-making process in more detail. 



2. Data Submission Requirements and Process 



a. 

SNAP and PMN forms. 

The Agency has reviewed the data submission needs for the SNAP and PMN programs and found significant overlap. In general,
the Agency has identified only a few additional data elements beyond those already required by the PMN program that
should be included for review under the SNAP program. These elements are: 

 Ozone depletion potential.

 Global warming potential.

 Cost of using the substitute, including:


 

_Chemical replacement data.

_Chemical cost data.

_Incremental equipment expenditures (either new or retrofit) needed to use substitute.

_Information on the cost implications of changes in energy consumption (e.g., from the use of a less or more energy-efficient
refrigerant).




 Documentation of testing results regarding the flammability of substitutes, especially when proposed for
consumer applications. 

Given this overlap, a submitter requesting a review under both the SNAP and PMN programs should provide the above information
by following these steps: 

 Complete the PMN form (EPA Form 7710-25) following the Instructions Manual currently available through
the TSCA Assistance Information Service. 

 Indicate on page 11 of the PMN form, ``Optional Pollution Prevention Information,'' that the chemical to be
reviewed is also to be considered under the SNAP program. 

 Complete a SNAP addendum that requests information only on those items listed above. (The addendum can be obtained
from the SNAP program, or EPA's Stratospheric Ozone Protection Hotline.) 

The completed PMN form (EPA Form 7710-25) will remain the basis for all information needed to complete review
of the new chemical under section 5 of TSCA. The completed PMN form and the SNAP addendum together will comprise the
data submission for section 612 review and listing decisions for new chemicals. This approach is intended to minimize
the reporting burden on submitters. 

The Agency will modify the PMN Instructions Manual to provide more explicit direction on how to complete the SNAP addendum.
A SNAP submitter may also consult the SNAP Guidance Manual, which is available from the Stratospheric Ozone Protection
Hotline. Any questions regarding the completion of these forms can be directed to either the PMN Pre-notice Coordinator
or the SNAP program.

<PARENT> FR940318-0-00023 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

b. 

Submission of completed forms.

 Both the PMN and SNAP programs have a review period of 90 days, subject to suspensions and extensions described in section
VII.A. for the SNAP program and in the PMN final rule (40 CFR 720.75). To ensure that new chemical submissions are reviewed
and decided on jointly, the Agency encourages submitters to provide both the PMN form and SNAP addendum to the PMN and
SNAP coordinators. Failure to provide both programs with the requested information at the same time could result
in delays in the review of a submitter's notice seeking acceptance of a new chemical as a class I or II substitute concurrent
with review under the PMN program. 

c. 

Procedures for handling confidential business information.

 The Agency recognizes that, where appropriate, information submitted to the PMN and SNAP programs may need to be held
confidential. EPA has determined that all CBI submitted as part of the joint PMN/SNAP review should be maintained
and treated in a manner consistent with TSCA security procedures. Confidentiality claims will be processed and reviewed
in a manner consistent with 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. This approach was selected because the majority of data provided
to SNAP under the joint review process will come from the PMN form. Submitters should note that while TSCA and CAA may
have different language describing CBI handling procedures, there is no substantive difference in how CBI is maintained
under the two statutes. 



3. Agency Review of New Substitutes under PMN and SNAP 



a. 

Preparation of public docket and Federal Register notices. 

Once the letter of receipt has been issued, the PMN program will prepare a public docket and 

Federal Register

 notice, as described in the final rule for the PMN program (40 CFR 720.75). The PMN program manager will consult with
the SNAP program in preparing the notice. 

b. 

Joint review process.

 EPA will complete joint evaluations of new chemicals serving as class I or II substitutes under section 5 of TSCA and
section 612 of the CAA. This joint review process will be coordinated to ensure that there is consistency in the final
decisions made under the PMN and SNAP programs. To ensure agreement in the decisions, EPA offices will work in concert
to develop toxicity, exposure, and risk profiles for those substitutes and applications that come under joint TSCA
and CAA review authority. The Agency will also coordinate its review of the completeness of the information supplied
and any subsequent data requests to minimize the reporting burden on the submitter. Submitters should note that Agency
decisions to restrict production of particular chemicals under TSCA will, in the case of joint PMN/SNAP applications,
also have the effect of restricting production of substitutes undergoing review under the SNAP program. However,
companies that produce substitutes only being reviewed under the SNAP program are not required to cease production
during the SNAP review period in the case of existing substitutes, and in the case of new substitutes, manufacturers
may introduce the substitute into interstate commerce 90 days after submitting their complete notification to EPA.


As part of the review, the PMN and SNAP programs will work to arrive at a consistent decision regarding the new chemical
under review. Consequently, listing decisions under SNAP will reference any conditions also incorporated into
the PMN review (e.g., submission of additional toxicity information, restrictions on use, etc.).
 
If a substitute meets the conditions for general PMN approval but not for SNAP acceptability, the company may produce
and market the substance in question once the 90-day period has elapsed. However, EPA will commence a rulemaking to
prohibit the use of the substitute as a class I or II substitute. If the chemical fails to meet the conditions for PMN
approval, the submitter is barred from producing the chemical and consequently is effectively barred from marketing
the product as a substitute for a class I or II compound. Submitters should note, however, that CAA section 612 places
considerable emphasis on identifying and promoting the use of substitutes which, relative to others, reduce overall
risks to human health and the environment. To the extent a substitute offers such risk reduction, EPA will make every
effort to facilitate production and use of that alternative. 

c. 

Communication of decision.

 The PMN program will use the existing TSCA regulatory framework for 
communicating decisions on the new substitute to the submitter. The SNAP program will provide public notice of decisions
regarding the acceptability or unacceptability of a substitute following the process described in section VII.A.3.g.
EPA will contact the submitter to determine how best to list the substitute under the SNAP program if necessary to protect
the confidentiality of the alternative. 



C. Joint Review of Substitutes under SNAP and FIFRA 



1. Background on Use of Ozone-Depleting Chemicals in Pesticides 



Certain pesticides are formulated with class I and II chemicals. Examples include the use of methyl chloroform (1,1,1-trichloroethane)
as an inert ingredient, or the use of methyl bromide as an active agent. Pesticide products that contain class I and
II compounds must be reformulated as these chemicals are phased out of production pursuant to Clean Air Act section
604. This section describes how the Agency will handle reviews of these changes. 



2. Applicability 



Any new pesticide or amendment of an existing formulation is already subject to Agency approval under current provisions
of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), Public Law 100-460, 100-464 to 100-526,
and 100-532. However, as of the effective date of the SNAP program, new pesticides or formulation changes based
on class I or class II substitutes will also be subject to review under section 612 of the CAA. These authorities apply
in all cases where a manufacturer amends a pesticide product to replace chemicals being phased out under CAA section
602 or 604. Similarly, registrations of new pesticide products will also be subject to SNAP review if the new formula
contains chemicals functionally replacing class I or class II compounds which would otherwise have been used in the
new pesticide formulation. 



3. Review Responsibilities Under FIFRA and CAA/SNAP 



In general, review responsibilities for pesticide products under the CAA SNAP program will focus on a substance's
ozone depletion and global warming potential. The FIFRA reviews will address factors commonly examined during pesticide
amendments and registrations. The two program offices responsible for these reviews will coordinate their efforts
at critical junctures and share pertinent data to ensure appropriate technical consideration of the substitute.




4. Data Submission Requirements and Process 



a. 

Preparation of applications.

 The Agency has reviewed the data submission needs for the SNAP and FIFRA pesticide amendment/registration process
and found no significant overlap. Because there is so little overlap, the Agency requires that a submitter requesting
review under both SNAP and the Office of Pesticide Programs' (OPP) pesticide amendment/registration process submit
all information ordinarily required for the OPP process as well as a fully completed SNAP information form. A copy
of the FIFRA form should be submitted to OPP, and a copy of the SNAP form should be submitted to the SNAP Coordinator.
The SNAP form can be obtained from the SNAP program. For further guidance, SNAP submitters may also consult the SNAP
Guidance Manual, which is available from the Stratospheric Ozone Protection Hotline. 

If a registrant is submitting an amendment to a product registration under FIFRA that currently contains a class I
or II substance, he or she should note in section II (``Amendment Information'') of the FIFRA form that the amendment
was filed in response to the CAA production phase-out. Similarly, if a registrant is submitting an application for
a new pesticide registration that would otherwise have been based on a class I or II compound, he or she should note in
Section II of the FIFRA form that the registration includes a class I or II substitute.

<PARENT> FR940318-0-00023 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The submitter should also identify in Section II both the substitute chemical and the 
class I or II compound it is replacing. Further, if a registrant is aware that a particular 
chemical intended for use as a class I or II substitute in a pesticide formulation has already 
been accepted through earlier SNAP/FIFRA determinations, the registrant should also 
reference the relevant part of the prior review. 

b. 

Review of applications.

 When the Agency receives the FIFRA application and SNAP submission, it will log 
each into the relevant tracking systems: the OPP's tracking system for the FIFRA application 
and the SNAP tracking system for SNAP submissions. If the FIFRA application is identified 
in section II as a Clean Air Act substitution, the FIFRA program coordinator will contact 
EPA's SNAP program to ask if the substitute has been the subject of any prior SNAP 
reviews. If the registrant's substitute is already on the list of unacceptable substitutes, EPA 
will notify the registrant that the amendment request cannot be granted. If the registrant's 
substitute is already on the list of acceptable substitutes, EPA will proceed with the standard 
FIFRA application review. If a chemical substitute is not listed under existing SNAP 
determinations but is a substitute for an ozone-depleting compound, EPA will inform the 
registrant that a SNAP review must commence. 



5. Communication of Decision 



Once EPA review is complete, the Agency will notify the registrant whether the new 
formulation or proposed formulation change is acceptable. At the same time, the Agency will 
amend the SNAP determinations to reflect these findings and will publish the revised 
determinations in the next quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice. Submitters should note that, 
because of the shared authority to review substitutes under both SNAP and FIFRA, 
formulators may not sell amended or new formulations subject to FIFRA until they have 
received FIFRA approval. 



D. Shared Statutory Authority with the Food and Drug Administration 



The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 21 U.S.C. 321, provides for the 
safety and effectiveness of drugs and therapeutic devices, the purity and wholesomeness of 
foods, and the harmlessness of cosmetics. Under this statute, the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) regulates the packaging of food products and incidental additives and 
requires predistribution clearance of medical devices. 

As defined in the FDCA, medical devices can include any devices, diagnostic 
products, drugs, and drug delivery systems. Devices covered under this jurisdiction are 
subject to review under the FDCA. Some medical devices and food packaging currently 
contain class I or II compounds. The Agency has determined that such products are exempt 
from further review for human health effects under the SNAP program where FDA approval 
of such effects is required before a product can be introduced into commerce. EPA will rely 
in its SNAP determination on FDA's conclusions regarding health effects. The Agency 
believes this exemption is justified because of the higher burden of proof placed on submitters 
under the FDCA. However, the Agency will continue to evaluate all other environmental 
effects of the proposed substitute, and will consult with the FDA to determine the appropriate 
course of action. 



VIII. Petitions



A. Background 



1. Role of Petitions 



Section 612(d) of the CAA explicitly states that ``any person may petition the 
Administrator to add a substance * * * or to remove a substance from either of such (prohibited 
or safe use) lists.'' The petition provision serves two principal needs. The first is to permit 
the appeal of existing Agency determinations under the SNAP program. The second is to 
provide a mechanism for individuals and organizations to bring to the Agency's attention new 
information on substitutes that could affect existing listing determinations or result in new 
ones. 

The opportunity for outside parties to comment on existing listing decisions is an 
important aspect of the petition process. As discussed in the section on notifications, 
companies that produce substitutes must submit specific data on the substitutes to the Agency 
for review. However, organizations and private citizens other than those required to submit 
SNAP notices may have additional information about existing substitutes or information on 
new substitutes not yet reviewed by the Agency. To ensure that the SNAP determinations are 
based on the best information on substitutes, it is essential that the Agency offer a means for 
such information to be incorporated into the SNAP analyses on a continuing basis. 

Before individuals, organizations, or companies may initiate legal action against EPA 
for the purpose of changing the lists of acceptable or unacceptable substitutes, they must first 
exhaust all administrative remedies for receiving such relief, including remedies like the 
petition process described in this section. 



2. Types of Petitions 



Five types of petitions exist: 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940318-0-00136 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940318-0-00023 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) Petitions to add a substitute not previously reviewed under the SNAP program 
to the acceptable list; 

(2) Petitions to add a substitute not previously reviewed under the SNAP program 
to the unacceptable list; 

(3) Petitions to delete a substitute from the acceptable list and add it to the 
unacceptable list or to delete a substitute from the unacceptable list and add it 
to the acceptable list; 

(4) Petitions to add or delete use restrictions on an acceptability listing, and 

(5) Petitions to grandfather general use of an unacceptable or acceptable subject to 
narrowed use limits in specified applications substitute. 

Petitioners should note that the first type of petition is comparable to completing a 
SNAP submission, except that the latter is submitted by substitute producers prior to the 
introduction into interstate commerce of the substitute for a significant new use as a class I or 
II substitute. The first type of petition, by contrast, would generally be initiated by entities 
other than the company responsible for producing the substitute. Companies that 
manufacture, formulate, or use a substitute themselves and want to have their substitutes 
added to the acceptable list should submit information on the substitute under the 90-day 
advance notification review program. 



3. Basis for Petition 



A petitioner may submit a petition for several reasons, including: 

 Availability of new information on substitutes or applications not covered in 
the existing SNAP determinations; 

 Requests to extend effective date for existing prohibitions on uses of an 
unacceptable substitute; 

 New technologies or practices that reduce exposures to a substitute previously 
unacceptable under SNAP due to toxicity concerns; or 

 Requests for acceptability subject to narrowed use limits listing for specialized 
applications within a sector end-use for an unacceptable substitute where no 
other technologically viable substitute can be found. 

All of the above are examples of valid justifications for submitting a petition. Other bases for 
petitioning the Agency may exist as well, and all petitions with adequate supporting data will 
receive consideration under the SNAP program. 



4. Nature of Response 



The Agency will only review and grant or deny petitions based on the sector and end-use application identified in the
petition. For example, simply because the Agency ultimately 
deletes a substitute from the list of acceptable substitutes for a particular end-use in the 
solvents cleaning sector does not mean the substitute is unacceptable for any specific end-use 
as a refrigerant. A similar caveat applies for petitions on applications within a sector. If a 
substitute, for instance, is found acceptable for a specific end-use within an application, it will 
not automatically be deemed acceptable for any other end-use in that sector. 



B. Content of the Petition 



The Agency requires the following information: A brief statement describing the type 
of petition, substitute, sector and end-uses to which it applies; and a brief summary of the 
basis for the petition and the data that support the petition. As with SNAP submissions, the 
Agency will issue a determination letter on the completeness of the petition to the petitioner 
within 15 calendar days of its receipt. 

Petition types (1) and (2) must contain the information described in section V.B. of 
this notice, which lists the items to be submitted in a 90-day notification. Information 
requirements for such petitions and 90-day notifications are the same, since the Agency will 
be applying the same level of analysis to petitions submitted by outside parties as to 
notifications received from the producing companies themselves. For petition types (3) and 
(4), which request a reexamination of a substitute previously reviewed under the SNAP 
program, the submitter may reference the prior submission rather than submit duplicate 
information. In this case, the petitioner should provide and submit as appropriate any new or 
additional data. Petitions to grandfather use of an unacceptable substitute must describe the 
applicability of the four-part test to judge the appropriateness of Agency grandfathering as 
described in section VI.B. of this final rule. 



C. Sufficiency of Data 



Petitioners should be aware that insufficient data may prevent the Agency from 
reaching a timely decision on whether to grant or deny a petition. EPA will conclude a 
completeness review of each petition received within fifteen days of receipt of the petition. 
Within the 15-day period, EPA will inform the petitioner of any additional information 
needed. If EPA makes no such request, then after the 15-day period is completed, the 90-day 
review period will automatically commence. If EPA does request any additional data, the 90-day period shall not commence
until the additional data are received and themselves reviewed 
for completeness.

<TEXT>
 

As provided in section 612(d), any petition must ``include a showing by the petitioner 
that there are data on the substance adequate to support the petition.'' Petitioners may provide 
citations to scientific literature, where appropriate. However, submitters are advised that 
furnishing copies of supporting articles, reports, or letters will expedite the review process. 

If the Agency receives a petition with insufficient data, EPA will not commence 
review until the petitioner submits the missing information to the best of the petitioner's 
ability. EPA will inform the petitioner when the petition is complete for purposes of 
initiating the 90-day review period. To the extent the petitioner does not have the required 
information, EPA may also seek data from sources other than the petitioner, including 
manufacturers or users of products that contain the substitute. In such cases, section 612(d) 
explicitly provides that ``the Administrator shall use any authority available to the 
Administrator, under any law administered by the Administrator, to acquire such information.'' 
These authorities include section 114 of the CAA as well as information collection provisions 
of other environmental statutes. Where EPA cannot obtain sufficient data within the statutory 
90-day review period, the Agency may deny the petition for lack of adequate technical 
support. 



D. Criteria for Evaluating Petitions 



In evaluating petitions, the Agency will follow the same criteria as for review of the 
SNAP Information Notice which notifies EPA of the intent to introduce a substitute into 
interstate commerce. This will ensure that both petitions and notifications are judged by the 
same standards. 



E. Petition Review Process 



1. Petition Submittal 



This final rule describes a generic petition process. Petitions should be sent to the 
docket number listed in the beginning of this final rule as well as to the SNAP Coordinator. 



2. Petition Reviews 



When the Agency receives a petition, it will log the petition into the SNAP tracking 
system. If the petition concerns a substitute previously either found acceptable or 
unacceptable under the SNAP program, the Agency will as a courtesy contact the initial 
submitter of that substitute. 

The Agency will grant or deny the petition within 90 days of receiving a complete 
application. If the Agency grants a petition to add a substitute to the list of unacceptable 
substitutes or to remove a substitute from either list, the decision will be made through notice 
and comment rulemaking. In such cases, the statute requires EPA to propose, take comment 
on, complete final action, and publish the revised lists within six months of the grant of the 
petition. Otherwise, responses to petitions, including explanations of petition denials, will be 
included in the next 3-month 

Federal Register

 notice updating the SNAP determinations. 
Regardless of the final determination, the Agency will inform petitioners within 90 days 
whether their request has been granted or denied. 



IX. Listing of Substitutes



A. Overview 



This section presents EPA's listing decisions for class I substitutes in the following 
industrial sectors: Refrigeration and air conditioning, foam blowing, solvents cleaning, fire 
suppression and explosion protection, sterilants, aerosols, tobacco expansion and adhesives, 
coatings and inks. Parts D through K below present a detailed discussion of the substitute 
listing determinations for each of the major use sectors. Tables that summarize listing 
decisions in this section are included in appendix B. Listings of substitutes within the 
pesticides sector will be added in future notices, as information on these substitutes becomes 
available to the Agency. This final rule focuses on substitutes for class I substances, given 
the accelerated production phaseout schedule for class I substances. One of the goals of 
SNAP is to encourage transition away from class I substances as rapidly as possible. SNAP 
will begin analyzing alternatives to class II substances in the near future. Results of these 
analyses will appear in quarterly updates to the SNAP lists, which will be published in the 


Federal Register

 as described in Sections III.C.4. and VII.A.3.g. of this final rule. 

To develop the lists of unacceptable and acceptable substitutes, EPA conducted screens 
of health and environmental risks posed by various substitutes for class I compounds in each 
use sector. These screens are presented in individual background documents entitled ``Risk 
Screen on the Use of Substitutes for Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances'' for each use sector. 
These background documents are available for review in the public docket supporting this 
rulemaking. Whenever the initial risk screen indicated a potential risk, the substitute was 
evaluated further to ascertain whether the potential risk was accurately estimated and if 
management controls could reduce any risk to acceptable levels. 

Based on these analyses, EPA classified as unacceptable only uses of substitutes that 
pose significantly higher human health and environmental risks than those risks that would 
accrue through either continued use of the class I substances themselves or through use of 
other available substitutes.

<TEXT>
 

The assessments presented in the background documents are screens of the 
comparative risks posed by use of substitutes, not assessments or rankings of the absolute 
risks associated with use of each substitute. Designating a substitute as acceptable does not 
imply the absence of risks for that substitute, but rather that the substitute in question is 
believed to present lower overall risks than both the class I compound it is replacing and 
other substitutes available for the same end-use. For instance, in some cases, ozone-depleting 
substances can be replaced by chemicals with known toxicity or ability to contribute to 
ground-level ozone formation. The Agency's risk screen analyzes these effects, and the 
SNAP determinations generally describe as acceptable those substitutes for which risks from 
replacements would be lower on an overall basis compared to risks from other existing 
alternatives, or for which such risks could be managed by developing and implementing 
appropriate regulatory controls. Additionally, in cases where the Agency has listed a 
substitute as unacceptable, it has assessed_as required in section 612_the availability of other 
substitutes and concluded that alternatives with reduced overall risk are currently or 
potentially available. 

As a rule, the Agency did not evaluate the technical performance of a substitute, since 
the purpose of the SNAP program is to examine environmental effects of substitutes identified 
as being of commercial interest regardless of technical acceptability. However, in certain 
sectors, performance of the substitute does pertain directly to environmental or health effects. 
For example, in refrigeration, the ability of a refrigerant replacement to serve as a coolant will 
directly influence the substitute's energy efficiency, which in turn will affect the substitute's 
environmental effects. Similarly, in fire suppression, the ability of a substitute to put out fires 
and thereby save human lives will directly affect a substitute's health effects. Further, in the 
case of narrowed use listings, the Agency's decision to grant or deny a narrowed use petition 
may hinge on the ability of potential substitutes to meet technical performance criteria. For 
example, in the case of certain specialized solvents, some substitutes otherwise considered 
unacceptable may require special consideration because they are the only available substitute 
offering performance characteristics deemed essential in a certain application. In cases such 
as these, the SNAP analyses do consider the performance of a substitute as necessary. 

EPA's evaluation of each substitute in an end use is based on the following types of 
information and analyses: 

 Atmospheric effects are assessed by predicting ozone depletion and analyzing total 
global warming potential, including chemical properties relevant to global warming. 
Ozone depletion is based on market penetration of a substitute and is measured in 
terms of cumulative Cl

x

 loadings and its effect in terms of increased incidence of skin 
cancer cases and skin cancer mortalities. Analysis of total global warming potential 
includes changes consideration of inherent properties such as atmospheric lifetime and 
absorption spectra, as measured by the GWP index, and from changes in fossil fuel 
use due to increases or decreases in energy efficiency resulting from production or use 
of the substitutes. Atmospheric lifetime is considered as an indicator of the likely 
persistence of an environmental effect or of the time lag to reverse any known or 
unknown effect associated with an emission. The model used by the Agency to 
determine atmospheric effects_the Atmospheric Stabilization Framework model_has 
been used by the Agency in calculating the benefits from the phase-out of class I 
substances. The model was peer-reviewed in connection with this earlier analysis. 

Although scientific studies have pointed to the possibility of ecological effects due to 
ozone depletion, such as crop damage, the scope of existing studies is limited and 
therefore these effects were not part of this analysis. 

 Exposure assessments are used to estimate concentration levels of substitutes to 
which workers, consumers, the general population, and environmental receptors may 
be exposed, and over what period of time. These assessments are based on personal 
monitoring data or area sampling data if available. Otherwise, exposures are assessed 
using measured or estimated releases as inputs to mathematical models. Exposure 
assessments may be conducted for many types of releases, including releases in the 
workplace and in homes, releases to ambient air and surface water, and releases from 
the management of solid wastes. 

 Toxicity data are used to assess the possible health and environmental effects from 
exposure to the substitutes. If Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA)-approved or EPA-wide health-based criteria such as Permissible Exposure 
Limits (PELs, for occupational exposure), inhalation reference concentrations (RfCs, 
for noncarcinogenic effects), or cancer slope factors (for carcinogenic risk) are 
available for a substitute, exposure information is combined with this toxicity 
information to explore any basis for concern. Otherwise, toxicity data are used with 
existing EPA guidelines to develop health-based criteria for interim use in these risk 
characterizations. 

 Flammability is examined as a possible safety concern for workers and consumers. 
EPA assesses flammability risk using data on flash point and flammability limits (e.g., 
OSHA flammability/combustibility classifications), data on testing of blends with 
flammable components, test data on flammability in consumer applications conducted 
by independent laboratories, and information on flammability risk minimization 
techniques. 

 Some of the substitutes are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), chemicals that 
increase tropospheric air pollution by contributing to ground-level ozone formation. 
Local and nationwide increases in VOC loadings from the use of substitutes is also 
evaluated.

<TEXT>
 

In conducting these assessments, EPA made full use of previous analyses performed by the Agency, including EPA's
1990 interim hazard assessments and supporting documentation. These analyses were modified in some cases to incorporate
more recent data, such as data received in public comment on the May 12, 1993 NPRM, or to accommodate different analytical
approaches as needed. Finally, these analyses assume that the regulated community complies with applicable requirements
of other statutes and regulations administered by EPA (e.g., recycling requirements promulgated under the CAA)
and other Federal agencies (e.g., any occupational exposure limits set by OSHA). 



Acceptable substitutes within specific use sectors may be listed as hazardous wastes or, because of flammability,
corrosivity, reactivity or toxicity characteristics, must be managed as hazardous wastes. The regulatory status
of three chlorinated hydrocarbons (trichloroethylene, methylene chloride, perchloroethylene) which could serve
as substitutes for ODCs are highlighted in section IX. of this final rule. However, other chemicals listed as acceptable
substitutes are also RCRA-regulated, and the RCRA regulations should be consulted when application of a specific
substitute for an ozone-depleting substance is being considered. 

Should additional data become available that would help characterize the risks of substitutes, the Agency will incorporate
this data into its risk screens. For example, the risk screen does not at present include assessment of the environmental
transformation products of substitutes. Research efforts of the Agency in cooperation with the Alternative Fluorocarbons
Environmental Acceptability Study (AFEAS) are in progress and are intended to define the chemical, biological and
photochemical sinks for these substances in the biosphere. Ultimately, these research activities will contribute
to the development of more complete ecological risk assessments for substitutes. However, the Agency generally
does not believe that a more detailed characterization of risks would lead to a different listing decision for individual
substitutes unless effects are characterized as highly severe, since the critical comparison for policy purposes
remains the adverse effects posed by continued use of a class I compound. 

The listing of acceptable and unacceptable substitutes under SNAP will continue. Thus, if a company is not yet able
to provide the Agency with the information needed to complete a review of a substitute, a review can be completed in
the future, when data become available. Once the data are complete, Agency review will begin, as discussed in sections
IV. through IX. of this final rule. 



B. Format for SNAP Determinations 



Sections IX.D. through IX.K. below present the decisions on acceptability of substitutes that EPA has made based
on available information and the evaluation criteria (see Section V of this final rule). These sections describe
the sector end-uses (e.g., industrial process refrigeration), the substitutes evaluated, the decision (i.e.,
acceptable or unacceptable) and associated rationale, any conditions for or limitations on the use of a substitute,
and any general comments. 

In most cases, the end-use descriptions have been written broadly to encompass numerous industrial applications
or uses. Based on discussions with industry, the Agency felt that this approach was preferable to listing substitutes
by narrowly-defined applications, which would increase needlessly the number of SNAP notices that would be received
by the Agency. The objective of section 612 is to ensure that replacement of class I and II substances with available
substitutes will reduce adverse effects on human health and the environment. In general, the Agency can look at exposures
from very broad classifications of use (e.g., metals cleaning) and perform the screening analysis to ensure that
this statutory objective is being met. It is not necessary or helpful, for example, to list acceptable substitutes
by each specific type of metal being cleaned in the solvents cleaning sector. This is especially true when conservative
assumptions used in the screening analysis demonstrate the acceptability of an alternative in a wide range of end-uses.
Where possible, the substitutes presented in sections D. through K. have been identified by their chemical name.
Generally speaking, EPA has not listed substitutes by product or company name in order to avoid implied endorsement
of one substitute over another. However, there are two circumstances in which specific chemical names have not been
included. First, where proprietary blends have been identified as substitutes, the Agency has worked with the manufacturers
to identify generic ways in which the substitute could be listed. Before a user invests in a substitute in these categories,
they may wish to contact the SNAP program to confirm that the specific substitute they intend to use has been reviewed
and found acceptable by EPA. EPA believes that if a potential user identifies the substitute by a product name that
EPA has on record, but was not included on the list for the reasons stated above, EPA can confirm the listing of the substitute
without violating safeguards important to protect any proprietary business information provided in confidence
to the Agency. 


The second situation in which EPA does not anticipate listing specific chemicals arises in the solvents cleaning
sector, primarily for aqueous and semi-aqueous cleaners. In this area, numerous cleaning formulations exist and
are comprised of a wide variety of chemicals. As discussed in the section below on solvents cleaning alternatives
(see section IX.F.), the Agency performed its screening assessment by identifying representative chemicals. These
were then used to screen a wide variety of chemicals grouped into categories of solvent-cleaning constituents (e.g.,
saponifiers, surfactants, etc.). Information on these chemicals presented in the risk screen was used as a basis
for determining that aqueous and semi-aqueous cleaners present lower risk than the chemicals they are replacing.


EPA has selected this strategy for listing as acceptable aqueous and semi-aqueous cleaners for several reasons.
First, it should minimize the need to submit SNAP notices for blends of compounds that are combinations of the chemicals
which have already been approved. Second, it will allow EPA to avoid listing proprietary formulations. 


Any conditions for use included in listing decisions are part of the decision to identify a substitute as acceptable.
Thus, users would be considered out of compliance if using a substitute listed as acceptable without adhering to the
conditions EPA has stipulated for acceptable use of the alternative. Alternatively, where restrictions are set
which narrow the acceptable applications within an end-use, a user would be considered out of compliance if using
the compound in an end-use application where such use is unacceptable. Conditions, if any, are listed when it is clear
that a substitute can only be used safely if certain precautions are maintained. As noted previously, any conditions
will be imposed in the listing of substitutes as acceptable through rulemaking. 


The comments contained in the table of listing decisions found in summary form in Appendix B provide additional information
on a substitute. Since comments are not part of the regulatory decision, they are not mandatory for use of a substitute.
Nor should the comments be considered comprehensive with respect to other legal obligations pertaining to the use
of the substitute. However, EPA encourages users of acceptable substitutes to apply any comments in their use of these
substitutes. In many instances, the comments simply allude to sound operating practices that have already been identified
in existing industry and/or building-code standards. Thus, many of the comments, if adopted, would not require significant
changes in existing operating practices for the affected industry.

Recently, the Agency has become aware of substitute mixtures that are being marketed as replacements for both class
I and II chemicals. In situations where these mixtures are a combination of class I and II chemicals, they may serve
as transitional chemicals because they offer environmental advantages in that they have a lower combined ODP than
use of a class I compound by itself. However, where EPA has identified a non-ozone depleting alternative that reduces
overall risk to human health and the environment, mixtures of class I and II substances shall be unacceptable or subject
to use limits. 


There have been a few instances in which mixtures of class I and II chemicals have been marketed as replacements for
class II chemicals. Because the ODP of such alternatives is clearly higher than the class II substances, the Agency
is prohibiting the use of any class I and class II mixture as a replacement for a class II chemical. Where the Agency is
aware of specific mixtures falling into this category, they are listed by individual use sector below. The remainder
of this section presents the initial listing decisions for each of the following end use sectors:




 
D. Refrigeration and Air Conditioning 
E. Foam Blowing 
F. Solvents Cleaning 
G. Fire Suppression and Explosion Protection 
H. Sterilants 
I. Aerosols 
J. Tobacco Expansion 
K. Adhesives, Coatings and Inks 


D. Refrigeration and Air Conditioning 


1. Overview 


The refrigeration and air conditioning sector includes all uses of Class I and Class II substances to transfer heat.
Most end-uses in this sector involve mechanically moving heat from a cool region to a warmer one. For example, a car's
air conditioner moves heat from the cooled interior to the hot ambient air. 

This sector also includes heat transfer end-uses, i.e. those uses of Class I and Class II substances to move heat from
a warm region to a cool one. For example, CFC-114 is currently used to remove excess heat from a very hot uranium
enrichment process to cooler ambient air. Hence, the process requires no additional energy, and does not create refrigeration
by mechanical means. 


Mechanical systems generally use a vapor compression cycle. However, several alternative cycles have been used
for decades; these and other alternatives are being re-examined in light of the phaseout of commonly used CFC-based
refrigerants in 1996. Substitutes reviewed under SNAP may use alternative cycles; review is not restricted solely
to applications based on replacing the working fluid in vapor compression equipment. Similarly, simple heat transfer
end-uses will also be included. 

The refrigeration and air conditioning sector is divided into the following end-uses: 

 Commercial comfort air conditioning; 
 Industrial process refrigeration systems; 
 Industrial process air conditioning;
 Ice skating rinks; 
 Uranium isotope separation processing; 
 Cold storage warehouses; 
 Refrigerated transport; 
 Retail food refrigeration; 
 Vending machines; 
 Water coolers; 
 Commercial ice machines; 
 Household refrigerators; 
 Household freezers; 
 Residential dehumidifiers; 
 Motor vehicle air conditioning; 
 Residential air conditioning and heat pumps; and 
 Heat transfer. 
EPA has not necessarily reviewed substitutes in every end-use. 
The following discussion provides some distinctions among the various end-uses in the refrigeration and air conditioning
sector. 

a. 

Chillers.

 CFCs are used in several different types of mechanical commercial comfort air conditioning systems, known as chillers.
These chillers cool water, which is then circulated through a building. They can be classified by compressor type,
including centrifugal, reciprocating, scroll, screw, and rotary. The selection of a particular compressor type
generally depends on the cooling capacity required. Reciprocating and scroll compressors are used in small capacity
applications (less than 200 tons), screw compressors are used in medium capacity applications (50 to 400 tons), and
centrifugal compressors are used in large capacity applications (greater than 300 tons). The majority of the chillers
used in the United States are centrifugal chillers. Chillers have a lifetime of 23 to 40 years. EPA anticipates that
over time, existing cooling capacity will be either retrofitted or replaced by systems using non-CFC refrigerants
in a vapor compression cycle or by alternative technologies. 

b. 

Industrial process refrigeration systems.

 Many industrial applications require cooling of process streams. These applications include systems designed
to operate in a wide temperature range. Included within this category are industrial ice machines and ice rinks. The
choice of substitute for specific applications depends on ambient and required operating temperatures and pressures.



c. 

Ice skating rinks.

 Skating rinks frequently use secondary refrigeration loops. They are used by the general public for recreational
purposes. 

d. 

Industrial process air conditioning.

 Ambient temperatures near 200 degrees Fahrenheit and corrosive conditions make this application distinct from
commercial and residential air conditioning. Units in this end-use provide comfort cooling for operators and protect
process equipment. 

e. 

Uranium isotope separation processing. 

This end-use includes operation of a heat transfer cycle to cool uranium isotope separation processing. Substitutes
must meet an extremely rigorous set of criteria to be applicable in this end-use.

f. 

Cold storage warehouses. 

Cold storage warehouses are used to store meat, produce, dairy products and other perishable goods. The majority
of cold storage warehouses in the United States use ammonia as the refrigerant in a vapor compression cycle.

g. 

Refrigerated transport.

 Refrigerated transport moves products from one place and climatic condition to another, and include refrigerated
ship holds, truck trailers, railway freight cars, and other shipping containers. Refrigerated transport systems
are affected by a number of inherent complications not found with other refrigeration and air conditioning end-uses.
In route, the refrigerated units may be subject to a broad range of ambient temperatures. Engine-driven transport
units suffer power interruptions when either the unit or the vehicle is out of use for brief periods of time (e.g., loading
and unloading and fuel stops). Refrigerated units are designed to provide the maximum amount of space available for
containment of the product to be transported. Refrigerated transport equipment must be versatile to allow for the
different temperature requirements for the different products (e.g., ice cream versus fresh produce) which may
be transported.

h. 

Retail Food Refrigeration.

 This end-use includes all cold storage cases designed to chill food for commercial sale. Equipment in this end-use
is generally designed for two temperature regimes: Low temperature cases operating below freezing and medium temperature
units merely chilling food. In addition to grocery cases, the end-use includes convenience store reach-in cases
and restaurant walk-in refrigerators. Icemakers in these locations are discussed under commercial ice machines.

i. 

Vending machines.

 Vending machines are self-contained units which dispense goods that must be kept cold or frozen. Like equipment in
other end-uses, the choice of substitute will strongly depend on ambient conditions and the required operating temperature.

j. 

Water coolers. 

Water coolers are also self-contained and provide chilled water for drinking. They may or may not feature detachable
containers of water.

k. 

Commercial ice machines. 

These units are used in commercial establishments to produce ice for consumer use, e.g., in hotels, restaurants,
and convenience stores. Thus, the cleanliness of the ice is important. In addition, the machines are typically smaller
in size than industrial equipment. Commercial ice machines are typically connected to a building's water supply.

l. 

Household refrigerators.

 Household refrigerators are intended primarily for residential use, although they may be used outside the home.
Approximately 159 million units exist in the U.S., where the average residential refrigerator is an 18.4 ft

3

 automatic defrost unit with a top mounted freezer. Cooling is provided by a conventional single evaporator unit in
a vapor compression cycle. The evaporator is located in the freezer compartment, and cooling to both compartments
is typically achieved by mechanically driven air exchange between the compartments.

m. 

Household freezers. 

Household freezers only offer storage space at freezing temperatures, unlike household refrigerators. Two model
types, upright and chest, provide a wide range of sizes.

n. 

Residential dehumidifiers. 

Residential dehumidifiers are primarily used to remove water vapor from ambient air for comfort purposes. While
air conditioning systems often combine cooling and dehumidification, this application serves only the latter purpose.
Since air is cooled as it flows over the evaporator, it loses moisture through condensation. It is then warmed as it
passes over the condenser coil. Dehumidifiers actually slightly warm the surrounding air, since the compressor
adds heat to the cycle.

o. 

Motor vehicle air conditioning. 

Motor vehicle air conditioning systems (MVACS) provide comfort cooling for passengers in cars, buses, planes, trains,
and other forms of transportation. MVACS pose risks related to widely varying ambient conditions, accidents, do-it-yourself
maintenance, and the location of the evaporator inside the passenger compartment. Given the large number of cars
in the nation's fleet, and the variety of designs, new substitutes must be used in accordance with established retrofit
procedures.

Flammability is a concern in all applications, but the conditions of use and the potential for accidents in this end-use
increase the likelihood of a fire. In addition, the number of car owners who perform their own routine maintenance
means that more people will be exposed to potential hazards. Current systems are not designed to use flammable refrigerants.

p. 

Residential air conditioning and heat pumps. 

HCFC-22, a class II substance, is the dominant working fluid in residential air conditioning and heat pumps.
This end-use includes both central units and window air conditioners. SNAP will begin analyzing class II substance
substitutes in the near future. Results of these analyses will appear in quarterly updates in the 

Federal Register

.

q. 

Heat transfer. 

This end-use includes all cooling systems that rely on convection to remove heat from an area, rather than relying
on mechanical refrigeration. There are, generally speaking, two types of systems: Systems with fluid pumps, referred
to as recirculating coolers, and those that rely on natural convection currents, referred to as thermosiphons.



2. Substitutes for Refrigerants



Substitutes fall into eight broad categories. Seven of these categories are chemical substitutes generally used
in the same cycle as the ozone-depleting substances they replace. They include hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs),
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), hydrocarbons, blends of refrigerants, ammonia, perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and chlorine
systems. The eighth category includes alternative technologies that generally do not rely on vapor compression
cycles.

a. 

Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). 

EPA believes that hydrochlorofluorocarbons have an important role to play as transitional refrigerants. HCFCs
are chemically similar to CFCs except that they contain hydrogen in addition to chlorine and fluorine. Because their
thermophysical properties are, in many cases, similar to CFCs, equipment designed to use CFCs can often be retrofitted
to operate with HCFCs. In addition, new equipment can be designed specifically for these compounds.

HCFCs contribute to the destruction of stratospheric ozone, but to a much lesser extent than CFCs. Use of HCFCs as transitional
refrigerants will allow industry to move away from CFCs more rapidly and, therefore, will offer significant environmental
and health benefits over the continued use of CFCs. Because they contain hydrogen, the HCFCs break down more easily
in the atmosphere than do CFCs, and therefore have lower ODPs. Their global warming potentials are also lower than
those for the CFCs. Production of HCFCs is controlled under the international agreement set forth in the Montreal
Protocol, which is being implemented in the U.S. through the Clean Air Act. HCFCs were initially scheduled to be phased
out by 2030. As a result of growing evidence indicating greater risks of ozone depletion, however, the international
community agreed in Copenhagen in November 1992 to accelerate the phaseout of the ozone-depleting compounds, including
HCFCs. As a result, EPA published an accelerated phaseout of HCFCs on December 10, 1993 (58 FR 65018). The proposed
accelerated schedule places production and consumption limits on the most potent ozone-depleting HCFCs first,
with the production of HCFCs with lower ozone depletion potentials (ODPs) permitted over a longer period of time.
There are clear environmental and health benefits to be gained by allowing near-term use of HCFCs until substitutes
with zero ODP are developed.

b. 

Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). 

Hydrofluorocarbons do not contain chlorine and do not contribute to destruction of stratospheric ozone. However,
some HFCs do have significant global warming potentials (GWPs). Although a few HFCs have been in use for some time,
the potential for HFCs as a replacement for CFCs has grown rapidly over the last several years. EPA is concerned that
rapid expansion of the use of some HFCs could contribute to global warming. Nonetheless, HFCs as a class offer lower
overall risk than continued use of CFCs, as well as a near-term option for moving away from CFCs.

c. 

Hydrocarbons. 

Hydrocarbons do not contain chlorine or bromine; they therefore also have zero ODP. Hydrocarbons degrade in the lower
atmosphere, contributing to ground-level pollution such as smog, but they do not contribute directly to global warming.
Propane, ethane, propylene, and to some extent butane are used as refrigerants in specialized industrial applications,
primarily in oil refineries and chemical plants, where they are frequently available as part of the process stream
and where their use contributes only a slight increment to the overall risk of fire or explosion. Because of the overall
risks, these systems are designed to meet rigid requirements for reliability, durability, and safety.

Hydrocarbon refrigerants are also used in some home appliances. In general, they are effective refrigerants and
may provide some gains in efficiency over CFCs. EPA believes refrigeration end-uses may exist for this class of compounds,
but such determinations will require analysis of appropriate controls to address the risk of fire.

d. 

Blends. 

Blends of refrigerants offer significant opportunities for alternatives to class I substances. The number of single-substance
substitutes is limited; combinations greatly expand the number of possible refrigerants. By varying the concentrations
of the constituents, manufacturers may design blends for specific end-uses.

Blends generally fall into two categories: azeotropes and zeotropes. Azeotropes behave like single refrigerants
under normal conditions. They boil and condense at constant temperature and do not change composition across a phase
change. Zeotropes, however, exhibit temperature glide, meaning that as the refrigerant flows across a heat exchanger,
the temperature changes in response to differential boiling or condensing of different constituents in the blend.
Known as fractionation, this process may pose additional risks if any of the blend's components are flammable, even
if the blend as formulated is not. On the other hand, equipment designed to take advantage of zeotropic blends may reap
energy efficiency gains. EPA expects blends to play an important role in the transition away from ODSs.

<TEXT>
 

In some cases, the specific components of blends, as well as their proportions, are confidential business information;
in others, only the proportions are confidential. With respect to both types of blends, however, listings in this
final rule and in future updates will refer to only those blends which have been submitted for review. Although several
companies may submit blends with the same components, only those compositions specifically reviewed under SNAP
will be listed as acceptable. ASHRAE has issued numerical designations for many blends. All blends will be assigned
a generic name for use in public notices. Substitutes that were included in the proposed rule will retain the same generic
names, but the listing will include any available ASHRAE designations. Blends submitted since the proposed rule
will be listed using the ASHRAE designation when available. If ASHRAE has not issued its designation, they will be
assigned new names. In most cases, the discussion in the listings will include the blends' components. Blends that
contain HCFCs will be labeled ``HCFC Blend Alpha'', ``HCFC Blend Beta'', etc. This designation is intended to ease
identification of blends which must be handled in accordance with other regulations described below. Blends that
have zero ODP will be given similar names that describe their major components. An information sheet listing the trade
names and manufacturers of the blends, along with a vendor list, may be obtained by contacting the SNAP refrigerants
sector expert.

e. 

Ammonia.

 Ammonia has been used as a medium to low temperature refrigerant in vapor compression cycles for more than 100 years.
Ammonia has excellent refrigerant properties, a characteristic pungent odor, no long-term atmospheric risks,
and low cost. It is, however, moderately flammable and toxic, although it is not a cumulative poison. OSHA standards
specify a 15 minute short-term exposure limit of 35 ppm for ammonia.

Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in meat packing, chicken processing, dairy, frozen juice, brewery, cold storage,
and other food processing and industrial applications. It is also widely used to refrigerate holds in fishing vessels.
Some absorption refrigeration and air conditioning systems use ammonia as well.

f. 

Perfluorocarbons.

 Unlike CFCs, HCFCs or HFCs, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are fully fluorinated compounds. The principal environmental
characteristic of concern for these compounds is that they have extremely long atmospheric lifetimes, often orders
of magnitude longer than those of the CFCs. These long lifetimes cause the PFCs to have very high global warming potentials.
Technology for containment and recycling of PFCs is commercially available and is recommended by manufacturers
to offset any possible adverse environmental effects.

One advantage of the PFCs is that, like HFCs, they do not contribute to ozone depletion. In addition, these chemicals
are nonflammable and exhibit low toxicity, and they are not subject to federal regulations concerning volatile organic
compounds (VOCs), since they do not contribute to ground-level ozone formation.

The Agency anticipates that in widespread use, these compounds pose higher overall risk compared to other available
alternatives because of their relatively long lifetimes and associated high GWPs. Because of these concerns, the
Agency has found acceptable only certain narrowly defined uses of perfluorinated compounds, prohibiting their
use where other alternatives with lower overall risk are available. EPA has described these limited acceptable uses
as specifically as possible. Further, users should be aware that, because of the environmental concerns detailed
above, any proposed uses of PFCs outside those described in this final rule should be submitted for future review under
SNAP.

g. 

Chlorine.

 Chlorine was listed in the proposed regulation as an alternative refrigerant in chlorine liquefaction, a processing
step in the manufacture of the chemical. When chilled below its boiling point, chlorine can be stored as a liquid at
atmospheric pressure, a method that for safety reasons is preferable to storing the chemical as a pressured gas at
ambient temperatures. Although the refrigeration system will generally be physically separate from the actual
chlorine process stream, compatibility of the refrigerant with liquid chlorine is critical because of chlorine's
high reactivity. CFC-12 has been widely used because it does not react with chlorine.

Systems using chlorine as a refrigerant require specialized compressors designed to resist chemical attack by liquid
and gaseous chlorine. EPA has determined that chlorine can be safely used in refrigeration systems associated with
chlorine-containing industrial process streams. Such systems must be designed and operated with the same safety
considerations that apply to the process stream. In particular, OSHA regulates this use under its standard for Process
Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119).

h. 

Alternative technologies.

 Several technologies already exist as alternatives to equipment using class I substances. As a result of the CFC phaseout,
they are gaining prominence in the transition away from CFCs. Examples of these technologies include evaporative
cooling, desiccant cooling, and absorption refrigeration and air conditioning. In addition, several technologies
are currently under development. Significant progress has expanded the applicability of these alternatives, and
their environmental benefits generally include zero ODP and low direct GWP. In addition, evaporative cooling offers
significant energy savings, which results in reduced indirect GWP.



3. Comment Response



a. 

Comments on acceptable substitutes.

 A commenter opposed listing the use of HCFC-123 as acceptable because of toxicity concerns. EPA has conducted
worker exposure studies which indicate that exposure can be limited to 1 ppm, substantially below the industry-established
acceptable exposure limit (AEL) of 30 ppm. Based on these studies, EPA remains confident that HCFC-123 can be
used safely when standard industrial hygiene practices are followed. It is important to note, too, that the AEL is
a long-term exposure limit. Safety measures to limit short-term exposures are important for all refrigerants.

Another commenter informed EPA that chlorine-based refrigeration systems are generally physically separated
from chlorine-containing process streams. This separation invalidates the analogy to hydrocarbon-based systems
for industrial process refrigeration. Hence, EPA's final determination that chlorine is acceptable for this end-use
includes the acknowledgement of OSHA standards dictating safety considerations in the design and operation of such
systems.

b. 

Other comments.

 Several commenters requested additional end-use categories, while others requested greater aggregation. Some
aggregation is necessary to minimize confusion and the analysis of small differences among similar applications.
Yet EPA also recognizes that certain end-uses are fundamentally different from others. In the NPRM, EPA identified
major end-uses within the refrigeration and air conditioning sector. For purposes of the final rule, EPA is reluctant
to change the end-use categories from those listed in the proposed rule. Retaining the original end-uses serves the
goal of creating the certainty needed to encourage transition away from ozone-depleting substances.

However, this final rule does combine substitute listings for various refrigerants within each end-use. For example,
industrial process refrigeration now includes substitutes for CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502. The
risk screens conducted by EPA analyzed the use of substitutes within an end-use; the chemical being replaced was usually
not relevant to the analysis. Because it may be important to distinguish among substitutes for certain substances
if they exhibit significantly different operational characteristics, such as condensing pressure or typical ambient
conditions, the listings do not combine centrifugal chillers into one end-use. Rather, retrofitted CFC-11,
CFC-12, CFC-113, and CFC-114 chillers remain separate.

A commenter proposed that all blends consisting of individually acceptable components be deemed acceptable. EPA
believes that blends pose analytical difficulties not encountered with single refrigerants. Blends, unlike single
compounds, have the potential to separate into components during normal use and during leaks. This process is called
fractionation, and it is caused by differences in vapor pressure among the constituents.

For example, as a zeotropic blend enters the evaporator, it is a liquid until it absorbs enough heat to reach the boiling
point of the component with the highest vapor pressure. As this portion boils away, the remaining components will
have a higher overall boiling point, and the temperature will rise until the second component begins to vaporize.
This process may continue until all the refrigerant is in vapor phase, or some may remain a liquid even at the exit from
the evaporator. Azeotropes and near-azeotropes, however, exhibit small changes in temperature in these two-phase
parts of the system, and do not undergo significant composition changes during normal use.

During normal operation, pressure across the condenser and evaporator remains relatively constant. During a leak,
however, system pressure decreases. In addition, the refrigerant is exposed to ambient temperatures. As a result,
fractionation is possible during a leak when both vapor and liquid are present, even for azeotropes.

As with all substitutes, flammability and materials compatibility testing are necessary for blends. For azeotropes,
these data are necessary for the single composition during normal operation. For zeotropes, such testing is necessary
at all compositions occurring during normal operation. In addition, such tests should be conducted during multi-phase
leaks for all blends to determine the extent and effects of fractionation. Even if the blend is nonflammable as formulated,
enrichment of a flammable component through fractionation could result in a flammable mixture. In addition, materials
compatible with the blend as formulated may not retain that compatibility if fractionation results in a substantially
different composition. Therefore, EPA believes it is not appropriate to automatically find all blends of acceptable
components also acceptable. Only specific compositions will be designated acceptable, as described earlier.

Several commenters believed EPA was unclear in its distinctions between new and 
retrofit substitutes. In response, EPA has clarified this difference in this final rule. A tension 
exists between deeming substitutes acceptable for as wide a range of end-uses as possible and 
providing some guidance to users on effective substitutes. 
Several commenters suggested duplicating listings for retrofits and new equipment, but 
that duplication does not always serve the goal of disseminating information about viable 
substitutes. Certain substances may not be attractive for long-term use because they contain 
HCFCs, and thus may only be listed for retrofits. Alternatively, substitutes may not be easily 
implemented as a retrofit. It should be noted, however, that an acceptability determination for 
use in new equipment or as a retrofit option does not imply that the alternative is 
unacceptable for use in the other category. 
The retrofit category within each end-use refers to the use of substitutes with some 
modification to existing equipment but without changing every component. Generally 
speaking, retrofit refrigerants will not require completely new systems or redesign. Drop-in 
replacements require minimal retrofitting, as in cases where only the refrigerant needs to be 
replaced. 
The new equipment category within each end-use refers to the use of substitutes in 
entirely new systems. No existing components will be used. This designation may be used 
for refrigerants which may require significant design changes. For example, use of a 
flammable substitute may require some design changes to mitigate potential risk. Submitters 
must demonstrate how those risks can be addressed in new designs. In addition, alternative 
technologies often require entirely different systems. For example, evaporative cooling does 
not use a vapor compression cycle, and therefore cannot be used as a retrofit option. 
For purposes of submissions, the retrofit and new use categories should be considered 
separate end-uses and listed separately on the submission form. 


4. Listing Decisions 


a. 

Acceptable substitutes. 


These determinations are based on data submitted to EPA and on the risk screen 
described in the draft background document entitled ``Risk Screen on the Use of Substitutes 
for Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances: Refrigerants''. In accordance with the guiding 
principles for SNAP, substitutes were compared both to the substance they replace and to 
each other. 
EPA believes the use of all acceptable substitutes presents lower overall risk than the 
continued use of an ozone-depleting substance. Not all substitutes will necessarily be 
appropriate choices for all systems within an end-use. Engineering decisions must take into 
account factors such as operating temperatures and pressures, ambient conditions, and age of 
equipment, especially during retrofits. For example, under industrial process refrigeration, 
both HFC-134a and HCFC-22 are listed as acceptable for retrofits. However, these 
substances exhibit significantly different thermodynamic characteristics, and both may not be 
appropriate for use within a given system. EPA believes such decisions are most 
appropriately made by the equipment owner, manager, or contractor. 
Users of HCFCs should be aware that an acceptability determination shall not be 
construed to release any user from compliance with all other regulations pertaining to class II 
substances. These include: (a) The prohibition against venting during servicing under section 
608, which was effective July 1, 1992; (b) recycling requirements under section 608, which 
were effective July 13, 1993; (c) section 609 regulations regarding MVACS which were 
effective August 13, 1992; and (d) the revised production phaseout of class II substances 
under section 606, which was published on December 10, 1993. In addition, users of 
non-chlorine refrigerants should be aware that an acceptability determination shall not be 
construed to release any user from conformance with the venting prohibition under section 
608(c)(2), which takes effect November 15, 1995, at the latest. 
Substitutes are listed as acceptable by end-use. These substitutes have only been 
found acceptable for use in the specific end-uses for which they have been reviewed, as 
described in this section. Users of blends should be aware that EPA has evaluated and found 
acceptable in each case only the specific percentage composition submitted for review; no 
others have been evaluated. EPA strongly recommends that users of alternative refrigerants 
adhere to the provisions of ASHRAE Standard 15_Safety Code for Mechanical 
Refrigeration. ASHRAE Standard 34_Number Designation and Safety Classification of 
Refrigerants is a useful reference on refrigerant numerical designations. Users are also 
strongly encouraged to contain, recycle, or reclaim all refrigerants. 
(1) 

CFC-11 Centrifugal Chillers, Retrofit. 


(a) 

HCFC-123. 


HCFC-123 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11 in retrofitted centrifugal chillers. 
Because HCFC-123 contributes to ozone depletion, it is considered a transitional alternative. 
Since it poses much lower ozone-depleting risk than continued use of CFCs, EPA has 
determined that its use is acceptable for these end-uses. In addition, HCFC-123's GWP and 
atmospheric lifetime are significantly lower than almost any other alternatives. HCFC-123 is 
not flammable. Since HCFC-123 is classified as a B1 refrigerant pursuant to ASHRAE 
standard 34, ASHRAE requires that a refrigerant vapor detector be placed in the machinery 
room. EPA strongly recommends that users of HCFC-123 adhere to this requirement and any 
other requirements provided in ASHRAE Standards 15 and 34. Worker-monitoring studies 
conducted by EPA demonstrate that HCFC-123's 8-hour time-weighted average concentration 
can be maintained at or under 1 ppm (less than the industry-established AEL of 30 ppm), 
provided that such standards are followed.

CFC-12 Centrifugal Chillers, Retrofit. 


(a) 

HFC-134a. 


HFC-134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-12 in retrofitted centrifugal chillers. 
HFC-134a does not contribute to ozone depletion. HFC-134a's GWP and atmospheric 
lifetime are close to those of other alternatives which are acceptable in this end-use. While 
HFC-134a is compatible with most existing refrigeration and air conditioning equipment parts, 
it is not compatible with the mineral oils currently used in such systems. An ester-based 
lubricant should be used rather than mineral oils. 
(3) 

CFC-113 Centrifugal Chillers, Retrofit.

 
No substitutes have been identified for CFC-113 in retrofitted centrifugal chillers. 
(4) 

CFC-114 Centrifugal Chillers, Retrofit. 


(a) 

HCFC-124. 


HCFC-124 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-114 in retrofitted centrifugal chillers. 
Because HCFC-124 contributes to ozone depletion, it is considered a transitional alternative. 
However, it represents a much lower ozone-depleting risk than the continued use of CFCs. In 
addition, HCFC-124's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are significantly lower than other 
alternatives. HCFC-124 is not flammable. 
(5) 

R-500 Centrifugal Chillers, Retrofit. 


(a) 

HFC-134a. 


HFC-134a is acceptable as a substitute for R-500 in retrofitted centrifugal chillers. 
See the discussion on HFC-134a under retrofitted CFC-12 centrifugal chillers. 
(6) 

CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-114, and R-500 
Centrifugal Chillers, New. 


(a) 

HCFC-123. 


HCFC-123 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-114, and 
R-500 in new centrifugal chillers. See the discussion on HCFC-123 under retrofitted CFC-11 
centrifugal chillers. 
(b) 

HCFC-124. 


HCFC-124 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-114 in new centrifugal chillers. See 
the discussion on HCFC-124 under retrofitted CFC-114 centrifugal chillers. 
(c) 

HCFC-22. 


HCFC-22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-114, and 
R-500 in new centrifugal chillers. HCFC-22 has been used in a variety of air conditioning 
and refrigeration applications for many years. Like HCFC-123, HCFC-22 contributes to 
ozone depletion and is considered a transitional alternative. HCFC-22 exhibits a higher ODP 
than HCFC-123, and production of it will be phased out according to the accelerated phase 
out schedule. HCFC-22's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are higher than other HCFCs. 
HCFC-22 is not flammable and is it compatible with existing oils used in most refrigeration 
and air conditioning equipment. 
(d) 

HFC-134a. 


HFC-134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-114, and 
R-500 in new centrifugal chillers. See the discussion on HFC-134a under retrofitted CFC-12 
centrifugal chillers. 
(e) 

HFC-227ea. 


HFC-227ea is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-114, and 
R-500 in new centrifugal chillers. HFC-227ea is a new chemical that has not seen 
widespread use. It contains no chlorine, so it does not contribute to ozone depletion. 
HFC-227ea's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are higher than those of other alternatives which 
are acceptable in this end-use. HFC-227ea is also being investigated as a component of 
several blends. 
(f) 

Ammonia. 


Ammonia is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-114, and 
R-500 in new centrifugal chillers. Ammonia does not deplete the ozone or contribute to 
global warming. Ammonia is flammable and toxic, but it may be used safely if existing 
OSHA and ASHRAE standards are followed. Users should check local building codes related 
to the use of ammonia. 
(g) 

Evaporative cooling. 


Evaporative Cooling is acceptable as an alternative technology to centrifugal chillers 
using CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-114, or R-500. Evaporative cooling does not 
contribute to ozone depletion or global warming and has the potential to be more energy 
efficient than current refrigeration and air conditioning systems. Evaporative cooling uses no 
chemicals, but relies instead on water evaporation as a means of cooling. It is in widespread 
use in office buildings in the western U.S. Recent design improvements have greatly 
expanded its applicability to other regions. 
(h) 

Desiccant cooling. 


Desiccant cooling is acceptable as an alternative technology to centrifugal chillers 
using CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-114, or R-500. Desiccant cooling systems do not

contribute to ozone depletion or global warming. They offer potential energy savings over 
the use of CFC-11. Desiccant cooling is an alternate technology to the vapor compression 
cycle. 
(i) 

Ammonia/water absorption. 


Ammonia/water absorption is acceptable as an alternative technology to centrifugal 
chillers using CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-114, or R-500. Ammonia/water absorption

an alternative technology to vapor compression cycles. Ammonia is the refrigerant, and water 
is the absorber. This alternative has zero ODP and GWP. For information on toxicity, see 
the discussion of ammonia above. Users should check local building codes related to the use 
of ammonia. 
(j) 

Water/lithium bromide absorption. 


Water/lithium bromide absorption is acceptable as an alternative technology to 
centrifugal chillers using CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-114, or R-500. Some absorption

systems use water as the refrigerant and lithium bromide as the absorber. Lithium bromide 
has zero ODP and GWP. It is low in toxicity and is nonflammable. 
(k) 

Stirling cycle. 


Stirling Cycle systems are acceptable as an alternative technology to centrifugal 
chillers using CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-114, or R-500. These systems use a different

thermodynamic cycle from vapor compression equipment. Helium is frequently used as the 
refrigerant. The Stirling cycle does not include a phase change. Heat transfer is 
accomplished through compression and expansion. These systems have been used for several 
decades, primarily in refrigerated transport and cryogenics.

(d) Evaporative cooling. Evaporative Cooling is acceptable as an alternative technology to reciprocating chillers
using CFC-12. See the discussion on evaporative cooling under new CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113,
CFC-114, and R-500 centrifugal chillers.

using CFC-12. See the discussion on the Stirling cycle under new CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113,
CFC-114, and R-500 centrifugal chillers. 
(9) CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502 Industrial Process Refrigeration, Retrofit. Please note that different
temperature regimes may affect the applicability of substitutes within this end-use. 
(a) HCFC-22. HCFC-22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502 in retrofitted
industrial process refrigeration. See the discussion on HCFC-22 under new CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113,

(b) HFC-134a. HFC-134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502 in
retrofitted industrial process refrigeration. See the discussion on HFC-134a under retrofitted CFC-12
centrifugal chillers. 
(c) R-401A and R-401B. R-401A and R-401B, which consist of HCFC-22, HFC-152a,
and HCFC-124, are acceptable as substitutes for CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502 in retrofitted
industrial process refrigeration. Two of the constituents in these blends are HCFCs and contribute to ozone depletion,
and production of these compounds will be phased out according to the accelerated schedule. While the GWP of HCFC-22
is somewhat high, refrigerant leak regulations should 
reduce its contribution to global warming. The GWPs of the other components are low. Although these blends do contain
one flammable constituent, HFC-152a, the blends themselves are not flammable. In addition, each blend is a
near azeotrope, and it does not fractionate in normal operation. Finally, leak testing of each blend demonstrated
that while the vapor and liquid compositions changed, neither phase became flammable. Testing of these blends with
centrifugal compressors is inadequate, and therefore such use is not recommended by the manufacturer. Further testing
may resolve this uncertainty. 
(d) R-402A and R-402B. R-402A and R-402B, which consist of HCFC-22, propane, and HFC-125,
are acceptable as substitutes for CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502 in retrofitted industrial process
refrigeration. HCFC-22 contributes to ozone depletion, and will be phased out according to the accelerated
schedule. Although these blends contain one flammable constituent, propane, the blends themselves are not flammable.
In addition, the blends are near azeotropes, 
meaning they do not change composition between the vapor and the liquid phase. Therefore, it is unlikely that the blends
would fractionate during normal operation, resulting in an enrichment of the flammable component. Finally, while
testing demonstrated that the vapor and liquid compositions changed during leaks, neither phase became flammable.
Testing of these blends with centrifugal compressors is inadequate, and therefore such use is not recommended by
the manufacturer. Further testing may resolve this uncertainty. 
(e) R-404A. R-404A, which consists of HFC-125 and HFC-143a, is acceptable as a substitute
for CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502 in retrofitted industrial process refrigeration. None of this blend's
constituents contains chlorine, and thus this blend poses no threat to stratospheric ozone. However, HFC-125
and HFC-143a have very high GWPs. EPA strongly encourages recycling and reclamation of this blend in order to
reduce its direct global warming impact. 
Although HFC-143a is flammable, the blend is not. It is an azeotrope, so it will not fractionate during operation.
Leak testing has demonstrated that its composition never becomes flammable. 
(f) R-507. R-507, which consists of HFC-125, HFC-143a, and HFC-134a, is acceptable
as a substitute for CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502 in retrofitted industrial process refrigeration.
None of this blend's constituents contains chlorine, and thus this blend poses no threat to stratospheric ozone.
However, HFC-125 and HFC-143a have very high GWPs, and the GWP of HFC-134a is somewhat high. EPA strongly
encourages recycling and reclamation of this blend in order to reduce its direct global warming impact. Although
HFC-143a is flammable, the blend is not. It is a near azeotrope, so it will not fractionate during operation.
Leak testing has demonstrated that its composition never becomes flammable. 
(g) Ammonia. Ammonia is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502 in retrofitted
industrial process refrigeration. See the discussion on ammonia under new CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113,
CFC-114, and R-500 centrifugal chillers. 

(h) Propane. Propane is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502 in retrofitted
industrial process refrigeration equipment. Propane does not contribute to ozone depletion and it exhibits a negligible
GWP. Propane is flammable, and as such EPA recommends but does not require that it only be used at industrial facilities
which manufacture or use hydrocarbons in the process stream. Such facilities are designed to comply with the safety
standards required for managing flammable chemicals.

industrial process refrigeration equipment. Chlorine is a highly reactive chemical and as such, EPA recommends
but does not require that chlorine only be used at industrial facilities which manufacture or use chlorine in the process
stream. Note, however, that OSHA's Process Safety Management Standards apply to the use of chlorine.

potential of pressurized natural gas. As its pressure is reduced from transmission pipes to the 
distribution system, the gas cools. This refrigeration is then used to cool a transfer medium 
such as water, which then cools the refrigerated space. It uses very little energy and produces 
no global warming emissions, since the gas is not burned.

See the discussion on HFC-134a under retrofitted CFC-12 centrifugal chillers. 

(c) R-401A and R-401B. R-401A and R-401B, which consist of HCFC-22, HFC-152a,

See the discussion on these blends under retrofitted CFC-11, CFC-12 and R-502 industrial process
refrigeration. 

(d) HCFC Blend Alpha. HCFC Blend Alpha, which consists of HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b, is acceptable as a substitute
for CFC-12 in retrofitted household refrigerators. This blend's components contribute significantly less
to ozone depletion than CFC-12. However, the two components have the highest ODPs of all refrigerant alternatives,
and will be phased out under the accelerated phaseout schedule. In addition, the GWPs of the components are high compared

to most of the other alternatives in this end-use. Although this blend does contain a flammable constituent, testing
has shown that the blend itself is not flammable and that it must experience significant fractionation before flammability
becomes a risk. Given the small refrigerant charge size and the hermetic nature of refrigerators, it is unlikely for
a leak resulting in such fractionation to occur. 

(29) CFC-12 Household Refrigerators, New. (a) HCFC-22. HCFC-22 is acceptable as a substitute for
CFC-12 and R-502 in new household refrigerators. See the discussion on HCFC-22 under new CFC-11,
CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-114, and R-500 centrifugal chillers. 

(b) HFC-134a. HFC-134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-12 in new household refrigerators.
See the discussion on HFC-134a under retrofitted CFC-12 centrifugal chillers. 

(c) HFC-152a. HFC-152a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-12 in new household refrigerators.
HFC-152a does not contribute to ozone depletion. In addition, HFC-152a's GWP and atmospheric lifetime
are significantly lower than those of most alternatives. Although HFC-152a is flammable, a risk assessment
demonstrated it could be used safely in this end-use. 

(d) HCFC Blend Alpha. HCFC Blend Alpha, which consists of HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b, is acceptable as a substitute
for CFC-12 in new household refrigerators. See the discussion on this blend under retrofitted CFC-12
household refrigerators. 

(e) R200b blend. R200b blend is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-12 in new household refrigerators. R200b
does not contribute to ozone depletion. In addition, the GWPs and atmospheric lifetimes of the blend's constituents
are less than those of CFC-12. However, the GWP of one component is high compared to those of other alternatives
for this end-use. One component of R200b is flammable, but a risk assessment has shown that use of R200b in household
refrigerators poses negligible additional risk of fire, given the hermetic nature of the equipment, the small charge,
and the low probability of ignition. 

(f) Stirling cycle. Stirling cycle systems are acceptable as an alternative technology to household refrigerators
using CFC-12. Research and development efforts are underway to produce household refrigerators using this
cycle. Further information is discussed under new CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-114, and
R-500 centrifugal chillers.

(34) CFC-12 Motor Vehicle Air Conditioners, Retrofit. (a) HFC-134a. HFC-134a is acceptable as
a substitute for CFC-12 in retrofitted motor vehicle air conditioners. HFC-134a does not contribute
to ozone depletion. HFC-134a's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are close to those of other alternatives which
have been determined to be acceptable for this end-use. However, HFC-134a's contribution to global warming
could be significant in leaky end-uses such as MVACS. EPA has determined that the use of HFC-134a in these applications
is acceptable because industry continues to develop technology to limit emissions. In addition, the number of available
substitutes for use in MVACS is currently limited. HFC-134a is not flammable and its toxicity is low. While 
HFC-134a is compatible with most existing refrigeration and air conditioning equipment parts, it is not compatible
with the mineral oils currently used in such systems. An ester-based lubricant should be used rather than mineral
oils.

(b) R-401C. R-401C, which consists of HCFC-22, HFC-152a, and HCFC-124, is acceptable
as a substitute for CFC-12 in retrofitted motor vehicle air conditioners. HCFC-22 and HCFC-124
contribute to ozone depletion. The production of HCFC-22 will be phased out according to the accelerated phaseout
schedule. The GWP of HCFC-22 is somewhat higher than other alternatives for this end-use. Experimental data
indicate that HCFC-22 may leak through flexible hosing in mobile air conditioners at a high rate. In order to
preserve the blend's composition and to reduce its contribution to global warming, EPA strongly recommends using
barrier hoses when hose assemblies need to be replaced during a retrofit procedure. The GWPs of the other components
are low. Although this blend does contain one flammable constituent, the blend itself is not flammable. In addition,
this blend is a near azeotrope, meaning it does not change composition during evaporation and compression. Finally,
although testing demonstrated that the vapor and liquid compositions changed during leaks, neither phase became
flammable.

(35) CFC-12 Motor Vehicle Air Conditioners, New. (a) HFC-134a. HFC-134a is acceptable as a substitute
for CFC-12 in new motor vehicle air conditioners. HFC-134a does not contribute to ozone depletion. HFC-134a's
GWP and atmospheric lifetime are close to those of other alternatives which have been determined to be acceptable
for this end-use. However, HFC-134a's contribution to global warming could be significant in leaky end-uses
such as MVACS. EPA has determined that the use of HFC-134a in these applications is acceptable because industry

Although this blend does contain one flammable constituent, the blend itself is not flammable. In addition, this
blend is a near azeotrope, meaning it does not change composition during evaporation and compression. Finally, although
testing demonstrated that the vapor and liquid compositions changed during leaks, neither phase became flammable.

(c) Evaporative cooling. Evaporative cooling is acceptable as an alternative technology to motor vehicle air conditioners
using CFC-12. Evaporative cooling does not contribute to ozone depletion or global warming and has the potential
to be more energy efficient than current refrigeration and air conditioning systems. Evaporative cooling uses no
chemicals, but relies instead on water evaporation as a means of cooling. It is in widespread use in transit buses in
the western U.S. Recent design improvements have greatly expanded its applicability to other regions.

(d) CO

2

 cooling. CO

2

 cooling systems are acceptable as an alternative technology to motor vehicle air conditioners using CFC-12.
CO

2

 systems for motor vehicle air conditioning are currently under development. EPA believes that with continued development,
such systems could be available within 5 years, and thus they are potentially available substitutes. CO

2

 was historically used in refrigeration systems. It is a well-known, nontoxic, nonflammable gas. Its GWP is defined
as 1, and all other GWPs are indexed to it. Since it is readily available as a waste gas, no additional chemical will need
to be produced. Thus, the use of CO

2

 as a refrigerant will not contribute to global warming.

(e) Stirling cycle. Stirling cycle systems are acceptable as an alternative technology to motor vehicle air conditioners
using CFC-12. A full scale Stirling cycle motor vehicle air conditioning system has been built. Further development
is necessary to facilitate practical implementation. For further information see the discussion on the Stirling
cycle under new CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-114, and R-500 centrifugal chillers.

(36) Heat transfer. Although EPA did not originally intend to review this end-use, the Agency reconsidered after
reexamining the potential size of annual sales of substitutes. Thus, EPA is currently reviewing submissions for
the use of PFCs in heat transfer systems. EPA anticipates including its final determination in the first SNAP update.

b. Unacceptable substitutes. (1) HCFC-22/HCFC-142b/CFC-12 blend. A HCFC-22/HCFC-142b/CFC-12
blend is unacceptable as a substitute for CFC-12 in:

 Commercial comfort air conditioning;

 Industrial process refrigeration systems;

 Ice skating rinks;

 Cold storage warehouses;

 Refrigerated transport;

 Retail food refrigeration;

 Vending machines;

 Water coolers;

 Commercial ice machines;

<TEXT>
 

 Household refrigerators;

 Household freezers;

 Residential dehumidifiers; and

 Motor vehicle air conditioning.



It is also unacceptable as a substitute for HCFC-22 in residential and packaged HCFC-22 air conditioning.
Other substitutes for CFC-12 exist which contain no class I substances. In addition, because this blend contains
CFC-12 (which has an ODP 20 times that of HCFC-22), it poses a greater risk to stratospheric ozone than the
use of HCFC-22 alone.




(2) HCFC-141b. HCFC-141b is unacceptable as a substitute for CFC-11 in new centrifugal chillers.
This substance has a high ozone depletion potential. At least one other substitute exists that presents lower overall
risk.

(3) Hydrocarbon Blend A. Hydrocarbon Blend A is unacceptable as a substitute for CFC-12 in:

 Commercial comfort air conditioning;

 Ice skating rinks;

 Cold storage warehouses;

 Refrigerated transport;

 Retail food refrigeration;

 Vending machines;

 Water coolers;

 Commercial ice machines;

 Household refrigerators;

 Household freezers;

 Residential dehumidifiers; and

 Motor vehicle air conditioning.




Flammability is the primary concern. EPA believes the use of this substitute in very leaky uses like motor vehicle
air conditioning may pose a high risk of fire. EPA requires a risk assessment be conducted to demonstrate this blend
may be safely used in any CFC-12 end-uses.



E. Foams



1. Overview



Foam plastics accounted for approximately 18 percent of all U.S. consumption of ozone-depleting chemicals on an
ODP-weighted basis in 1990. Five class I chemicals_CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-114, and
methyl chloroform_are used as blowing agents in foam production. These five compounds are used in a wide variety of
applications.

Foam plastics manufactured with CFCs fall into four major categories: polyurethane, phenolic, extruded polystyrene,
and polyolefin. Historically, CFC-11 and CFC-113, which remain in a liquid state at room temperature,
have been used as blowing agents in polyurethane and phenolic foams. CFC-12 and CFC-114, which have lower
boiling points than CFC-11 and CFC-113 and are gases at room temperature, are used in polyolefin and polystyrene
foams. In addition to CFCs, methyl chloroform is used as a blowing agent in some flexible polyurethane foams.

Due to the wide variety of applications that foams represent, the Agency has divided its analysis of foam plastics
into the following ten distinct end-use sectors:

 Rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock;

 Rigid polyurethane appliance;

 Rigid polyurethane spray and commercial refrigeration, and sandwich panels;

 Rigid polyurethane slabstock and other foams;

 Polystyrene extruded insulation boardstock and billet;

 Phenolic insulation board;

 Flexible polyurethane;

 Polyurethane integral skin;

 Polystyrene extruded sheet; and

 Polyolefin.




The SNAP determinations in this final rule distinguish between these ten end-use sectors because the mix of potential
alternatives to Class I blowing agents, and potential emission and exposure profiles, differ for each. Appendix
B at the end of this preamble lists in tabular form the Agency's determinations on substitutes in the foam sector. These
determinations are based on the risk screens described in the background document entitled, ``Risk Screen on the
Use of Substitutes for Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances: Foam-Blowing Agents'' and discussed in supporting memoranda.
The table also includes as ``pending'' substitutes for which the Agency has not yet issued determinations. Vendors
or users of substitutes not described in Appendix B should submit information on these uses, so that the Agency can
review them and issue a SNAP determination.



2. Alternative Blowing Agents



Under the SNAP program, the evaluation of alternatives for CFCs depends on a number of factors. These include toxicity,
flammability, environmental concerns, and, in the case of insulating foams, the insulating efficiency of alternatives.

Toxicity concerns associated with the use of alternative chemicals relate to the exposure of workers and consumers
to the chemicals or to the decomposition products these chemicals may form slowly over time in foam products. The likely
degree of human health risk associated with an alternative depends not only on the nature of a substitute chemical
but also on the chemical composition, manufacturing process, and product applications that characterize the foam
end-use sector into which that substitute will be introduced.

Flammability concerns, like toxicity concerns, have to do with possible danger to workers and consumers. Such danger
includes possible ignition of materials during manufacturing, storage, or transportation, and the fire hazard
posed by the final product. Alternatives to CFCs have varying degrees of flammability. As in the case of toxicity,
however, the composition, production processes, and end-use applications that characterize each foam type dictate
the potential risks associated with flammability.

In addition to posing toxicity and flammability risks, alternatives may have deleterious effects on the environment.
Such effects may include stratospheric ozone depletion, global warming, and contribution to smog or tropospheric
ozone formation. HCFCs have, in varying degrees, the potential to deplete ozone; both HCFCs and HFCs have global warming
potential; and various potential alternatives, especially hydrocarbons, are volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
that contribute to the formation of ozone, or smog, in the lower atmosphere.

The use of alternative blowing agents can have an adverse affect on the insulating capacity of foam products due to
higher thermal conductivity of the substitute. The overall risk screen for substitutes under SNAP takes into account
indirect contributions to global warming.

a. 

Hydrochlorofluorocarbons. 

Because of their relatively low thermal conductivity, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are considered necessary
transitional alternatives to CFC blowing agents in thermal insulating foams. Two HCFCs, HCFC-123 and HCFC-141b,
can serve as replacements for CFC-11 in many end-use applications. Because of limited availability of HCFC-123,
HCFC141b represents the more likely short-term possibility for replacing CFC-11 in several of the insulating
foam sectors. As a result, the Agency has determined that HCFC-141b, despite its relatively high ODP of 0.11,
is an acceptable transitional alternative to CFC-11 for several foam end-uses. Other HCFC alternatives are
HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b. Although these compounds are commercially available and have lower ODPs than
HCFC-141b, each has a boiling point significantly lower than CFC-11. As a result, conversion to HCFC-22
or HCFC-142b from CFC-11 generally entails significant investment in technical and process modification.
HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b do, however, present viable, near-term alternatives to CFC-12 in extruded
polystyrene boardstock and billet foams.

<TEXT>
 

Production of HCFCs is controlled by the Clean Air Act and under section 605 is scheduled for phase-out by 2030. However,
due to new data concerning greater risks of ozone depletion, EPA promulgated an accelerated phase-out schedule (58
FR 65018, 12/10/93). Given the technical and safety concerns associated with many non-HCFC alternatives, however,
disallowing the interim use of HCFCs in insulating foam end-uses, including the use of HCFC-141b and HCFC-22,
would have adverse effects on human health and the environment. 
Effective January 1, 1994, plastic foam products which contain or are manufactured with HCFCs are banned from sale
or distribution into interstate commerce under section 610 of the CAA. Under section 610, thermal insulation foam
products are, however, exempted from this ban. Foam insulation product means a product containing or consisting
of the following types of foam: (1) Closed cell rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foam; (2) closed cell rigid
polystyrene boardstock foam; (3) closed cell rigid phenolic foam; and (4) closed cell rigid polyethylene foam when
such foam is suitable in shape, thickness and design to be used as a product that provides thermal insulation around
pipes used in heating, plumbing, refrigeration, or industrial process systems. Any use of acceptable HCFC substitutes
listed under SNAP must comply with restrictions under the section 610 Non-Essential Ban. 
b. 

Hydrofluorocarbons.

 Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) represent a zero-ODP alternative to CFC blowing agents in many sectors. From the standpoint
of stratospheric ozone depletion alone, HFCs are preferable to HCFCs as alternative blowing agents. The relatively
higher thermal conductivity of HFCs, however, is likely to hamper the insulating capabilities of HFC-blown foams
unless significant changes in the foam formulation or process modifications are adopted. 
The HFCs hold more promise as near- or intermediate-term alternatives for CFC-12 in extruded polystyrene foams,
particularly in extruded polystyrene sheet foams. However, issues such as flammability, global warming potential,
cost, and the solubility of HFCs in polystyrene polymer remain of concern for the industry. 
Conversion to HFC-152a may entail significant capital investment in order to ensure worker safety against
fire hazards. Moreover, in the case of insulating foams, manufacturers will need to guarantee that foams blown with
HFC-152a meet the building code requirements that apply to the flammability of building materials. 
c. 

Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6.

 Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6, most of which are readily available as bulk chemicals, have the advantage
of being low cost. These chemicals are also halogen free, thus 
they are both zero-ODP and zero-GWP. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 are currently being used in extruded
polystyrene, polyurethane, and polyolefin non-insulating foam end-uses. 
Hydrocarbons have significantly higher thermal conductivities than do any of the CFCs. Conversion to hydrocarbons
could thus lead to the production of foams with lower insulating efficiency and, possibly, to a reduction in the energy
efficiency of insulated items. Formulation changes and process modifications have been introduced to increase
the thermal insulating efficiency of hydrocarbon-blown foams. Cyclopentane is a leading alternative 
blowing-agent candidate for insulating foams because of its high boiling point and other physical properties similar
to CFC-11. 
Conversion to hydrocarbons may entail significant capital investment in order to ensure worker safety against fire
hazards. Moreover, in the case of insulating foams, manufacturers will need to guarantee that foams blown with hydrocarbons
meet the building code requirements that apply to the flammability of building materials. 
Hydrocarbons are VOCs and may contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone, or smog, in the lower atmosphere.
Any use of hydrocarbon blowing agents is subject to the federal, state and local restrictions that apply to VOCs, and
conversion to hydrocarbons could therefore involve further capital investment to comply with these restrictions.

d. 

Other blowing agents.

 Two other blowing agents, methylene chloride and acetone, have been identified as substitutes for CFC-11 in
flexible polyurethane foams. Methylene chloride, which already serves as an auxiliary blowing agent for most grades
of flexible polyurethane foam, is commercially available, and is relatively low cost. Because of its toxicity, it
poses a potential risk to workers and residents in nearby communities. However, the Agency's analysis of use of this
chemical as a blowing agent indicates risks can be controlled by adhering to existing regulatory standards. Methylene
chloride use is further restricted in several states and localities, and is listed as a hazardous waste under RCRA
and, thus, users must comply with applicable RCRA waste disposal requirements. The Agency is also in the process of
addressing residual risks to the general population through emissions to air under title III section 112 of the CAA.
The Agency expects to issue maximum achievable control technology (MACT) rules governing methylene chloride use
in the foams sector by 1997. Methylene chloride is not a VOC, and thus, does not contribute to the formation of tropospheric
ozone. 
When used as a blowing agent, acetone is capable of yielding all grades of flexible polyurethane foam. It can serve
as an alternative blowing agent where methylene chloride use is infeasible. Acetone is a VOC, and must be controlled
as such. In addition, plant modifications may be necessary to accommodate acetone's flammability. 
Carbon dioxide (CO

2

) is an acceptable substitute for all foam end-uses. Any CO

2

 blend is acceptable as long as the other constituents of the blend are acceptable under SNAP. CO

2

 does contribute to global warming. In addition, CO

2

 has the highest thermal conductivity of the SNAP-listed chemical alternatives, and will lower the thermal capacity
of insulating foams unless significant foam formulation or process modifications are adopted. 
e. 

Alternative manufacturing processes.

 The AB Technology is a commercially available and technically feasible process for replacing CFCs or other auxiliary
blowing agents for most conventional flexible foam grades. AB Technology employs formic acid in conjunction with
water as the blowing agent for producing flexible polyurethane foam. The process is based on using the reaction of
formic acid with an isocyanate to produce carbon monoxide in addition to the water/isocyanate reaction normally
used to generate carbon dioxide gas for the expansion of foam. OSHA has set a permissible exposure level (PEL) for carbon
monoxide of 35 ppm of a time weighted average with a ceiling not to exceed 200 ppm.

The majority of public comments received on the foams sector in the proposed rule focused on three issues: The viability
or availability of substitutes; the need for listing of alternative technologies or manufacturing processes, and
the need for notification under SNAP for use of blends or mixture of blowing agents. 
a. 

Viability or availability of listed substitutes.

 Several commenters suggested that the NPRM did not sufficiently address the performance and practicality of use
of acceptable substitutes. Commenters were especially concerned about alternative blowing agents used in thermal
insulation applications, and whether acceptable substitutes represented existing or experimental use. For example,
several commenters stated that if the alternative blowing agent will affect the insulating capacity of a foam it should
be part of the SNAP analysis, and the outcome should be discussed as part of the listing decision. Another commenter
contended that for many of the end-uses, not all of the listed HCFC substitutes are technically viable, but each should
be listed anyway to maximize the breadth of options. This commenter also reported that uses of some of the HFCs and hydrocarbons
are still in development and, therefore do not represent actual alternatives. 
EPA recognizes that the use of alternative blowing agents in insulation products can affect the energy efficiency
of the final product. In this final rule, the overall risk characterization for substitutes under SNAP specifically
takes into account indirect contributions to global warming. However, EPA also recognizes that the changes in foam
formulation or product thickness can result in products with insulation efficiency equivalent to CFC-blown foam.
Therefore, EPA believes it is appropriate to consider and comment on the difference in thermal conductivity of alternative
blowing agents as compared to the CFC being replaced, and compared to other acceptable substitutes. However, it would
be inappropriate to comment on the expected performance of a foam product using one blowing agent versus another,
given that formulations are highly proprietary and can vary significantly from manufacturer-to-manufacturer.
Further, EPA believes it is preferable to identify a broad range of alternatives, and let the market determine which
alternative produce the best performing insulation products. 
Several commenters requested clarification on the definition of hydrocarbons. One commenter suggested a more specific
definition for hydrocarbons of ``saturated light hydrocarbons, C3-C6.'' 
The Agency agrees with these commenters. Since the broad use of hydrocarbon in the NPRM may be viewed as potentially
precluding other viable substitutes, and because the alternate definition suggested by the commenter encompasses
those specifically listed hydrocarbons as well as more recently identified materials being tested in foams such
as cyclopentane, this definition has been adopted by EPA in the final rule. 
b. 

Alternative technologies or manufacturing processes.

 Several commenters argued that EPA should not issue its seal of approval for substitutes that are alternative products,
unless and until the Agency evaluates them with the same degree of detail that HCFCs were evaluated, particularly
with regard to toxicity, technical feasibility, flammability, and energy impacts. 
The Agency believes that alternative products and alternative manufacturing processes will play an important role
in the transition from ODSs in many sectors. In light of public comment, the Agency recognized that the SNAP data requirements
and the SNAP evaluation process proposed in the NPRM were biased toward chemical substitutes. The Agency also agrees
with public comment that review of non-chemical alternatives must be supported by appropriate analysis. In this
final rule, the Agency has made revisions to the SNAP Information Notice to better account for the different information
requirements associated with non-chemical alternatives and increased the discussion of the Agency's analysis
of non-chemical alternatives in the background documents. 
c. 

Use of blends.

 Several commenters argued that EPA's proposed requirement for notification and review of chemical alternative
blends was unnecessary and burdensome for the foams sector. The comments proposed that any combination or blend of
individually acceptable blowing agents should be permitted without additional notification to SNAP. One commenter
suggested EPA clarify that the term ``blend'' when used in the SNAP rule does not refer to individual, separately-``acceptable''
substitutes, two or more of which may be used in the same manufacturing process. 
In light of these public comments, the Agency re-examined the analytical basis for reviewing blends, to determine
whether the potential human health and environmental risks would be different for blends or mixtures of chemicals
than those of individual chemicals that were determined to be acceptable for use in the foams manufacturing process
under SNAP. In particular, the Agency was concerned with potential synergistic effects of the chemical blends, and
that the decomposition product profile would differ from that of a single chemical.

The Agency has determined that because of the potential for formation and emission of decomposition products in rigid
closed cell foams, notification and review under SNAP is required for blends of chemical alternatives in foam end-uses
that encompass residential products where chronic consumer exposure could occur. These end-uses are: Polyurethane
rigid laminated boardstock, polystyrene extruded boardstock and billet foams, phenolic foams, and polyolefin
foams. This analysis is detailed in the SNAP technical background document, ``Risk Screen on the Use of Substitutes
for Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances: Foam Blowing Agents.'' In contrast, for open-celled foams where the blowing
agent is fully emitted from the foams within hours or days of manufacture, the formation of decomposition products
is not a factor in decisionmaking. For this final rule, use of blends or mixtures of substitutes listed as acceptable
under the SNAP program in open-celled or closed-cell or semi-rigid end-uses not designated above does not require
notification. 


4. Listing Decisions 


a. 

Acceptable substitutes. (1) Rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock.

 (a) HCFC-123. HCFC-123 is acceptable as an alternative blowing agent to CFC-11 in rigid polyurethane
and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam. From the standpoint of technical feasibility, HCFC-123
represents a viable alternative to CFC-11 as a potential blowing agent. More specifically, the physical properties,
thermal conductivity, and aging of foams blown with HCFC-123 are similar to those blown with CFC-11. As
a result, HCFC-123, which has an ozone depleting potential significantly lower than that of CFC-11, has
the potential to replace CFC-11 in many applications. Nonetheless, availability of HCFC-123 is limited
at present. The acceptable exposure limit (AEL) for HCFC-123 is 30 ppm. 
(b) HCFC-141b. HCFC-141b is acceptable as an alternative to CFC-11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate
laminated boardstock foam. Although its ODP of 0.11 is relatively high, HCFC-141b offers almost immediate
transition out of CFC uses in this sector. Not only does HCFC-141b offer a technically feasible alternative
to CFC-11, but it is currently available in quantities sufficient to meet industrial demand. HCFC-141b
is scheduled for phase-out from production on January 1, 2003 under the accelerated phase out rule (58 FR 65018) under
section 606 of the CAA. 
(c) HCFC-22. HCFC-22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate
laminated boardstock foam. HCFC-22 offers an alternative with significantly less potential to deplete ozone
than CFC-11. Plant or process modifications may be required to allow use of blowing agents like HCFC-142b
that have significantly lower boiling points than CFC-11. HCFC-22 is subject to the accelerated phase
out rule (58 FR 65018) under section 606 of the CAA. 
(d) HCFC-142b. HCFC-142b is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate
laminated boardstock foam. HCFC-142b offers an alternative with significantly lower potential to deplete
ozone than CFC-11. Plant or process modifications may be required to allow use of blowing agents like HCFC-142b
that have significantly lower boiling points than CFC-11. HCFC-142b is subject to the accelerated phase
out rule (58 FR 65018).
(e) HCFC-22/HCFC-141b. The HCFC-22/HCFC-142b blend is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11
in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam. HCFC-22 has an occupational exposure
limit (OEL) of 250 ppm, whereas HCFC-141b has an OEL of 1000 ppm. 
(f) HCFC-22/HCFC-142b. HCFC-22/HCFC-142b blends are acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11
in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam. This blend offers an alternative with significantly
less potential to deplete ozone than CFC-11. Plant or process modifications may be required to allow use of blowing
agents like HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b that have low boiling points than CFC-11. 
(g) HCFC-141b/HCFC-123. The HCFC-141b/HCFC-123 blend is acceptable as an alternative to
CFC-11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam. As noted above, HCFC-141b,
because of its commercial availability offers an immediate opportunity to replace CFC-11. HCFC-123
has limited availability. However, because the ODP of HCFC-123 is lower than that of HCFC-141b, the blend
has a lower ODP than HCFC-141b alone. 
(h) HCFC-22/HCFC-141b. The HCFC-22/HCFC-142b blend is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11
in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam. Because both components of the blend are
commercially available in large enough quantities to meet industry demand, it offers a near-term vehicle for replacing
CFC-11 in laminated boardstock foams. HCFC-22 has an occupational exposure limit (OEL) of 250 ppm, whereas
HCFC-141b has an OEL of 1000 ppm. 
(i) HFC-134a. HFC-134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate
laminated boardstock foam. HFC-134a offers the potential for a non-ozonedepleting alternative to CFC-11
blowing agents in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foams. Plant modifications may
be necessary to accommodate the use of HFC-134a because its boiling point is lower than that of CFC-11.
In addition, the cost of HFC-134a is relatively high, and the use of HFC-134a may cause significant increases
in thermal conductivity, with a concomitant loss in the insulating capacity of foams blown with HFC-134a. HFC-134a
also has a relatively high global warming potential compared with other available alternatives. 
(j) HFC-152a. HFC-152a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate
laminated boardstock foam. HFC-152a offers the potential for a non-ozonedepleting alternative to CFC-11
blowing agents in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock. Use of HFC-152a as a blowing
agent in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam has raised concern over the potential
for significant increases in thermal conductivity. Process changes may be necessary to accommodate the use of HFC-152a,
and plant modifications may be necessary to manage its flammability. Also, foams blown with HFC-152a will need
to conform with building code requirements that relate to flammable materials. 
(k) Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6. Saturated Light Hydrocarbons C3-C6 are acceptable as substitutes
for CFC-11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam. These hydrocarbons have
zero-ODP and zero-GWP. Plant or process modifications may be necessary to accommodate the use of saturated light
hydrocarbons C3-C6. These materials also pose flammability concerns which may require capital investment
to manage. Foams blown with hydrocarbons will need to conform with building code requirements that relate to flammable
materials. Finally, the thermal conductivity is greater than CFC-11 blowing agents which may effect the thermal
capacity of final products. Saturated light hydrocarbons are VOCs and must be controlled as such under Title I of the
CAA. 
(l) 2-Chloropropane. 2-Chloropropane is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate
laminated boardstock foam. At present, because 2-chloropropane is a proprietary process, its commercial availability
may be limited. Moreover, 2-chloropropane is flammable and its use may require extensive modification of existing
equipment. 
(m) Carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate
laminated boardstock foam.

(2) Polyurethane, rigid appliance foam. 
(a) HCFC-123. 
HCFC-123 (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid 
polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to 
CFC-11 in rigid polyurethane appliance foam. 

(b) HCFC-141b. 
HCFC-141b (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid 
polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to 
CFC-11 in rigid polyurethane appliance foam. The Appliance Research Consortium (ARC), a 
subsidiary of the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM), convened an 
independent panel of toxicologists to evaluate the risk of potential exposure from foods stored 
in refrigerators manufactured with HCFC-141b as the blowing agent in the insulating foam. 
The panel evaluated the same toxicological data available to EPA, and concluded that the use 
of HCFC-141b in this intended application is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) per section 
201(s) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 USC section 321(s).

 




(c) HCFC-22. 
HCFC-22 (or blends thereof), for reasons described in the section on rigid 
polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as a substitute for 
CFC-11 in rigid polyurethane appliance foam. 

(d) HCFC-142b. 
HCFC-142b (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11 in rigid 
polyurethane appliance foam. HCFC-142b offers an alternative with significantly less 
potential to deplete stratospheric ozone than CFC-11. Nevertheless, certain technical 
problems persist. Namely, plant modifications may be required to allow the use of blowing 
agents like HCFC-142b that have low boiling points. 

(e) HFC-134a. 
HFC-134a (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid 
polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to 
CFC-11 in rigid polyurethane appliance foam. 

(f) HFC-152a. 
HFC-152a (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid 
polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to 
CFC-11 in rigid polyurethane appliance foam. 

(g) Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6. 
Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 (or blends thereof) are acceptable as substitutes 
for CFC-11 in rigid polyurethane appliance foam. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 offer 
the potential of a non-ozone-depleting alternative to the use of CFC-11 blowing agents in 
rigid polyurethane appliance foam. Plant modifications may be necessary to accommodate 
the flammability of Saturated Light Hydrocarbons C3-C6. In addition, the potential for 
significant increases in thermal conductivity may reduce insulating capacity. Foams blown 
with saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 must conform with building code requirements that 
relate to flammable materials. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 are VOCs and will be 
subject to control as such under Title I of the CAA. 

(h) Carbon dioxide. 
Carbon dioxide (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11 in rigid 
polyurethane appliance foam. 

(3) Rigid polyurethane commercial refrigeration foam, 
spray foam, and sandwich panels. (a) HCFC-123. 
HCFC-123, for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and 
polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC-11 and CFC-12 
in rigid polyurethane commercial refrigeration foam, spray foam, and sandwich panels. 

(b) HCFC-141b. 
HCFC-141b (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid 
polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to 
CFC-11 and CFC-12 in rigid polyurethane commercial refrigeration foam, spray foam, and 
sandwich panels. 

(c) HCFC-22. 
HCFC-22 (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11 and CFC-12 in 
rigid polyurethane commercial refrigeration foam, spray foam, and sandwich panels. HCFC-22 offers an alternative
with significantly less potential to deplete ozone than either CFC-11 
or CFC-12. However, significant process changes could be necessary to accommodate the 
low boiling point of HCFC-22.

(d) HCFC-142b. HCFC-142b (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane
and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC-11 and CFC-12 in rigid
polyurethane commercial refrigeration foam, spray foam, and sandwich panels. 

(e) HFC-134a. HFC-134a (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane
and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC-11 and CFC-12 in rigid
polyurethane commercial refrigeration foam, spray foam, and sandwich panels. 

(f) HFC-152a. HFC-152a (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane
and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC-11 and CFC-12 in rigid
polyurethane commercial refrigeration foam, spray foam, and sandwich panels. 

(g) Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 (or blends thereof), for
the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, are acceptable
alternative blowing agents for CFC-11 and CFC-12 in rigid polyurethane commercial refrigeration foam,
spray foam, and sandwich panels. 

(h) Carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide (or blends thereof) is an acceptable alternative blowing agent for CFC-11
in rigid polyurethane commercial refrigeration foam, spray foam, and sandwich panels. 

(4) Polyurethane slabstock and other foams. (a) HCFC-123. HCFC-123 (or blends thereof) is acceptable
as an alternative to CFC-11 in rigid polyurethane slabstock and other foams. From the standpoint of technical
feasibility, HCFC-123 represents a viable alternative to CFC-11 as a potential blowing agent. More specifically,
the physical properties, thermal conductivity, and aging of foams blown with HCFC-123 are similar to those
blown with CFC-11. As a result, HCFC-123, which has an ozone depleting potential significantly lower
than that of CFC-11, has the potential to replace CFC-11 in many applications. Nonetheless, commercial
availability of HCFC-123 is limited at present. 

(b) HCFC-141b. HCFC-141b (or blends thereof) is acceptable as an alternative to CFC-11 in rigid
polyurethane slabstock and other foams. Although its ODP of 0.11 is relatively high, HCFC-141b offers almost
immediate transition out of CFCs in this sector. Not only does HCFC-141b offer a technically feasible alternative
to CFC-11, it is currently available in sufficient quantities to meet industry demand. The use of HCFCs in polyurethane
slabstock and other foams is subject to further restriction under section 610 of the CAA, which banned the use of class
II substances in noninsulating foams after January 1, 1994. 

(c) HCFC-22. HCFC-22 (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11 in rigid polyurethane
slabstock and other foams. HCFC-22 offers an alternative with significantly less potential to deplete ozone
than either CFC-11 or CFC-12. However, significant process changes may be necessary to accommodate the
low boiling point of HCFC-22. 

(d) HFC-134a. HFC-134a (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane
and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC-11 and CFC-12 in rigid
polyurethane slabstock and other foams. 

(e) HFC-152a. HFC-152a (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane
and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC-11 and CFC-12 in rigid
polyurethane slabstock and other foams. 

(f) Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 (or blends thereof), for
the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, are acceptable
alternative blowing agents for CFC-11 and CFC-12 in rigid polyurethane slabstock and other foams. 

(g) Carbon Dioxide. Carbon dioxide (or blends thereof) is an acceptable alternative blowing agent for CFC-11
and CFC-12 in rigid polyurethane slabstock and other foams. 

(5) Extruded Polystyrene Boardstock and Billet. (a) HCFC-22. HCFC-22 is an acceptable alternative blowing
agent for CFC-12 in extruded polystyrene boardstock and billet foam. HCFC-22 offers an alternative with
significantly less potential to deplete ozone than CFC-12. HCFC-22, however, has a relatively high permeation
rate out of polystyrene, thus affecting insulation performance. Users must be in compliance with the section 610
Nonessential Products Containing Class II Substances Ban. 

(b) HCFC-142b. HCFC-142b is an acceptable alternative blowing agent for CFC-12 in extruded polystyrene
boardstock foam. HCFC-142b offers an alternative with significantly less potential to deplete ozone than
either CFC-11 or CFC-12. Users must be in compliance with the section 610 Non-essential Products Containing
Class II Substances Ban.

(c) HCFC-22/HCFC-142b. The HCFC-22/HCFC-142b blend is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-12
in extruded polystyrene boardstock and billet foam. The blend offers an alternative with significantly less potential
to deplete ozone than CFC-12. Users must be in compliance with section 610 Nonessential Products Containing
Class II Substances. 

(d) HFC-134a. HFC-134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-12 in extruded polystyrene boardstock
and billet foam. HFC-134a offers the potential for a non-ozone-depleting alternative to CFC-12 blowing
agents in extruded polystyrene boardstock and billet foam. HFC-134a, because of its low flammability and encouraging
performance in toxicological testing, exhibits definite advantages from the standpoints of environmental risk
and worker and consumer safety. However, HFC-134a has relatively high thermal conductivity, is costly, and
has the potential to contribute to global warming. In addition, the compound has poor solubility in polystyrene polymer,
which could limit its usefulness as an alternative blowing agent from a technical standpoint. HFC-134a also
has a relatively high global warming potential compared to other 
available alternatives. 

(e) HFC-152a. HFC-152a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-12 in extruded polystyrene boardstock
and billet foam. HFC-152a offers the potential for a non-ozone-depleting alternative to CFC-12 blowing
agents in extruded polystyrene boardstock. However, the high flammability of HFC-152a when combined with
its properties of high thermal conductivity, low solubility in polystyrene polymer, and high permeability through
polystyrene limit the extent to which HFC-152a is likely to replace CFC-12. Plant modifications may be
needed to accommodate the flammability of HFC-152a, and foams blown with HFC-152a will need to conform
with building code requirements that relate to flammable materials. 

(f) Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 are acceptable as substitutes
for CFC-12 in polystyrene boardstock and billet foam. Of the Saturated Light Hydrocarbons C3-C6, pentane,
isopentane, butane, and isobutane have been demonstrated as feasible blowing agents in polystyrene. In fact, saturated
light hydrocarbons C3-C6 have been used for years in the manufacture of extruded polystyrene sheet products.
However, saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 have several disadvantages as blowing agents in extruded polystyrene
boardstock and billet foam. Replacement of CFC-12 blowing agents with Saturated Light Hydrocarbons C3-C6
may reduce the insulating efficiency in this end-use. Controlling the flammability of saturated light hydrocarbons
C3-C6 may entail significant investment in plant conversion to accommodate them as alternatives to CFC-12.
Foams blown with saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 will need to conform with building code requirements that
relate to flammable materials. Finally, saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 are VOCs and must be controlled
as such under Title I of the CAA. 

(g) HCFC-22/Saturated Light Hydrocarbons C3-C6. Blends of HCFC-22/saturated light hydrocarbons
C3-C6, for the reasons described and with the caveats outlined above for HCFC-22 and Saturated Light Hydrocarbons
C3-C6, are acceptable substitutes for CFC-12 in extruded polystyrene boardstock and billet foam. 

(h) Carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is an acceptable alternative blowing agent for CFC-12 in extruded polystyrene
boardstock and billet foam. 

(6) Phenolic insulation board. (a) HCFC-141b. HCFC-141b, for the reasons described in the section on
rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC-11
and CFC-113 in phenolic insulation board. 

(b) HCFC-142b. HCFC-142b, for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate
laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC-11 and CFC-113 in phenolic insulation board.


(c) HCFC-22. HCFC-22, for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane commercial refrigeration
foams, spray foams, and sandwich panels, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC-11 and CFC-113 in phenolic
insulation board. 

(d) HCFC-22/HCFC-142b. Blends of HCFC-22/HCFC-142b, for reasons described above and with
the caveats outlined above for HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b, are acceptable as an alternative to CFC-11
and CFC-113 in phenolic insulation board. 

(e) Saturated Light Hydrocarbons C3-C6. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6, for the reasons described
in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, are acceptable alternatives to
CFC-11 and CFC-113 in phenolic insulation board. 

(f) HCFC-22/Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6. HCFC-22/Saturated light hydrocarbon C3-C6
blends are acceptable as substitutes for CFC-11 and CFC-113 in phenolic insulation board. HCFC-22/saturated
light hydrocarbon C3-C6 blends offer an alternative with significantly less potential to deplete ozone than
either CFC-11 or CFC-113. However, extensive plant modifications may be necessary to accommodate use
of these blends. In addition, there are concerns about the potential for significant increases in thermal conductivity
resulting from the replacement of CFC-11 and CFC-113 with a blend. Also, foams blown with saturated light
hydrocarbons C3-C6 will need to conform with building code requirements that relate to flammable materials.
Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 are VOCs and must be controlled as such under Title I of the CAA, and HCFC-22
is subject to the phase-out of Class II compounds under sections 605 and 606 of the CAA. 

(g) HFC-143a. HFC-143a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11 and CFC-12 in phenolic insulation
board. HFC-143a has a higher global warming potential than other substitutes available. 

(h) 2-Chloropropane 2-Chloropropane is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11 and CFC-12 in phenolic
insulation board. At present, because 2-chloropropane is a proprietary technology. Moreover, 2-chloropropane
is flammable and its use may require extensive modification of existing 
equipment. 

(i) Carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is an acceptable alternative blowing agent for CFC-11 and CFC-12 in
phenolic insulation board. 

(7) Flexible polyurethane foam. (a) 

Methylene chloride.

 Methylene chloride (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a blowing agent in flexible polyurethane foams. Methylene
chloride is already used as an auxiliary blowing agent in the manufacture of most flexible polyurethane slabstock
foams and has proven adequate in yielding foams of many densities and degrees of softness. Replacement of CFC-11
or methyl chloroform blowing agents with methylene chloride can reduce the potential for stratospheric ozone depletion
resulting from the production of flexible polyurethane foams.

<TEXT>
 

Nevertheless, there is concern over the potential health and safety issues posed by 
methylene chloride. In fact, due to these concerns, some local and regional restrictions apply 
to the use of methylene chloride. To assess these risks in the application under discussion, 
EPA used data collected by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for 
the proposed revision of the permissible exposure level (PEL) for methylene chloride. The 
Agency's estimate for total population risk for methylene chloride was based on average plant 
emissions derived from OSHA's analysis, and while not negligible, was within the range of 
existing Agency decisions on acceptable risk. For further detail, refer to the background 
document entitled ``Risk Screen on the Use of Substitutes for Class I Ozone-Depleting 
Substances: Foams''. 

In light of the results of Agency analysis, EPA decided to find acceptable the use of 
methylene chloride subject to existing or future restrictions because it will allow immediate 
transition from class I substances in this end-use. Potential users should note that methylene 
chloride use will be subject to future controls for hazardous air pollutants under Title III 
section 112 of the CAA. In addition, use of the compound must conform to all relevant 
workplace safety standards; OSHA has proposed permissible exposure levels (PELs) for 
methylene chloride of 25 ppm on a time-weighted average (TWA). Once such additional 
controls have been adopted, use of this substitute must comply with any other applicable 
requirements, such as state restrictions. Use is also subject to waste disposal requirements 
under RCRA. 

(b) Acetone. Acetone (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a blowing agent for flexible polyurethane 
foams. In those areas where methylene chloride use is deemed unacceptable, acetone may 
provide another non-ODP alternative to CFC-11 and methyl chloroform. All grades of 
flexible polyurethane foam produced with CFCs can be produced using acetone as an 
auxiliary blowing agent. Acetone does not have an ozone depletion potential, and its global 
warming potential is negligible. Nevertheless, acetone is highly flammable and its use 
requires precautions to ensure safety to workers as prescribed by OSHA. In addition, use of 
this compound is subject to various federal, state, or local controls as a VOC under Title I of 
the CAA. 

(c) HFC-134a. 
HFC-134a (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11 in flexible 
polyurethane foam. HFC-134a is a non-ozone-depleting alternative to CFC-11 blowing agents 
in flexible polyurethane foam. Plant modifications may be necessary to accommodate the use 
of HFC-134a because its boiling point is lower than that of CFC-11. 

(d) HFC-152a. 
HFC-152a (or use thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11 in flexible 
polyurethane foam. HFC-152a is a non-ozone-depleting alternative to CFC-11 blowing agents 
in flexible polyurethane foam. Process changes may be necessary to accommodate the use of 
HFC-152a, and plant modifications may be necessary to manage its flammability. 

(e) AB Technology. 
AB Technology is acceptable as an alternative process in flexible polyurethane foams. 
The AB Technology generates carbon monoxide as the chemical blowing agent. Precautions 
should be taken to insure the safety of workers from exposure to elevated levels of carbon 
monoxide, particularly at the latter phases of production where ventilation is generally not as 
efficient as on the foam line. OSHA has set a permissible exposure level (PEL) for carbon 
monoxide of 35 ppm on a time-weighted average (TWA) with a ceiling of 200 ppm. 

(f) Carbon dioxide. 
Carbon dioxide (or blends thereof) is an acceptable alternative process in flexible 
polyurethane foams. 

(8) Polyurethane integral skin foams. 
(a) HCFC-123. 
HCFC-123 (or blends thereof) is acceptable as an alternative to CFC-11 in integral 
skin foams. The physical and chemical properties of HCFC-123 are similar to CFC-11. As a 
result, HCFC-123, which has an ozone depleting potential significantly lower than that of 
CFC-11, has the potential to replace CFC-11 in many integral skin applications. Nonetheless, 
commercial availability of HCFC-123 is limited at present. The use of HCFC-123 in integral 
skin foams is subject to significant restriction under section 610 of the CAA, which bans the 
use of class II substances in noninsulating foams after January 1, 1994. The ban exempts 
only certain integral skin foams used to provide for motor vehicle safety. 

(b) HCFC-141b. 
HCFC-141b (or blends thereof) is acceptable as an alternative to CFC-11 in integral 
skin foams. Although its ODP of 0.11 is relatively high, HCFC-141b offers an acceptable 
transition substitute out of CFC-11 in integral skin foams. The use of HCFC-141b in integral 
skin foams, however, is subject to significant restriction under section 610 of the CAA, which 
banned the use of class II substances in noninsulating foams after January 1, 1994. The ban 
exempts only certain integral skin foams used to provide for motor vehicle safety. 

(c) HCFC-22. 
HCFC-22 (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11 in integral skin 
foam. HCFC-22 offers an alternative with significantly less potential to deplete ozone than 
CFC-11. However, process changes may be necessary to accommodate the low boiling point 
of HCFC-22. The use of HCFC-22 in integral skin foams is subject to significant restrictions 
under section 610 of the CAA, which banned the use of class II substances in noninsulating 
foams after January 1, 1994. The ban exempts only certain integral skin foams used to 
provide for motor vehicle safety.

(d) HFC-134a. 
HFC-134a (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11 in polyurethane 
integral skin foam. HFC-134a is a non-ozone-depleting alternative to CFC-11 blowing agents 
in polyurethane integral skin foam. Plant or process modifications may be necessary to 
accommodate the use of HFC-134a because its boiling point is lower than that of CFC-11. 

(e) HFC-152a. 
HFC-152a (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11 in polyurethane 
integral skin foam. HFC-152a is a non-ozone-depleting alternative to CFC-11 blowing agents 
in polyurethane integral skin. Plant or process changes may be necessary to accommodate the 
use of HFC-152a, and plant modifications may be necessary to manage its flammability. 
Also, foams blown with HFC-152a will need to conform with any product safety requirements 
that relate to flammable materials. 

(f) Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6. 
Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 (or blends thereof) are acceptable as substitutes 
for CFC-11 in integral skin foams. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 offer the possibility 
of a non-ODP replacement for CFC-11 in integral skin foams. Plant or process modifications 
may be necessary to accommodate the flammability of 

saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 
and to make the necessary technical and process modifications. 

(g) Methylene chloride. 
Methylene chloride (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a blowing agent in integral 
skin foam. See methylene chloride discussion under Polyurethane Flexible Foams for 
additional details on toxicity issues. Use is subject to waste disposal requirements under 
RCRA. 

(h) Carbon dioxide. 
Carbon dioxide (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a blowing agent in integral skin 
foams. 

(9) Extruded polystyrene sheet foam. 
(a) HFC-134a.

polystyrene sheet foam. HFC-134a is a non-ozone-depleting alternative to CFC-12 blowing 
agents in polystyrene sheet foam. 

(b) HFC-152a. 
HFC-152a (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-12 in extruded 
polystyrene sheet foam. HFC-152a is a non-ozone-depleting alternative to CFC-12 blowing 
agents in extruded polystyrene sheet foams. The compound is commercially available and its 
low molecular weight suggests that its blowing efficiency will be double that of CFC-12. 
Plant or process modifications may be needed to accommodate the flammability of HFC-152a. 

(c) Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6. 
Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 (or blends thereof) are acceptable as substitutes 
for CFC-12 in extruded polystyrene sheet foam. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 offer 
the potential of a non-ozone-depleting alternative to the use of CFC-12 blowing agents in 
extruded polystyrene sheet. At present, pentane and butane are used extensively as blowing 
agents in extruded polystyrene sheet. These compounds are widely available at low cost and 
offer excellent solubility with the polystyrene polymer. 

(d) Carbon dioxide. 
Carbon dioxide (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-12 in extruded 
polystyrene sheet foam. 

(10) Polyolefin foams. 
(a) HCFC-22. 
HCFC-22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11, CFC-12, and CFC-114 in 
polyolefin foams. HCFC-22 offers an alternative with significantly less potential to deplete 
ozone than CFC-11, CFC-12, or CFC-114. Under the section 610 Non-Essential Use Ban, 
HCFC use in polyolefin foams is restricted to thermal insulating applications of polyethylene 
foams where such foam is suitable in shape, thickness and design to be used as a product that 
provides thermal insulation around pipes used for heating, plumbing, refrigeration, or 
industrial process systems. 

(b) HCFC-142b. 
HCFC-142b is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11, CFC-12, and CFC-114 in 
polyolefin foams. HCFC-142b offers an alternative with significantly less potential to deplete 
ozone than CFC-11, CFC-12, or CFC-114. Under the section 610 Non-Essential Use Ban, 
HCFC use in polyolefin foams is restricted to thermal insulating applications of polyethylene 
foams where such foam is suitable in shape, thickness and design to be used as a product that 
provides thermal insulation around pipes used for heating, plumbing, refrigeration, or 
industrial process systems.

(c) HCFC-22/HCFC-142b. 
HCFC-22/HCFC-142b blends are acceptable, for reasons described and the caveats 
outlined above, as a substitute for CFC-11, CFC-12 and CFC-114 in polyolefin foam. Under 
the section 610 Non-Essential Use Ban, HCFC use in polyolefin foams is restricted to thermal 
insulating applications of polyethylene foams where such foam is suitable in shape, thickness 
and design to be used as a product that provides thermal insulation around pipes used for 
heating, plumbing, refrigeration, or industrial process systems. 
(d) HFC-134a. 
HFC-134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11, CFC-12, and CFC-114 in 
polyolefin foams. HFC-134a offers the potential for a non-ozone-depleting alternative to 
CFC-11, CFC-12, and CFC-114 in polyolefin foams. HFC-134a, because of its low 
flammability and encouraging performance in toxicological testing, exhibits definite 
advantages from the standpoints of worker and consumer safety. HFC-134a does, however, 
contribute to global warming. 
(e) HFC-143a. 
HFC-143a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11, CFC-12, and CFC-114 in 
polyolefin foams. HFC-143a has a higher global warming potential than other acceptable 
substitutes in this end-use. 
(f) HFC-152a. 
HFC-152a, for the reasons described in the section on extruded polystyrene sheet 
foam, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC-11, CFC-12, and CFC-114 in polyolefin foams. 
Plant or process modifications may be needed to accommodate the flammability of HFC-152a. 
(g) Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6. 
Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 are acceptable as substitutes for CFC-11, CFC-12, 
and CFC-114 in polyolefin foams. 
(h) HCFC-22/Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6. 
HCFC-22/Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 blends, for the reasons described and 
with the caveats outlined above, are acceptable substitutes for CFC-11, CFC-12 and CFC-114 
in polyolefin foams. Under the section 610 Non-Essential Use Ban, HCFC use in polyolefin 
foams is restricted to thermal insulating applications of polyethylene foams where such foam 
is suitable in shape, thickness and design to be used as a product that provides thermal 
insulation around pipes used for heating, plumbing, refrigeration, or industrial process 
systems. 
(i) Carbon dioxide. 
Carbon dioxide is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11, CFC-12, and CFC-114 in 
polyolefin foams. 
b. 

Unacceptable substitutes. 


The final rule listing a foam blowing agent as unacceptable in a specific foam use 
sector constitutes a ban on the use of that alternative to Class I compounds. This decision 
will be effective 30 days after publication of this final rule. 
(1) Polyolefin foams. 
The use of HCFC-141b (or blends thereof) is unacceptable as an alternative blowing 
agent in polyolefin foams. HCFC-141b has an ODP of 0.11, almost equivalent to that of 
methyl chloroform, a Class I substance. The Agency believes that non-ozone depleting 
alternatives are sufficiently available to render the use of HCFC-141b unnecessary in this 
application. 


F. Solvent Cleaning 


1. Overview 


On an ozone-depletion weighted basis, solvents constitute approximately 15 percent 
of the chemicals targeted for phase-out under the Montreal Protocol. In the U.S., the two 
class I chemicals used as industrial solvents are CFC-113 (C2F3C13_trifluorotrichloroethane) 
and methyl chloroform (C2H3C13_1,1,1-trichloroethane). The SNAP determinations issued 
in the solvent cleaning sector focus on substitutes for CFC-113 and methyl chloroform (MCF) 
when used in industrial cleaning equipment, since this application comprises the largest use of 
ozone-depleting solvents. 
Other cleaning applications for ozone-depleting solvents exist as well, such as in dry 
cleaning of textiles or in hand cleaning or maintenance cleaning as a spray. In addition, these 
solvents are used as bearer media (such as lubricant carriers), mold release agents, component 
testing agents, or in other non-cleaning applications. CFC-11 is also occasionally used as a 
cleaning solvent in specialized applications. For the reasons described earlier in this 
Preamble, the Agency intends to exclude cleaning substitutes for CFC-113, MCF and CFC-11 
in these applications_with the exception of aerosol substitutes_from the SNAP determinations 
at this time. As a result, the Agency is not at this time issuing any determinations on 
acceptability of such substitutes, and will neither approve nor restrict their uses. Aerosol 
substitutes are covered in a separate section of this Preamble.

Appendix B at the end of this Preamble lists in tabular form the Agency's 
determinations on substitutes in the cleaning sector. These listings are based on the risk 
screens described in the background document entitled ``Risk Screen on the Use of Substitutes 
for Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances: Solvent Cleaning'' and discussed in associated 
supporting memoranda. The table includes as ``pending'' a few substitutes for which the 
Agency has not yet issued determinations. Vendors or users of cleaning substitutes not 
described in appendix B should submit information on these uses, so that the Agency can 
review them and issue a SNAP determination. 
The three major end uses that in the past employed CFC-113 and MCF are metals 
cleaning, electronics cleaning, and precision cleaning. Metals cleaning applications usually 
involve removing cutting oils and residual metal filings. This sector relies principally on 
MCF as a cleaning solvent. In contrast, the electronics industry uses principally CFC-113, for 
instance, to remove flux residues left after mounting parts on printed circuit boards. Precision 
cleaning also uses mostly CFC-113. This last application comprises a broad category of 
industrial cleaning operations and can cover uses ranging from preparation of pacemakers to 
manufacture of direct access storage devices (DASDs) for computers. The following sections 
present substitutes for CFC-113 and MCF in these three end uses and discuss the acceptability 
listings presented in appendix B. 


2. Substitutes in Solvents Cleaning 


a. 

Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). 


HCFC-141b or HCFC-141b blends with alcohols are the principal HCFC alternative 
solvents to CFC-113/MCF cleaning. These alternatives can be used in vapor degreasing 
equipment, principally for electronics or precision cleaning, and in some cases existing CFC-113 or MCF equipment
can be retrofitted for use with HCFC-141b alternatives. From an 
environmental standpoint, the critical characteristic of HCFC-141b is that it has a relatively 
high ODP_0.11_the highest of all the HCFCs. 
Another HCFC, HCFC-123, is generally not considered to have widespread application 
as a cleaner. Although this HCFC has the capacity to remove many soils, it is such an 
aggressive cleaner that it frequently degrades the surface of the part being cleaned. The 
company-set AEL for HCFC-123 was recently raised from 10ppm to 30ppm based on new 
toxicity findings. These new data mean that the exposure limit could be met with existing 
equipment, and the Agency intends to list HCFC-123 under separate rule-making as 
acceptable subject to adherence to the exposure limit. 
HCFC-225, a third HCFC, is widely viewed as having potential as a cleaning agent, 
especially for manufacture and maintenance of precision parts and equipment. However, this 
chemical is not yet in widespread production or use and is only now starting to be 
commercially available. Preliminary toxicity findings suggest that of the two HCFC-225 
isomers, HCFC-225ca and HCFC-225cb, toxicity concerns associated with the ca-isomer may 
warrant a comparatively low company-set occupational exposure limit. As a result, EPA 
intends under separate rule-making to propose HCFC-225 as acceptable subject to adherence 
to this limit. The Agency anticipates that companies will readily be able to meet this 
requirement since the ca-isomer is sold commercially in a blend with the less toxic cb-isomer. 
In addition, equipment using HCFC-225 is usually designed for precision operations and has 
inherently low emissions. 
b. 

Semi-aqueous cleaners. 


Semi-aqueous cleaners are alternatives for cleaning in all three sectors. These cleaners 
employ hydrocarbons/surfactants either emulsified in water solutions or applied in 
concentrated form and then rinsed with water. Since both approaches involve water as part of 
the formulation, the system is commonly referred to as ``semi-aqueous.'' The principal 
categories of chemicals used in these formulations are terpenes, C6-C20 petroleum 
hydrocarbons (both naturally or synthetically derived), or oxygenated organic solvents (such 
as alcohols). An extensive discussion of various semi-aqueous cleaning alternatives may be 
found in the Industry Cooperative for Ozone Layer Protection (ICOLP) documents on the 
subject. Users can obtain these documents from the EPA. 
c. 

Aqueous cleaners. 


Aqueous cleaners, unlike semi-aqueous, uses water as the primary solvent. These 
formulations are used mostly for metals cleaning, but companies are beginning to explore 
options using these substitutes in other cleaning applications. In aqueous formulations, 
detergents and surfactants are combined in water with a variety of additives such as organic 
solvents (e.g., high-boiling point alcohols), builders, saponifiers, inhibitors, emulsifiers, pH 
buffers and antifoaming agents. The cleaning process is comparable to that used in semiaqueous applications and
consists of combinations of a wash phase, a rinse phase, and a 
drying phase. An important difference is that the wash tank is frequently heated to improve 
soil removal. The final step, drying, is separate from the cleaning step and can be 
accomplished by use of heat or a drying agent. These alternatives are discussed extensively 
in the ICOLP documents. 
d. 

Straight organic solvent cleaning. 


Organic solvents can be used to replace CFC-113 and MCF in certain cleaning 
operations. This classification is defined to include terpenes, C6-C20 petroleum hydrocarbons 
(both naturally and synthetically derived), and oxygenated organic solvents such as alcohols, 
ethers (including propylene glycol ethers), esters and ketones. These compounds are 
commonly used in solvent tanks at room temperature, although the solvents can also be used 
in-line cleaning systems or be heated to increase solvency power. If heated, the solvents must 
be used in equipment designed to control vapor losses.

These solvents, unlike class I and II compounds, do not contribute to stratospheric 
ozone depletion, and generally have short atmospheric lifetimes. Yet many of the organic 
solvents are regulated as VOCs because they can contribute to ground-level ozone formation. 
In addition, certain of the organic solvents are toxic to human health and are subject to waste 
handling standards under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and to 
workplace standards set by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). For 
example, xylene and toluene may be used as substitutes but are, once they become wastes, 
regulated under RCRA as listed or characteristic wastes. 

e. 

Other chlorinated solvents. 

In addition to MCF and CFC-113, the three other commonly used chlorinated solvents 
are trichloroethylene (``TCE''), methylene chloride (``meth''), and perchloroethylene (``perc''). 
Unlike MCF and CFC-113, these chlorinated solvents have very short atmospheric lifetimes 
and are not considered to contribute to ozone depletion. However, all three have known 
toxicity problems and are regulated as Hazardous Air Pollutants under section 112 of title III 
of the Clean Air Act. They are also subject to waste handling standards under RCRA and to 
workplace standards set by OSHA. Additionally, TCE and perc exhibit photochemical 
reactivity, and are regulated as smog precursors. 

The phaseout of CFC-113 and MCF has prompted a renewed interest in meth, TCE, 
and perc, despite these toxicity concerns. The three solvents are mostly viewed as potential 
metal cleaning substitutes, especially since they can be used in conventional vapor degreasing 
equipment. In fact, these three solvents were the preferred industrial solvents until concerns 
about their toxicity and anticipated lowering of the OSHA Permissible Exposure Limits 
(PELs) resulted in a switch by some users to MCF. 

In response to such concerns, equipment vendors have now developed equipment for 
using these solvents that significantly limit their emissions. The availability of such 
equipment has prompted environmental agencies in other western countries, such as Germany, 
to relax restrictions on the use of these chemicals. Such equipment, although expensive, can 
now be purchased in the United States. 

f. 

No-clean alternatives. 

No-clean alternatives involve the use of fluxes or cutting oils that need not be 
removed after the manufactured part is fully formed. It offers an efficient solution to the 
cleaning problem, since it sidesteps the need for cleaning altogether. This type of substitute 
represents one of the few process changes possible in the solvents cleaning sector. Water-removable products are
products where the soils or fluxes can be removed using water as 
opposed to other types of chemical solvents. In electronics cleaning, where these two 
approaches are in more widespread use, no-clean or water-removable alternatives rely either 
on special fluxes or on a soldering process that eliminates or reduces the residues otherwise 
removed through the cleaning step. 

In metal preparations, an increasing common process change is to use vanishing oils. 
These oils are refined mineral spirits, usually odorless, that flash off after the metal forming 
step is completed thus eliminating the need for cleaning. Technically, this process can be 
referred to as a ``no-clean'' process, although that term is usually reserved for electronics 
manufacture. 

g. 

Perfluorocarbons. 

Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are fully fluorinated compounds, unlike either CFCs, HCFCs 
or HFCs. Perfluorocarbons presently employed or being investigated for commercial 
applications for cleaning are C5F12, C6F12, C6F14, C7F16, C8F18, C5F11NO, C6F13NO, 
C7F15NO, and C8F16. 

These compounds are being discussed as part of innovative cleaning and drying 
systems to replace ozone-depleting solvents used in cleaning. These systems would use an 
aqueous or solvent cleaner bath with PFCs for rinsing and/or drying. Although the PFCs 
technically are being used as drying agents in this system, it is due to the replacement of 
CFC-113 as a cleaner that the PFCs are being used, which is why PFCs are addressed in the 
solvent cleaning sector. PFCs also have solvent displacement properties (including for 
displacement of water), that may make their use necessary. Although these systems have the 
technical potential to meet a number of cleaning needs, the expense of the PFCs may limit 
widespread commercial interest in systems that use these compounds. 


The environmental characteristics of concern for these compounds are high global 
warming potential (5,000-10,000 times greater than CO

2

) and long atmospheric lifetimes 
(3,000-5,000 years). Although the actual contributions to global warming depend upon the 
quantities of PFCs emitted, the warming effects of PFCs are essentially irreversible. In other 
respects, PFCs are benign and are generally nontoxic, nonflammable, and do not contribute to 
ground-level ozone formation. Environmental concerns associated with use of PFCs are 
discussed in the comment response section of this preamble, section III.D. Technology for 
containment and recycling of PFCs is commercially available and is recommended by 
manufacturers to offset any possible adverse environmental effects. 

h. 

Monochlorotoluene/benzotrifluorides. 

Monochlorotoluene and benzotrifluorides are of commercial interest as solvent 
substitutes in a variety of cleaning applications. These compounds can be used either in 
isolation or in various mixtures, depending on desired chemical properties. The Agency is 
still receiving toxicity and exposure information on these formulations and will issue a SNAP 
determination for these substitutes when SNAP review is complete.

i. 

Volatile methyl siloxanes.

 Cyclic and linear volatile methyl siloxanes (VMSs) are currently undergoing investigation for use as substitutes
for class I compounds in metals, electronics and precision cleaning. Because of their chemical properties, these
compounds show promise as substitutes for cleaning precision guidance equipment in the defense and aerospace industries.
In addition, the volatile methyl siloxanes have high purity and are therefore relatively easy to recover and recycle.
In the cleaning system using VMSs, the fluids are used to clean parts in a closed header system using a totally enclosed
process. The parts are drained and then dried using vacuum baking.

j. 

Supercritical fluid cleaning, plasma cleaning, UV-ozone cleaning.

 Supercritical fluid cleaning, plasma cleaning and UV-ozone cleaning are all three high-technology methods of cleaning
parts. These substitutes are mostly of interest for cleaning electronic parts or for precision cleaning, although
supercritical carbon dioxide is being investigated for metal cleaning applications as well.

k. 

Dibromomethane.

 The Agency has received notification that dibromomethane (also referred to as methylene bromide) can be used as a
substitute cleaning agent. This chemical has an ozone depletion potential of .17, although it is not yet listed under
the Clean Air Act. In addition, dibromomethane is believed to be more toxic than methylene chloride, although toxicity
studies are scarce since industrial applications in the past have been limited. As a result, the Agency intends to
propose this substitute as unacceptable in a separate rule-making.

l. 

HFC-4310mee.

 HFC-4310mee will soon be commercially available as a solvent cleaning agent. The Agency has received preliminary
data on this chemical, and anticipates that its use will be limited due to global warming concerns to applications
where it can replace longer-lived PFCs or where its special chemical properties make it the only viable substitute
for a class I or II compound. This chemical will be undergoing review under the Premanufacture Notice program of the
Toxic Substances Control Act.

Other HFCs are also being developed for solvent usage, although their composition is still proprietary.



3. Comment Response



The majority of public comments received on the proposed solvents cleaning SNAP decisions focused on the determinations
for perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and for chlorinated solvents. Most commenters on PFCs requested that the Agency expand
the acceptability determination for PFCs to parts other than computer components, as stated in the SNAP Notice of
Proposed Rule-Making (NPRM). Although many commenters agreed that a measure of control due to global warming effects
was necessary, several companies described in detail situations where PFCs are believed to be the only viable alternative
to CFC-113 and methyl chloroform. The Agency agrees with these commenters, and the final SNAP determination
lists the PFCs as acceptable in all cases where no other alternative meets performance or safety standards. This approach
does not diverge significantly from that described in the NPRM, in which EPA noted its intention to examine the possibility
that PFCs may be necessary for cleaning other parts in addition to computer components.

Opinions on the chlorinated solvents diverged widely. A number of commenters disagreed with the Agency's decision
to list these chemicals as acceptable substitutes for solvents cleaning. This viewpoint was countered by other commenters
who strongly agreed with the continuing need to use chlorinated solvents. The Agency has not altered its decision
on these chemicals, and remains convinced that with responsible control measures and housekeeping practices, potential
risks from these solvents can be significantly reduced and that overall risks to human health and the environment
will not increase significantly as a result of substitution.



4. Listing Decisions



a. 

Acceptable substitutes. 

(1) Metals cleaning. (a) Semi-aqueous/aqueous cleaners. Semi-aqueous and aqueous cleaners are acceptable substitutes
for CFC-113 and MCF in metals cleaning. The determinations in this action cover semi-aqueous cleaners using
terpenes, petroleum hydrocarbons, and alcohols. To complete its modeling of the ability of aqueous and semi-aqueous
substitutes to replace CFC-113 and MCF in existing applications, the Agency examined their ability to meet
cleaning requirements in the metals cleaning sector. Each of these alternatives has the potential to service as much
as 70 percent of the metals cleaning market. To date, companies have shown the greatest interest in aqueous formulations
for metals cleaning, which is why the Agency has reviewed this option in its first round of SNAP determinations.

Concern over the water-based cleaners has historically focussed on the potential for adverse effects on aquatic
life following discharge of wastewaters to surface water bodies. Examples of these effects include death to aquatic
microorganisms, fish teratogenicity, or ecosystem effects such as inhibition of algal growth or bioconcentration.
In this case, the Agency wanted to ensure that, in restricting the use of CFC-113 and methyl chloroform, it would
not simply be replacing risks from air emissions with equal risks from contaminated water effluent.

<TEXT>
 

To complete its risk analysis for the aqueous and semi-aqueous formulations, the Agency developed a screening methodology
designed to characterize risks presented by typical manufacturing setups using these formulations. The diversity
of chemicals used in aqueous and semi-aqueous cleaning complicated this undertaking. To complete its screen, the
Agency projected concentrations in water for the most toxic chemical that could be used in the water-based formulations.
These concentrations were based on the maximum possible concentration in the formulation and case studies documenting
actual release profiles for several sample processes. The predicted concentrations obtained using this approach
were then compared with toxicity values for this ``worst'' chemical.

This analysis suggests that most risks presented by use of water-based cleaners can be controlled by standard process
management practices (e.g., planned discard schedules for wash and rinse solutions in cleaner tanks) and by adhering
to existing requirements for wastewater treatment imposed by municipal or state authorities. This screening approach,
although it does not examine the toxicity of each chemical and mixture or project exposures for each possible formulation,
does provide adequate perspective on the risks of these compounds compared with risks from continued use of CFCs.

Although the Agency is listing water-based substitutes as acceptable, it urges companies to install systems that
permit re-use and recycling of the formulation wherever possible to limit discharge of these chemicals. This step
can offer both important benefits to aquatic systems as well as reduce operating costs of cleaning systems.

Users should also note that EPA is preparing new effluent limitations and standards that will affect metals cleaning
under the Clean Water Act for the Metal Products and Machinery sector. These standards, the first portion of which
is expected to be issued in November 1994, will address any remaining uncontrolled risks deriving from the use of water-based
cleaners in this industry. Phase I covers sectors such as stationary industrial equipment, hardware, and aircraft.
Phase II, to be issued later, covers among other sectors manufacture, rebuild, or maintenance of buses, trucks, railroads,
and shipbuilding.

(b) 

Straight organic solvent cleaning.

 Straight organic solvent cleaning is an acceptable substitute for CFC-113 and MCF in the metals cleaning sector.
This acceptability determination extends to organic solvents used as individual chemicals as well as in combinations.
Although these compounds can be toxic to human health and are considered VOCs, the Agency's risk screen shows that
these risks can be addressed through existing regulatory controls. In occupational settings where toxicity is a
concern, such as for acetone or for certain ketones, OSHA has set PELs designed to control risks. One class of organic
solvents about which there has recently been increased concern for possible health effects is glycol ethers. However,
the glycol ethers identified in this case are ethylene glycol ethers, whereas for solvent cleaning purposes companies
customarily use propylene glycol ethers. Propylene glycol ethers are generally not believed to exhibit the same
degree of toxicity as the ethylene glycol ethers. Controls also exist for sources of VOC emissions and for handling
of the organic solvents as hazardous wastes under RCRA.

Regulatory standards are not the only method of mitigating the environmental effects of these chemicals. Many manufacturers
and distributors of these solvents have instituted programs or can refer companies to programs that will reclaim
and process spent solvent_either on or off-site_for further use. The Agency encourages companies using organic
solvents to seek out such programs. In addition, companies should consider the principles of pollution prevention
when instituting cleaning with organic solvents and adopt emissions control measures such as appropriate freeboard
and automated hoists that will reduce pollution at its source.

(c) 

Other chlorinated solvents.

 Trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (perc) and methylene chloride (meth) are all acceptable substitutes
for CFC-113 and MCF in the metals cleaning sector. These alternatives have the chemical properties to meet the
cleaning needs of up to 80 percent of the metals cleaning sector, although the Agency anticipates that the actual market
share for the non-ozone-depleting chlorinated solvents will not expand to the maximum extent feasible. Because
of the high toxicity of these compounds, they have the potential to pose risks to workers and residents in nearby communities.
However, the Agency's analysis of use of these compounds as cleaning agents indicates that these risks can be controlled
by adhering to existing regulatory standards. OSHA has determined, for instance, that it is possible to use these
solvents in a manner that minimizes risks to workers. To reach this conclusion, OSHA conducted extensive analyses
of the toxicity and technical feasibility of using perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, or methylene chloride
(54 FR 2329-2984, January 19, 1989, and 56 FR 57036-57141, November 7, 1991). OSHA found that the new PEL
of 50 ppm for trichloroethylene was feasible in metal cleaning operations (54 FR 2433) and after conducting an extensive
study of metal degreasing control technologies, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health concluded
that an exposure limit of 25 ppm for TCE could also be achieved. More recently, in its proposed standard for methylene
chloride, OSHA found that a PEL of 25 ppm is technically feasible during metal cleaning operations with the use of appropriate
local exhaust ventilation and work practices.

<TEXT>
 

In addition, these solvents are all listed as hazardous wastes under RCRA (F001, U080, U210, U228) and thus must comply
with applicable RCRA waste disposal requirements. The SNAP risk screen did note the potential for adverse effects
without additional controls. However, the Agency is in the process of addressing residual risks to the general population
through releases to air under section 112 of the Clean Air Act. Section 112 requires EPA to establish Maximum Achievable
Control Technology (MACT) standards for use of Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs). All three non-OD chlorinated solvents
are listed as HAPs, and the Agency issued a proposal describing MACT rules governing their use in industrial cleaning
in November 1993. The final regulation is expected to be issued by the end of 1994. 

Finally, through the voluntary ``33/50'' pollution prevention program, the EPA is encouraging companies to decrease
emissions of TCE, perc, and meth, in addition to 14 other specific chemicals. Companies participating in this program
voluntarily commit to decreasing emissions 33 percent by the end of 1992 and 50 percent by the end of 1995, using pollution
prevention strategies. The Agency is committed in the long term to urge companies to participate in pollution prevention
programs such as 33/50, and to continue to find new ways to use and emit less polluting and lower toxicity compounds.
EPA urges even companies not participating in the 33/50 program to explore and adopt housekeeping practices, chemical
handling procedures, and equipment configurations that lead to lower chemical consumption. 

(d) Supercritical carbon dioxide. Supercritical carbon dioxide is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-113
and MCF in the metals cleaning sector. The Agency's risk screen did not identify any environmental effects with significant
concerns for this substitute. 

(e) Vanishing oils. Vanishing oils are acceptable substitutes for CFC-113 and MCF in the metals cleaning sector.
Although these materials are VOCs, extensive regulations exist at the Federal, state, and local level to control
any new VOC uses. In addition, newer vanishing oils often have higher flashpoints, enabling them to be flashed and
captured in ovens. 

(f) Volatile methyl siloxanes (dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, hexamethyldisiloxane, octamethyltrisiloxane,
decamethyltetrasiloxane). The volatile methyl siloxanes dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, hexamethyldisiloxane,

octamethyltrisiloxane, and decamethyltetrasiloxane are acceptable substitutes for CFC-113 and MCF in the
metals cleaning sector. The Agency's risk screen for these chemicals indicated that exposure to these substitutes
are generally below levels that would raise concern for health risks. Two of the volatile methyl siloxanes, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane
and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, have low company-set exposure limits, and these chemicals will be handled under
a separate rulemaking. 

(2) Electronics cleaning. a. (Semi-aqueous/aqueous cleaners).
Semi-aqueous and aqueous cleaners are acceptable substitutes for CFC-113 and MCF in electronics cleaning.
The justification for this determination is described in the section on metals cleaning. In this case, the Agency
estimated that up to 80 percent of the cleaning market could be captured by semi-aqueous cleaners and that up to 60 percent
of the market could be served by aqueous cleaners. As in metals cleaning, the Agency urges companies to adopt pollution
prevention practices and to select formulations with low overall toxicity. 

Effluent limitations and standards that affect use of water-based formulations in the electronics cleaning sector
will be proposed under the Clean Water Act for the Phase I Metal Products and Machinery sector by November 1994. Phase
I includes electronic equipment along with other manufacturing areas such as aerospace, hardware and mobile industrial
equipment. Phase II, to be issued later, covers household and office equipment in addition to sectors such as motor
vehicles and shipbuilding. 

(b) No-clean substitutes. No-clean processes are acceptable substitutes for CFC-113 and MCF in electronics
cleaning. The Agency's analysis estimates that, over time, as much as seventy percent of the electronics cleaning
market could switch to no-clean processes_a projection that is borne out by the high degree of interest shown by electronics
companies in these substitutes. 

Concerns for risks deriving from use of no-clean processes focus primarily on worker safety. To examine these risks,
the Agency looked at critical factors that distinguish no-clean processes from conventional electronics assembly.
These differences center on changes in the proportions of chemicals used in formulations, rather than on differences
in the identity of chemicals selected. The analysis determined that occupational risks deriving from these differences
are already well-documented and controlled, for example, through requirements specified on key Materials Safety
Data Sheets and existing workplace regulations implemented by OSHA.

<PARENT> FR940318-0-00023 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Additionally, the shifts in proportions of chemicals used in the formulation result in less waste than is normally
generated through the traditional manufacturing process, resulting in a lower probability of overall adverse effects
to the general population. The Agency also investigated the production of waste before and after the actual cleaning
process and found that waste generation at these points in the production process would not be greater than what is
seen with CFC-113 or MCF use. 

This acceptability listing also applies to water-removable fluxes and inert gas soldering. 

(c) Straight organic solvent cleaning. Straight organic solvent cleaning is an acceptable substitute for CFC-113
and MCF in the electronics cleaning sector. This acceptability determination extends to organic solvents used as
individual chemicals as well as in combinations. The Agency's justification for this decision is described in the
section on acceptable substitutes for metals cleaning. 

(d) Other chlorinated solvents. Trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (perc) and methylene chloride (meth)
are all acceptable substitutes for CFC-113 and MCF in the electronics cleaning sector. The reasons for this
decision are described in the metals cleaning discussion. Although these solvents have not received as much commercial
interest for electronics cleaning as for metals cleaning applications, the Agency did receive a request to review
these chemicals for electronics cleaning. 

Although the Agency's risk screen focused on use of these chemicals in metals cleaning operations, the screen suggests
that release profiles for these chemicals in electronics cleaning will be either the same or lower. As a result, the
Agency has reached the same conclusion with respect to electronics cleaning as in the metals cleaning analysis, namely
that any risks due to the inherent toxicity of these chemicals could be controlled by existing and future regulatory
standards. 

(e) Supercritical fluid cleaning, plasma cleaning, UV-ozone cleaning. Supercritical fluid cleaning, plasma cleaning,
UV-ozone cleaning are all acceptable as substitutes for CFC-113 and MCF in electronics cleaning. The Agency
did not identify any environmental issues associated with use of these substitutes. While ozone is hazardous to human
health, OSHA has already set standards for use of this compound in the workplace. 

(f) Volatile methyl siloxanes (dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, hexamethyldisiloxane, octamethyltrisiloxane,
decamethyltetrasiloxane). The volatile methyl siloxanes dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, hexamethyldisiloxane,

octamethyltrisiloxane, and decamethyltetrasiloxane are acceptable substitutes for CFC-113 and MCF in the
electronics cleaning sector. The Agency's risk screen for these chemicals indicated that exposure to these substitutes
are generally below levels that would raise concern for health risks. Two of the volatile methyl siloxanes, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane
and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, have low company-set exposure limits, and these chemicals will be handled under
a separate rule-making. 

(3) Precision cleaning. (a) 

Semi-aqueous/aqueous cleaners.

 Semi-aqueous and aqueous cleaners are acceptable substitutes for CFC-113 and MCF in precision cleaning. The
reasons for this decision are the same as those described in the metals cleaning section. Each of these alternatives
has the potential to service approximately 65 percent of the precision cleaning market. This figure may overestimate
the technical potential for water-based cleaners in this sector, since this end use sector faces the greatest technical
constraints in implementing new cleaning alternatives. 

The Agency did not specifically examine risks from water-based formulations used in precision cleaning since the
processes are typically either similar to those used in metals cleaning or have lower throughputs and therefore fewer
discharges. Therefore, the analysis assumed that these risks from precision cleaning would be either comparable
to or less than risks associated with use of water-based formulations for metals cleaning. 

(b) Other chlorinated solvents. Other chlorinated solvents are acceptable substitutes for CFC-113 and MCF
in precision cleaning. The reasons for this decision are described in the section on metals cleaning. For the analysis
of risks from these substitutes in the precision cleaning end use sector, the Agency made the same assumptions as in
its analysis for electronics cleaning applications of water-based formulations, namely that exposures would be
equal to or less than exposures in the metals cleaning sector since the processes for precision cleaning are similar
or even of lower emissions than those for metals cleaning. Consequently, the Agency believes that risks would also
be either equivalent or lower. 

(c) Straight organic solvent cleaning. Straight organic solvent cleaning is an acceptable substitute for CFC-113
and MCF in precision cleaning. This acceptability determination extends to organic solvents used as individual
chemicals as well as in combinations. The Agency's justification for this decision is described in the section on
acceptable substitutes for metals cleaning. 

(d) Supercritical fluid cleaning, plasma cleaning, UV-ozone cleaning. Supercritical fluid cleaning, plasma cleaning,
UV-ozone cleaning are all acceptable as substitutes for CFC-113 and MCF in precision cleaning. The Agency did
not identify any environmental issues associated with use of these substitutes. While ozone is hazardous to human
health, OSHA has already set standards for use of this compound in the workplace. 

(e) Volatile Methyl Siloxanes (dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, hexamethyldisiloxane, octamethyltrisiloxane,
decamethyltetrasiloxane). The volatile methyl siloxanes dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, hexamethyldisiloxane,
octamethyltrisiloxane, and decamethyltetrasiloxane are acceptable substitutes for CFC-113 and MCF in the
precision cleaning sector. The Agency's risk screen for these chemicals indicated that exposure to these substitutes
are generally below levels that would raise concern for health risks. Two of the volatile methyl siloxanes, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane
and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, have low company-set exposure limits, and these 
chemicals will be handled under a separate rule-making. 

b. Substitutes acceptable subject to use conditions. (None).

c. 

Substitutes acceptable subject to narrowed use limits. 


(1) Metals Cleaning. (None). 
(2) Electronics Cleaning. 
(a) Perfluorocarbons. 
Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are acceptable substitutes for CFC-113 and MCF in the 
electronics cleaning sector for high-performance, precision-engineering cleaning applications 
only where reasonable efforts have been made to ascertain that other alternatives are not 
technically feasible due to performance or safety requirements. PFCs covered by this 
determination are C5F12, C6F12, C6F14, C7F16, C8F18, C5F11NO, C6F13NO, C7F15NO, 
and C8F16O. The uses of PFCs in solvent cleaning are restricted due to global warming 
concerns. PFCs display intrinsic properties that point to their potential to be contributors to 
global warming. All PFCs, for instance, have very long atmospheric lifetimes. As an 
example, C5F12 (perfluoropentane) has a lifetime of approximately 4,100 years. This means 
that for practical purposes, any global warming effects from PFCs are irreversible. In 
contrast, the lifetime of CFC-113 is, at 110 years, 40 times smaller. Since greenhouse gases 
come from many diverse sources, even small emissions of PFCs warrant controls if global 
warming is to be successfully mitigated. The risk screen for the solvent cleaning sector 
discusses the atmospheric properties of PFCs and provides a more detailed discussion of why 
PFCs merit being listed as acceptable only for narrowed uses. 
Despite concerns about the global warming potential of PFCs, the Agency has listed 
this niche application as an acceptable use of perfluorocarbons because, for certain high-performance, precision-engineered
components and equipment, a PFC-based cleaning system 
may be the only viable alternative available to replace use of class I or II compounds. 
The characteristics of components or equipment that may require PFC-based cleaning 
are if the part: 
 Requires extremely low levels of remaining particulate and residue for adequate 
performance (as opposed to cosmetic appearance).
 Possesses complex geometric configurations and or capillary spaces (as small 
as 1 micron) which greatly hinder cleaning and drying.
 Contains or is made of materials sensitive to corrosion, oxidation or other damage from water (such as ceramics,
gallium arsenide, silicon nitride, or magnesium), where that damage would degrade subsequent performance of the
product.
 Contains temperature-sensitive materials that cannot maintain their integrity at the high drying temperatures
of alternative systems. 
 Contains materials that are hydrophilic or otherwise impaired by contact with water.
 Is extremely fragile, requiring the use of a low viscosity, very low surface 
tension fluid.
 Is contaminated with specialized halogenated lubricants or damping fluids such 
as perfluoropolyethers.
 Is a low-volume prototype under development for research, testing and 
evaluation purposes. 
Users should note that the presence of one of these parameters alone does not 
necessarily indicate the need to use a PFC. For instance, a water-sensitive part could potentially also be cleaned
using a solvent wash, solvent rinse without PFCs. 
Examples of components where PFCs may be necessary are: 
 Precision optical and electro-optical systems such as components for highpowered lasers or weapon targeting
systems.
 Specialized electrical, semiconductor and electronic components, connectors 
and assemblies such as precision electronic components used for military and 
avionics applications.
 Sensitive medical devices and medical equipment components such as 
electronic circuitry for pacemakers (does not include prosthetic devices). 
 Precision telecommunications and communications components such as 
microwave hybrid components for electronic warfare. 
 High-performance computer components and computer electro-mechanical 
assemblies such as direct access storage devices. 
Other examples are listed in the section on precision cleaning. Examples of parts 
where alternatives other than PFCs exist are electronic parts for low-value, mass-produced 
consumer or standard machined metal parts. 
A specific example under electronics cleaning where PFCs may be necessary exists in 
manufacture of certain direct access storage devices (DASDs) for computers. To make the 
technical improvements demanded of the storage devices, such as faster access times and 
higher recording densities, companies have been required to use magnetically superior 
materials. These materials are extremely prone to corrosion from water and are vulnerable to 
any contamination introduced in the manufacturing process, such as organic or particulate 
matter. Consequently, the storage device itself must be a miniature ``clean room'' if it is to 
perform correctly. Manufacturers of some DASDs can use water-based cleaners in much of 
the production process, but may need to rely on the PFCs as water-displacement agents to 
achieve the required high degree of cleanliness while protecting the water-sensitive materials 
in the device. 
As the acceptability determination states, before users adopt PFCs as part of a 
substitute cleaning system, they must ascertain that ``other alternatives are not technically 
feasible due to performance or safety requirements.'' This statement implies users will 
undertake a thorough technical investigation of alternatives before implementing the PFCs. A 
determination, for instance, that PFCs are necessary simply ``because my parts cannot tolerate 
water,'' is insufficient. Similarly, companies should avoid rejecting an alternative simply 
because it is flammable or toxic, since equipment now exists which may be feasible for some 
uses that makes it possible for a broad spectrum of alternatives to meet performance and 
safety standards. 
Users may contact vendors of alternatives to explore with experts on these alternatives 
whether or not they would work. This effort may involve a detailed discussion of the type of 
parts, e.g., function, substrate, geometry, and cleanliness standards. A possible approach is to 
actually arrange for the parts to be tested with other cleaning alternatives. For example, a 
concern regarding the flammability of isopropyl alcohol is not sufficient reason to reject this 
alternative, unless the user has contacted vendors and examined the newer styles of equipment 
and found them insufficiently safe. To assist users in their evaluation, EPA has prepared a 
list of vendors selling substitutes for cleaning solvents. Although EPA does not require users 
to report their test results in a certification to the Agency, companies must keep these results 
on file for future reference. 
In cases where users must rely on PFCs due to lack of other options, they should make every effort to: 
 Adopt closed systems and recover, recycle and destroy where possible. 
 Pre-clean where possible with other alternatives so as to avoid unnecessary use 
of PFCs.
 Reduce emissions to a minimum through equipment features and conservation 
practices that address idling losses, liquid dragout, and operator variables 
(adequate freeboard, chillers, welded piping, programmable hoists, operator 
training, etc.).
 Continue to search for long-term alternatives. 
The Agency believes that it is reasonable to expect users to achieve favorable CFC/PFC 
replacement ratios since PFCs have relatively higher boiling points. In addition, the high 
price of PFCs makes additional containment cost-effective. Companies forced to use PFCs 
due to lack of other alternatives may use the PFC-based equipment to clean and dry other 
precision parts, but only if the amount of PFCs needed to stock the equipment does not 
increase.

Prospective users should also note that companies now investigating PFC use contend 
that within 2-3 years, it will be possible to replace the PFCs in cleaning equipment with 
HFCs or other options that have zero ozone depletion potential and significantly lower global 
warming potential. As a result, they view use of the PFCs as an important but transitional 
solution to their cleaning needs. If PFCs are chosen, it is important for users to begin 
working with chemical manufacturers to start testing and qualifying these new materials to 
help speed conversion when alternative chemicals become commercially available. 

Users of PFCs should note that if other alternatives such as HFCs or other cleaning 
substitutes are later found to meet performance or safety standards, the Agency could be 
subject to a petition requesting it to list PFCs as unacceptable substitutes due to availability of 
other alternatives. If such claims are determined to be accurate and EPA limits the 
acceptability listing even further, EPA may grandfather existing uses but only to the extent 
warranted by cost and timing considerations associated with testing and retrofitting. 

(3) Precision cleaning. (a) Perfluorocarbons. 
Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are acceptable substitutes for CFC-113 and MCF in the 
precision cleaning sector only for high-performance, precision-engineering cleaning 
applications where reasonable efforts have been made to ascertain that other alternatives are 
not technically feasible due to performance or safety requirements. PFCs covered by this 
determination are C5F12, C6F12, C6F14, C7F16, C8F18, C5F11NO, C6F13NO, C7F15NO, 
and C8F16O. The electronics cleaning section discusses the justification for this narrowed 
use acceptability listing. 

Despite concerns about the global warming potential of PFCs, the Agency has listed 
this narrowed application as an acceptable use of perfluorocarbons in precision cleaning 
because, for certain high-performance, precision-engineered components and equipment, a 
PFC-based system may be the only viable alternative available to replace use of class I or II 
compounds. 
Types of precision components that may require PFC-based cleaning include: 
 High-performance guidance, navigation and tracking systems such as 
gyroscopes and accelerometers.
 High-performance aerospace and avionics components and equipment such as 
liquid oxygen systems or rotational hand controllers.
 Critical analytical devices and their components used for gas chromatography 
where low residue levels are essential.
 Optical components made from plastics damaged irreparably by water or other 
solvents or coated or mounted with specialized materials. 
Interested users should review the section on PFCs under electronics cleaning for a 
full discussion of the considerations, limitations, and requirements associated with selecting 
this alternative. 
d. 

Unacceptable substitutes. 

(1) Metals cleaning. (a) HCFC-141b and its blends. 
HCFC-141b and its blends are unacceptable as substitutes for CFC-113 and MCF in 
metals cleaning, with acceptability subject to narrowed use limitations to be granted by EPA, 
if necessary, as CFC-113 replacements after the effective date of this listing. The effective 
date for this listing is 30 days after the date of the final rule for uses of HCFC-141b and its 
blends in new equipment (including retrofits made after the effective date) and as of January 
1, 1996, for uses of HCFC-141b and its blends in existing equipment. For purposes of this 
SNAP determination, ``existing equipment'' is defined to include equipment that companies 
have shown a clear intention to use and have purchased before the effective date of the SNAP 
determination, even if that equipment has not yet been installed. 
As discussed earlier in this action in Section VI.B., the Agency is authorized to 
grandfather existing uses from a prohibition where appropriate under the four-part test 
established in 

Sierra Club 

v. 

EPA, 

supra. The Agency has conducted the four analyses 
required under this test, and has concluded that the balance of equities favors a grandfathering 
period of two years for uses of HCFC-141b in existing equipment in this application. The 
prohibition set forth in this action clearly represents a departure from previously established 
practice, as use of the substitute was allowed previously. Existing users of HCFC-141b who 
switched from class I substances into this solvent invested in this substitute on the assumption 
that it would be a sufficient improvement over the class I use. Prohibiting their use of the 
substitute immediately would impose a severe economic burden on these users. These factors 
taken together outweigh any statutory interest in applying the new rule immediately to 
existing users. This is especially true since the restriction applies immediately to new 
equipment using HCFC-141b, which creates no incentive for continued investment in 
equipment using HCFC-141b in this application.

The Agency's basis for proposing to restrict use of HCFC-141b is that this compound has a comparatively high
ODP_0.11. This is the highest ODP of all the HCFCs; in fact, the ODP for HCFC-141b is nearly equal to the ODP for
MCF (0.12). For this reason, the Agency concludes that replacing MCF with HCFC-141b is unacceptable, since
using HCFC-141b in place of MCF would not provide the environmental benefits that the phase-out was designed
to achieve. 

To analyze the impacts from use of HCFC-141b as a CFC-113 replacement, the Agency estimated HCFC-141b
use over time in each of the cleaning end uses, and projected health effects due to ozone depletion with the help of the
Atmospheric Stabilization Framework model. The modeling period starts in 1990 and measures health effects expected
for people born before 2030. 

The findings of this modeling show adverse health effects of the magnitude commonly associated with the use of ozone-depleting
compounds. For example, in the case of metals cleaning, the Agency projected that use of HCFC-141b to replace
MCF where technically feasible could yield approximately 40,000 additional skin cancer cases and approximately
1,000 additional skin cancer fatalities compared to use of non-ozone-depleting substitutes. 

The Agency believes that these figures and the availability of superior substitutes as described in the section on
acceptable substitutes justify the proposal to list HCFC-141b as an unacceptable substitute. The Agency believes
that, in almost all applications, other solvent cleaning substitutes are available that meet industry performance
and safety criteria. To reach its decision on HCFC-141b use, the Agency also took into account the cost of other
alternatives. The analysis suggested that, although HCFC-141b can be used with modification to existing equipment,
the capital costs for the retrofit and the materials costs in combination would be so high as to render other alternatives
comparatively affordable, even though they require new equipment. 

HCFC-141b will be restricted as a substitute only where other alternatives exist to CFC-113 for the application
in question. Several companies have already contacted the Agency, indicating that they have tested available alternatives
to CFC-113, and that in some cases only HCFC-141b meets performance or safety criteria. The most commonly
cited reasons for needing to use HCFC-141b are either applications where a non-flammable solvent is required
or where sensitive parts could be destroyed by use of other cleaning systems. 

For these applications of HCFC-141b, the Agency may find that the uses are acceptable subject to limitations
if it determines that these critical uses persist beyond the grandfathering period provided in the listing. For EPA
to issue a narrowed use acceptability listing, companies who believe they may need to use HCFC-141b past the
effective date must first contact EPA, since the Agency has not yet received any indication from users of a technical
need to use HCFC-141b past the grandfathering period granted under the unacceptability listing. Narrowed
use acceptability listings are described in more detail in section VII. of the Preamble. Companies interested in
submitting a SNAP application for a narrowed use are encouraged to contact the Agency at least 90 days in advance of
the expiration of the grandfathering period. Companies that intend to use HCFC-141b within the parameters
of the final unacceptability listing and who will cease using HCFC-141b after the expiration of the grandfathering
period need not contact the Agency. 

The Agency believes that the decision to restrict HCFC-141b use as a CFC-113/MCF substitute for metals
cleaning will have little effect on industry since few vendors of HCFC-141b have been selling HCFC-141b
as a metals cleaning substitute. Companies in this end use sector that want to replace CFC-113 with HCFC-141b
and use it beyond the date described in this SNAP determination should review the section referenced above. The Agency
expects to receive few such requests, however, since most metals cleaning is currently performed with MCF. 

(2) Electronics cleaning. (a) HCFC-141b and its blends. HCFC-141b and its blends are unacceptable as
substitutes for CFC-113 and MCF in electronics cleaning, with acceptability subject to narrowed use limitations
to be granted by EPA, if necessary, as CFC-113 replacements after the effective date of this listing. The effective
date for this prohibition is 30 days after the date of the final rule for new equipment (including retrofits made after
the effective date) and January 1, 1996 for existing equipment. The structure and reasons for this unacceptability
listing are the same as those for the decision on HCFC-141b as a metals cleaning substitute. As in the metals cleaning
sector, the Agency will grant narrowed use acceptability listings in limited cases for use beyond the grandfathering
period of the listing, as necessary. As discussed earlier in this action in section VI.B., the Agency is authorized
to grandfather existing uses from a prohibition where appropriate under the four-part test established in 

Sierra Club 

v. 

EPA,

 supra. 

The Agency has conducted the four analyses required under this test, and it has concluded that the balance of equities
favors a grandfathering period of two years for existing equipment in this application. The prohibition set forth
in this action clearly represents a departure from previously established practice, as use of the substitute was
allowed previously. Existing users of HCFC-141b who switched from class I substances into this solvent invested
in this substitute on the assumption that it would be considered an acceptable substitute. It would impose a severe
economic burden on these users to prohibit their use of the substitute immediately, with no provision of time to allow
them to recover their investment in existing equipment or acquire new equipment in a timely fashion. These factors
taken together appear to outweigh any statutory interest in applying the new rule immediately to existing users,
especially since the restriction would apply immediately to new equipment using HCFC-141b, which would serve
to prevent further ozone depletion from use of HCFC-141b in this application. 

As with metals cleaning applications for HCFC-141b, the Agency modeled potential HCFC-141b use in electronics
cleaning applications over time, and projected health effects due to ozone depletion with the help of the Atmospheric
Stabilization Framework model. For electronics cleaning, the maximum market penetration for HCFC-141b as
a replacement for CFC-113 is 90 percent. With this penetration, the model predicted approximately 400 additional
skin cancer fatalities and 30,000 additional skin cancer cases compared to uses of non-ozone-depleting substitutes.


(3) Precision cleaning. (a) HCFC-141b. HCFC-141b and its blends are unacceptable as substitutes for
CFC-113 and MCF in precision cleaning, with acceptability subject to narrowed use limitations to be granted
by EPA, if necessary, as CFC-113 replacements after the effective date of this listing. The effective date for
this listing is 30 days after the date of the final rule for new equipment and as of January 1, 1996, for existing equipment.
The structure and reasons for this decision are described in the section on metals cleaning. As discussed earlier
in this action in section VI.B., the Agency is authorized to grandfather existing uses from a prohibition where appropriate
under the four-part test established in 

Sierra Club 

v. 

EPA,

 supra. 

The Agency has conducted the four analyses required under this test, and it has concluded that the balance of equities
favors a grandfathering period of two years for existing equipment in this application. The prohibition set forth
in this action clearly represents a departure from previously established practice, as use of the substitute was
allowed previously. Existing users of HCFC-141b who switched from class I substances into this solvent invested
in this substitute on the assumption that it would be considered an acceptable substitute. It would impose a severe
economic burden on these users to prohibit their use of the substitute immediately, with no provision of time to allow
them to recover their investment in existing equipment or acquire new equipment in a timely fashion. These factors
taken together outweigh any statutory interest in applying the new rule immediately to existing users, especially
since the restriction would apply immediately to new equipment using HCFC-141b, which would serve to prevent
further ozone depletion from use of HCFC-141b in this application. 

In the case of precision cleaning uses of HCFC-141b, the Agency's modeling of HCFC-141b use as a CFC-113
replacement projected approximately 5,000 additional skin cancer cases when compared to use of non-ozone-depleting
substitutes.

As in the case of other cleaning applications, the Agency finds unacceptable substitutions of HCFC-141b to
replace MCF, since these compounds have nearly identical ODPs. Here again, the Agency will grant, if necessary, a
limited narrowed use acceptability listings for CFC-113 past the exemption granted in the grandfathering
period. However, the Agency expects only few requests for permission to use HCFC-141b to come from this sector,
since most companies who requested exemptions to date to have stated that they view their use of HCFC-141b only
as an interim solution. EPA believes that, absent future indications from such companies, all uses of HCFC-141b
can be terminated by the effective date of the unacceptability listing. 



G. Fire Suppression and Explosion Protection 



1. Overview 



Halons are gaseous or easily vaporizable halocarbons used primarily for putting out fires, but also for explosion
protection. The two halons used most widely in the United States are Halon 1211 (chlorodifluorobromomethane) and
Halon 1301 (trifluorobromomethane). Halon 1211 is used primarily in streaming applications and Halon 1301 is typically
used in total flooding applications. Some limited use of Halon 2402 also exists in the United States, but only as an
extinguishant in engine nacelles (the streamlined enclosure surrounding the engine) on older aircraft and in the
guidance system of Minuteman missiles. 

Halons are used in a wide range of fire protection applications because they combine five characteristics. First,
they are highly effective against solid, liquid/gaseous, and electrical fires (referred to as Class A, B, and C fires,
respectively). Second, they are clean agents; that is, they dissipate rapidly, leaving no residue and thereby avoiding
secondary damage to the property they are protecting. Third, halons do not conduct electricity and can be used in areas
containing live electrical equipment. Fourth, halons are gaseous substances that can penetrate in and around physical
objects to extinguish fires in otherwise inaccessible areas. Finally, halons are generally safe for limited human
exposure when used with proper exposure controls. 

Despite these advantages, halons are among the most ozone-depleting chemicals in use today. Halon 1301 has an estimated
ODP of 10; Halon 1211 has an estimated ODP of 3. Thus, while total halon production (measured in metric tons) comprised
just 2 percent of the total production of class I substances in 1986, halons represented 23 percent of the total estimated
ozone depletion potential of CFCs and halons combined. 

The greatest releases of halon into the atmosphere occur not in extinguishing fires, but during testing and training,
service and repair, and accidental discharges. Data generated as part of the Montreal Protocol's technology assessment
indicate that only 15 percent of annual Halon 1211 emissions and 18 percent of Halon 1301 emissions occur as a result
of use to extinguish actual fires. These figures indicate that significant gains can be made in protecting the ozone
layer by revising testing and training procedures and by limiting unnecessary discharges through better detection
and dispensing systems for halon and halon alternatives. 

Additional information on specific halon uses can be found in the Montreal Protocol 1991 Assessment or in other background
material in the public docket. The determinations found in this section are based on the risk screen described in the
background document entitled ``Risk Screen on the Use of Substitutes for Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances: Fire
Extinguishing and Explosion Protection (Halon Substitutes)'', and in supplementary assessments included in the
public docket. 



2. Substitutes for Halons 



The fire protection community has made considerable progress in identifying and developing substitutes for halons
in fire protection applications. Several manufacturers have submitted information regarding substitute streaming
and total flooding agents, and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has initiated efforts to develop
standards for their use in total flooding scenarios (NFPA 2001). In addition, manufacturers are seeking Underwriters
Laboratories (UL) and Factory Mutual Research Corporation (FMRC) certification for systems employing the new agents.
The Agency's review of halon substitutes is intended not to replace, but to complement the guidance of the fire protection
community in directing the transition away from halons to substitutes posing lower overall risk. 

Many recent efforts to develop substitutes for halon have focused on halocarbon chemicals. These are considered
potential ``replacements'' for halon because they possess halon-like properties (gaseous, non-conducting) and
because they can be used on Class A, B, and C fires. Some of the replacement chemicals are chemical action agents which,
like halons, suppress fires by interfering with the free radical chain reactions that sustain a fire. Others are physical
action agents which cool, dilute, or smother the fire (separating the air and fuel). In general, chemical action agents
are much more effective fire suppressants than physical action agents.

Halocarbons represent only a portion of agents available for fire protection, and in fact appear to be a decreasing
portion as users more and more are choosing to install ``alternative'' systems. Water, carbon dioxide, foam, and
dry chemical are already in widespread use as fire extinguishants and may capture some of the former halon market.
Water mist, powdered aerosols and inert gases are new technologies that are also likely to claim part of the former
halon market. EPA encourages users to assess their risk management schemes and, where possible, to minimize reliance
on chemical agents. Nonchemical alternatives should be seriously evaluated to determine whether they afford the
necessary level of protection in any given application. 

In assessing toxicity of a halocarbon, EPA pays special attention to consumer and worker exposure to discharges during
fire emergencies and accidental discharges. In these acute, episodic exposures to the halon substitutes, cardiac
sensitization is of particular interest. The term cardiac sensitization refers to an increased susceptibility
of the heart to adrenaline (or other catecholamines) which may result in potentially fatal heart arrhythmias. 

Several studies involving human exposure in a laboratory setting establish the potential significance for human
health of animal data on cardiac sensitization. Evaluating the safety of potential halon substitutes requires the
measurement of the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) and the Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level (LOAEL)
of cardiac sensitization in an appropriate species, usually the dog. EPA uses the NOAEL value as the basis to ensure
protection of the worker population. The protocols used to determine the cardiotoxic NOAEL and LOAEL concentrations
for each agent are conservative. The cardiotoxicity effect levels are measured in animals that have been made more
sensitive to these effects by the administration of epinephrine concentrations which are just below the concentrations
at which epinephrine alone causes cardiotoxicity. The concentration of epinephrine required to cause this heightened
sensitivity is approximately ten times greater than the concentration a human being would be likely to secrete under
stress. 

The determination of the safety of either a flooding or streaming agent substitute is also dependent on a number of
other related factors. For total flood systems, the magnitude of exposure will depend on the design concentration
of the flooding agent (as determined by the substitute's extinguishing concentration plus 20 percent, as specified
by NFPA guidelines) and the length of time it takes a person to evacuate the area in which the agent is released. In assessing
exposure and consequent use conditions, the design concentration of a total flood substitute is compared to its cardiotoxic
NOAEL and LOAEL levels. Generally, if the design concentration is higher than the agent's LOAEL level, then the agent
is not suitable for use in normally occupied areas. EPA is adopting the OSHA standard (29 CFR 1910, subpart L) section
1910.162, which limits the exposure to an agent based upon the length of time it takes to evacuate an area. In addition,
EPA makes note that OSHA standard 1910.160 also applies to gaseous total flood systems. 

In addition, EPA recognizes that agents should not be used at a concentration that significantly displaces oxygen
in the lungs. Most of the CFC and halon substitutes are gaseous, heavier-than-air compounds, which following a leak
or catastrophic emission may tend to pool near the ground, i.e. in the breathing zone. Since these agents are, in the
main, colorless with minimal odor and little toxicity or irritant effect, they can lead to asphyxiation by oxygen
displacement if the unwary inadvertently walk into an area of oxygen depletion. The designer of a total flood system
should be particularly alert to this possibility during discharge and subsequent dispersion of the agent in the space.
For compounds which do not elicit a cardiotoxic effect until very high concentrations have been reached, care should
be taken that sufficient oxygen remains in the room so that asphyxiation will not occur. 

In contrast to total flooding agents, exposure to substitute streaming agents can be expected to vary greatly depending
on the amount of agent released, the time needed to extinguish a fire, the size of the room or enclosure in which a fire
occurs, the size of the fire, the proximity of the person to the point of discharge of the agent, the rate at which fresh
air infiltrates the space, and the air exchange rate near the fire. Assessment of exposure in streaming applications
is much more complicated. EPA employs the `box model' to assess consumer exposure, which has been widely used for many
years to estimate probable exposures of workers to hazardous airborne materials, and has been described in detail
by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and is discussed in detail in the background
documents. The box model takes into consideration assumptions on volume of the space in which the extinguishant is
used, rate at which fresh air infiltrates the space, amount and rate of agent release, area of the fire, location of
the worker, and the air exchange rate in the vicinity of the fire. Values obtained through the box model, compared to
cardiotoxic NOAEL/LOAEL values, provide a screen for assessing risk. However, EPA has found that the model often
overstates the actual exposure to an agent, and therefore, EPA requires personal monitoring tests be conducted in
actual use scenarios in order to complete the assessment.

<TEXT>
 

Evaluating halon substitutes also requires assessing the efficacy of substitute agents. 
The efficacy of a fire protection agent can be compared using a cup burner or full scale test 
to obtain the extinguishing concentration in a particular fuel. NFPA standards require an 
additional 20 percent be added to obtain the design concentration. Most values identified in 
this rule are obtained by cup burner, while some are obtained by full scale testing, and most 
are in heptane. This measure is included in the discussion of halon substitutes for 
information and comparative purposes, and EPA does not assert that the efficacy values listed 
here are appropriate for all fire or explosion hazards. The user community is cautioned to 
consult the appropriate NFPA standard, relevant OSHA regulations, and professional fire 
consultants to determine actual requirements. 

After concluding the analysis of halon alternatives, EPA in some cases finds 
acceptable the use of an agent only under certain conditions. In implementing its use of 
conditions, the Agency has sought to avoid overlap with other existing regulatory authorities. 
EPA believes that section 612 clearly authorizes imposition of use conditions to ensure safe 
use of replacement agents. EPA's mandate is to list agents that ``reduce the overall risk to 
human health and the environment'' for ``specific uses.'' In light of this authorization, EPA 
is only intending to set conditions for the safe use of halon substitutes in the workplace until 
OSHA incorporates specific language addressing gaseous agents into OSHA regulation. 
Under OSHA Public Law 91-596, section 4(b)(1), OSHA is precluded from regulating an area 
currently being regulated by another federal agency. EPA is specifically deferring to OSHA, 
and has no intention to assume responsibility for regulating workplace safety especially with 
respect to fire protection. EPA's workplace use conditions will not bar OSHA from 
regulating under its Public Law 91-596 authority. The substitutes for halons in fire protection 
applications are discussed in the next section by class of chemical. 

a. 

Brominated hydrofluorocarbons. 


Brominated hydrofluorocarbons (HBFCs) are effective halon substitutes. Because 
these substances contain bromine, they act as chemical action agents in the same manner as 
the halons. In fact, some HBFCs are more effective than Halons 1211 and 1301 in specific 
applications. For this reason, HBFCs can replace Halons 1211 and 1301 on nearly a one-to-one basis and appear to have
significant applicability in existing systems. However, the 
presence of bromine also means that these agents have higher ozone-depleting potentials than 
other halon substitutes. 

At this time, only one HBFC, HBFC-22B1, is expected to be commercially available 
in the near term. HBFC-22B1 can, however, serve only as an interim substitute for halons. 
The substance has an ODP of 0.74 and has been listed as a class I substances. Under the 
Montreal Protocol and the Clean Air Act, production of HBFC-22B1 is required to end 
January 1, 1996. 

b. 

Hydrochlorofluorocarbons. 


A number of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) have also been suggested as halon 
replacements. These include HCFC-22, HCFC-123, and HCFC-124. These HCFCs will 
extinguish fires but because they are physical action agents, they are considerably less 
effective than halons or HBFCs. Thus, high concentrations must be achieved to extinguish 
fires. Further, although the ozone depletion potential of HCFCs is considerably lower than 
that of either halons or HBFCs, they are listed as class II chemicals under the Clean Air Act. 
The production of HCFC-141b will be phased out beginning January 1, 2003; HCFC-22 and 
HCFC-142b beginning January 1, 2020; and all other HCFCs beginning January 1, 2030 (58 
FR 65018, December 10, 1993). 

In addition, under section 610(d) of the CAA as amended, HCFCs in pressurized 
dispensers are banned from sale or distribution after January 1, 1994. Under the final 
rulemaking for section 610 (58 FR 69637, December 30, 1993) EPA interpreted section 
610(d) to exclude HCFCs which are part of an installed `system.' The final rule exempts 
total flooding systems and those streaming applications which incorporate fixed, automatic 
systems. However, section 610(d) only allows the sale of an HCFC in a portable fire 
extinguisher where other unregulated agents are not suitable for the intended applications. 
Because alternatives are available for residential uses, EPA intends to publish a proposed 
rulemaking under section 612 to update the SNAP list of acceptable substitutes and to ban the 
sale and use of HCFCs in portable fire extinguishers for residential applications. However, in 
commercial (including industrial and military) settings, the variety of hazards are too broad to 
create standards through rulemaking, and therefore under section 610(d) EPA has established 
industry-based mechanisms for controlling the sale of HCFCs. 

Generally, while HCFCs can serve only as interim halon substitutes due to their 
scheduled phaseout as class II substances, EPA believes that they serve an important 
transitional role in the phaseout of class I substances. HCFC-22 has been suggested as a total 
flooding agent, but this compound is unlikely to be used as a single agent in normally 
occupied areas due to its cardiotoxic profile.

HCFC-123 is being proposed as a streaming agent to replace Halon 1211, both in pure 
form and in blends. HCFC-123 could replace Halon 1211 at a ratio of 1.8 by weight_a ratio 
considerably better than that of most other streaming substitutes. HCFC-123 has the lowest 
ODP of all the HCFCs proposed as halon substitutes, and its global warming potential (GWP) 
is half that of other HCFC substitutes. 

HCFC-124 is being proposed as both a total flooding agent and a streaming agent, 
both alone and in blends. HCFC-124 has relatively low ODP and GWP values. Animal 
testing indicates that the substance may be lethal to rats at a level greater than 23 percent 
over a four hour period. Due to its cardiotoxic profile, this agent is not suitable for use in 
total flooding applications in normally occupied areas. However, pending personal 
monitoring tests to assess actual exposure, it is possible that this agent could be used as a 
streaming agent. 

c. 

Hydrofluorocarbons. 


Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) have also been suggested as halon substitutes. HFCs are 
physical action agents and are less effective than halons or HBFCs. Due to their reduced 
efficacy, larger storage volumes are required for use in fire protection systems. Their great 
advantage over halons, HBFCs, and HCFCs is that HFCs have an ozone depletion potential of 
zero. However, when exposed to fires, HFCs potentially decompose into greater amounts of 
hydrogen fluoride (HF) than do HCFCs, depending on the number of fluorines in the 
molecule. Discharge of these chemicals onto a fire must be rapid or early to prevent the 
buildup of large amounts of these decomposition products. 

In addition, HFCs can potentially contribute to global climate change. Because of this 
potential, HFCs are included in President Clinton's Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP). 
Under this plan, EPA is directed to limit uses of greenhouse gases as substitutes for ozone-depleting compounds.
Because EPA is simultaneously also interested in promoting the 
broader shift away from ozone-depleting compounds, any limits on use will be imposed 
wherever possible in ways that preserve as much flexibility for those trying to move to 
alternatives as possible. To minimize unnecessary emissions of greenhouse gases, EPA is 
recommending that users limit testing only to that which is essential to meet safety or 
performance requirements; recover HFCs from the fire protection system in conjunction with 
testing or servicing; and recycle recovered agent for later use or destruction. Manufacturers 
of these agents must recognize their responsibility to prevent unnecessary emissions of these 
gases. Product stewardship programs may be a useful mechanism to help users meet these 
requirements. EPA will reexamine how to control unnecessary emissions of greenhouse gases 
in the future. 

HFC-23, HFC-32, HFC-125, HFC-134a, and HFC-227ea have all been proposed as 
total flooding agents. HFC-134a and HFC-227ea have also been proposed as streaming 
agents. HFCs tend to possess less risk of acute cardiotoxicity than do the HCFCs or HBFC-22B1. 

HFC-32 has been determined to be flammable, with a large flammability range, and is 
therefore inappropriate as a halon substitute. In the next SNAP update, EPA intends to 
propose listing this agent as unacceptable in total flood applications. 

d. 

Perfluorocarbons. 


Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are fully fluorinated compounds which do not contribute to 
ozone depletion. In addition, PFCs are nonflammable, essentially non-toxic, and are not 
VOCs. PFCs are effective fire protection agents, having the lowest required extinguishing 
concentration of any of the suggested substitutes other than HBFCs. However, these 
compounds have high molecular weights, which create weight and storage replacement ratios 
that are somewhat higher than the HCFCs and many of the HFC candidates. Two PFCs have 
been submitted as halon replacements: Perfluorobutane (C

4

F

10

) as a total flood replacement for 
Halon 1301, and perfluorohexane (C

6

F

14

) as a substitute for Halon 1211. In the NPRM, these 
agents were referred to as FC 3-1-10 and FC 5-1-14, respectively. 
The principal environmental characteristic of concern for PFCs is that they have long 
atmospheric lifetimes and have the potential to contribute to global climate change. PFCs are 
also included in the CCAP which broadly instructs EPA to use section 612, as well as 
voluntary programs, to control emissions. 

While PFCs are extremely persistent, their favorable toxicity profile makes these 
agents attractive for use in occupied areas. Thus, EPA believes that there are instances in 
which PFCs represent the only viable alternative to transition away from the CFCs or halons. 

The Agency is finding use of PFCs acceptable only for applications where reasonable 
efforts have been made to determine that no other alternatives are technically feasible due to 
performance or safety requirements. However, as with all of the substitutes which are 
greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting substances, EPA recommends that users limit testing 
only to that which is essential to meet safety or performance requirements; recover agent from 
the fire protection system in conjunction with testing or servicing; and recycle or destroy 
agent that is recovered from a system. In addition, EPA encourages manufacturers to develop 
aggressive product stewardship programs to help users avoid such unnecessary emissions. 
EPA will reexamine how to control unnecessary emissions of greenhouse gases in the future. 

e. 

Chlorofluorocarbons. 


Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have also been proposed as halon alternatives, either 
individually or in blends. These compounds are also class I substances, however, and as a 
matter of policy EPA will not encourage shifting from one class I substance to another, 
despite the fact that the ODPs of the CFCs are significantly lower than those of Halons 1211 
and 1301. EPA does not believe it is appropriate to encourage shifting to substitutes that are 
required to be phased out in the near term. In addition, the sale and distribution of CFCs in 
pressurized dispensers (in this sector, portable fire extinguishers) are controlled under section 
610(b) of the CAA. 

f. 

Blends. 


A number of manufacturers have proposed proprietary blends of chemicals for fire 
protection applications. These blends combine a variety of CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs, PFCs, inert 
gases, and other additives to achieve desired levels of effectiveness, toxicity, and 
decomposition products. Most of these blends contain constituents that have non-zero ODPs 
and GWPs. In assessing the ODP and GWP of such blends, the Agency has examined both 
the weighted average of the constituents and the individual characteristics of the constituents. 
Because toxicity varies with the exact composition of the blend, EPA requires cardiotoxicity 
tests to be conducted on the blend itself, rather than being inferred from the constituents. 

g. 

Non-halocarbon alternative agents. 


Non-halocarbon alternative agents such as CO

2

, dry chemical, foams, and water that 
are currently in widespread use and that are covered in NFPA standards and OSHA 
regulations may also be used as substitutes for halon. These agents are not as widely 
applicable as the halocarbon substitutes, and must be used where recommended by the 
manufacturers and approved by standard-setting entities such as the NFPA. 

In addition, several manufacturers have developed new technologies to adapt 
traditional agents to the halon market. Two manufacturers have developed inert gas blends as 
Halon 1301 substitutes in total flood systems. One of them, containing CO

2

 mixed with inert 
gases has already been included in the new NFPA 2001 standard. 

Water sprinkler systems are capturing part of the halon substitute market, often in 
conjunction with improved detection systems and risk management programs which isolate 
the degree of liability in a given fire event. A promising new water technology incorporates 
fine water droplets to create a water mist or fog. It has been suggested that water mist 
systems are safe for use on Class A and B fires, and even can be used on Class C electrical 
fires without causing secondary damage. Because the environmental, health and safety issues 
of the various types of water mist systems have not yet been fully addressed, EPA is listing 
water mist as pending in this rule, and will work with NFPA, manufacturers, and others in 
order to include it in the next SNAP update.

Again, while dry chemicals are in widespread use, another new technology for both 
the total flooding and streaming markets involves the use of powdered aerosols, which 
combine fine powder particulates with gas to achieve a total flood effect. 
While foams are also in widespread use, one manufacturer has prepared a blend of 
etoxylated linear alcohol and sulfonated soap for use in streaming applications. This blend is 
not a clean agent, but offers another alternative technology where secondary damage can be 
tolerated. It presents benefits of rapid cool-down, prevention of reignition, and decrease in 
the quantity of water required to extinguish fires. 


3. Response to Comments 


Key issues included in the public comment are addressed in this section. For a 
complete discussion of public comments received, refer to the ``Response to Comments'' 
document in the public docket. The issues addressed in this section include: Alternative 
technologies, efficacy and design, use conditions, narrowed use restrictions, and halon 
categories and subdivisions. 
a. 

Alternative technologies. 


As halon is being phased out, there is a growing interest in not only clean chemical 
substitutes but also in reassessing the use of conventional substitutes, adopting new risk 
management strategies and using alternative technologies. Several commenters expressed the 
view that alternatives such as water and CO

2

 are not clean agent chemical substitutes, but 
rather conventional suppression system substitutes, and have been in widespread use for many 
years. Thus, these commenters stated that such alternatives are outside the scope of SNAP 
and that EPA should only list clean agent chemical substitutes. They indicated that it would 
be counterproductive to list all acceptable substitutes and alternatives under SNAP, which are 
better addressed by the entire fire protection community, and that doing so would restrict 
trade and development of new technology. One commenter said it was unclear what purpose 
would be served by attempting to list all substitutes and alternatives, including a variety of 
system technologies. 
Section 612 of the Clean Air Act specifies that class I and class II substances shall be 
replaced by ``chemicals, product substitutes, or alternative manufacturing processes that reduce 
overall risks to human health and the environment'' and directs EPA to assist in identifying 
such substitutes and alternatives, promote their development, maintain a public clearinghouse, 
and publish lists of acceptable and unacceptable substitutes for specific uses. EPA interprets 
this language as a broad mandate to include alternative technologies. For the fire suppression 
and explosion protection sector, EPA is defining alternative technology to be any non-halocarbon substance discharged
for the purpose of fire suppression or explosion protection. 
Thus, water mist, inert gas mixtures, powdered aerosols and any other `not in kind' 
alternative to CFCs and halons are alternative technologies. EPA believes that its assessment 
of potential human health and environmental impacts of these new technologies does, in fact, 
speed their acceptance and adoption by removing uncertainty about their safe use. In 
addition, while water sprinklers, carbon dioxide, foam, and dry chemical are currently in use, 
these substances fall within the definition of alternative technology. EPA will simply list 
these as acceptable and note their applicable NFPA standards. 
EPA will assess each class of alternative technology and determine whether a separate 
review is prudent due to variations in formulation and design of similar technologies, or 
whether it is possible to construct a broad listing of acceptability that covers several 
manufacturers. In this final rule, EPA is listing each water mist technology as well as inert 
gas blends and powdered aerosols separately due to the unique formulation, design and 
intended use of each. An acceptable or unacceptable listing of a particular alternative 
technology is not generalizable to similar technologies from other manufacturers. 
b. 

Efficacy and design issues. 


Many commenters state that in the NPRM, EPA has assumed that a single design 
concentration (obtained from a cup burner test for heptane) is applicable for all fire hazards 
and requested that EPA remove all reference to design concentration. However, several 
commenters noted that listing of the design concentration was useful in comparing the relative 
efficacy of substitute agents, as long as EPA is clear about the source of the data. 
In addition, many commenters feel that while EPA states that the SNAP rule ``is 
intended not to replace, but to complement the guidance of the fire protection community,'' 
EPA has ``dangerously oversimplified'' the many factors that must be taken into consideration 
in designing a system, and a listing of ``acceptability'' implies that any alternative will work in 
a safe and effective manner. One commenter specifically requested that EPA remove all 
references to design and installation requirements. 
Many commenters believe that EPA should not comment on the efficacy of substitutes, 
as this is outside the scope of the SNAP rule, and that EPA should only comment on 
environmental and toxicological concerns. The commenters believe EPA should only list the 
agent name, EPA's decision, NOAEL, and any specific environmental or regulatory concerns 
(such as ODP, GWP, or future phaseout date.) One commenter is concerned that EPA's 
involvement in efficacy issues will cause users to select agents that will result in less effective 
and more expensive protection than is needed, and will make American industry less 
competitive in world markets. 
One commenter summed up the requests of many others, suggesting that, at a 
minimum, EPA should include cautionary wording that a listing of `acceptable' does not 
imply the agent will work in any given application. Further, EPA should point out that the 
efficacy of an agent is dependent on the application system and should encourage users to 
consult current consensus fire codes and standards such as those developed by NFPA. 
By contrast, EPA believes that efficacy of a substitute agent must be a consideration in 
decision making, because EPA's charge is to ensure that substitutes are not on balance more 
risky than the ozone-depleting compounds being replaced. A substitute which is not effective 
cannot be considered safer than the halon being replaced. In addition, design concentration is 
germane to a discussion of potential exposure and its consequent effects on human health.

<TEXT>
 

In addition, while most agents submitted under SNAP are relatively effective, the 
analysis of efficacy assists in the assessment of the availability of substitutes in various niche 
markets. EPA intends to accept as many viable substitutes as possible. If, due to technical 
concerns such as weight or storage volume equivalency, there are few or no substitutes 
available in a given application, EPA must ensure that it does not restrict the few available 
choices based on other issues, such as environmental concerns. EPA's primary task in SNAP 
is to facilitate the move away from ozone-depleting compounds, and this goal cannot be 
served in the fire extinguishing sector without a full understanding of the characteristics of the 
available substitutes. 
However, the Agency agrees with the commenters that data sources should be clearly 
identified. EPA does not intend to imply that cup burner data for heptane dictates the proper 
design concentration for all applications and for all fire hazards, nor does EPA intend to 
imply that a listing of `acceptable' means that an agent may be used in any application 
without professional consultation. In this final rule, EPA reaffirms the need for all potential 
users to consult NFPA technical standards, OSHA regulations, and fire protection 
professionals for actual design considerations. 
c. 

Use conditions.

 In response to EPA's request for comment on whether section 612 authorizes the 
agency to set use conditions, several commenters argued that setting use conditions is not 
within the purview of section 612. Some commenters stated that EPA has exceeded its scope 
of authority under the Clean Air Act, and that EPA should defer regulation of workplace 
safety to OSHA, which is the appropriate entity. Other commenters stated that EPA failed to 
consult with OSHA and thus overstepped its authority by setting workplace conditions. 
Other commenters feel it is proper for EPA to establish exposure limits on new agents 
as it will ensure public safety until OSHA regulations are complete, especially where there is 
little historical exposure information to rely on. 
EPA believes that section 612 clearly authorizes imposition of use conditions to ensure 
safe use of replacement agents. EPA's mandate is to list agents that ``reduce the overall risk 
to human health and the environment'' for ``specific uses.'' Where use of a substitute without 
conditions would increase overall risk, EPA is authorized to find the use of such substitutes 
totally unacceptable. Included in this is the authority to find acceptable the use of the 
substitute only if used in a manner that reduces overall risk, and to find unacceptable its use 
in all other cases. 
Further, EPA's use conditions on workplace safety for halon substitutes will exist only 
in the interim, until OSHA incorporates specific language addressing gaseous agents in the 
OSHA law. Under OSHA Public Law 91-596, section 4(b)(1), OSHA is precluded from 
regulating an area currently being regulated by other federal agencies. EPA is specifically 
deferring to OSHA, and has no intention to assume responsibility for regulating workplace 
safety in regard to fire protection. Consequently, EPA's use conditions are effective only 
until OSHA acts and will terminate by their own terms once OSHA establishes standards. 
OSHA  1910.162 governs the use of all gaseous agents in fixed extinguishing 
systems, however EPA finds that the guidance is not sufficiently explicit on the allowable 
concentrations of the different agents. While paragraph 1910.162(b)(3) stipulates that ``[t]he 
employer shall assure that employees are not exposed to toxic levels of gaseous agent or its 
decomposition products,'' it does not define what a `toxic level' is. In examining paragraph 
1910.162 (b)(6)(i) through (b)(6)(iii), EPA concludes that it is OSHA's intent to limit exposure 
to gaseous agents based upon cardiotoxicity levels. EPA's conclusion was confirmed in 
discussions with OSHA. EPA therefore concludes that it is appropriate under the SNAP 
program to stipulate what the cardiotoxic levels for each agent are, and, until OSHA 
incorporates clarifying language, to impose use conditions that apply OSHA standard 
1910.162 in its entirety to these agents. 
References in  1910.162 to a Halon 1301 concentration of 7% imply a cardiotoxic 
NOAEL, and references to a Halon 1301 concentration of 10% imply a cardiotoxic LOAEL. 
In this regulation, EPA is clarifying the intent of  1910.162(b)(3) to allow the use of the 
substitute gaseous agents only according to paragraph (b)(6)(i) through (b)(6)(iii), using the 
cardiotoxic NOAEL and LOAEL of each agent as the concentration referenced in each 
subparagraph. Thus, until OSHA establishes applicable work-place requirements, the use 
conditions in this final rule on halocarbon substitutes, using the OSHA regulation as a 
standard, will be as follows: 
 Where egress from an area cannot be accomplished within one minute, the 
employer shall not use this agent in concentrations exceeding its NOAEL. 
 Where egress takes longer than 30 seconds but less than one minute, the 
employer shall not use the agent in a concentration greater than its LOAEL. 
 Agent concentrations greater than the LOAEL are only permitted in areas not 
normally occupied by employees provided that any employee in the area can escape within 30 
seconds. The employer shall assure that no unprotected employees enter the area during 
agent discharge. 
These conditions will no longer apply once OSHA establishes applicable workplace 
requirements. 
EPA will adopt the commenters' suggestion that the use conditions be stated once in 
the beginning of each section and will not repeat them for each agent. 
d. 

Narrowed use restrictions.

 
Many commenters requested that EPA remove the narrowed use restrictions placed 
upon HFC-23, C

4

F

10

, and C

6

F

14

. These commenters argue that narrowed use restrictions are 
unnecessary, because the fire protection community (including entities such as NFPA, UL, 
FMRC and others) has successfully regulated fire protection historically and remains better 
able to determine which agents should be selected based on design and use criteria, including 
environmental and toxicological acceptability, efficacy, cost, engineering practice and specific 
risk. 
It is not the intent of EPA to interfere with the ability of the fire protection community 
to use its expertise in selecting agents and designing appropriate and cost-effective systems 
based upon technical criteria. EPA congratulates the industry on its excellent record of self-regulation, and seeks
to work cooperatively with the regulated community in our efforts to 
address the phaseout of halon. However, use of fire protection agents is, in fact, already 
regulated under federal law, i.e. OSHA, to ensure their safe use. 
Under the Clean Air Act, EPA is mandated to evaluate substitutes to reduce ``overall 
risk to human health and the environment'' and to publish lists of acceptable and unacceptable 
substitutes ``for specific uses.'' EPA interprets section 612 as giving the Agency authority to 
limit use where there are concerns due to health or environmental factors. Because a primary 
goal of the SNAP program as a whole is to speed the market's transition away from ozone-depleting substances, conditional
acceptances were accorded to many substitutes which might 
be unacceptable in the absence of any use conditions. EPA believes that, through the setting 
of narrowed use restrictions in the limited cases where they are warranted, it has actually 
expanded the list of available options for fire protection experts to choose from.

Many commenters stated that the narrowed use restrictions as written in the NPRM by EPA are vague and confusing, and
overly complex, leading to uncertainty. Commenters asked that EPA clarify such vague terms as ``high value,'' ``public
safety,'' ``national security,'' ``life support,'' and ``critical.'' They state that ambiguity will cause many
users to be reluctant to use the new substitute agents. Concern was expressed that the fire protection community will
have to spend an inordinate amount of time interpreting and deciphering whether a particular system meets EPA's requirements.
Some commenters advised that, if EPA retains narrowed use restrictions, these restrictions should be better defined
through work with the fire protection industry. One commenter suggested that a more easily enforced method would
be to allow use only in applications where toxicity of other substitutes would not be acceptable. Furthermore, some
commenters noted that EPA's publicly expressed concern about the environmental acceptability, particularly the
global warming impacts, of certain agents has already slowed interest in the development of systems. They state that
as a result, there is continued dependence on halon for certain critical applications where no other alternative
agent is suitable, such as in explosion inerting applications. 

EPA agrees with the commenters that narrowed use restrictions must not contribute to uncertainty and a consequent
reluctance to move away from ozone-depleting fire fighting agents. To address this concern, EPA has worked with agent
manufacturers, system designers, and members of the regulated community to better clarify the intent and the wording
of narrowed use restrictions. In this final rule, EPA is amending the means of controlling unwanted emissions of long-lived
agents. In the NPRM, EPA attempted to narrow the scope of uses for the PFCs (C

4

F

10

 and C

6

F

14

) and for HFC-23 by listing the use categories that were acceptable. Because the regulated community found this
listing ambiguous, and because EPA could not list all possible uses that would require this agent, EPA explored the
technical criteria that would define where this agent was best applied, as one commenter suggested. This approach
was appealing, but, again, tended to place the task of system design upon the Agency. Therefore, for the PFCs, the Agency
has decided to adopt an approach that places the burden of proof upon the end-user for determining that no other alternative
was technically feasible for that application. 

Users shall self-certify the need to use restricted agents. Before users adopt C

4

F

10

 or C

6

F

14

, both restricted agents, they must make reasonable efforts to ascertain that ``other substitutes or alternatives
are not technically feasible due to performance or safety requirements.'' Users are expected to evaluate the technical
feasibility of other substitutes or alternatives to determine their adequacy to control the particular fire or explosion
risk. An example of where no other alternative is available due to the physical or chemical properties of the agent
would be where, due to the environmental characteristics of the end-use, other agents would fail to vaporize or would
not achieve the dispersion required for effective fire protection. Similarly, use of PFCs due to toxicological concerns
would be appropriate where use of other alternative agents would violate the workplace safety use conditions set
forth in this final rule. For example, use of a certain agent for explosion suppression in an occupied area might require
high concentrations of an agent that exceed its LOAEL, or, in cases where egress is precluded such as in military vehicles
during wartime, the required concentration of the alternatives might exceed their NOAEL. EPA intends that PFCs be
used only as the agent of last resort. 

To assist users in their evaluation, EPA has prepared a list of vendors manufacturing halon substitutes and alternatives.
Although users are not required to report the results of their investigation to EPA, companies must retain these results
in company files for future reference. 

Several commenters requested that narrowed use restrictions on HFC-23 be lifted because its cardiotoxicity
profile is favorable compared to its design or inerting concentration and in some cases it may be the only acceptable
alternative. As mentioned above, one commenter suggested that it would be more appropriate to qualify acceptability
of a particular agent with respect to its technical applicability in defined situations. For example, this commenter
identified several areas where HFC-23 is particularly applicable: (a) Where temperatures are likely to go
below 0
  (b) where pre-inerting is required for occupied areas, and (c) where occupied areas can suffer considerable
variation in fire volume. 

Most HFC-23 is a by-product of the manufacture of HCFC-22. While HCFC-22 is scheduled for a production
phaseout under the Clean Air Act by the year 2020, HCFC-22 is also used as a feedstock for the manufacture of other
products, such as Teflon. Thus, it can be expected that HFC-23 will likely be inadvertently produced in the future.
As discussed above, Action 40 of the CCAP instructs EPA to limit emissions of greenhouse gases under the SNAP program.
However, because this agent is typically a byproduct of HCFC-22 production, it is EPA's position that capture
of HFC-23 and use as a fire suppression agent may delay the effects of this agent in the atmosphere while serving
a valuable purpose. Thus, EPA is lifting the narrowed use restrictions imposed in the NPRM, and in this FRM EPA is finding
acceptable the use of this agent wherever deemed applicable given technical or market considerations. However,
to control unnecessary emissions of this agent, EPA recommends that users limit testing only to that which is essential
to meet safety or performance requirements; recover HFC-23 from the fire protection system in conjunction
with testing or servicing; and recycle or destroy agent that is recovered from a system. EPA is encouraging development
of product stewardship programs by the manufacturer and by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) marketing systems
containing this agent. 

e. 

Halon categories and subdivisions.

 Many commenters requested that EPA remove the subdivisions within the use categories. In other words, agents should
be classified as either ``total flooding'' or ``streaming'' with no further distinction as to their use. This structure,
states one commenter, is consistent with the separation addressed by UNEP and NFPA. They state that the proposed subdivisions
over-complicate the rule. 

For example, in total flood applications, some commenters suggest simply referring to an agent's NOAEL which, along
with OSHA regulations and NFPA standards, will determine its suitability for a given application. Thus, there would
be no need to distinguish between normally occupied and normally unoccupied spaces. 

EPA is adopting the recommendation of the commenters. Two end-use categories are used in this final rule: Streaming
Agents and Total Flooding Agents. Explosion inertion is included in the Total Flooding Agent category. 



4. Listing Decisions

<TEXT>
 

In order to evaluate the acceptability of proposed halon substitutes, the Agency divided the fire protection sector
into two end-uses: (1) Streaming Agents, and (2) Total Flooding Agents. The `Total Flooding' category includes all
total flooding applications, including normally occupied, normally unoccupied, and explosion inertion and suppression
applications. 

For some substitutes, data required by the Agency to complete a risk assessment is not yet available or has not been
submitted to the Agency as requested. As a result, not all candidate substitutes have been fully evaluated by the Agency.
Those substitutes which the Agency is currently reviewing, but for which a final determination cannot yet be made,
are listed as pending review in the table in Appendix B. The evaluation of these pending submissions will continue,
and the results of these continuing evaluations will be published in the 

Federal Register

 as part of EPA's quarterly updates to the SNAP lists. 

The listing decisions are compiled by type. Thus, for each end-use, an agent may be listed in one or more type of decision,
including `acceptable,' `acceptable subject to use conditions,' `acceptable subject to narrowed use limits,'
`unacceptable,' or `pending completion of review.' 

The table in appendix B summarizes EPA's decisions by each type of decision for each end-use. 

EPA's finding of acceptability of a halon substitute should be viewed only as a listing based on the criteria briefly
set out in this Preamble as governing the SNAP program and described in detail in the background document entitled
``Characterization of Risk From the Use of Substitutes for Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances: Fire Extinguishing
and Explosion Protection (Halon Substitutes)''. EPA's finding of acceptability should not be considered an endorsement
of the substitute for the suppression or prevention of any given fire or explosion scenario, for which the user is referred
to a fire protection specialist. 

a. 

Acceptable.

 (1) Streaming agents. (a) HCFC-123. HCFC-123 is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute. Because of its
relatively low weight equivalency, HCFC-123 could replace Halon 1211 at ratio of 1.8 by weight. However, testing
has indicated that application of this agent may require special handling or nozzles to successfully extinguish
a fire. Its extinguishment concentration based on cup burner tests is 6.3 percent. 

With an ODP of 0.02, HCFC-123 has the lowest ODP of all the HCFCs proposed as halon substitutes, and its 100-year
GWP of 90 is lower than that of other proposed HCFC substitutes. In addition, it has a short atmospheric lifetime of
2 years. Since HCFC-123 has a cardiotoxic level (LOAEL) of 2.0 percent in the dog, with no effect (NOAEL) apparent
at 1.0 percent, potential users have expressed concern about using HCFC-123 or blends containing HCFC-123
as the primary constituent. However, actual exposures were assessed using personal monitoring devices, and the
Agency concludes that likely exposure levels from its use as a streaming agent do not exceed safe levels when used with
good ventilation. Similar exposure concerns exist with the use of carbon dioxide or Halon 1211 streaming agents.
All must be used only in areas with adequate ventilation. The manufacturer of portable extinguishers using these
agents should include cautionary language on the label indicating the need for ventilation. 

The manufacturer has raised its allowable exposure limit (AEL) for HCFC-123 to 30 parts per million (ppm). The
AEL is set at a level believed to protect workers who are regularly exposed from adverse chronic effects. As a practical
matter, exposures should not exceed this limit for any working day; this practice is consistent with OSHA's enforcement
of its own PELs. If it is likely that exposures may exceed 30 ppm as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA), proper protective
gear should be worn. For the purposes of determining the proper respiratory protection, the user should consult the
manufacturer of the product for their specific recommendations for respirator use of the particular end use. 

As discussed in the section on HCFCs generally, this agent is subject to regulations under section 610(d) of the CAA.
EPA intends to publish a proposed rulemaking that will ban the use of this agent in residential applications. 

(b) (HCFC blend) B. (HCFC blend) B is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute. This blend consists largely of HCFC-123,
therefore, as with HCFC-123, it has been shown in tests to have a weight equivalency ratio to Halon 1211 of 1.8.
While HCFC-123 has a cardiotoxic level of 2.0 percent in the dog, with no effect apparent at 1.0 percent, actual
exposures from use of this blend as a streaming agent were assessed using personal monitoring devices. The Agency
concludes that likely exposure levels do not exceed safe levels. 

The manufacturer of HCFC-123 has raised its allowable exposure limit (AEL) to 30 parts per million (ppm). The
AEL is set at a level believed to protect workers who are exposed on a regular basis from chronic adverse effects. As
a practical matter, exposures should not exceed this limit for any working day; this practice is consistent with OSHA's
enforcement of its own PELs.

If it is likely that exposures may exceed 30 ppm as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA), proper protective gear should
be worn. To determine proper respiratory protection, the user should consult the manufacturer of the product for
any specific recommendations governing respirator use in the particular end-use. 

HCFC-123, which is the major component of this blend has an ODP of 0.02, which is the lowest ODP of all the HCFCs
proposed as halon substitutes, and its 100-year GWP of 90 is lower than that of other proposed HCFC substitutes. Although
this agent contains a very small percentage of PFC, which has a long atmospheric lifetime and which could potentially
contribute to global climate change, EPA believes that the quantities of PFC likely to be emitted are small, and that
availability of this blend is an important aid in the transition away from ozone-depleting substances. As with any
chemical replacement to halon, EPA recommends that unnecessary emissions be controlled by minimizing training
and by the use of recycling during maintenance. 

As discussed in the section on HCFCs generally, this agent is regulated under section 610(d). Consistent with the
intent of section 610(d), EPA intends to publish a proposed rulemaking that will ban the use of this agent in residential
applications. 

(c) (Surfactant blend) A. (Surfactant blend) A is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute. This product is a mixture
of organic surfactants and water. In use, this concentrated mixture is diluted to strengths of 1-10 percent
with available water. The surfactants appear to enhance the heat absorbing capacity of the water. 

(Surfactant Blend) A acts on oil, gasoline, and petroleum based liquid fires (Class B fires) by encapsulating the
fuel, thus removing the fuel source from the fire. This encapsulating feature prevents flame propagation and reduces
the possibility of reignition. 

This blend was designed for use on Class B oil and gasoline fires, but can be used on all Class A and Class B fires, as well
as Class D fires. The agent has passed Underwriters' Laboratories (UL) certification for Class A, B, and D fires, and
UL testing for Class C fires is underway. 

This extinguishant is a blend of complex alcohols, lipids, and proteins, which are diluted in large volumes of water
to the final commercial preparation. Each of the substances is biodegradable and in its shipping state the product
has been assigned a hazardous materials identification system (HMIS) rating of 0-0-0 for health hazard,
reactivity, and flammability, respectively. The HMIS rating was developed by the National Paint and Coatings Association
(NPCA) to indicate the hazard potential of chemical substances, with zero representing the lowest hazard potential.


Initial data provided by the manufacturer indicate some ocular irritation in rabbits, and thus EPA is recommending
that the manufacturer label the product with a caution about possible eye irritation. 













(d) Carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute. Carbon dioxide can be used as a direct
substitute for Halon 1211 in specified applications. Carbon dioxide systems are not rated for Class A fires and so
must be used in conjunction with another type of extinguisher to ensure that all possible fires can be extinguished.
In addition, discharge of carbon dioxide into confined spaces may result in CO

2

 concentrations above the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) level. Areas into which carbon dioxide
is discharged should be immediately evacuated and ventilated. Carbon dioxide extinguishers should be used only
in accordance with manufacturer's guidelines and applicable NFPA standards. 













(e) Dry chemical. Dry chemical extinguishers are acceptable as Halon 1211 substitutes. Dry chemical extinguishers
can be used as a substitute for Halon 1211 in most residential applications. While dry chemical extinguishers can
be used on Class A, B, or C fires depending upon the type of powder used, they do not always penetrate well around obstacles,
they do not inhibit re-ignition of fires, they do not cool surfaces, they can cause secondary damage, and discharge
in confined spaces can result in temporary loss of visibility. Dry chemical extinguishers should be used only in accordance
with manufacturer's guidelines and with relevant NFPA standards. 

(f) Water. Water is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute. Users should be aware, however, that water extinguishers
cannot act as a substitute for Halon 1211 in all applications. Water is primarily a Class A fire extinguishant. It can
be used on de-energized Class C fires, but should not be used with Class B fires. Water may damage objects onto which
it is discharged. Water extinguishers should be used only in accordance with manufacturer's guidelines and with
applicable NFPA standards.

(g) Foam. Foam is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute. Foam extinguishers cannot be used as a substitute for halon
in all applications. Portable foam extinguishers are intended primarily for use on flammable liquid fires and are
somewhat effective on Class A fires. Foam can also cause secondary damage on objects onto which it is discharged. Foam
extinguishers should be used in accordance with manufacturer's guidelines and with NFPA standards. 





(2) Total flooding agents. (a) Carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. Exposure
to carbon dioxide poses an imminent threat to life. However, because it displaces oxygen, it is an effective fire protection
agent. As a result, both OSHA and the NFPA address CO

2

 systems for occupied areas. OSHA 1910.162(b)5 requires a pre-discharge alarm for systems with a design concentration
of 4 percent or greater. NFPA has written a standard (NFPA 12) that explicitly controls how such CO

2

 systems may be safely used in occupied areas. To protect life, the standard requires a system design such that no personnel
may be present upon system discharge. The EPA recognizes both the OSHA regulation and the NFPA standard as industry
practice and therefore defer to them in this rule. CO

2

 systems require a storage volume of three times that of Halon 1301. 

In the review of proposed substitutes, the Agency looks at a variety of health and environmental factors, including
whether the agent contributes to global climate change. While carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, it is also a byproduct
of many industrial processes and is recaptured and reformulated as a fire fighting agent and thus does not require
new production. Therefore, the Agency has determined that its contribution to overall greenhouse gas emissions
is low. 

(b) Water. Water sprinkler systems are acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. Such systems are in widespread use and
are governed by NFPA technical standards. EPA encourages adoption of water systems wherever feasible. Care should
be taken when using water on Class C electrical fires, and it may not be suitable in instances in which secondary damage
is considered unacceptable. 

(c) (Inert Gas Blend) B is acceptable for use in unoccupied areas. The decision for use of this agent in occupied areas
is pending until the agency completes its review of low oxygen atmospheres, and will be included in a future rulemaking.
Use conditions to limit the risk of inadvertent exposure to personnel in normally unoccupied areas may be included
in future rulemakings. 

(d) (Powdered Aerosol) A is acceptable for use in unoccupied areas. The decision for use of this agent in occupied areas
is pending until the agency completes its review of the potential health effects of this agent. In addition, use conditions
to limit the risk of inadvertent exposure to personnel in normally unoccupied areas may be included in future rulemakings.


(e) (Powdered Aerosol) B is acceptable for use in unoccupied areas. This SNAP submission included many different
formulations. While the formulations pose little risk in a normally unoccupied area, the decision for use of the various
formulations in occupied areas is pending further review of their potential health effects. In addition, use conditions
to limit the risk of inadvertent exposure to personnel in normally unoccupied areas may be included in future rulemakings.


b. 

Acceptable subject to use conditions. 

(1) Total flooding agents. In analyzing the acceptability of substitutes for total flooding applications in occupied
spaces, the Agency considered cardiotoxicity one of the primary decision variables. Current OSHA limitations on
use of Halon 1301 in total flooding applications assure that these uses do not pose a cardiotoxic risk to personnel
at the design concentration. 

OSHA promulgated a safety and health standard (29 CFR 1910 subpart L) governing fire protection systems used at all
workplaces which is designed to limit employee exposures to toxic levels of gaseous agents used in fixed total flood
systems. OSHA section 1910.162 governs the use of all gaseous agents in fixed extinguishing systems, however the
guidance is not explicit on the allowable concentrations of the different agents. While paragraph 1910.162(b)3
stipulates that ``[t]he employer shall assure that employees are not exposed to toxic levels of gaseous agent or its
decomposition products,'' it does not define what a ``toxic level'' is. In examining paragraph 1910.162(b)(6)(i)
through (b)(6)(iii), EPA concludes that it is OSHA's intent to limit exposure to gaseous agents based upon cardiotoxicity
levels. EPA's conclusion was confirmed in discussions with OSHA. EPA's assessment is that the use of NOAEL/LOAEL
values based on exposure scenarios is the proper method to ensure safe use of gaseous agents, and agrees with OSHA's
approach. It is therefore EPA's intention to stipulate the cardiotoxic levels for each agent and, until OSHA incorporates
clarifying language for the new agents, to impose use conditions that apply 1910.162 in its entirety to these agents.


References in  1910.162 to a Halon 1301 concentration of 7 percent imply a cardiotoxic NOAEL, and references
to a Halon 1301 concentration of 10 percent imply a cardiotoxic LOAEL. In this regulation, EPA is clarifying the intent
of  1910.162(b)(3) to allow the use of the substitute gaseous agents only according to paragraph (b)(6)(i)
through (b)(6)(iii), using the cardiotoxic NOAEL and LOAEL of each agent as the concentration referenced in each
subparagraph.

In addition, existing OSHA standard 1910.160 applies certain general controls to the use of fixed extinguishing
systems in occupied workplaces, whether gaseous, dry chemical, water sprinklers, etc., and EPA has not reproduced
those. These include, for example, the requirements for discharge and pre-discharge alarms, and availability of
Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) for emergency entry into an area where agent has been 
discharged.






In many occupied areas, total flooding halons can be replaced by improved detection equipment and manually operated
extinguishing systems. Improved detection systems, if they detect fires in their early stages, can alert occupants
to the existence of a fire so they may respond appropriately without discharge of the total flood system. In those cases
in which a total flooding system is deemed necessary, improved detection systems can also reduce false 
alarms that result in the unnecessary discharge of total flooding systems. 

In unoccupied areas, human exposure to potentially toxic substitutes or decomposition products are of less concern.
The key criterion in the SNAP decision process therefore becomes environmental considerations. At the same time,
the Agency must ensure that personnel are not exposed to toxic concentrations of fire protection agents or their decomposition
products when the substances are vented or leak out from the extinguishment area. Precautions must also be taken to
prevent exposures to personnel entering a normally unoccupied area after a discharge. In addition, if there is a possibility
that someone must enter a room while an agent is likely to exceed the NOAEL level, SCBA must be worn. 

Design concentrations for explosion inertion must be higher than for fire suppression. In addition, design concentrations
vary depending on the combustible material being considered. Thus, the system designer must be careful to ensure
that system design precludes unacceptable cardiotoxic or oxygen depletion levels. 

Explosion inertion agents are currently regulated by OSHA through the general duty clause
, but use conditions are not explicitly stated as they are for fire suppression systems. However, since design concentrations
for systems protecting against explosion of various gases or flammable liquids may expose personnel to cardiotoxic
levels of inertion agents, it is industry practice to adopt standards provided under OSHA 1910.162. EPA is not intending
to impose new regulations in this area, but defers to current OSHA practice in this regard, with the stipulation that
the NOAEL and LOAEL values identified in this Final Rulemaking are the reference values for exposure limits. 





Until OSHA establishes applicable workplace requirements, total flooding agents are acceptable by the Agency for
use in occupied areas only under the following conditions: 

1. Where egress from an area cannot be accomplished within one minute, the 
employer shall not use the agent in concentrations exceeding its NOAEL. 

2. Where egress takes greater than 30 seconds but less than one minute, the employer shall not use the agent in a concentration
greater than its LOAEL. 

3. Agent concentrations greater than the LOAEL are only permitted in areas not normally occupied by employees provided
that any employee in the area can escape within 30 seconds. The employer shall assure that no unprotected employees
enter the area during agent discharge. These conditions will no longer apply once OSHA establishes applicable workplace
requirements. 

(a) HBFC-22B1. HBFC-22B1 is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. This agent is subject to the use conditions
delineated in the discussion of total flooding agents in this section. HBFC-22B1 can replace Halon 1301 at a
ratio of 1.4 by weight and 1.3 by storage volume, making it technically suitable for use in existing total flood systems.
Its required extinguishing concentration, based on the cup burner test in heptane, is estimated at 4.4 percent, and
its 
design concentration is 5.3 percent. Its explosion inertion concentration is 8.0 percent. The LOAEL for cardiotoxicity
is 1 percent while its NOAEL is 0.3 percent. Its atmospheric lifetime is 7 to 15 years, but its GWP is uncalculated. This
compound is unlikely to be feasible as a total flooding agent in occupied areas because its design concentration exceeds

its cardiotoxic effect level. 

While HBFC-22B1 has an ODP of 0.74 and will be phased out on January 1, 1996, the Agency believes that the substance
can serve a useful role in helping users transition away from Halon 1301, which has a much higher ODP, estimated at 10.


This agent was submitted to the Agency as a Premanufacture Notice (PMN) and is presently subject to requirements contained
in a Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA) section 5(e) Consent Order and associated Significant New Use Rule (40 CFR
721.1296).

(b) HCFC-22. HCFC-22 is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. This agent is subject to the use conditions
delineated in the discussion of total flooding agents in this section. HCFC-22 has an extinguishment concentration,
as determined by cup burner in heptane, of 11.6 percent and a design concentration of 13.9 percent, the highest of the
candidate HCFCs. Its 
estimated explosion inertion concentration is 18.8 percent. Its weight and volume equivalence are 2.4 percent and
3.0 percent, respectively. The cardiotoxic NOAEL is 2.5 percent and its LOAEL is 5.0 percent. This compound is unlikely
to be feasible as a pure agent in occupied areas because its design concentration exceeds its cardiotoxic effect level.


The ODP for HCFC-22 is 0.05, the 100 year-GWP is 1600, and the atmospheric 
lifetime is 16 years. Its ODP and GWP are both higher than those for other candidate HCFCs. This agent is schedule for
production phaseout under the CAA for new equipment in the year 2010 and for existing equipment in the year 2020 (58
FR 65018). 

(c) HCFC-124. HCFC-124 is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. This agent is subject to the use conditions
delineated in the discussion of total flooding agents in this section. HCFC-124 has relatively low ODP of .022,
and, compared to other candidate 1301 substitutes for which GWP has been estimated, has a relatively low 100-year
GWP value of 440 with an atmospheric lifetime of 7 years. Animal testing indicates that the substance may be lethal
to rats at a level greater than 23 percent over a four hour period. The substance has a 
cardiotoxic LOAEL of 2.5 percent and a NOAEL apparent at 1.0 percent. Its weight and volume equivalence is 2.6 and 2.9
respectively. The extinguishing concentration based on cup burner tests in heptane of HCFC-124 is 7.0 percent
and its design concentration is 8.4 percent, while its explosion inertion concentration is 12.0 percent. This compound
is unlikely to be feasible as a total flooding agent in normally occupied areas because its design 
concentration exceeds its cardiotoxic level. 

(d) (HCFC BLEND) A. (HCFC BLEND) A is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. This agent is subject to the use conditions
delineated in the discussion of total flooding agents in this section. Based on full-scale testing, the extinguishing
concentration of this blend has been determined to be approximately 7.2 percent and therefore the design concentration
is approximately 8.6 percent. The cardiotoxic NOAEL of this blend is 10.0 percent, and the LOAEL is at least 10.0 percent.
Until further data is supplied, the Agency considers its LOAEL to be 10 percent. The major component of this blend has
an ODP of 0.05, higher than other proposed HCFC substitutes, but the blend appears somewhat more effective from a weight
and storage volume 
equivalency basis, which is 1.6 and 2.3 respectively. This compound is a feasible candidate for use in a normally occupied
area. 

This agent is a blend of different HCFCs. The predominant component of this blend is HCFC-22, which has an ODP
of 0.05, an atmospheric lifetime of 16 years, and a GWP of 1600. HCFC-22 is scheduled for production phaseout
under the CAA by the year 2020 and all other HCFCs by the year 2030 (58 FR 65018). 

(e) HFC-23. HFC-23 is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. This agent is subject to the use conditions
delineated in the discussion of total flooding agents in this section. 

HFC-23 is attractive for use as a total flooding agent in occupied areas because the cardiotoxic NOAEL is at least
30 percent without added oxygen and over 50 percent with added oxygen, compared to a design concentration of 14.4 percent,
based on cup burner tests in heptane. EPA recognizes that no cardiotoxic effect was measured in the tests of HFC-23,
and acknowledges that tests were terminated when oxygen levels decreased to a point posing risk of asphyxiation.
However, EPA must examine this agent in the light of potential 
cardiotoxicity because this is a halocarbon which does possess cardiotoxic characteristics. It is an artifact of
the test protocol that determines that the NOAEL and LOAEL must be interpreted from the data, and not interpolated.
To observe a cardiotoxic effect would require quantities in such high concentration as to pose a risk of asphyxiation
before risk of cardiotoxicity. Because testing was stopped at 30 percent without added oxygen and 50 per 
cent with added oxygen, EPA must use these values as the maximum allowable 
concentrations. In the NPRM, EPA did not refer to a specific LOAEL for this agent. However, the standard OSHA-derived
language was included for all agents. In this rulemaking, EPA is using the values of 30 percent for the NOAEL and 50%
for the LOAEL. 

Compared to an inerting concentration in methane of 20.5 percent and an inerting design concentration of 22.6 percent
in methane, this agent is an excellent candidate for use in explosion inertion. 

As mentioned earlier, the risk of using agents in high concentrations poses a risk of asphyxiation by displacing oxygen.
With an ambient oxygen level of 21 percent, a design concentration of 22.6 percent will reduce oxygen levels to approximately
16 percent, the minimum oxygen level considered to be required to prevent impaired judgement or other physiological
effects. The weight equivalent of HFC-23 is 1.6 while its storage volume 
equivalent is 2.6. This agent requires a high pressure system for proper discharge and dispersion.

Because this agent has an atmospheric lifetime of about 280 years and a 100-year GWP of 9,000, it is considered a potent
greenhouse gas and should be handled accordingly. Since HFC-23 is typically a by-product of manufacturing
and is not expressly produced for use as a fire fighting agent, EPA is allowing the use of this agent wherever applicable
given technical or market considerations. However, in order to minimize unnecessary emissions of greenhouse gases,
EPA recommends that users limit testing only to that which is essential to meet safety or performance requirements;
recover HFC 23 from the fire protection system in conjunction with testing or servicing; and destroy or recycle HFC-23
for later use. In addition, EPA encourages manufacturers to develop aggressive product stewardship programs to
help users avoid such unnecessary emissions. 
(f) HFC-125. HFC-125 is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. This agent is subject to the use conditions
delineated in the discussion of total flooding agents in this section. The cardiotoxic NOAEL for HFC-125 is
7.5 percent, and its LOAEL is 10.0 percent compared to a cup burner extinguishment concentration in heptane of 9.4
percent. While this agent would not be appropriate for use in normally occupied areas, it is not expected that human

health would be threatened by use of HFC-125 in normally unoccupied areas. This agent has a weight and volume
equivalence of 2.6 and 3.2, respectively. 
HFC-125 does not deplete stratospheric ozone. Despite its zero ODP, HFC-125 has an atmospheric lifetime
of 41 years, and the highest calculated GWP (100-year GWP of 3,400) than any other HFC (except HFC-23) or HCFC
currently planned for production as a halon or CFC substitute. 
(g) HFC-134a. HFC-134a is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. This agent is subject to the use conditions
delineated in the discussion of total flooding agents in this section. HFC-134a has a cardiotoxic NOAEL of 4.0
percent, a LOAEL of 8 percent, and a design concentration of 12.6 percent. This compound is unlikely to be feasible
as a total flooding agent in occupied areas because its design concentration exceeds its cardiotoxic level. Like
the other HFCs, HFC-134a has an ODP of zero. It also has among the lowest GWP of the candidate 1301 replacements
for which GWP has been estimated, with a 100-year GWP of 1,200 and an atmospheric lifetime of 16. 
Cup burner tests in heptane indicate that this substance is less effective than 1301. Systems that use HFC-134a
will require approximately 2.5 times more extinguishant by weight and 3.1 times more storage volume than 1301 systems.

(h) HFC-227ea. HFC-227ea is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. This agent is subject to the use conditions
delineated in the discussion of total flooding agents in this section. The final report on cardiotoxicity of HFC-227ea
indicates that its NOAEL is 9.0 percent and that its LOAEL is at least 10.5 percent. EPA is accepting 10.5 percent as
its LOAEL. Cup burner 
tests with heptane indicate that the extinguishment concentration for this agent is 5.8 percent, thus making its
calculated design concentration 7.0 percent. These concentrations provide a sufficient margin of safety for use
in a normally occupied area. HFC-227ea does not deplete stratospheric ozone. In addition, HFC-227ea
is the most effective of the proposed HFC substitutes for Halon 1301. HFC-227ea can replace Halon 1301 at a ratio
of 1.7 by weight and 1.4 by volume. 
HFC-227ea has a 100-year GWP of about 2,050, with an atmospheric lifetime of 31 years.

F

10

 is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute where other alternatives are not technically feasible due to performance
or safety requirements: (a) due to their physical or chemical properties or (b) where human exposure to the agents
may approach cardiosensitization levels or result in other unacceptable health effects under normal operating
conditions. This agent is subject to the use conditions delineated in the preceding discussion. In addition, because
this agent can be used in high concentrations due to its cardiotoxicity profile, the design concentration must result
in oxygen levels of at least 16%. 
Cup burner tests in heptane indicate that C

4

F

10

 can extinguish fires in a total flood application at concentrations of 5.5 percent and therefore has a design concentration
of 6.6 percent. The cardiotoxicity NOAEL of 40 percent for this agent is well above its extinguishment concentration
and therefore is safe for use in occupied areas. This agent has a weight and volume equivalence of approximately 3.1
and 3.0 respectively. 
Using agents in high concentrations poses a risk of asphyxiation by displacing oxygen. With an ambient oxygen level
of 21 percent, a design concentration of 22.6 percent may reduce oxygen levels to approximately 16 percent, the minimum
level considered to be required to prevent impaired judgment or other physiological effects. Thus, the oxygen level
resulting from discharge of this agent must be at least 16 percent. 
This agent has an atmospheric lifetime of 2,600 years and a 100-year GWP of 5,500. Due to the long atmospheric lifetime
of C

4

F

10

, the Agency is finding this chemical acceptable only in those limited instances where no other alternative is technically
feasible due to performance or safety requirements. In most total flooding applications, the Agency believes that
alternatives to C

 exist. EPA intends that users select C

 out of need and that this agent be used as the agent of last resort. Thus, a user must determine that the requirements

 acceptability by undertaking the following measures: (i) Conduct an evaluation of foreseeable conditions of end
use; (ii) determine that human exposure to the other alternative extinguishing agents may approach or result in cardiosensitization

or chemical properties or other technical constraints of the other available agents preclude their use. 
Some examples of potential end-uses where toxicity may possibly be of concern are: i. Applications involving confined
spaces where egress is difficult, such as in civilian and military transportation applications including aircraft
engines, armored vehicles (engine and crew compartments), and ship engines; ii. Applications where public safety
or national security necessity may preclude personnel from evacuating, in event of emergency, such as nuclear power
plants or guard/security facilities; iii. Explosion and fire protection applications where high suppression or
inerting concentrations are required such as processing and pump stations, flammable liquid processing areas,
and flammable metal processing areas; iv. Health care facility applications involving impaired populations, such
as hospitals and nursing homes where there may be a preference for use of this agent due to the unique concerns within
the facility; v. Military mission critical applications which are vital to national security; vi. Other applications
where, due to physical or chemical properties, there are no other technically feasible alternatives. 
EPA recommends that users minimize unnecessary emissions of this agent by limiting testing of C

(j) IG-541. IG-541 is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. This agent is subject to the use conditions
delineated in the discussion of total flooding agents in this section. In the NPRM, this agent was referred to as (Inert
Gas Blend) but is now referred to as IG-541, consistent with NFPA 2001. This agent is a non-reactive, non-halocarbon
substance, and thus not carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic; the toxicity and cardiotoxicity tests normally
applied to halon substitutes do not apply here. Rather, this agent is a potential asphyxiant, since it is designed
to decrease the oxygen to a level at which combustion cannot be supported. This blend is designed to increase breathing
rates, thus making the oxygen deficient atmosphere breathable for short periods of time. Data submitted by the manufacturer
was peer-reviewed by pulmonary, cardiac, and stroke specialists. All have agreed that the blend does not pose significant
risk to the working population and may even pose less risk than does exposure to halocarbon agents. However, to ensure
safety, this blend is acceptable under the conditions that the design concentration results in at least 10 percent
oxygen and 5 percent carbon dioxide. In addition, if the oxygen concentration of the atmosphere falls below 10 percent,
personnel must be evacuated and egress must occur within 30 seconds. Since a fire can be expected to consume oxygen
and form decomposition products, personnel should treat any fire situation as an emergency and promptly exit the
space. 
A fire suppression design concentration of 52 percent and 43 percent would result in oxygen levels of 10 percent and
12 percent, respectively. The inerting concentration for this blend is 44 percent for methane/air mixtures and 50
percent for propane/air mixtures. A 50 percent concentration would result in an atmosphere of only 10.5 percent oxygen
content, which is at the lower limit of acceptability of this agent. 
Concerns have been raised about the decibel level of this system upon discharge. The manufacturer has submitted a
report indicating the decibel level to be 117 decibels for 3 seconds followed by a decay in noise level over 5 minutes,
compared to 130 decibels for a typical halon system. The Time Weighted Average (TWA) of this system is 57 decibels.
These levels are in compliance with the OSHA workplace maximum allowed peak of 140 decibels and a maximum Time Weighted
Average (TWA) of 90 decibels. This acceptability listing for use of IG-541 does not apply to any other inert gas
system. A manufacturer with a different formulation must prepare a separate SNAP submission to EPA. 
c. 

Acceptable subject to narrowed use limits.

 (1) Streaming agents. (a) HBFC-22B1. HBFC-22B1 is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute in non- residential
applications. HBFC-22B1 is unacceptable for use in residential applications. 
Extinguishment testing indicates that HBFC-22B1 can replace Halon 1211 at a ratio of 1.1 by weight, making it
a viable substitute for use in hand-held extinguishers. Despite its high ODP of 0.74, this chemical can facilitate
the shift away from Halon 1211, which has an even higher ODP of 3.0. However, given the potential market penetration
and the high ODP of HBFC-22B1, widespread use of HBFC-22B1 in consumer applications was estimated to cause
unacceptable damage to the ozone layer and an excessively high number of skin cancer cases and deaths. The total estimated
skin cancer cases and fatalities from the use of HBFC-22B1 as a Halon 1211 replacement in all uses including consumer
uses is approximately 30,000 and 600, respectively. 
In addition to concern about its ODP, use of HBFC-22B1 in residential applications may present risks of cardiosensitization.
To assess this risk, the Agency modeled the peak concentration of HBFC-22B1 that would be expected if such an
extinguishant were used to suppress a kitchen fire and estimated the decline from the peak. Such analysis indicated
that peak concentrations of HBFC-22B1 would exceed 3300 ppm. This is in excess of NFPA ceilings for exposure.
In light of the availability of other fire protection agents with lower associated risks, the Agency determined that
the risks posed by HBFC-22B1 were too large to justify widespread use in the consumer sector. Thus, EPA finds
HBFC-22B1 unacceptable for use in residential applications since other viable alternatives exist. 
Worker exposure may be a concern in small enclosed areas, but in larger areas and outdoors, modeling efforts indicate
that HBFC-22B1 can be used safely. In most realistic fire scenarios, proper procedures should be in place regarding
the operation of the extinguisher and workers will be properly trained in fire fighting procedures and ventilation
of extinguishment areas can be expected after dispensing the extinguishant.

<TEXT>
 

Because it represents one of the few available substitutes in specific end-uses, EPA is finding use of HBFC-22B1
acceptable as a streaming agent except for residential uses. However, it can only be considered a transitional agent,
because it will be phased out as a class I substance beginning January 1, 1996, in accordance with the Clean Air Act and
with the requirements of the Montreal Protocol. 

This agent was submitted to the Agency in a Premanufacture Notice (PMN) and is presently subject to requirements contained
in a Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA) section 5(e) Consent Order and associated Significant New Use Rule (40 CFR
721.1296). Under the terms of the Consent Order, it may be used only for outdoor automotive and marine applications.
In addition, to ensure safe use, the sale of this product is restricted to a size discouraging residential use, with
a minimum UL rating of 5BC. The unit must be properly labeled. The label must ban residential use, indicate space volume
restrictions that would limit exposure to 1 percent, and describe proper evacuation and reentry requirements. In
addition, the agent may only be sold in rechargeable units to encourage reuse and recycling and to minimize the potential
for the agent to escape to the atmosphere through improper disposal. 

(b) (CFC Blend). (CFC Blend) is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute in non-residential applications. While this
agent was listed in the SNAP NPRM as proposed acceptable, the sale and distribution of CFCs in pressurized dispensers
(in this sector, portable fire extinguishers) are controlled under section 610 of the CAA. The section 610 final rulemaking
(58 FR 4768, January 15, 1993) bans the use of CFCs in portable fire extinguishers. Therefore, in the upcoming proposed
SNAP rulemaking, EPA will list this agent as proposed unacceptable due to section 610 prohibitions. 

This agent is unacceptable for use in residential applications since other viable alternatives exist. (CFC-Blend)
contains CFCs with ODPs of 1.0. The predominant constituent has a 100-year GWP of 3400, with an atmospheric lifetime
of 55 years. The CFC constituent in this blend will be phased out of production on December 31, 1995. 

This agent is the most effective of all other halon substitutes except for HBFC-22B1 and HCFC-123, and
does not pose the exposure risk of HBFC-22B1 in certain scenarios. (CFC Blend) is generally considered non-toxic
and could serve as a transitional substitute in many streaming applications. However, in light of its high ODP relative
to other substitute agents and the large potential market for consumer/residential extinguishers, alternative
agents such as water and dry chemical are considered sufficient for residential uses.

 is acceptable as a streaming agent in non-residential applications: Where other alternatives are not technically
feasible due to performance or safety requirements: (a) Due to the physical or chemical properties of the agent, or
(b) where human exposure to the extinguishing agent may approach cardiosensitization levels or result in other unacceptable
health effects under normal operating conditions. This agent is unacceptable for use in residential applications
and for uses beyond the limits and conditions stipulated in this action. 

The extinguishment concentration of C

 is 4.4 percent, and a cardiotoxicity NOAEL of 40 percent. Its weight equivalence is 2.8 and its storage volume equivalence
is 3.1. While C

6

F

14

 has no ODP, its atmospheric lifetime is 3,000 years, and may potentially contribute to global climate change. 

EPA intends that users select C

6

F

14

 out of need and that this agent be used as the agent of last resort. Thus, a user must determine that the characteristics
of the end-use preclude use of other available alternatives. In most streaming applications, the Agency believes
that alternatives to C

6

F

14

 exist. These include the halocarbon replacements identified above as well as alternative agents such as water, CO

2

, foam, and dry chemicals. Users should attempt to use these other agents before deciding on an C

6

F

14

 system. At the time of publication of this rulemaking, EPA is unaware of any data which necessitates the use of any PFC
as a streaming agent based on toxicological concerns. 

Users must observe the limitations on C

6

F

14

 acceptability by undertaking the following measures: (i) Conduct an evaluation of foreseeable conditions of end
use; (ii) determine that human exposure to the other alternative extinguishing agents may pose a risk of cardiosensitization
or other unacceptable toxicity effects under normal operating conditions; and (iii) determine that the physical
or chemical properties or technical constraints of the other available agents preclude their use. Users must maintain
documentation on measures taken to justify use of this agent. 

Some examples of potential end-uses where toxicity or physical characteristics may possibly be of concern are: i.
Confined spaces which are difficult to egress, such as civilian and military transportation applications, including
armored vehicles, marine engines, power boats, aircraft cabins, and race cars; ii. Applications where public safety
or national security necessity may preclude personnel from evacuating, in event of emergency, such as nuclear power
plants or guard/security facilities; iii. Emergency response applications such as crash rescue vehicles and aircraft
flightlines; iv. Military applications involving mission critical applications which are vital to national security;
v. Other applications where, due to physical or chemical properties, there are no technically feasible alternatives.


EPA recommends that users minimize unnecessary emissions by limiting testing only to that which is essential to meet
safety or performance requirements; recovering C

F

14

 from the fire protection system in conjunction with testing or servicing; and destroying C

6

F

 or recycling it for later use. EPA encourages manufacturers to develop aggressive product stewardship programs
to help users avoid such unnecessary emissions.

 is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute (i) where other alternatives are not technically feasible due to performance
or safety requirements: (a) Due to their physical or chemical properties or (b) where human exposure to the agents
may approach cardiosensitization levels or result in other unacceptable health effects under normal operating
conditions. This agent is subject to the use conditions delineated in the preceding discussion concerning use to
total flooding agents in the workplace. In addition, because this agent can be used in high concentrations due to its
cardiotoxicity profile, the design concentration must result in oxygen levels of at least 16%.

Cup burner tests in heptane indicate that C

4

F

10

 can extinguish fires in a total flood application at concentrations of 5.5 percent with a design concentration of
6.6 percent. The cardiotoxicity NOAEL of 40 percent for this agent is well above its extinguishment concentration
and therefore is safe for use in occupied areas.

Using agents in high concentrations poses a risk of asphyxiation by displacing oxygen. With an ambient oxygen level
of 21 percent, a design concentration of 22.6 percent may reduce oxygen levels to approximately 16 percent, the minimum
level considered to be required to prevent impaired judgement or other physiological effects. Thus, the oxygen level
resulting from discharge of this agent must be at least 16 percent.

While C

4

F

10

 has a no ODP, it has an atmospheric lifetime of 2,600 years. Due to its long atmospheric lifetime, the Agency is finding
this chemical acceptable only in those limited instances where no other alternative is technically feasible due
to performance or safety requirements. In most total flooding applications, the Agency believes that alternatives
to C

4

F

10

 exist. It is EPA's intention that users not select C

4

F

10

 out of simple preference, but out of need and that this agent be used as the agent of last resort. Thus, a user must determine
that the requirements of the specific end-use preclude utilization of other available alternatives.

Users must observe the limitations on PFC use by undertaking the following measures: (i) Conduct an evaluation of
foreseeable conditions of end use; (ii) determine that human exposure to the other alternative extinguishing agents
may approach or result in cardiosensitization or other unacceptable toxicity effects under normal operating conditions;
and (iii) determine that the physical or chemical properties or other technical constraints of the other available
agents preclude their use.

Some examples of potential end-uses where toxicity may possibly be of concern are: i. Applications involving confined
spaces where egress is difficult, such as in civilian and military transportation applications including aircraft
engines, armored vehicles (engine and crew compartments), and ship engines; ii. Applications where public safety
or national security necessity may preclude personnel from evacuating, in event of emergency, such as nuclear power
plants or guard/security facilities; iii. Explosion and fire protection applications where high suppression or
inerting concentrations are required such as processing and pump stations, flammable liquid processing areas,
and flammable metal processing areas; iv. Health care facility applications involving impaired populations, such
as hospitals and nursing homes where there may be a preference for use of this agent due to the unique concerns within
the facility; v. Military mission critical applications which are vital to national security; vi. Other applications
where, due to physical or chemical properties, there are no other technically feasible alternatives.

EPA recommends that users minimize unnecessary emissions by limiting testing of C

 to that which is essential to meet safety or performance requirements; recovering C

b. 

Unacceptable substitutes.

 (1) Streaming agents. (a) (CFC-11). CFC-11 is unacceptable in its proposed application as a Halon 2402
substitute or for use in controlling large outdoor fires. This agent has been proposed as a substitute for Halon 2402,
as well as for use in controlling large outdoor fires, as when dropped from helicopters. Halon 2402 is not used in the
U.S. and thus does not require a substitute agent. Other nonozone-depleting methods are already in use in fighting
these large outdoor fires and, thus, EPA does not believe that introduction of this substitute is warranted.

(2) Total flooding agents. There are no total flooding agents listed as unacceptable.



H. Sterilants



1. Overview



CFC-12 is widely used in combination with ethylene oxide (EtO) to sterilize medical equipment and devices.
The most prevalent combination consists of 12 percent EtO mixed with 88 percent CFC-12; the mixture is therefore
referred to as ``12/88''. EtO serves as the actual sterilant in this mixture and can be used alone as a sterilant, but
by itself, EtO is highly flammable. CFC-12 acts as a diluent to form a non-flammable blend.

Sterilants, including 12/88, are used in a variety of applications. These include hospital sterilization, medical
equipment sterilization, pharmaceutical production, spice fumigation, commercial research and development,
and contract sterilization. Hospitals are by far the most numerous users of sterilants. Within hospitals, 12/88
is the most popular sterilant. Estimates indicate that in 1989, EtO/CFC-12 was used for over 95 percent of all
sterilization in hospitals. Other individual users of sterilant such as contract sterilizers and pharmaceutical
producers, while less numerous than hospitals, typically consume more sterilant than the average hospital but are
more likely to use other alternatives such as pure EtO sterilization.

<PARENT> FR940318-0-00023 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Despite the varied end uses of sterilants, the Agency did not divide its analysis and regulation of the sterilants
sector into distinct end uses. This is because alternatives to 12/88 are consistent across end uses, and the sterilant
sector as a whole represents one of the smallest use sectors for Class I substances being considered in the SNAP program.
On an ODP-weighted basis, US consumption of CFC-12 for sterilization represented less than 4 percent of the
total US consumption of ozone depleting substances in 1990. 

Several alternatives to 12/88 are currently in widespread use, but each is limited in applicability by material properties
of the devices to be sterilized. These currently available alternatives are unlikely to serve as widespread substitutes
for 12/88. Steam sterilizers, for example, are used in many applications and are less expensive to purchase and operate
than 12/88 systems. However, steam can only be used to sterilize equipment that can resist high temperatures and high
humidity. Pharmaceutical manufacturers already use steam to the maximum extent possible, but hospitals may be able
to shift some of their current 12/88 use to steam by separating heat and moisture-resistant devices from sensitive
ones. Other alternatives such as radiation, peracetic acid, and glutaraldehyde are also in use, but, like steam,
are incompatible with many of the materials now sterilized with 12/88. For example, 30 to 50 percent of new products
are initially sterilized with gamma radiation, but it is not possible to re-sterilize hospital surgical equipment
with gamma radiation. Rather, 12/88 must be used. 

Several other alternatives, such as chlorine dioxide, gaseous ozone, vapor phase hydrogen peroxide, and ionized
gas plasma, are currently under development. Many of these alternatives are also incompatible with materials currently
sterilized with 12/88. Those that may be applicable as partial substitutes for 12/88, such as hydrogen peroxide,
are not expected to be commercially available in the near term. 

Alternatives such as radiation and other currently available technologies should be used wherever applicable,
but are not specifically addressed in this rule due to their limited potential to be widespread substitutes for 12/88.
Additional information on such alternatives and on specific uses of 12/88 can be found in the supporting documentation
retained in the public docket. The determinations in this section are based on the risk screen described in the background
document titled ``Risk Screen on the Use of Substitutes for Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances: Sterilization.''
Responses to comments received on the sterilants sector can be found in the ``Response to Comment'' document, also
found in the public docket. 



2. Substitutes for Sterilization 



a. 

Halocarbons

. A number of halocarbon substitutes have been suggested as alternatives to CFC-12 in EtO blends for sterilization.
These include HCFC-123, HCFC-124, HFC-125, HCFC-141b, and HFC-134a and HFC-227ea.
At present, however, only HCFC-124, a blend of HCFCs, and HFC-227ea have been proposed as near-term candidates.
While HCFC-124 has been fully evaluated by the Agency in this rule, final determinations on the HCFC Blend and
HFC-227ea will be made as soon as complete data is available and the products are approved under FIFRA. Additional
research will be required to determine the suitability of the other agents in EtO blends. 

Many of the proposed halocarbons offer good potential as EtO diluents. They demonstrate good flame retardation,
low ODPs, low GWPs, low toxicity, materials compatibility, acceptable vapor pressures, and good blending properties.
Mixtures of halocarbons with EtO would most likely be at ratios similar to 12/88, or with a slightly lower EtO content.
HCFC-124 has been tested with 8.6 percent EtO, for example. Such properties would make halocarbon blends virtual
drop-in replacements for 12/88 in existing systems. The blends would also be far less damaging to stratospheric ozone
than is 12/88. 

b. 

Carbon dioxide

. Carbon dioxide is already in widespread use as a sterilant in blends with EtO. Previously, the most common blend contained
10 percent EtO and 90 percent CO

2

 and was referred to as ``10/90''. However, on October 1, 1993 the Department of Transportation (DOT) issued regulations
on the transport of hazardous materials which listed EtO/CO

2

 mixtures as flammable if they contain more than 9 percent EtO. To avoid changing safety and handling procedures, manufacturers
of this blend are changing the formulation of the EtO/CO

2

 blend to 8.5/91.5. 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940318-0-00194 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940318-0-00023 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

While the 8.5/91.5 blend is compatible with most of the materials now sterilized with 12/88, it must be used at higher
operating pressures than 12/88 systems and hence is not a direct drop-in replacement for 12/88. Use of CO

2

 blends requires that the sterilizing unit be retrofitted to handle higher operating pressures in order to prevent
excessive leakages of EtO from the system. 

CO

2

 and EtO tend to separate while stored in pressurized containers. Thus, initial discharges from the canisters during
use may contain excessively high amounts of flammable EtO; final discharges from nearly empty canisters may contain
pure CO

2

 and may not effectively sterilize equipment. To overcome this problem, single ``unit dose'' canisters have been
developed for use in conjunction with CO

2

 sterilizers. For safe operation, these canisters must be connected and disconnected from the sterilizing unit before
and after every use, thereby increasing the risk of accidental exposure. Improved training procedures will be required
with such systems. 

c. 

Pure EtO

. Pure EtO systems can also be used in place of current 12/88 sterilizers. By itself, EtO is toxic, carcinogenic, and
flammable. It is also explosive at concentrations above 3 percent in air. Thus, additional precautions must be taken
to limit occupational exposures and conflagration. Present OSHA standards and proper engineering controls have
demonstrated their ability to provide for safe operation of such systems. Pure EtO systems are currently used by many
contract sterilizers, large hospitals, and other large users. 



3. Listing Decisions 



a. 

Acceptable substitutes

. (1) HCFC-124. HCFC-124 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-12 in EtO blends. Initial testing
in hospital, industrial, and laboratory settings indicates that an EtO/HCFC-124 blend can serve as a virtual
drop-in replacement for 12/88, enabling users to transition away from CFC-12 while still using their existing
equipment. 

Use of HCFC-124 in sterilizers will allow significant reductions in skin cancer cases and deaths resulting
from ozone depletion. HCFC-124 has an ODP of only 0.02. Modeling results indicate that even if HCFC-124
replaces all current use of CFC-12 in sterilization, resulting skin cancer deaths in the total US population
born before 2030 will total only 600 more than if a zero ODP substitute were available. In addition, the low GWP of HCFC-124
ensures that use of the chemical in sterilizers will have a negligible effect on global warming. 

Under Title III of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Agency is required to regulate any of the 189 hazardous air
pollutants (HAPs). Ethylene oxide is a HAP, and the user is alerted to follow all upcoming regulations concerning
the use of ethylene oxide, whether used alone or in a blend. For example, it is likely in the future that Title III will
require a system that prevents venting of EtO into the atmosphere, therefore users installing new HCFC-124/EtO
systems may choose to take this into consideration. 

(2) Carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-12 in EtO blends used for sterilization.
Carbon dioxide can effectively reduce the flammability of EtO and does not deplete stratospheric ozone. Most CO

2

 currently used in sterilant mixtures is the recaptured by-product of other chemical processes, so its manufacture
for use in sterilizers should not increase emissions to the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is an asphyxiant in high concentrations,
but engineering controls designed to limit occupational exposures from the more toxic EtO will also serve to prevent
potentially lethal exposures to CO

2

. 

Blends of CO

2

 and EtO are commercially available at present, and proven process cycles already exist. Blends of CO

2

 and EtO have been in widespread use for years and dominated the market before the development of 12/88. Recent regulations
issued by DOT have prompted manufacturers to change the formulation of the blend to 8.5/91.5 EtO/CO

2

 due to flammability concerns. As mentioned above, ethylene oxide is a HAP, and the user is alerted to follow all upcoming
regulations under Title III of the Clean Air Act Amendments concerning the use of ethylene oxide, whether used alone
or in a blend. 

(3) Pure EtO. Pure EtO is acceptable as a substitute for 12/88 in sterilization. By itself, EtO is neither an ozone depleting
substance nor a contributor to global warming. However, EtO is toxic, carcinogenic, and flammable. While these factors
must be considered in the decision to approve EtO as a substitute for 12/88 and must be considered by users selecting
appropriate substitutes for their current use of 12/88, the Agency considers current applicable standards and operating
procedures (such as OSHA standards for occupational exposure) sufficient to protect human health and the environment.
Thus, pure EtO systems are acceptable substitutes for 12/88. Users are advised to adhere to all existing workplace
standards and to train workers in the proper operation of EtO equipment. Historical experience with pure EtO systems
indicates that they can be used safely when operated in accordance with such guidelines. Because of the threat posed
to the general population by vented EtO, the Agency also recommends that pure EtO systems be used in conjunction with
emission control technologies such as catalytic converters or acid water scrubbers to prevent exposures of the general
population to dangerous levels of EtO. 

As mentioned above, ethylene oxide is a HAP, and the user is alerted to the probability of future regulations under
Title III of the Clean Air Act Amendments concerning the use of ethylene oxide, whether used alone or in a blend. 

(4) Steam. Steam sterilization is acceptable as a substitute for 12/88 in sterilization. As mentioned above, steam
sterilization can be used on devices that can withstand high temperature and very high humidity. The use of steam sterilization
can be increased by separating heat and moisture sensitive devices from resistant ones. 

b. 

Unacceptable substitutes

. (None). 



I. Aerosols 



1. Overview 

To provide perspective on EPA's decisions in the aerosols sector, this section presents first an overview of important
related regulations affecting aerosols. Subsequent parts of the section describe the substitutes in the aerosols
sector and present EPA's decisions on the substitutes. The decisions are summarized in Appendix B at the end of this
notice. The proposed decisions presented in this section are based on the risk screen contained in the draft background
document entitled ``Risk Screen on the Use of Substitutes for Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances: Aerosols.''

Following scientific concerns raised in 1974 regarding possible ozone depletion from 
CFCs, EPA and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acted on March 17, 1978 (43 FR 
11301; 43 FR 11318) to ban the use of CFCs as aerosol propellants in all but essential 
applications. During the mid-1970s, use as aerosol propellants constituted over 50 percent of 
total CFC consumption in the United States. The 1978 ban reduced aerosol use of CFCs in 
this country by approximately 95 percent, eliminating nearly half of the then total U.S. 
consumption of these chemicals. 

Some CFC aerosol products were specifically exempted from the ban based on a 
determination of essentiality. (See reference Essential Use Determinations-Revised, 1978.) 
The other uses of CFCs in aerosol and pressurized dispenser products (e.g., as an active 
ingredient, a solvent, or as the sole ingredient) were excluded from the ban because they did 
not fit the narrow definition of ``aerosol propellant.'' Therefore, prior to the 1990 amendments 
to the Clean Air Act, the only aerosol products that still contained CFCs were products 
exempted from the 1978 ban on CFC propellants or products excluded from the 1978 ban. 

The Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 includes statutory authorities relevant to use of 
ozone depleting chemicals used in aerosol applications in several sections of Title VI. In 
addition to mandating the phaseout of class I and class II substances (sections 604 and 605) 
and mandating the review of substitutes (section 612), section 610 of title VI prohibits the 
sale of certain nonessential products made with class I and class II substances. Title VI 
divides controlled ozone-depleting substances into two distinct classes. Class I is comprised 
of CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, MCF, hydrobromofluorocarbons, and methyl bromide. 
Class II is comprised solely of HCFCs. The product bans for class I substances and class II 
substances are distinct from one another and are addressed in subsections 610(b) and 610(d), 
respectively. In section 610(b), Congress directed EPA to promulgate regulations that 
prohibit the sale or distribution of certain ``nonessential'' products that release class I 
substances. Under this subsection, Congress specifies particular products as nonessential and 
directs EPA to identify other nonessential products. 

In the final regulations implementing the Class I Nonessential Products ban (58 FR 
4767; January 15, 1993), EPA issued regulations that implement the requirements of section 
610(b) and ban certain nonessential products that release class I substances. Under this rule, 
EPA banned, among other products, flexible and packaging foam, and aerosols and other 
pressurized dispensers using CFCs. The use of methyl chloroform, while a class I substance, 
is not restricted under this regulation. 

As directed by Congress, EPA researched the purpose or intended use of products 
containing class I substances, the technological availability of substitutes, safety and health 
considerations, and other relevant factors including the economic effect of banning selected 
products. EPA then banned the use of CFCs as propellants and solvents in all aerosol 
products with the following specific exemptions (58 FR 4767; January 15, 1993): 




_Medical devices listed in 21 CFR 2.125(c).

_Lubricants for pharmaceutical and tablet manufacture.

_Gauze bandage adhesives and adhesive removers.

_Topical anesthetic and vapocoolant products.

_Lubricants, coatings, or cleaning fluids for electrical and electronic equipment that contain CFC-11, CFC-12
or CFC-113 for solvent purposes, but which contain no other CFC.

_Lubricants, coatings, or cleaning fluids for aircraft maintenance that contain CFC-11 or CFC-113,
but which contain no other CFC.

_Release agents for molds using CFC-11 or CFC-113 in the production of plastic 
or elastomeric materials.

_Spinnerette lubricant/cleaning sprays used in the production of synthetic fibers that contain CFC-114,
but contain no other CFCs.

_Containers of CFCs used as halogen ion sources in plasma etching.

_Document preservation sprays that contain CFC-113, but which contain no other CFCs.

_Red pepper bear repellant sprays that contain CFC-113, but which contain no other CFCs. 




Exemption from the class I ban does not imply exemption from the phase-out 
requirements. 

HCFCs also have current and potential applications as propellants and as solvents in 
aerosol products. Until recently, their use has been limited by the aerosol industry because of 
their high cost relative to traditional options such as CFCs and hydrocarbons. Increased 
regulation of CFCs, including taxation of these substances and an eventual phase-out, has 
meant that HCFCs are, for an interim period, economically viable in some applications, 
particularly where concern about flammability limits the use of cheaper alternatives, such as 
hydrocarbons. 

However, section 610(d) of the CAA prohibits as of January 1, 1994, the sale or 
distribution of aerosol or foam products that contain or are manufactured with class II 
substances. All HCFCs are currently listed as class II substances. EPA believes that the ban 
on certain products containing class II substances is self-executing. Section 610(d)(1) bans 
the sale of the specified class II products on its own terms, without any reference to required 
regulations. Thus, EPA is not required to determine which products will be banned. 

However, section 610(d)(2) allows EPA to grant exceptions and exclusions from the 
ban on aerosol and pressurized dispenser products containing class II substances. 
Specifically, EPA is authorized to grant exceptions from the prohibition where the use of the 
aerosol product or pressurized dispenser is determined by the Administrator to be essential as 
a result of flammability or worker safety, and where the only available alternative to the use 
of a class II substance is the use of a class I substance which legally could be substituted for 
such class II substance (i.e., use of a class I substance that is still allowed). In addition to 
these two criteria for exceptions, aerosol products may be excluded from the ban as a result 
of a third consideration in section 610 (d)(2); namely, that the ban on products containing 
class II substances shall not apply to any medical device. Reflecting the self-executing nature 
of the CAA ban, any aerosol product or pressurized dispenser containing a class II substance 
is banned as of January 1, 1994, unless EPA grants an exception. 

EPA published a final rule under 610(d)(2) December 30, 1993 (58 FR 69637). The 
following products were exempted:

 Medical devices listed in 21 CFR 2.125(e); 

 Lubricants, coatings or cleaning fluids for electrical or electronic equipment, 
which contain class II substances for solvent purposes, but which contain no 
other class II substances; 

 Lubricants, coatings or cleaning fluids used for aircraft maintenance, which 
contain class II substances for solvent purposes but which contain no other 
class II substances; 

 Mold release agents used in the production of plastic and elastomeric materials, 
which contain class II substances for solvent purposes but which contain no 
other class II substances, and/or mold release agents that contain HCFC-22 as a 
propellant where evidence of good faith efforts to secure alternatives indicates 
that, other than a class I substance, there are no suitable alternatives; 

 Spinnerette lubricants/cleaning sprays used in the production of synthetic fibers, 
which contain class II substances for solvent purposes and/or contain class II 
substances for propellant purposes; 

 Document preservation sprays which contain HCFC-141b as a solvent, but 
which contain no other class II substance; and/or which contain HCFC-22 as a 
propellant, but which contain no other class II substance and which are used 
solely on thick books, books with coated, dense or paper and tightly bound 
documents; 

 Portable fire extinguishing equipment sold to commercial users, owners of 
marine vessels or boats, and owners of noncommercial aircraft that contains a 
class II substance as a fire extinguishant where evidence of good faith efforts 
to secure alternatives indicate that, other than a class I substance, there are no 
suitable alternatives; and 

 Wasp and hornet sprays for use near high-tension power lines that contain a 
class II substance for solvent purposes only, but which contain no other class II 
substances. 

EPA did not propose any exceptions for propellant uses of class II substances since 
sufficient propellant substitutes are available. 

Uses of HCFCs granted an exemption under section 610 based on the lack of other 
alternatives will not face further restrictions under the SNAP program and authority under 
section 612, since the express purpose of the SNAP program is to restrict substitutes only in 
cases where other alternatives do exist. 



2. Substitutes for Aerosols 



The class I substances that are currently being used in aerosol applications include 
CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-114, and methyl chloroform (MCF). Class II substances 
that are currently being used are HCFC-22, HCFC-142b, and HCFC-141b. 

The Agency has elected only to discuss alternatives for CFC-11, CFC-113, MCF, 
HCFC-22, HCFC-142b, and HCFC-141b. The uses for CFC-12 and CFC-114 are as 
propellants in medical applications and will not be discussed here because the substitutes for 
these applications are currently being developed and will have to undergo FDA review. 
Possible substitutes in this application include HFC-134a and HFC-227ea, which both have 
low toxicity and zero ozone depletion potential. Regulatory approval for these compounds, 
however, is contingent on FDA approval, which will likely occur over the next several years. 
EPA's review of these substitutes will focus exclusively on environmental effects. 

A variety of chemicals are currently being used or are being considered as substitutes 
for class I and II controlled substances used in non-inhalation aerosols and pressurized 
containers. The suitability of alternatives depends upon the product in which they are used. 
Each of these alternatives has its own physical and chemical characteristics which make it an 
optimal choice for the product in question, in terms of such factors as solvency properties, 
propellant characteristics, performance, cost, and environmental considerations. However, the 
Agency believes that the majority of the substitutes considered to replace the class I and II 
controlled substances used as propellants or solvents in aerosols and pressurized containers as 
propellants and solvents are currently available and easily integrated into existing aerosol 
production facilities. 

The primary substitutes for the propellant uses of CFC-11, HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b 
are as follows: 

 Saturated hydrocarbons (C3-C6).

 Dimethyl ether.

 HFCs.

 Compressed gases.

 Alternative processes.

HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b could technically be used as substitutes for CFC-11, but 
their use is extensively controlled under section 610 of the CAA. 
The primary substitutes for the solvent/diluent uses of CFC-11, CFC-113, MCF, and 
HCFC-141b are as follows: 
 Petroleum hydrocarbons (C6-C20).
 Oxygenated organic solvents (ketones, esters, ethers, and alcohols). 
 HCFC-141b. 
 Terpenes. 
 Chlorinated solvents. 
 Water-based systems. 
Other substitutes, including monochlorotoluenes/benzotrifluorides, hydrofluorocarbons, 
and perfluorocarbons, are also being investigated. This list of substitutes was compiled with 
the help of companies that submitted information on substitutes to the Agency in response to 
the January 16, 1992, Advance Notice of Proposed Rule-Making. Today's decisions on these 
substitutes are listed in appendix B. The remainder of this section discusses these substitutes, 
the decision on each substitute, and the Agency's reasoning behind each determination. 
Vendors or users of substitutes not included on the table for the SNAP determinations on 
aerosols should provide information on the substitutes so that the Agency can add these 
substitutes to the lists. 
a. Substitutes for propellants. 
(1) Saturated light hydrocarbons (C3-C6). 
Hydrocarbons are promising replacements for nonessential uses of HCFC-22 as a 
propellant in aerosols and pressurized containers. The specific category of hydrocarbons used 
as propellants are saturated light hydrocarbons (C3-C6). Examples of these small chain 
compounds include butane, isobutane, and propane. All have low boiling points, making 
them excellent propellants. They are used separately or in mixtures, are inexpensive 
compared to HCFC-22 (HCFC-22 is four times more expensive than hydrocarbons), and are 
readily available from most chemical distributors. 
The Agency believes that the major area of concern with the replacement of 
hydrocarbons for HCFC-22 is the flammability of hydrocarbons. In applications where a 
nonflammable propellant is needed, a hydrocarbon could not be used. For example, the use 
of hydrocarbons around electrical equipment could prove hazardous if sparks from the 
equipment were to ignite the hydrocarbon propellant. 
Saturated light hydrocarbons are adequate substitute propellants where flammability is 
not a concern. To reduce product flammability, hydrocarbons can be used with water-based 
formulations in products such as insecticides, where product quality would not be adversely 
affected. Manufacturers are also hindered from selling hydrocarbon-propelled aerosols in 
certain jurisdictions. In California, for example, the use of hydrocarbons is restricted because 
of their classification as volatile organic compounds which contribute to low level ozone or 
smog. 
(2) Dimethyl ether. 
Dimethyl ether (DME) is a medium pressure, flammable, liquefied propellant. 
Because of its chemical properties, it can be used as a combination propellant/solvent, 
although it is typically classified together with other propellants and is used in combination 
with other propellants. Practices for manufacture and use of aerosol products formulated with 
DME parallel practices employed with hydrocarbons. 
(3) Hydrofluorocarbons. 
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) such as HFC-134a, HFC-125 and HFC-152a are partially 
fluorinated hydrocarbons and have been developed relatively recently. These compounds are 
less dense than HCFC-22, but with minor reformulation adjustments could function equally 
well as propellants except in products such as noise horns, which require a more dense gas. 
Because HFCs have only recently been developed, they are only now becoming readily 
available and are expected to be priced significantly higher than HCFC-22, at least in the near 
term. 
Preliminary studies show that HFC-134a and HFC-125 are nonflammable and have 
very low toxicity, which would make them good replacements for HCFC-22 as propellants in 
products where nonflammability is a requirement. Although HFC-152a is slightly flammable, 
it can be formulated with other materials_such as HFC-125_to control its flammability. 
HFCs also may be used in conjunction with other flammable chemicals to reduce the 
flammability of such mixtures. For example, HFCs are being tested for use with dimethyl 
ether (DME) in safety sprays and animal repellents. Although DME is flammable, the overall 
product formulation is not. HFC-134a and HFC-125 are also being tested as replacements for 
CFCs still used in medical applications because of their nonflammable, nontoxic properties. 
(4) Compressed gases. 
Compressed gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, air, and nitrous oxide are 
common, low molecular weight gases used as propellants in aerosol products but not as drop-in replacements. First,
alternative dispensing mechanisms and stronger containers are needed 
because these gases are under significantly greater pressure. Containers holding compressed 
gases are, therefore, larger and bulkier. Second, because these chemicals have low molecular 
weights, they are inadequate as replacements for HCFC-22 in products requiring a dense gas 
propellant, such as noise horns, or in products requiring fine dispersion of the product, such 
as surface lubricants and weld inspection developers. Third, compressed gases dispel material 
faster because they are under higher pressure, which contributes to wasted product. 
Compressed gases are readily available from most chemical distributors and are 
relatively inexpensive. Compressed gases cool upon expansion. Compressed gases are also 
nonflammable and can serve as propellants in applications where a nonflammable propellant 
is necessary, but not in applications where a fine even dispersion is required.

(5) HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b. 
Limited use of these chemicals as substitutes is anticipated since section 610 imposes 
significant restrictions as of January 1, 1994, on their use as aerosol propellants. 
(6) Alternative processes. 
Alternative processes, such as manually operated pumps and sprays, provide an 
alternative delivery mechanism in place of the aerosol dispenser. Development of alternative 
process replacements depends on technological feasibility. Some products, such as aerosol 
foams, cannot now be easily formed with alternative processes, making the replacement of the 
propellant difficult. In other products, the alternative process may not provide proper 
dispersion or accurate application of the product, limiting its use. Persons using manual 
pumps or sprays (in applications where alternative processes function adequately as 
replacements) on a continuous basis may become fatigued with the constant pumping motion, 
thus producing poor product performance. Nonetheless, these substitutes can serve as viable 
alternatives in certain applications. 
b. 

Substitutes for solvent/diluents. 


(1) Petroleum hydrocarbons (C6-C20). 
Petroleum hydrocarbons are generally defined as C6-C20 hydrocarbons fractionated 
from the distillation of petroleum. These compounds are loosely grouped into paraffins (six 
carbon chains to ten carbon chains_n-hexane, n-heptane, etc.) and light aromatics (toluene 
and xylene) and come in various grades of purity. Components with up to twenty carbons are 
now also being used in an effort to reduce flammability. These compounds have good 
solvent properties, are relatively inexpensive (about half the price of MCF), and are readily 
available from chemical distributors. When a controlled substance is used only as a diluent, 
such as in automotive undercoatings, substitution using petroleum hydrocarbons can be 
achieved with minor reformulation. Many of these products containing petroleum 
hydrocarbons even outperform their chlorinated counterpart. 
Petroleum hydrocarbons are, however, flammable, and thus cannot be used as 
replacement solvents in applications where the solvent must be nonflammable such as 
electronic cleaning applications. In addition, pesticide aerosols formulated with certain 
petroleum hydrocarbons must adhere to requirements imposed under the Federal Insecticide, 
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). 
(2) Oxygenated organic solvents. Oxygenated organic solvents are compounds based on hydrocarbons containing 
appendant oxygen (alcohols and ketones), integral oxygens (ethers), or both (esters). These 
compounds are relatively inexpensive compared to MCF_about half the cost_and are readily 
available from chemical distributors. These compounds are also flammable, however, and 
cannot be used as substitute solvents in applications where the solvent must be nonflammable. 
These compounds are currently being blended with class I substances to reduce the 
amount of class I substances used in a product's formulation. Since the quantity of these 
compounds is small, the product still remains nonflammable. Some manufacturers, however, 
are completely reformulating products such as spot removers with ketones, esters, ethers, or 
alcohols. To continue the safe use of these convenient products, consumers may have to be 
educated about the product's increased flammability. 
(3) Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). 
HCFC-141b is a potential substitute to replace CFC-11 and CFC-113 used in 
solvent/diluent applications in aerosols and pressurized dispensers. HCFC-141b's ODP is 
similar to that of MCF, making it unlikely that aerosol manufacturers would reformulate their 
products away from MCF towards HCFC-141b. 
HCFC-141b has a number of characteristics that make it a suitable alternative solvent, 
namely: It is nonconductive, nonflammable according to U.S. Department of Transportation 
specifications, and evaporates quickly. However, HCFC-141b is expensive compared to the 
pretax price of CFC-113_almost three times the cost. Further, HCFC-141b is slightly 
corrosive to plastic parts, and could not serve as a drop-in replacement for all the uses of 
CFC-11 and CFC-113 as a solvent. 
(4) Terpenes. 
Terpenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons based on isoprene subunits. They have good 
solvent properties and could replace ozone-depleting compounds in some solvent cleaning 
applications. They are flammable, which limits their use in applications that require 
nonflammable solvents. Some terpenes have a slight citrus scent while others have stronger, 
unpleasant odors, making them difficult to use over an extended period of time.

<TEXT>
 

(5) Other chlorinated solvents. Other chlorinated solvents such as perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, and
methylene chloride can be used to replace CFC-11, CFC-113, and MCF in solvent applications in aerosol
and pressurized containers. These chlorinated solvents are extremely effective and can dissolve compounds which
are difficult to dissolve in other solvents, such as fluorinated polymers used in water and oil repellants. However,
due to toxicity concerns associated with these substances, their use is likely to be limited, especially in products
sold to the general public or in products used frequently by workers. In addition, pesticide aerosols formulated
with these chlorinated solvents must adhere to applicable requirements under FIFRA. 


Because they are strong solvents and nonflammable, however, chlorinated solvents are promising substitutes in
cleaning applications for electronic equipment or electric motors where safeguards could protect workers from
the potentially toxic fumes. These compounds are readily available from chemical distributors at prices comparable
to those for MCF. 


(6) Water-based formulations. Water-based formulations provide a replacement for the use of CFC-11, CFC-113,
and MCF as solvents in aerosols and pressurized dispensers. These reformulated products usually contain new components/active
ingredients that are water soluble. The overall function of the reformulated product remains the same, but the product's
substituents are changed. 


Most formulations are nonflammable, yet may be difficult to use around sources of electricity because they may short
out electrical equipment. Such products may also have short shelf-lives because the active ingredient may decompose
in an aqueous environment. Also, these products when sprayed do not evaporate quickly, resulting in product accumulation.
This may create problems in certain applications, such as where the accumulation of a water-based product contributes
to rust or corrosion. The possibility of reformulating products is product-specific, depending on the feasibility
of finding active 
ingredients that are water soluble. 


(7) Monochlorotoluene/benzotrifluorides. Monochlorotoluenes and benzotrifluorides are of commercial interest
as solvent substitutes for aerosols. These compounds can be used either in isolation or in various mixtures, depending
on desired chemical properties. The Agency has not yet completed its review of these formulations, which will be included
in the next SNAP update. 



(8) HFC-4310. HFC-4310mee will soon be commercially available as a solvent cleaning agent and may be useful
in aerosol products. The Agency has not completed review of preliminary data on this chemical. This chemical will
be undergoing review under the Premanufacture Notice program of the Toxic substances Control Act. 



Other HFCs are also currently in development for solvent usage, although their composition is still proprietary.



(9) Perfluorocarbons (C6F14). The Agency recently received a request to evaluate the perfluorocarbon C

 as a substitute solvent in aerosols. While this agent has been reviewed as a substitute for use in solvent cleaning,
the Agency has not completed review in this sector. 



3. Comment Response 




Public comments on the aerosols decisions focused principally on technical issues, such as the flammability of various
propellants or the length of hydrocarbons used as propellants. Several commenters noted that chlorinated solvents
may be appropriate for use in consumer products where a nonflammable aerosol is necessary, such as for brake cleaners.
The Agency recognizes this as a valid concern and has amended the comment made in the Notice of Proposed Rule-Making
that stated that chlorinated solvents are not suitable for consumer applications. However, EPA still encourages
manufacturers to formulate products with solvents of lower toxicity, where possible. 


A number of commenters requested clarification of the relationship between the section 612 SNAP program and the section
610 nonessential use ban. The Agency has added clarification to the relevant discussion of listing decisions. 




4. Listing Decisions 


a. 

Acceptable Substitutes. 

(1) Propellants. (a) Saturated light hydrocarbons (C3-C6). Saturated light hydrocarbons (C3-C6) are
acceptable substitutes for CFC-11, HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b as propellants in the aerosols sector.
These hydrocarbons have several environmental advantages over other substitutes. For example, they have zero ozone
depletion potential, and because of their extremely short atmospheric residence times they are estimated to contribute
little to global warming. Yet their reactivity contributes to formation of tropospheric ozone. However, use of VOCs
is already subject to stringent regulatory controls at the federal, state, and local level, and the Agency's risk
screen suggests that these controls preclude the need for additional regulation of aerosols formulated with VOCs.




Saturated light hydrocarbons have a long history of use, and the increase in use due to replacement of CFCs as aerosol
propellants represents a fraction of current consumption. Hydrocarbon propellants acquired industrial importance
in the U.S. in the early 1950s. By 1978, when the ban on CFC propellants in the U.S. was promulgated, nearly half of all
aerosol units being produced in the U.S were already using hydrocarbon propellants. This percentage grew to nearly
90 percent in 1979 as a result of the CFC ban. 


Most of the hydrocarbon propellants are essentially non-toxic. Very high 
concentrations of hydrocarbons are necessary to alter normal body functions. No temporary or permanent physiological
malfunctions are produced by these chemicals; however, very high concentrations of hydrocarbons may result in asphyxiation
because of lack of oxygen.

<TEXT>
 

Hydrocarbon propellants are flammable. Precautions should be taken in receiving, unloading, transferring, storing,
and filling hydrocarbon aerosol products. The listing of these compounds as acceptable substitutes does not exempt
producers or users from other applicable regulatory or industrial standards such as those promulgated by OSHA. However,
because of the widespread use of these materials, industry is already familiar with the safety precautions necessary
in switching from a CFC filling operation to one using hydrocarbons. 


(b) HFC-134a, HFC-125 and HFC-152a. HFC-134a, HFC-125 and HFC-134a are acceptable
substitutes for CFC-11, HCFC-22, and HCFC-142b as propellants in the aerosols sector. HFC-152a
has both zero ozone depletion potential and a comparatively low global warming potential. However, HFC-152a
by itself is flammable, and necessary precautions should be taken when using this chemical. 
HFC-134a and HFC-125 also have no ozone depletion potential, yet these compounds do have atmospheric
lifetimes and could contribute to global warming. Despite these concerns, the Agency has listed these substitutes
as acceptable in today's rule-making since they meet the needs of specialized applications where other substitutes
do not provide acceptable performance. The use of these HFCs by themselves is acceptable, as are blends of these chemicals
with other acceptable substitutes. 


(c) Dimethyl ether. Dimethyl ether is an acceptable substitute propellant for CFC-11, HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b
in the aerosols sector. The principal environmental concern for the use of DME is its ability to contribute to ground-level
ozone formation. However, the Agency's screen of effects from increased use of VOCs in aerosol products suggests
that increases in groundlevel ozone formation from use of DME can be controlled through existing VOC regulations.



(d) Compressed gases. Compressed gases are acceptable substitutes for CFC-11, HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b
as propellants in the aerosols sector. The Agency believes that although compressed gases such as air, carbon dioxide,
and nitrogen are presently only used in about 7-9 percent of the aerosol products, their use will grow in the future.
These gases have low toxicity and 
industrial practices for using these substitutes are well established. Since these gases are under significantly
greater pressure than CFCs and HCFCs, containers holding these gases must be larger and bulkier, and safety precautions
should be undertaken during filling operations. Carbon dioxide and nitrogen are non-flammable and do not require
the use of explosion proof gassing equipment. Nitrous oxide, while non-flammable, can create a moderate explosion
risk under certain temperature and pressure conditions. 


(e) Alternative processes. Alternative processes are acceptable substitutes for CFC-11, HCFC-22 and
HCFC-142b as propellants in the aerosols sector. Alternative processes such as finger and trigger pumps, two-compartment
aerosol products, mechanical pressure dispenser systems, and nonspray dispensers (e.g., solid stick dispensers)
have found increasing use as replacement for conventional aerosol products. The Agency believes that these products
do not pose any significant risks, since they rely on mechanical force to replace the propellant. 


(f) HCFC-22, HCFC-142b. HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b are acceptable substitutes for CFC-11
as aerosol propellants. Users should note, however, that under section 610 of the Clean Air Act, extensive restrictions
already govern the use of HCFCs as aerosol propellants as of January 1, 1994. Only one exemption for HCFCs used as aerosol
propellants was granted under section 610 (58 FR 69637). Today's listing allows the use HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b
in the exempted application, but general use restrictions established under section 610 must still be followed.
Decisions taken under section 610 are described earlier in this chapter, as are the exemptions under section 610.




The principal problem with HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b is that they have significant ODPs and are therefore
classified as class II substances. Yet in limited where flammability is a technical impediment to use of other alternatives,
HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b may be the only alternatives to replace other ozone-depleting propellants. The
exemption for HCFC-141b use as an aerosol solvent under section 610 reflects these user needs. 


(2) Solvents. (a) Petroleum hydrocarbons. C6-C20 petroleum hydrocarbons are acceptable substitutes for
CFC-11, CFC-113, methyl chloroform (MCF) and HCFC-141b as solvents in the aerosol sector. Petroleum
hydrocarbons, both naturally and synthetically derived, have a long history of safe use, and 
any risks due to increased tropospheric ozone formation or worker exposure can be controlled by existing regulations.
Concerns for risks from these compounds in possible uses as pesticide aerosol solvents have already been addressed
under FIFRA authorities. 



(b) HCFC-141b. HCFC-141b, either by itself or blended with other compounds, is an acceptable substitute
for CFC-11, CFC-113 and MCF as an aerosol solvent. Under section 610 of the Clean Air Act, extensive restrictions
already govern the use of HCFC-141b as an aerosol solvent as of January 1, 1994. Limited exemptions for HCFC-141b
use as an aerosol solvent were granted under section 610 (58 FR 69637). Today's listing allows the use HCFC-141b
in the exempted applications, but general use restrictions established under section 610 must still be followed.
Decisions taken under section 610 are described earlier in this chapter, as are the exemptions under section 610.




The principal problem with HCFC-141b is that it has a comparatively high ODP-0.11. This is the highest
ODP of all HCFCs; in fact, the ODP of HCFC-141b is about twice as high as HCFC-22. Yet in certain cases, such
as where flammability is a technical impediment to use of other alternatives, HCFC-141b may be the only alternative
to replace other ozone-depleting solvents. Several companies contacted the Agency under both section 610 and 612
indicating that they have tested alternatives, and that in some cases only HCFC141b meets performance or safety criteria.
The exemptions for HCFC-141b use as an aerosol 
solvent under section 610 reflect these user needs. 


(c) Other chlorinated solvents. Trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, and methylene chloride are acceptable
substitutes for CFC-11, CFC-113, MCF and HCFC-141b as solvents in the aerosols sector. These substitutes
have the technical capability to meet a large portion of the needs of the aerosols 
industry. However, the Agency anticipates that, due to toxicity concerns associated with the use of these alternatives,
the market share for these other chlorinated solvents will not increase substantially.

The toxicity of these three solvents has been the subject of extensive analysis. Without regulation, their use has
the potential to pose high risks to workers as well as to residents in nearby communities or consumers using household
products containing such chemicals. However, while the Agency generally discourages the use of these chemicals
in aerosol applications, they may be necessary in products where nonflammability is a critical characteristic.
The Agency encourages formulators of aerosols to restrict their use of chlorinated solvents to products that must
be nonflammable. 

Given that the use of chlorinated solvents may be necessary to offset risks of flammability, the Agency has determined
chlorinated solvents to be acceptable substitutes since risks to workers can be reduced by adhering to OSHA standards.
Residual risks to residents in nearby communities may remain. The Agency is aware of these potential risks and has
the authority to address them under section 112 of the CAA. This section of the CAA lists three of these solvents as Hazardous
Air Pollutants, and authorizes the Agency to establish controls for their use. EPA will pursue any appropriate regulations
under this authority. Any risks arising from use of these compounds as pesticide aerosols in reformulated products
can be addressed using FIFRA authorities. 

These solvents are occasionally found in consumer products. Consumer risks were not analyzed under the SNAP risk
screens since these risks are controlled under authorities implemented by the Consumer Safety Product Commission,
which has already established labeling requirements for use of these solvents. 

(d) Oxygenated organic solvents. Oxygenated organic solvents (ketones, esters, ethers, and alcohols) are acceptable
substitutes for CFC-11, CFC-113, MCF and HCFC-141b as solvents in the aerosols sector. Most of these
compounds have a long history of safe use, and regulations to control any risks due to tropospheric ozone formation
or worker exposure are already in place under other relevant authorities. 

(e) Terpenes. Terpenes are acceptable substitutes for CFC-11, CFC-113, MCF and HCFC-141b as solvents
in the aerosols sector. Terpene-based formulations have a long history of safe use as industrial solvents, and any
increased risks due to increased tropospheric ozone formation can be controlled through existing regulations.
Additionally, many of these chemicals are naturally occurring organic hydrocarbons and exhibit significant biodegradability.


The use history of these chemicals does not negate the toxicity of these compounds to aquatic life. However, the Agency
does not believe that in this case significant adverse effects are to be expected, since in aerosol applications the
terpenes volatilize during use and would consequently not be discharged to surface or ground water where aquatic
species are to be found. 

(f) Water-based formulations. Water-based formulations are acceptable substitutes for CFC-11, CFC-113,
MCF and HCFC-141b as solvents in the aerosols sector. The Agency did not identify any significant environmental
concerns associated with use of these products. They can contain small amounts of VOCs, but these amounts are minor
in comparison to products formulated solely with organic solvents. 

b. Substitutes acceptable subject to use conditions. (None). 
c. Substitutes acceptable subject to narrowed use limits. (None). 
d. Unacceptable substitutes. (None). 



 J. Tobacco Expansion 



1. Overview 



Tobacco expansion is the process of puffing leaves of tobacco to decrease the volume of tobacco used in cigarette production.
Currently, one of the primary technologies used to expand tobacco in the U.S. relies on CFC-11. One and one half
million pounds of CFC-11 are used annually in the U.S. in this sector. 

In the CFC-11 process, tobacco is saturated with CFC-11 in a stainless steel vessel maintained at 120 degrees
Fahrenheit and pressurized to 20 psi. The tobacco is then permeated with hot air (330 F) which expands the tobacco.
The CFC-11 is vaporized and recovered by cooling and compressing, and is continually recovered and recycled.


The Agency received notification on two potential substitutes: (1) Carbon dioxide technology, an alternative process
substitute, and (2) HFC-227ea. In this final rule, the Agency is listing carbon dioxide as an acceptable substitute
for CFC-11 in tobacco expansion. Similarly, HFC-227ea is (currently under review and will be listed in
the FRM pending completion of review of the data).

The NPRM listed HCFC-123 as pending review for use as a substitute for tobacco 
expansion. One commenter proposed that HCFC-123 should not be listed as an acceptable 
substitute in the final rule because the sole U.S. manufacturer will not sell it for use in the 
tobacco expansion process. The sole U.S. manufacturer of HCFC-123 confirmed via public 
comment that HCFC-123 will not be sold to the tobacco industry for use in the tobacco 
expansion process. The manufacturer requested EPA to withdraw this compound from 
consideration as an alternative for this end-use. Subsequently, EPA terminated the review for 
HCFC-123 in tobacco expansion, and will not include HCFC-123 in the listing decisions for 
this sector. 



3. Listing Decisions 



a. 

Carbon dioxide.

 The Agency has determined that the use of carbon dioxide as a substitute for CFC-11 
in tobacco expansion is acceptable. Carbon dioxide has been successfully used in the tobacco 
industry for approximately twenty years. It is non-toxic, non-flammable, and it has zero 
ODP. A permissible exposure level (PEL) has been set at 5,000 ppm, a level that can easily 
be met during the well contained tobacco expansion process. The carbon dioxide process is 
similar to the process using CFC-11, though pressure and temperature parameters are 
different. For this reason carbon dioxide cannot be used as a retrofit for CFC-11 equipment; 
new equipment must be purchased in order to use carbon dioxide for tobacco expansion. 

Although carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, increased use of carbon dioxide for 
tobacco expansion will not increase global warming because the carbon dioxide used in 
tobacco expansion is a by-product of the production of other gases. The carbon dioxide is 
captured from a stream of gas that otherwise would be emitted to the ambient air. 
Additionally, carbon dioxide recycling equipment is available, which will also help limit 
emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. 

b. 

Propane. 

 The Agency has determined that the use of propane as a substitute for CFC-11 in 
tobacco expansion is acceptable. Plant modifications may be necessary to control the 
flammability of this substitute to ensure worker safety. Propane is a VOC and must be 
controlled as such under Title I of the CAA. 



K. Adhesives, Coatings, and Inks 



1. Overview 



Methyl chloroform (MCF) is used as a solvent in the adhesives, coatings, and inks 
sector because of its unique and favorable properties: High solvency, non flammability, low 
toxicity, relative high stability, and low boiling point. For this section, coatings are defined to 
be durable and decorative coatings such as paints. Unlike a number of other solvents that are 
classified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), MCF does not photochemically degrade in 
the lower atmosphere to lead to ground-level ozone formation. This key property caused 
many manufacturers to switch from formulations containing VOC solvents to MCF in the mid 
1980s because regulatory pressure increased to reduce VOC emissions in nonattainment areas. 
Companies achieved compliance by altering their VOC solvent-borne formulations to MCF, 
thereby avoiding costly capital investment in new equipment, changes in operating 
procedures, and employee retraining. This trend has now been reversed as companies have 
begun to respond to the phase-out of MCF under the stratospheric ozone protection provisions 
of the Clean Air Act. 

This section examines substitutes that can be used in place of MCF in this sector, and 
presents the Agency's proposed decisions and supporting analysis on acceptability of these 
substitutes. These determinations are summarized in appendix B at the end of the sector 
discussions. 

Of the three uses for MCF in this sector, use of MCF is largest in the adhesives 
subsector. In 1989, manufacturers of adhesives consumed about 28,000 metric tons (MT) of 
MCF in their formulations, roughly nine percent of the total MCF produced in the U.S. 
(HSIA, 1991). Solvent-based adhesive formulations constitute 15 percent of all adhesive 
types. MCF is desirable as a solvent for adhesives because it evaporates rapidly, is 
nonflammable, exhibits a relatively high PEL, performs comparably to VOC-formulated 
products, and does not photochemically degrade in the lower atmosphere. The 1991 
consumption of methyl chloroform as a solvent in the adhesives sector was estimated to be 
32,000 MT. EPA believes that this consumption has declined since 1991 due to increased 
excise taxes, the CFC labeling requirement of the CAA and the increasing awareness of the 
pending 1996 phaseout. 

MCF is used in five adhesive types: 

 Laminate adhesives; 
 Flexible foam adhesives; 
 Hardwood floor adhesives; 
 Metal to rubber adhesives; and

 Tire patch adhesives. 
MCF is no longer commonly used in the following adhesive applications where its use 
was once widespread: 
 Pressure sensitive adhesives (tapes, labels, etc.); 
 Flexible packaging adhesives; 
 Aerosol-propelled adhesives; and 
 Shoe repair glues and other consumer adhesives. 
In manufacture of coatings and inks, MCF usage rose steadily throughout the 1980s 
principally because of the VOC problems with other solvents. It began declining in the early 
1990s because of the ozone depletion issue. In 1989, the consumption of MCF used in 
coatings and inks was 18,480 MT, six percent of the total 310,000 MT of MCF consumed in 
the U.S. The 1991 consumption in the coatings and inks sector was estimated to be 23,000 
MT. This consumption figure has likely declined even more for the same reasons as cited in 
the adhesives section. MCF is the only ozone-depleting substance currently used in coatings 
and inks formulations. As with uses in adhesives, MCF has replaced some of the applications 
in coatings and inks which previously used VOC solvents and now the trend is reversing. 
The current use of MCF in coatings and inks applications occurs in four use areas: 
 Flexographic and rotogravure printing inks; 
 Wood stains; 
 Metal coatings; and 
 Aerospace coatings. 


2. Substitutes in the Adhesives, Coatings, and Inks Sector 


Methyl chloroform-based adhesives, coatings, and inks can be replaced by either 
substitute solvents or alternative application technologies. In most instances, the alternatives 
are expected to perform as well as products containing MCF. Factors that determine which 
particular alternative is best in a given situation include physical and chemical properties, 
replacement chemical costs, capital investment costs, and product performance. 
The primary substitutes to replace methyl chloroform in adhesives, coatings, and inks 
include: 
 Petroleum hydrocarbons; 
 Oxygenated organic solvents 
(ketones, esters, ethers, alcohols); 
 Chlorinated solvents; 
 Terpenes; 
 Water-based formulations; 
 High-solids formulation; and 
 Alternative process alternatives; 


_Powder formulations;
_Hot melts;
_Thermoplastic plasma spray coatings;
_Radiation cured;
_Moisture cured;
_Chemical cured;
_Reactive liquids. 


These substitutes can be grouped into four basic categories: Solvent substitutes, water-based formulations, high-solids
formulations, and alternative processes. 
a. 

Solvent substitutes. 

Petroleum hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons fractionated from the distillation of 
petroleum. These compounds are loosely grouped into paraffins (six carbon chains to ten 
carbon chains_hexane, heptane, etc.) and light aromatics (toluene and xylene), and come in 
various levels of purity. These compounds have good solvent properties, cost about half as 
much as MCF, and are readily available from chemical distributors. 
Oxygenated organic solvents such as alcohols, ketones, ethers, and esters dissolve a 
wide range of polar and semi-polar substances. These compounds are relatively inexpensive 
compared to MCF (about half the cost) and are readily available. They function well as 
solvents and dissolve most resins and binders used in adhesives, coatings, and inks. 
Chlorinated solvents such as perchloroethylene and methylene chloride are chlorinated 
hydrocarbons. These chemicals can be used to replace MCF used in adhesives, coatings and 
inks. These solvents are commercially available from chemical distributors at prices 
comparable to those for methyl chloroform. 
Chlorinated solvent compounds are chemically similar to MCF and thus are able to 
substitute directly for MCF with minor changes in the formulation of the product; product 
quality is expected to remain unchanged. Manufacturers can use chlorinated solvents in 
existing equipment with minor changes, resulting in low capital costs.

<TEXT>
 

Terpenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons based on isoprene subunits. They have good 
solvent properties and could replace MCF in some coating and ink products. Terpenes, such 
as d-limonene, cost about seven times more than MCF, and are commercially available from 
chemical distributors. Manufacturers can use terpenes in existing equipment with minor 
changes. 
Monochlorotoluene and chlorobenzotrifluorides are also of commercial interest as 
solvent substitutes for adhesives, coatings, and inks. These compounds can be used either in 
isolation or in various mixtures, depending on desired chemical properties. The Agency 
recently received information on these formulations, and will issue a SNAP determination for 
these substitutes in the next set of listing decisions. 
b. 

Water-based formulations.

 
Water-based coatings contain water rather than conventional solvents. Primary uses of 
these coatings include coating of furniture, aluminum siding, hardboard, metal containers, 
appliances, structural steel, and heavy equipment. Water-based coatings are priced roughly 20 
to 30 percent more than methyl chloroform-based coatings. 
Water-based inks use water and other co-solvents such as alcohols and alkyl acetates 
to dissolve resins, binders, and pigments instead of conventional solvents. Water-based inks 
accounted for 55 percent of the flexographic inks and 15 percent of the gravure inks used in 
the U.S. in 1987. Water-based inks are priced roughly 10 percent less than methyl 
chloroform-based inks. 
Water-based adhesives currently account for about 45 percent of the world adhesive 
market. Water-based adhesives will likely dominate the market to replace MCF in general 
consumer uses and in areas where a rigid bond is not needed. Water-based adhesives_especially water-based latexes,
which are stable dispersions of solid polymeric material in an 
essentially aqueous medium_can effectively replace MCF use in the flexible foams sector 
because of the flexibility of the bond they provide. Water-based latex adhesives have the 
potential to penetrate 85-90 percent of the MCF-based adhesive market in flexible foams 
applications. They still pose some problems, however, including: 
 Long set and dry times; newer developments seem to be solving this problem; 
 Deterioration during storage especially if frozen; and 
 The production of bacteria-contaminated waste water. 
Water-based replacements have not proven effective in binding high density laminates or hardwood flooring principally
because moisture enhances the chances of warping. In cases where MCF is used for door assemblies or sealants, water-based
urethane adhesives containing polyisocyanates can be used. 
c. 

High-solid formulations.

 
High-solids coatings resemble conventional coatings in appearance and use, except 
high-solids coatings contain less solvent and a greater percentage of resin. High-solids 
coatings are currently used on appliances, metal furniture, and farm and road construction 
equipment. High-solids coatings are priced 20 to 30 percent higher than methyl chloroform-based coatings, yet the
buyer receives more usable paint because the coatings contain less 
solvent, thus reducing the volume of coatings required. 
High-solids adhesives can reduce the amount of solvent used in adhesives by 
increasing the percentage of solids in the formulation. Adhesives formerly containing 30-50 
percent solids contain about 80 percent solids after reformulation. High-solids adhesives 
have good performance characteristics, including initial bond strength, and can be applied 
using existing equipment at normal line speeds with minimal modification. For bonding 
rubber assemblies, high solid adhesive films are often too thick, resulting in limited versatility 
and generally poor performance. High-solids formulations, however, are already used widely 
in the flexible foams, hardwood flooring, and high-pressure laminates industries. The solvent 
of choice in these industries remains MCF, but with a decreased portion of solvent in the 
formulations, so that less solvent is consumed overall. High-solids formulations are only a 
transitional replacement until adequate substitutes are found that do not contain MCF. 
d. 

Alternative process substitutes.

 
Powder adhesives, the first category of alternative process substitutes, are composed of 
one-part epoxies, urethanes, and natural resins. These adhesives are often supplied as 
powders that require heat to cure. They are generally applied in one of three ways: (1) By 
sifting the powder onto preheated substrates, (2) by dipping a preheated substrate into the 
powder, and (3) by melting the powder into a paste or liquid and applying it by conventional 
means. Since high temperatures are required to activate and thermoset powder adhesives, 
their ability to replace MCF-based formulations will depend on the characteristics of the 
substrates being bonded: If the materials being bonded are heat sensitive, heat-activated 
powder adhesives cannot be used. 
Powder coatings have no solvent, containing only resins and pigments in powder form. 
Typically, the powder is electrostatically applied and the coated object is heated above the 
powder's melting point, so that the resin fuses into a continuous film. Powder coating is a 
mature technology and is used on various types of metal products such as appliances, concrete 
reinforced bars, automobiles, steel shelving, lawn and farm equipment, and some furniture. 
The elevated temperatures necessary to melt the coatings, however, restrict the use of powder 
coatings on plastic and wood products. Powder coatings are priced comparably to methyl 
chloroform-based coatings. 
Hot melt adhesives are 100 percent solid thermoplastic binders that can be used to 
replace MCF formulations in applications that require a rigid bond. Hot melts currently 
account for about 20 percent of the adhesives market, and they, along with water-based 
adhesives, will likely benefit most from the move away from MCF-based adhesive 
formulations. Hot melts are now used instead of MCF formulations in laminating 
applications, especially those involving the lamination of flexible foam products. They can 
also replace MCF-based adhesive formulations in the original equipment manufacturer's 
(OEM) production of high-pressure laminates and possibly in the installation of hardwood 
flooring. The potential ability of hot melt adhesives to replace MCF-based formulations in 
the flexible foams sector is limited to 10-15 percent penetration because of the need for 
flexible bonds in most furniture and bedding applications. 
Thermoplastic plasma spray coatings are powder coatings that melt in transit towards 
the object to be coated propelled by a pressurized inert gas, such as Argon. An electric arc 
strips electrons from the plastic particles fusing them together as they move through the 
applicator gun. Thermoplastic plasma spray coatings can be used to coat large and small 
objects of metal, wood, plastic, or fiberglass.

Radiation curing is a production technique for drying and curing adhesives with 
radiant energy in the form of ultraviolet (UV) or infrared (IR) light, electron beams (EB), and 
gamma or x-rays. The binding agents that can be cured with radiant energy are acrylics, 
epoxies, urethanes, anaerobic adhesives, and polyester resins. In many cases, if the materials 
are either heat sensitive or opaque, radiation curing cannot be employed. 

Radiation-dried coatings are applied as either a powder or as a high-solids form and 
dried using the same radiant energy forms as used in radiation-cured adhesives. The binder 
systems that can be dried with radiant energy are also similar. In cases where the radiant 
energy is harmful to a component, such as sensitive electronic equipment, radiant-dried 
coating cannot be employed. 

Moisture-cured, chemical-cured, and reactive liquid adhesives are still not widely used 
because they are still being developed or because performance or application problems still 
have to be addressed. They will not be widely commercially available for several years. 



3. Comment Response 



a. 

Acceptable substitutes. 


It was suggested that the acceptable substitutes cited for MCF could also be extended 
to other ozone-depleting solvents, such as CFC-113. Depending on the specific application, 
EPA believes that it is probable that the same substitutes would apply and has addressed such 
substitutes as appropriate. 

Another commenter noted that some terminology was inconsistent and should be 
clarified. The use of the collective term ``organic solvent'' when describing alcohols, ketones 
and esters was cited. EPA agrees and believes that ``Oxygenated organic solvent'' is more 
specific. This phrase was substituted in the final rule. 

b. 

Unacceptable substitutes_no comments received. 


c. 

Pending substitutes. 


One commenter suggested that other chlorinated solvents, glycol ethers, glycol ether 
acetates and N-methyl pyrollidone be forbidden as substitutes. EPA believes that when used 
as directed and within the specified controls, these substances are safe alternative processes. 

d. 

Other related issues_

One commenter stated that ``coatings'' needs to 
be clarified to mean paint type coatings and not other coatings such as lubricants and mold 
releases. The phrase coatings is defined in the overview section to mean durable and 
decorative coatings such as paint to clarify this application. 

4. Preliminary Listing Decisions 

a. 

Acceptable substitutes. 


(1) Solvent substitutes. 
(a) Petroleum distillates. 
Petroleum hydrocarbons are acceptable substitutes for MCF in adhesives, coatings, and 
inks. The principal concern with these substitutes is over risk to workers during manufacture 
and use of the alternative solvent. However, the Agency's analysis of these alternatives 
indicated that risks from use of petroleum hydrocarbons are well understood and already 
subject to necessary controls. For instance, although these solvents are flammable, industry 
has a good record of safe use of these substitutes. Additionally, certain of the petroleum 
hydrocarbons, for example n-hexane, have low Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs), but the 
Agency's survey of exposures in the workplace found that these levels can successfully be 
attained if adequate ventilation and appropriate work practices are implemented. 

The Agency's analysis of the potential for risks to residents in nearby communities did 
indicate the potential for adverse effects near a site with industrial use of petroleum 
hydrocarbons if a relatively toxic petroleum hydrocarbon is used. However, the Agency does 
not believe that the risk screen describes the true risk presented by these chemicals. First, the 
agency has determined that petroleum hydrocarbons used in this sector are rarely as toxic as 
n-hexane. Second, the screen used as past MCF emissions as a proxy for emissions of n-hexane. This approach does not
account for other regulatory controls, such as VOC controls, 
that limit emissions of hydrocarbons from industrial sites, and would consequently also serve 
to lower any other health risks to the general population from these chemicals. 

For this reason, the Agency believes that petroleum hydrocarbons merit use as 
substitutes, although it encourages manufacturers to formulate products where possible with 
compounds with lowest inherent toxicity. 

(b) Alcohols, ketones, ethers and esters. 
Alcohols, ketones, ethers and esters are acceptable substitutes for MCF in adhesives, 
coatings, and inks. The concerns for use of these solvents parallel the concerns associated 
with petroleum hydrocarbons. In this case, two of the typical oxygenated hydrocarbons 
examined in the Agency's risk screen, methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone, also 
have comparatively low toxicity. For the same reasons described in the section on petroleum 
distillates, the Agency is approving these compounds as substitutes for MCF. This approval 
also includes the same guidance to manufacturers_to select chemicals for product 
formulations with lowest inherent toxicity. 

(c) Chlorinated solvents. 
Perchloroethylene, methylene chloride and trichloroethylene are acceptable substitutes 
for adhesives, coatings, and inks. Use of these solvents merit special caution, since they are 
suspected human carcinogens. However, as with other solvents, the Agency's risk screen 
indicates that proper workplace practices significantly reduce risks in occupational settings. 
The Agency's examination of risks to the general population determined the highest potential 
for adverse effects to be associated with use of trichloroethylene, since it has the greatest 
cancer potency. Clearly there is a need for further assessment of the hazards from use of this 
chemical, and the Agency notes that authorities exist to address any risks determined from 
such analyses under Title III of the Clean Air Act. Title III lists all three of the chlorinated 
solvents as Hazardous Air Pollutants, and mandates development of Maximum Achievable 
Control Technology standards to control emissions of these chemicals in various industrial 
settings.

<TEXT>
 

(d) Terpenes. 
Terpenes are acceptable substitutes for MCF in adhesives, coatings, and inks. The 
principal environmental concern with terpenes is their toxicity to aquatic life. In applications 
for terpenes in adhesives, coatings, and inks, however, the terpenes are both used and bound 
in the product formulation, meaning that there are no discharges of wastewater effluent that 
could present a risk. Other potential environmental hazards associated with these compounds 
arise from their flammability and unpleasant odors, but these can be controlled by good 
workplace practices. 

(2) Water-based formulations/high-solid. 
Formulations. 
Water-based formulations and high-solid formulations are acceptable substitutes for 
MCF in adhesives, coatings, and inks. The Agency did not identify any environmental or 
health concerns associated with use of these products. These formulations do contain small 
amounts of VOCs, but the increase in VOC loadings from these products is expected to be 
extremely small in comparison to VOC contributions from other sources. 

(3) Alternative processes. 
Alternative processes, including powder formulations, hot melt, thermoplastic plasma 
spray, radiation-based formulations, and moisture-cured, chemical-cured, and reactive liquid 
alternatives, are all acceptable substitutes for MCF in adhesives, coatings, and inks. The 
Agency did not identify any health or environmental concerns associated with use of these 
substitutes. Since this grouping includes such a wide variety of products for which it is 
difficult to complete an in-depth risk screen, the Agency solicits additional detail on any 
potential environmental or health effects that merit further investigation. 



X. Additional Information 



A. Executive Order 12866 



Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) The Agency must 
determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review 
and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory 
action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect 
in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, 
jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or 
communitites; 

(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or 
planned by another agency; 

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan 
programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or 

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's 
priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. 

It has been determined that this is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of 
Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-602, requires that federal agencies 
examine the effects of their regulations on small entities. Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), whenever 
an agency is required to publish a final rule-making, it must prepare a regulatory flexibility 
analysis (RFA). Such an analysis is not required if the head of the Agency certifies that a 
rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities, 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b). 

The Agency believes that this final rule will not have a significant effect on a 
substantial number of small entities and has therefore concluded that a formal RFA is 
unnecessary. Because costs of the SNAP requirements as a whole are expected to be minor, 
the rule is unlikely to adversely affect small businesses, particularly as the rule exempts small 
sectors and end-uses from reporting requirements and formal Agency review. In fact, to the 
extent that information gathering is more expensive and time-consuming for small companies, 
this rule may well provide benefits for small businesses anxious to examine potential 
substitutes to any ozone-depleting class I and II substances they may be using, by requiring 
manufacturers to make information on such substitutes available. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The information collection requirements in this rule have been approved by the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et 
seq. 

and have been assigned control number 2060-0226. 

This collection of information has an estimated reporting burden averaging 166 hours 
per response and an estimated annual recordkeeping burden averaging 25 hours per 
recordkeeper. These estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data 
sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the 
collection of information. 

Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of 
information, including suggestions for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy 
Branch; EPA; 401 M Street, SW., (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office 
of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 
20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''

Data Confidentiality Claims 



Data Confidentiality Claims 



1. 

Special Requirements for Submitting Data to the Docket

 



Data submissions must be provided in three copies. If information is claimed as confidential, all CBI must be deleted
from the third copy which will become part of the public docket. If no claims of confidentiality are made for the submission,
the third copy should be identical to the other two. When portions of the submission are claimed as CBI, the first two
copies will include the CBI material as provided in section V of this notice, which shall be deleted from the third copy.
For the third copy, the following special preparation is required: 





_Remove the ``Supplemental Statement of Data Confidentiality Claims.'' 
_Excise from the body of the study any information you claim as confidential. Replace with generic information if
it is available. 
_Mark the third copy plainly on both its cover and its title page with the phrase ``Public Docket Material_contains
no information claimed as confidential.'' 



2. Supplemental Statement of Data Confidentiality Claims 



For any portion of a submission that is claimed as confidential, the following information must be included within
a Supplementary Statement of Data Confidentiality Claims: 




_Identify specifically by page and line number(s) each portion of the study for which you claim confidentiality.

_Give the reasons why the cited passage qualifies for confidential treatment. 
_Indicate the length of time_until a specific date or event, or permanently_for which the information should be treated
as confidential. 
_Identify the measures taken to guard against undesired disclosure of this 
information. 
_Describe the extent to which the information has been disclosed, and what 
precautions have been taken in connection with these disclosures. 
_Enclose copies of any determinations of confidentiality made by EPA, other Federal agencies, or courts concerning
this information. 
_If you assert that disclosure of this information would be likely to result in substantial harmful effects to you,
describe those harmful effects and explain why they should be viewed as substantial. 
_If you assert that the information is voluntarily submitted, indicate whether you believe disclosure of this information
might tend to lessen the availability to EPA of similar information in the future, and if so, how. 




If required substantiation is not provided along with the submission of information claimed as confidential, EPA
may make the complete submitted information available to the public without further notice to the submitter.

Appendix A to subpart G_

Substitutes Subject to Use Restrictions and Unacceptable Substitutes 



Subpart G_Significant New Alternatives Policy Program 



 82.170 

Purpose and scope. 



(a) The purpose of these regulations in this subpart is to implement section 612 of the Clean Air Act, as amended, regarding
the safe alternatives policy on the acceptability of substitutes for ozone-depleting compounds. This program will
henceforth be referred to as the ``Significant New Alternatives Policy'' (SNAP) program. The objectives of this
program are to identify substitutes for ozone-depleting compounds, to evaluate the acceptability of those substitutes,
to promote the use of those substitutes believed to present lower overall risks to human health and the environment,
relative to the class I and class II compounds being replaced, as well as to other substitutes for the same end-use,
and to prohibit the use of those substitutes found, based on the same comparisons, to increase overall risks. 


(b) The regulations in this subpart describe persons and substitutes subject to reporting requirements under the
SNAP program and explain preparation and submission of notices and petitions on substitutes. The regulations also
establish Agency procedures for reviewing and processing EPA's determinations regarding notices and petitions
on substitutes. Finally, the regulations prohibit the use of alternatives which EPA has determined may have adverse
effects on human health or the environment where EPA has identified alternatives in particular industrial use sectors
that on an overall basis, reduce risk to human health and the environment and are currently or potentially available.
EPA will only prohibit substitutes where it has identified other substitutes for a specific application that are
acceptable and are currently or potentially available. 

(c) Notifications, petitions and other materials requested shall be sent to: SNAP Document Control Officer, U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (6205-J), 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460.

competitive situation. Testing must be restricted to a defined testing period before the 
broader distribution of that substitute in interstate commerce. 


Use

 means any use of a substitute for a Class I or Class II ozone-depleting compound, 
including but not limited to use in a manufacturing process or product, in consumption by the 
end-user, or in intermediate uses, such as formulation or packaging for other subsequent uses. 


Use Restrictions

 means restrictions on the use of a substitute imposing either 
conditions on how the substitute can be used across a sector end-use or limits on the end-uses 
or specific applications where it can be used within a sector. 


 82.174 

Prohibitions. 


(a) No person may introduce a new substitute into interstate commerce before the 
expiration of 90 days after a notice is initially submitted to EPA under  82.176(a). 
(b) No person may use a substitute which a person knows or has reason to know 
was manufactured, processed or imported in violation of the regulations in this subpart, or 
knows or has reason to know was manufactured, processed or imported in violation of any 
use restriction in the acceptability determination, after the effective date of any rulemaking 
imposing such restrictions. 
(c) No person may use a substitute without adhering to any use restrictions set by 
the acceptability decision, after the effective date of any rulemaking imposing such 
restrictions. 
(d) No person may use a substitute after the effective date of any rulemaking 
adding such substitute to the list of unacceptable substitutes. 


 82.176 

Applicability. 


(a) Any producer of a new substitute must submit a notice of intent to introduce a 
substitute into interstate commerce 90 days prior to such introduction. Any producer of an 
existing substitute already in interstate commerce must submit a notice as of July 18, 1994 if such substitute has
not already been reviewed and approved 
by the Agency. 
(b) With respect to the following substitutes, producers are exempt from 
notification requirements: (1) 

Substitutes already listed as acceptable.

 Producers need not submit 
notices on substitutes that are already listed as acceptable under SNAP. 
(2) 

Small sectors.

 Persons using substitutes in sectors other than the nine 
principal sectors reviewed under this program are exempt from the notification requirements. 
This exemption shall not be construed to nullify an unacceptability determination or to allow 
use of an otherwise unacceptable substitute. 
(3) 

Small volume use within SNAP sectors.

 Within the nine principal 
SNAP sectors, persons introducing a substitute whose expected volume of use amounts to less 
than 10,000 lbs. per year within a SNAP sector are exempt from notification requirements. 
This exemption shall not be construed to allow use of an otherwise unacceptable substitute in 
any quantity. Persons taking advantage of this exemption for small uses must maintain 
documentation for each substitute describing how the substitute meets this small use 
definition. This documentation must include annual production and sales information by 
sector. 
(4) 

Research and development.

 Production of substitutes for the sole 
purpose of research and development is exempt from reporting requirements. 
(5) 

Test marketing.

 Use of substitutes for the sole purpose of test 
marketing is exempt from SNAP notification requirements until 90 days prior to the 
introduction of such substitutes for full-scale commercial sale in interstate commerce. 
Persons taking advantage of this exemption are, however, required to notify the Agency in 
writing that they are conducting test marketing 30 days prior to the commencement of such 
marketing. Notification shall include the name of the substitute, the volume used in the test 
marketing, intended sector end-uses, and expected duration of the test marketing period. 
(6) 

Formulation changes.

 In cases where replacement of class I or II 
compounds causes formulators to change other components in a product, formulators are 
exempt from reporting with respect to these auxiliary formulation changes. However, the 
SNAP submitter is required to notify the Agency if such changes are expected to significantly 
increase the environmental and human health risk associated with the use of any class I or 
class II substitute. 
(7) 

Substitutes used as feedstocks.

 Producers of substitutes used as 
feedstocks which are largely or entirely consumed, transformed or destroyed in the 
manufacturing or use process are exempt from reporting requirements concerning such 
substitutes. 
(c) Use of a substitute in the possession of an end-user as of March 18, 1994 listed as unacceptable or acceptable subject
to narrowed use limits may continue until the 
individual end-users' existing supply, as of that date, of the substitute is exhausted. Use of 
substitutes purchased after March 18, 1994 is not permitted subsequent to April 18, 1994.

 82.178 



Information required to be submitted. 



(a) Persons whose substitutes are subject to reporting requirements pursuant to  82.176 must provide the following
information: 


(1) 

Name and description of the substitute. 

The substitute should be identified by its: Chemical name; trade name(s); identification numbers; chemical formula;
and chemical structure. 

(2) 

Physical and chemical information. 

The substitute should be characterized by its key properties including but not limited to: Molecular weight; physical
state; melting point; boiling point; density; taste and/or odor threshold; solubility; partition coefficients
(Log K

ow

, Log K

oc

); atmospheric lifetime and vapor pressure. 

(3) 

Substitute applications. 

Identification of the applications within each sector end-use in which the substitutes are likely to be used. 

(4) 

Process description. 

For each application identified, descriptive data on processing, including in-place pollution controls. 

(5) 

Ozone depletion potential. 

The predicted 100-year ozone depletion potential (ODP) of substitute chemicals. The submitter must also provide
supporting documentation or references. 

(6) 

Global warming impacts. 

Data on the total global warming potential of the substitute, including information on the GWP index and the indirect
contributions to global warming caused by the production or use of the substitute (e.g., changes in energy efficiency).
GWP must be calculated over a 100, 500 and 1000-year integrated time horizon. 

(7) 

Toxicity data. 

Health and safety studies on the effects of a substitute, its components, its impurities, and its degradation products
on any organism (e.g., humans, mammals, fish, wildlife, and plants). For tests on mammals, the Agency requires a minimum
submission of the following tests to characterize substitute risks: A range-finding study that considers the appropriate
exposure pathway for the specific use (e.g., oral ingestion, inhalation, etc.), and a 90-day subchronic repeated
dose study in an appropriate rodent species. For certain substitutes, a cardiotoxicity study is also required. Additional
mammalian toxicity tests may be identified based on the substitute and application in question. To sufficiently
characterize aquatic toxicity concerns, both acute and chronic toxicity data for a variety of species are required.
For this purpose, the Agency requires a minimum data set as described in ``Guidelines for Deriving Numerical National
Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Aquatic Organisms and their Uses,'' which is available through the National
Technical Information Service (

#

PB 85-227049). Other relevant information and data summaries, such as the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS),
should also be submitted. To assist in locating any studies previously submitted to EPA and referred to, but not included
in a SNAP submission, the submitter must provide citations for the date, type of submission, and EPA Office to which
they were submitted, to help EPA locate these quickly. 

(8) 

Environmental Fate and Transport. 

Where available, information must be submitted on the environmental fate and transport of substitutes. Such data
shall include information on bioaccumulation, biodegradation, adsorption, volatility, transformation, and
other data necessary to characterize movement and reaction of substitutes in the environment. 

(9) 

Flammability. 

Data on the flammability of a substitute chemical or mixture are required. Specifically, the flash point and flammability
limits are needed, as well as information on the procedures used for determining the flammability limits. Testing
of blends should identify the compositions for which the blend itself is flammable and include fractionation data
on changes in the composition of the blend during various leak scenarios. For substitutes that will be used in consumer
applications, documentation of testing results conducted by independent laboratories should be submitted, where
available. If a substitute is flammable, the submitter must analyze the risk of fire resulting from the use of such
a substitute and assess the effectiveness of measures to minimize such risk. 

(10) 

Exposure data. 

Available modeling or monitoring data on exposures associated with the manufacture, formulation, transport, use
and disposal of a substitute. Descriptive process information for each substitute application, as described above,
will be used to develop exposure estimates where exposure data are not readily available. Depending on the application,
exposure profiles may be needed for workers, consumers, and the general population. 

(11) 

Environmental release data. 

Data on emissions from the substitute application and equipment, as well as on pollutant releases or discharge to
all environmental media. Submitters should provide information on release locations, and data on the quantities,
including volume, of anticipated waste associated with the use of the substitute. In addition, information on anticipated
waste management practices associated with the use of the substitute. Any available information on any pollution
controls used or that could be used in association with the substitute (e.g., emissions reduction technologies,
wastewater treatment, treatment of hazardous waste) and the costs of such technology must also be submitted. 

(12) 

Replacement ratio for a chemical substitute. 

Information on the replacement ratio for a chemical substitute versus the class I or II substances being replaced.
The term ``replacement ratio'' means how much of a substitute must be used to replace a given quantity of the class I
or II substance being replaced. 

(13) 

Required changes in use technology. 

Detail on the changes in technology needed to use the alternative. Such information should include a description
of whether the substitute can be used in existing equipment_with or without some retrofit_or only in new equipment.
Data on the cost (capital and operating expenditures) and estimated life of any technology modifications should
also be submitted. 

(14) 

Cost of substitute. 

Data on the expected average cost of the alternative. In addition, information is needed on the expected equipment
lifetime for an alternative technology. Other critical cost considerations should be identified, as appropriate.


(15) 

Availability of substitute. 

If the substitute is not currently available, the timing of availability of a substitute should be provided. 

(16) 

Anticipated market share. 

Data on the anticipated near-term and long-term nationwide substitute sales. 

(17) 

Applicable regulations under other environmental statutes. 

Information on whether the substitute is regulated under other statutory authorities, in particular the Clean Water
Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
Rodenticide Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, or other titles under the Clean Air Act. 

(18) 

Information already submitted to the Agency. 

Information requested in the SNAP program notice that has been previously submitted to the Agency as part of past regulatory
and information-gathering activities may be referenced rather than resubmitted. Submitters who cannot provide
accurate references to data sent previously to the Agency should include all requested information in the SNAP notice.


(19) 

Information already available in the literature. 

If any of the data needed to complete the SNAP program notice are available in the public literature, complete references
for such information should be provided.

(b) The Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) Information Notice is designed to provide the Agency with the
information necessary to reach a decision on the acceptability of a substitute. (1) Submitters requesting review
under the SNAP program should send the completed SNAP notice to: SNAP Document Control Officer, U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (6205-J), 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. 

(2) Submitters filing jointly under SNAP and the Premanufacture Notice Program (PMN) should send the SNAP addendum
along with the PMN form to: PMN Document Control Officer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (7407), 401 M Street,
SW., Washington, DC 20460. Submitters must also send both documents to the SNAP program, with a reference to indicate
the notice has been furnished to the Agency under the PMN program. Submitters providing information on new chemicals
for joint review under the TSCA and SNAP programs may be required to supply additional toxicity data under TSCA section
5. 

(3) Submitters filing jointly under SNAP and under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act should
send the SNAP form to the Office of Pesticide Programs, Registration Division, (7505C) 401 M Street, SW., Washington,
DC, 20460, as well as to the SNAP Document Control Officer. 



 82.180 



Agency review of SNAP submissions. 



(a) 

Processing of SNAP notices. 

(1) 

90-day review process. 

The 90-day review process will begin once EPA receives a submission and determines that such submission includes
data on the substitute that are complete and adequate, as described in  82.178. The Agency may suspend or extend
the review period to allow for submission of additional data needed to complete the review of the notice. 

(2) 

Initial review of notice. 

The SNAP Document Control Officer will review the notice to ensure that basic information necessary to process the
submission is present (i.e., name of company, identification of substitute, etc.). The SNAP Document Control Officer
will also review substantiation of any claim of confidentiality. 

(3) 

Determination of data adequacy. 

Upon receipt of the SNAP submission, the Agency will review the completeness of the information supporting the application.
If additional data are needed, the submitter will be contacted following completion of this review. The 90-day review
period will not commence until EPA has received data it judges adequate to support analysis of the submission. 

(4) 

Letter of receipt. 

The SNAP Document Control Officer will send a letter of receipt to the submitter to confirm the date of notification
and the beginning of EPA's 90-day review period. The SNAP Document Control Officer will also assign the SNAP notice
a tracking number, which will be identified in the letter of receipt. 

(5) 

Availability of new information during review period. 

If critical new information becomes available during the review period that may influence the Agency's evaluation
of a substitute, the submitter must notify the Agency about the existence of such information within 10 days of learning
of such data. The submitter must also inform the Agency of new studies underway, even if the results will not be available
within the 90-day review period. The Agency may contact the submitter to explore extending or suspending the review
period depending on the type of information received and the stage of review. 

(6) 

Completion of detailed review. 

Once the initial data review, described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section, has been completed, the Agency
will complete a detailed evaluation of the notice. If during any time the Agency perceives a lack of information necessary
to reach a SNAP determination, it will contact the submitter and request the missing data. 

(7) 

Criteria for review. 

To determine whether a substitute is acceptable or unacceptable as a replacement for class I or II compounds, the Agency
will evaluate: 

(i) Atmospheric effects and related health and environmental impacts; 

(ii) General population risks from ambient exposure to compounds with direct toxicity and to increased ground-level
ozone; 

(iii) Ecosystem risks; 

(iv) Occupational risks; 

(v) Consumer risks; 

(vi) Flammability; and 

(vii) Cost and availability of the substitute. 

(8) 

Communication of decision. 

(i) 

Communication of decision to the submitter. 

Once the SNAP program review has been completed, the Agency will notify the submitter in writing of the decision. Sale
or manufacture of new substitutes may commence after the initial 90-day notification period expires even if the Agency
fails to reach a decision within the 90-day review period or fails to communicate that decision or the need for additional
data to the submitter. Sale or manufacture of existing substitutes may continue throughout the Agency's 90-day review.


(ii) 

Communication of Decision to the Public. 

The Agency will publish in the 

Federal Register

 on a quarterly basis a complete list of the acceptable and unacceptable alternatives that have been reviewed to date.
In the case of substitutes proposed as acceptable with use restrictions, proposed as unacceptable or proposed for
removal from either list, a rulemaking process will ensue. Upon completion of such rulemaking, EPA will publish revised
lists of substitutes acceptable subject to use conditions or narrowed use limits and unacceptable substitutes to
be incorporated into the Code of Federal Regulations. (See appendix A of this subpart.) 

(b) 

Types of listing decisions. 

When reviewing substitutes, the Agency will list substitutes in one of five categories: 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940318-0-00232 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940318-0-00023 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) 

Acceptable. 

Where the Agency has reviewed a substitute and found no 
reason to prohibit its use, it will list the alternative as acceptable for the end-uses listed in the 
notice. 
(2) 

Acceptable subject to use conditions. 

After reviewing a notice, the 
Agency may make a determination that a substitute is acceptable only if conditions of use are 
met to minimize risks to human health and the environment. Where users intending to adopt 
a substitute acceptable subject to use conditions must make reasonable efforts to ascertain that 
other alternatives are not feasible due to safety, performance or technical reasons, 
documentation of this assessment must be retained on file for the purpose of demonstrating 
compliance. This documentation shall include descriptions of substitutes examined and 
rejected, processes or products in which the substitute is needed, reason for rejection of other 
alternatives, e.g., performance, technical or safety standards. Use of such substitutes in ways 
that are inconsistent with such use conditions renders them unacceptable. 
(3) 

Acceptable subject to narrowed use limits. 

Even though the Agency 
can restrict the use of a substitute based on the potential for adverse effects, it may be 
necessary to permit a narrowed range of use within a sector end-use because of the lack of 
alternatives for specialized applications. Users intending to adopt a substitute acceptable with 
narrowed use limits must ascertain that other alternatives are not technically feasible. 
Companies must document the results of their evaluation, and retain the results on file for the 
purpose of demonstrating compliance. This documentation shall include descriptions of 
substitutes examined and rejected, processes or products in which the substitute is needed, 
reason for rejection of other alternatives, e.g., performance, technical or safety standards, and 
the anticipated date other substitutes will be available and projected time for switching to 
other available substitutes. Use of such substitutes in applications and end-uses which are not 
specified as acceptable in the narrowed use limit renders them unacceptable. 
(4) 

Unacceptable. 

This designation will apply to substitutes where the 
Agency's review indicates that the substitute poses risk of adverse effects to human health 
and the environment and that other alternatives exist that reduce overall risk. 
(5) 

Pending. 

Submissions for which the Agency has not reached a 
determination will be described as pending. For all substitutes in this category, the Agency 
will work with the submitter to obtain any missing information and to determine a schedule 
for providing the missing information if the Agency wishes to extend the 90-day review 
period. EPA will use the authority under section 114 of the Clean Air Act to gather this 
information, if necessary. In some instances, the Agency may also explore using additional 
statutory provisions (e.g., section 5 of TSCA) to collect the needed data. 
(c) 

Joint processing under SNAP and TSCA.

 The Agency will coordinate reviews 
of substitutes submitted for evaluation under both the TSCA PMN program and the CAA. 
(d) 

Joint processing under SNAP and FIFRA.

 The Agency will coordinate reviews 
of substitutes submitted for evaluation under both FIFRA and the CAA. 


 82.182 

Confidentiality of data. 


(a) 

Clean Air Act provisions. 

Anyone submitting information must assert a claim 
of confidentiality at the time of submission for any data they wish to have treated as 
confidential business information (CBI) under 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. Failure to assert a 
claim of confidentiality at the time of submission may result in disclosure of the information 
by the Agency without further notice to the submitter. The submitter should also be aware 
that under section 114(c), emissions data may not be claimed as confidential. 
(b) 

Substantiation of confidentiality claims. 

At the time of submission, EPA 
requires substantiation of any confidentiality claims made. Failure to provide any 
substantiation may result in disclosure of information without further notice by the Agency. 
All submissions must include adequate substantiation in order for an acceptability 
determination on a substitute to be published. Moreover, under 40 CFR part 2, subpart B, 
there are further instances in which confidentiality assertions may later be reviewed even 
when confidentiality claims are initially received. The submitter will also be contacted as 
part of such an evaluation process. 
(c) 

Confidentiality provisions for toxicity data. 

In the event that toxicity or 
health and safety studies are listed as confidential, this information cannot be maintained as 
confidential where such data are also submitted under TSCA or FIFRA, to the extent that 
confidential treatment is prohibited under those statutes. However, information contained in a 
toxicity study that is not health and safety data and is not relevant to the effects of a 
substance on human health and the environment (e.g., discussion of process information, 
proprietary blends) can be maintained as confidential subject to 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. 
(d) 

Joint submissions under other statutes.

 Information submitted as part of a 
joint submission to either SNAP/TSCA or SNAP/FIFRA must adhere to the security 
provisions of the program offices implementing these statutes. For such submissions, the 
SNAP handling of such notices will follow the security provisions under these statutes. 


 82.184 

Petitions. 


(a) 

Who may petition.

 Any person may petition the Agency to amend existing 
listing decisions under the SNAP program, or to add a new substance to any of the SNAP 
lists. 
(b) 

Types of petitions. 

Five types of petitions exist: (1) Petitions to add a substitute not previously reviewed under the SNAP 
program to the acceptable list. This type of petition is comparable to the 90-day notifications, 
except that it would generally be initiated by entities other than the companies that 
manufacture, formulate, or otherwise use the substitute. Companies that manufacture, 
formulate, or use substitutes that want to have their substitutes added to the acceptable list 
should submit information on the substitute under the 90-day review program; 
(2) Petitions to add a substitute not previously reviewed under the SNAP 
program to the unacceptable list;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940318-0-00233 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940318-0-00023 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) Petitions to delete a substitute from the acceptable list and add it to the 
unacceptable list or to delete a substitute from the unacceptable and add it to the acceptable 
list; 
(4) Petitions to add or delete use restrictions on an acceptability listing. 
(5) Petitions to grandfather use of a substitute listed as unacceptable or 
acceptable subject to use restrictions. 
(c) 

Content of the petition. 

The Agency requires that the petitioner submit 
information on the type of action requested and the rationale for the petition. Petitions in 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section must contain the information described in  82.178, 
which lists the items to be submitted in a 90-day notification. For petitions that request the 
re-examination of a substitute previously reviewed under the SNAP program, the submitter 
must also reference the prior submittal or existing listing. Petitions to grandfather use of an 
unacceptable substitute must describe the applicability of the test to judge the appropriateness 
of Agency grandfathering as established by the United States District Court for the District of 
Columbia Circuit (see 

Sierra Club 

v. 

EPA, 

719 F.2d 436 (D.C. Cir. 1983)). This test includes 
whether the new rule represents an abrupt departure from previously established practice, the 
extent to which a party relied on the previous rule, the degree of burden which application of 
the new rule would impose on the party, and the statutory interest in applying the new rule 
immediately. 
(d) 

Petition process. 

(1) Notification of Affected Companies. If the petition concerns a substitute 
previously either approved or restricted under the SNAP program, the Agency will contact the 
original submitter of that substitute. 
(2) 

Review for data adequacy. 

The Agency will review the petition for 
adequacy of data. As with a 90-day notice, the Agency may suspend review until the 
petitioner submits the information necessary to evaluate the petition. To reach a timely 
decision on substitutes, EPA may use collection authorities such as those contained in section 
114 of the Clean Air Act as amended, as well as information collection provisions of other 
environmental statutes. 
(3) 

Review procedures. 

To evaluate the petition, the Agency may submit 
the petition for review to appropriate experts inside and outside the Agency. 
(4) 

Timing of determinations. 

If data are adequate, as described in 
 82.180, the Agency will respond to the petition within 90 days of receiving a complete 
petition. If the petition is inadequately supported, the Agency will query the petitioner to fill 
any data gaps before the 90-day review period begins, or may deny the petition because data 
are inadequate. 
(5) 

Rulemaking procedures. 

EPA will initiate rulemaking whenever EPA 
grants a petition to add a substance to the list of unacceptable substitutes, remove a substance 
from any list, or change or create an acceptable listing by imposing or deleting use conditions 
or use limits. 
(6) 

Communication of decision. 

The Agency will inform petitioners within 
90 days of receiving a complete petition whether their request has been granted or denied. If 
a petition is denied, the Agency will publish in the 

Federal Register

 an explanation of the 
determination. If a petition is granted, the Agency will publish the revised SNAP list 
incorporating the final petition decision within 6 months of reaching a determination or in the 
next scheduled update, if sooner, provided any required rulemaking has been completed 
within the shorter period.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule establishes fees that EPA will collect annually to support its voluntary radon proficiency programs. The
rule requires individuals and organizations applying to or participating in the National Radon Measurement Proficiency
(RMP) or the National Radon Contractor Proficiency (RCP) programs to pay annual fees. Thirty days after publication
of the rule, primary measurement service organizations in the RMP must pay an annual fee of $375 per device entered
or listed in the RMP program. Secondary measurement service providers in the RMP must pay an annual fee of $75. Participants
in the individual proficiency component of the RMP program must pay an annual fee of $150. Participants in the RCP program
must pay an annual fee of $200. State and local governments are exempted from these fees under section 305 of the Toxic
Substances Control Act, 15 U.S.C. 2665. Fees for other proficiency program elements, such as training courses or
exams, may be proposed at a later date.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Authority




Section 305 of the Toxic Substances Control Act, 15 U.S.C. 2665, specifically, the Indoor Radon Abatement Act (IRAA)
of 1988, 15 U.S.C. 2661 

et seq.

, authorizes the Administrator of EPA to assess fees ``as may be necessary to defray the costs'' associated with operating
its radon proficiency programs. This rule establishes fees for two proficiency programs: The National Radon Measurement
Proficiency Program and the National Radon Contractor Proficiency Program. Fees for other proficiency program
elements, such as training courses or exams, may be proposed later. Fees are authorized to be deposited into a special
account in the United States Treasury with amounts in the account to be appropriated for administering these programs.
State and local governments are exempt from paying a fee to participate in the programs covered by this rule.

This rule is cross-referenced to title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) chapter I, subchapter R, part 700
that lists regulations promulgated under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Although the IRAA was enacted
as Title III of TSCA, this regulation is listed under subchapter F of the CFR because it deals solely with a radiation
program.



II. Background



Radon is a naturally occurring odorless, invisible radioactive gas. Radon comes from the radioactive decay of uranium.
Radon can be found in high concentrations in soils and rocks containing uranium, granite, shale, phosphate, and pitchblende.

EPA, the American Lung Association, the American Medical Association, and the U.S. Surgeon General have identified
radon as the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States. EPA estimates that between 7,000 to 30,000 lung
cancer deaths are attributable to exposure to radon in the U.S. each year. Homes with radon problems occur in every
State. EPA estimates that nearly 1 out of every 15 homes in the U.S. has elevated radon levels. 

EPA has developed proficiency programs to assist States in addressing the radon problem. These proficiency programs
are part of a comprehensive 
Agency program to address the radon problem nationwide. The IRAA directed EPA to develop voluntary proficiency programs
to evaluate the effectiveness of radon devices, organizations, and operators. EPA operates two major proficiency
programs to implement this directive: the Radon Measurement Proficiency Program and the Radon Contractor Proficiency
Program. These programs assist States and consumers in identifying capable radon service providers. The statute
also authorizes the collection of a user fee from applicants to each of these programs. 

EPA also established four Regional Radon Training Centers (RRTCs) authorized by the IRAA. These centers provide
a variety of radon training courses, some of which train individuals seeking to enter the radon measurement and mitigation
business. They also assist States by tailoring training programs to meet specific State needs. 

EPA issued a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

, 55 FR 50492 (December 6, 1990), to establish a fee of $1,000 for each primary device application to the RMP, $200 for
each secondary method application to the RMP, and $200 for each applicant for the RCP exam. The proposed rule also included
fees for EPA-provided training courses. The comment period for the proposed rule closed on February 4, 1991. About
100 comments were submitted to the Public Docket on the proposed rule. This preamble includes responses to significant
comments and indicates changes to the rule, where applicable, as the result of the public comments. Specific responses
to comments and changes to the rule are discussed in section IV to this preamble. 

The fees that the Agency is initially establishing pursuant to section 305 of the TSCA will recover less than the total
costs of administering the proficiency programs. For Fiscal Year (FY) 1992, total Agency costs to operate the radon
proficiency programs, including both direct and indirect costs, were estimated as $2.6 million. EPA expects similar
costs for fiscal year 1994. The Agency expects to collect about $830,000 during the first year that this rule is in effect.
EPA shall adjust the fees over the next five years to a level that will ultimately be sufficient to recover the full annual
costs of the proficiency programs. Fees may also be adjusted to account for inflation, changes in programs costs,
etc. EPA will evaluate the potential of its fee adjustments on the radon industry. 



A. Overview of the National Radon Measurement Proficiency (RMP) Program 


1. Overview of the RMP 


EPA established the RMP program in 1986 to assist States and the public in selecting qualified organizations to measure
indoor radon and radon decay products. Radon decay products are the radioactive isotope which follow radon-222 in
the decay chain, primarily polonium-218, lead-214, bismuth-214, and polonium-214. Measurement organizations
and each of their primary radon measurement devices are tested. Those organizations which meet the program's quality
assurance requirements are listed as successful participants in the ``National Radon Measurement Proficiency
(RMP) Program_National Proficiency Report.'' The RMP program is voluntary proficiency program. 

The program emphasizes evaluating the proficiency of organizations that provide radon measurement services and
providing the public with information on proficient radon measurement services organizations. The RMP program
also promotes the use of standard operating procedures and improved quality assurance and control among members
of the radon measurement community. 

Any individual or organization that provides indoor radon measurement services may apply to RMP program. The application
(EPA 520/1-91-008) and Radon Measurement Proficiency (RMP) Program Handbook (EPA 520/1-91-006)
may be obtained by calling the Radon Proficiency Program Information Service (RIS) at (205) 272-2797 or by FAX
at (205) 260-9051 or by writing to the Radon Proficiency Program Information Service, c/o Sanford Cohen and
Associates, Inc., 1418 I-85 Parkway, Montgomery, AL, 36016. EPA will accept first-time applications or application
amendments any time during the year. Organizations in the RMP program can be listed for two general types of radon measurement
service categorized as 

``primary'' or ``secondary.'' 

It is possible that organizations may be listed for both primary and secondary services. Participants who offer radon
measurement services that include the capability to analyze or read radon measurement devices are defined as ``primary''
for that device. Passage of a radon measurement performance test is required for a participant offering primary services
to become listed as proficient. The test requires that participants demonstrate their ability to analyze accurately
the level of radon to which their device was exposed and to report the correct result. Successful participants are
listed are proficient for a specific type of radon measurement device. Participants are also tested periodically
to maintain their primary listing with a given device. Participants who provide primary services must also operate
using an acceptable quality assurance plan, and meet other requirements as described in the Radon Measurement Proficiency
(RMP) Program Handbook, EPA 520/1-91-006, February 1991. 

Organizations that offer radon measurement services, but rely on another party (a primary organization) for analysis
or reading of the measurement device, are defined as ``secondary'' for that method. This type of service may include
consulting with the consumer, placing and retrieving the measurement device, or providing consumers with measurement
results. A provider of secondary measurement services does not include over-the-counter retailers of measurement
devices. 

Requirements for secondary participants include operating according to an acceptable quality assurance plan,
using listed primary devices and analysis services, and using appropriate procedures for conducting radon measurements.
Participants for secondary services also must meet other requirements as described in the application package in
the Radon Measurement Proficiency (RMP) Program Handbook. Secondary measurement service providers that meet program
requirements are listed by the measurement method they use instead of a specific device. It is possible that organizations
may be listed for both primary and secondary services.

Currently, devices are classified within fifteen radon measurement methods. There are twelve radon measurement
methods for radon gas: Alpha track detection (AT), activated charcoal adsorption (AC), unfiltered track detection
(UT), charcoal liquid scintillation (LS), long-term and short-term electret-ion chamber ((EL) and (ES) respectively),
continuous radon monitoring (CR), grab radon/activated charcoal (GC), grab radon/pump-collapsible bag (GB),
grab radon/scintillation cell (GS), evacuated scintillation cell (SC), and pump-collapsible bag (PB). Currently,
there are three working level radon decay product measurement methods tested in the RMP: grab sampling-working level
(GW), continuous working-level monitoring (CW), and radon progeny integrating sampling unit (RPISU). Additional
methods may be tested in the future as methods and protocols are developed.

As of October 1991, EPA estimated that approximately 600 firms are participating in the RMP program and offering primary
services with about 1,200 devices. There are approximately 1,000 listed secondary firms in the RMP program. The most
recent National Proficiency Report was published in October, 1993. Letters indicating participants' current status
in the program are issued on an ongoing basis.



2. Improvements to the RMP Since the Proposed Rule



Between 1989 and 1991, EPA conducted a major evaluation of the RMP program. The program was also reviewed by EPA's Science
Advisory Board and the General Accounting Office. These reviews have resulted in a number of program improvements,
which include the following. 1. An application may be submitted to EPA at any time rather than in announced testing
``rounds,'' as was done prior to 1990. 2. Organizations offering only secondary measurement services must submit
their own application, and must use RMP-listed organizations and devices for the analysis or reading of the radon
measurement devices used. 3. The passing criteria for radon measurement proficiency tests for primary devices were
made more stringent. Prior to 1991, the average error during performance tests had to be less than or equal to 25%. Now
each device tested must have an error of less than or equal to 25%. EPA also now provides an opportunity to the organization
to retest if the test outcome for any device in a specific measurement method is greater than 25% but less than 50% of
EPA's target value. 4. Proficiency determinations are now based on testing and listing participants for a specific
device within a measurement method. In the past, those participants who successfully tested with a specific device
were sometimes listed for an entire method (a method may include many different devices). 5. All participants are
now required to adhere to a valid Quality Assurance Plan. 6. Specific requirements intended for individuals who provide
radon measurements services to consumers on-site (e.g., in a residence) have been developed by EPA. By April 1993,
organizations that participate in the RMP program must provide on-site measurement services using individuals
who have met the requirements of the individual proficiency component of the RMP program. Organizations who do not
meet this requirement will be removed from listing in the RMP program and its proficiency reports. EPA began a measurement
proficiency examination program in December 1991 as part of a larger effort to ensure the proficiency of individuals
who provide on-site measurement services.



B. Individual Measurement Proficiency and the RMP Exam



EPA established individual proficiency requirements because the quality and reliability of radon measurement
services depend on the ability of individual measurement contractors. Additionally, testing an individual's knowledge
should ensure that he or she is able to provide informed answers to radon questions from the public. 

The ``centerpiece'' of these requirements is the RMP measurement exam. The RMP measurement exam tests an individual's
ability to provide radon measurement services in a residential environment. Other individual proficiency requirements
include: (1) Passing a biennial reexamination; (2) meeting RMP program requirements for using listed devices with
listed organizations; and, (3) maintaining an affiliation with an RMP listed organization. Upon completing the
requirements, participants will be listed in ``The National RMP Program_Individual Proficiency Report.''



C. National Radon Contractor Proficiency (RCP) Program



EPA established the RCP program in the Fall of 1989 as required by Congress under Section 305 of TSCA. The RCP program
was developed to evaluate radon mitigation contractors and provide information on proficient radon mitigation
contractors to the public. Like the RMP, it is a voluntary proficiency program.

Randon mitigation contractors are typically construction and residential service contractors who provide radon
mitigation services to the public. To participate successfully in the program, a radon mitigation contractor must
meet the following requirements: (1) Successfully complete an EPA approved 16-hour hands-on mitigation training
course; (2) pass the national mitigation proficiency exam; (3) conduct business according to EPA's Radon Mitigation
Standards; and (4) pass a re-examination every two years. The names of those applicants who meet program requirements
are listed in the EPA ``National Radon Contractor Proficiency (RCP) Program_Proficiency Report.''

III. Provisions of the Rule


A. Activities for Cost Recovery


EPA is setting in place a mechanism by which, under phased-in implementation, the Agency shall recover its full annual
operating costs by the end of the fifth year. By means of the fees established in this final rule, EPA intends to recover
a portion of both direct and indirect costs for the various activities conducted under both the RMP and RCP programs.
Direct costs include personnel benefits and salaries, travel, equipment costs, and contractor expenses. Indirect
costs are those resources, outside of direct program costs, used to manage, oversee, and provide counsel to program
offices. These include costs such as those incurred by EPA's management, administrative, policy, and research staff.
Indirect costs also include overhead costs, such as utilities and rents.
In this rule, EPA sets fees to partially recover operating costs for the RMP and RCP programs. The Agency is initially
setting fees at partial cost recovery levels in this rule in response to concerns expressed in comments about the negative
impacts that proposed full-cost recovery fee levels would have on the participation of organizations in the proficiency
programs. However, EPA is authorized by section 305 of the TSCA to recover its full operating costs. Therefore, the
Agency shall adjust user fee levels each year over the next five year period to ultimately recover all of its annual
costs to operate the proficiency programs. The period of time between the promulgation of this rule and the establishment
of full cost recovery fees should enable the radon industry to adjust gradually to the burden of paying fees, thus maintaining
sufficient radon measurement and mitigation service capacity to meet consumer demand and, at the same time, assuring
some level of recovery of EPA program costs.
The mechanism used for setting fees for each of these programs is to calculate their average costs, which are defined
as the total cost of the activities of the programs divided by the expected number of participants in the program. In
the proposed rule, EPA indicated an intent to charge fees that were lower than the average full cost to EPA for the RCP
program and the classroom and field radon training courses for the first year of fee collection. EPA no longer offers
the classroom and field radon training courses and therefore, will not specify a fee for these training courses in
this final rule. Subsequent to publication of the proposed rule, EPA added individual proficiency elements to the
RMP Program. Because TSCA requires EPA to impose fees on all persons applying for a proficiency rating, an annual fee
for this portion of the program is included in this final rule.
Specific activities for cost recovery for each program are described below. A detailed description of costs and how
they were calculated is presented below in section V of this preamble, entitled ``Economic Impacts'' and in the Economic
Impact Analysis of the Radon Proficiency Program User Fee Rule, U.S. EPA/Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, November
17, 1993.


1. National Radon Measurement Proficiency Program


The costs for this program include both direct and indirect costs, such as salaries and equipment, and a proportion
of indirect costs. Direct costs include printing, mailing, and processing applications; calibration, exposure
of detectors and measurement analysis; notification of results; update and maintenance of the data base; and, preparation
of the proficiency report. Indirect costs include management and supervisory costs.
EPA's total cost for the RMP program for Fiscal Year 1992 was estimated at $1.6 million. As of October 1991, EPA had listed
approximately 1,200 primary device applications and approximately 1,000 secondary firm applications. If the RMP
fees were set at a full cost recovery level in the first year (as considered under Option 2 of the Economic Impact Analysis
of Radon Proficiency Program User Fee Rule, U.S. EPA/Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, November 17, 1993), the fee
for a primary device application would be about $1,825 per application, and a fee of $250 would be assessed for each
secondary firm applying to the RMP program. The difference between the fees for primary devices and secondary firms
reflect differences in EPA's costs to process each type of applicant through the RMP program.


2. Individual Measurement Proficiency


The costs for this component of the RMP program include both direct and indirect costs, such as salaries, and a proportion
of indirect costs. Direct costs cover exam administration, periodic updates, proficiency reports, and data base
management. Indirect costs include management and supervisory costs.
The total cost of the individual proficiency component of the RMP program in Fiscal Year 1992 was estimated to be $435,000.
As of October 1991, it was estimated that approximately 1,500 individuals would participate in the individual proficiency
program in FY92. The full cost recovery fee for this program would be about $290 per individual.


3. National Radon Contractor Proficiency Program


The costs for this program include both direct and indirect costs, such as salaries, and a proportion of indirect costs.
Direct costs cover such activities as periodic updates, exam administration, proficiency reports, and data base
management. Indirect costs include management and supervisory costs.
The total cost for the RCP program was estimated to be $552,000 in fiscal year 1992. Estimated participation in this
program is about 700 as of October 1991. The full cost recovery fee for this program would be about $790 per individual.


B. Fee Schedule


The Agency had to weigh a number of factors in establishing the following fee schedule. On the one hand, EPA is committed
to ensuring a sufficient number of proficient radon measurement and mitigation organizations and individuals are
available for consumers. On the other hand, EPA is authorized to assess fees to recover its costs associated with operating
the RMP and RCP programs.

<TEXT>
 

The proposed rule specified the collection of fees sufficient to recover all of the Agency's costs related to operating
the RMP program. For the RCP program, the Agency recognized that a fee set at a full cost recovery level would discourage
participation in this new program. Also, a full cost recovery fee for the RCP program would be significantly higher
than the costs charged for other environmental risk mitigation courses currently being offered in the marketplace
(e.g., NJ State inspector training courses, asbestos inspector and remediation courses, etc.). Accordingly, EPA
proposed a less-than-full cost recovery RCP fee.
Comments received on the proposed rule indicated that the radon testing and mitigation industry is in a period of contraction.
These comments are further substantiated by a comparison of the number of participating organizations in the RMP
program at the time of the proposed rule (about 6,670) and those currently in the RMP program (about 1,600). Comments
also expressed concern that the proposed fees would drive a significant number of industry members out of business.
In selecting fee levels for the final rule, EPA considered a number of factors including the revenue to be collected,
estimated program participation rates, and the average radon firm profits. EPA then assessed the effects different
fee levels would have on participation rates in the proficiency programs and the amount of revenue that would be collected.
In developing the final rule, the Agency analyzed five different formulas, including the fee levels in the proposed
rule, for cost recovery ranging from 20% program cost recovery to 100% recovery. Specific details regarding EPA's
sensitivity analysis for options for the final rule can be found in the Economic Impact Analysis of the Radon Proficiency
Program User Fee Rule, U.S. EPA/Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, November 17, 1993.
Due to concerns raised in public comments regarding the ability of the radon industry to bear the costs of the proposed
rule, as well as its own economic analysis, the Agency has decided to establish fees at a level lower than that which
it proposed and is sufficient to collect 30 percent of its operating costs for the RMP program in the first year of fee
collection. RMP fees, as a percentage of the average radon firm's annual profits, range from 40% to 60% in the final
rule, in contrast to 80% to 95% in the proposed rule. EPA estimates that participation rates at this fee level will range
from 85% to 90%. In contrast, the proposed rule would have resulted in participation rates ranging from 50% to 75%.
The Agency considers the impacts of this final rule to be acceptable for the following reasons: (1) EPA expects that
an adequate supply of proficient radon measurement and mitigation service providers will remain after this rule
becomes effective to meet the anticipated consumer demand with reasonably priced services, and (2) since virtually
all radon firms can be considered small, this rule does not place an undue burden on small businesses and it does not
give an unfair advantage to large businesses.
Further, EPA is adopting the proposed fee level for the RCP program. The Agency received no comments indicating that
the proposed fee level would decrease participation in the RCP program significantly. Therefore, EPA also believes
the proposed fee level for the RCP program is appropriate and will not discourage participation in this element of
the proficiency program. Consistent with its authority under TSCA, the Agency shall adjust fees for its proficiency
programs as necessary to achieve the full recovery of the cost to operate its proficiency programs within the next
five years. EPA will also consider potential industry impacts as it adjusts to fee levels which achieve full cost recovery.


1. Fee Amounts


Applicants to and participants in the RMP and RCP programs are required to pay fees according to the following fee schedule:

on the effective date of this rule shall pay an initial annual fee of $75.

(2) Each secondary organization that is not a listed participant in the RMP program on the effective date of this rule
and submits an initial application after the effective date of this rule shall pay an initial annual fee of $75. This
fee will be prorated quarterly, based on the acceptance date of an organization's application.

(3) Primary organizations that have or are seeking secondary listings for methods other than those for which they
are listed as a primary, are subject to this fee.



c. Individual Proficiency Component of the RMP Program



(1) In order to remain a listed participant, each individual who is a listed participant in the RMP individual proficiency
program on the effective date of this rule shall pay an initial annual fee of $150.

(2) Each individual who is not a listed participant in the RMP program on the effective date of this rule and submits
an initial application after the effective date of this rule shall pay an initial annual fee of $150. This fee will be
prorated quarterly, based on the acceptance date of an individual's application.

(3) Individuals in the individual proficiency component of the RMP program who fail the exam and wish to re-take the
exam shall pay an application processing charge of $50. Individuals wishing to re-take the exam will not be reassessed
the fees required under section III.B.1.c. (1) and (2) above.

(4) Individuals who have or are seeking listing status as a RMP primary or secondary organization are subject to the
applicable fees required in section III.B.1.a. and b. above.



d. RCP Program



(1) In order to remain a listed participant, each individual who is a listed participant in the RCP program on the effective
date of this rule shall pay an initial annual fee of $200.

(2) Each individual who is not a listed participant in the RCP program on the effective date of this rule and submits
an initial application after the effective date of this rule shall pay an initial annual fee of $200. This fee will be
prorated quarterly, based on the acceptance date of an individual's application.

(3) Individuals in the RCP program who fail the exam and wish to re-take the exam shall pay an application processing
charge of $50. Individuals wishing to re-take the exam will not be reassessed the charge under section III.B.1.d.
(1) and (2) above.




An organization or individual who is not a listed participant in EPA's radon proficiency programs on the effective
date of this rule and/or whose proficiency program application has not yet been accepted by EPA becomes subject to
the fees described above once its application has been accepted by EPA. Fees for such organizations or individuals
will be prorated quarterly, based on the acceptance date of the application. To remain listed, each participant in
the RMP or RCP programs, whether individual or organization, shall submit a renewal application and appropriate
annual fee to EPA each year.



2. Exemptions



State and local governments are exempted from these fees under section 305(e)(2) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2665.



3. Determination of Fees



Participants listed in the RMP and RCP programs on the effective date of this rule will be sent, by EPA, an annual renewal
application with appropriate fee calculation at least 30 days prior to the payment due date. This renewal application
also serves as an organization's or individual's payment invoice. Fees will be assessed based on the information
in EPA's proficiency program data bases. Participants who intend to pay the invoiced fee amount shall complete the
renewal application and send the appropriate payment to EPA following the procedures in section B.3. Organizations
or individuals who believe the invoiced fee amount is incorrect or wish to amend or adjust their listing status shall
do so by indicating the appropriate corrections or adjustments on their renewal application. Corrected renewal
applications for the RMP Program or the RCP Program shall be sent to: Radon Proficiency Program Information Service,
c/o Sanford Cohen and Associates, Inc., 1418 I-85 Parkway, Montgomery, AL 36016. EPA will review the corrected
renewal application, adjust the payment invoice amount (if appropriate) and issue a revised invoice. Participants
shall pay the corrected amount within 30 days of receipt of the revised invoice.

If the appropriate fee or revised renewal application for an individual or organization participating in the RMP
or RCP program has not been received by EPA on or before the payment due date, EPA will send, by certified mail, notice
to the individual or organization that they will be delisted from the proficiency program unless they pay the fee within
30 days of receipt of this second notice. If payment has not been received by EPA within 30 days of the participant's
receipt of the second payment invoice, the organization's or individual's listing will be removed from the proficiency
program.

New or initial applicants to the RMP or RCP programs will be assessed a fee at the time of their initial application.
EPA will send a payment invoice to the new applicant upon acceptance of its initial application. The invoice will state
that the applicant will be given 30 days to remit payment. The fee assessed will be prorated quarterly, based on the
acceptance date of the application. If the appropriate fee has not been received by EPA by the payment due date, the
application will be returned to the submitter and the applicant will not be listed in the proficiency program.



4. Payment Procedures



Each remittance to EPA under this rule shall be in United States currency and shall be paid by certified check, personal
check, or money order made payable to the order of the ``U.S. Environmental Protection Agency'' and sent to: U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, Headquarters Accounting Operations Branch, Radon Proficiency Program User Fees, P.O. Box 952491,
St. Louis, MO 63195-2491. The fee shall be submitted with the original copy of the EPA invoice. Collection of
fees shall begin in the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1993. Additional specific information on how and when fees
must be paid can be found in the guidance document How to Pay Your Fees, U.S. EPA/Office of Radiation and Indoor Air.
Copies of this document can be obtained by contacting the RIS at (205) 272-2797 or by FAX at (205) 260-9051.



5. Failing the RMP Measurement Test



Organizations that fail the initial measurement performance test or the re-test for a particular device must re-apply
to the RMP program for that device. EPA notifies all primary participants in writing of their measurement performance
test results and listing status. Any fee paid to EPA in the process of attaining a listing of a particular device will
not be refunded if the device fails to meet the RMP program criteria as stated in the Radon Measurement Proficiency
(RMP) Program Handbook, EPA 520/1-91-006, February 1991. Should the organization elect to re-apply,
EPA will assess a new fee based on the information provided in the organization's reapplication.

6. Failing the RMP Individual Proficiency and RCP Exams



Applicants to the RCP program and/or the individual proficiency component of the RMP program may take the written
examinations as often as they wish. However, each request for a re-test must include a $50.00 processing fee. This
processing fee reimburses EPA for the data-entry of the re-test request and for scheduling a new examination date
for the applicant. As with the RMP program, EPA notifies participants in writing of their results.

If an individual decides not to take the individual proficiency exam or the RCP exam within the fiscal year the application
and appropriate fee were submitted, a new application must be submitted with the appropriate fee. Fees will not be
refunded in the event an applicant fails the exam and/or chooses not to re-take the exam.



7. Implementation Guidance



EPA will make available detailed implementation guidance prior to effective date of this rule. Copies of this document
can be obtained by contacting the RIS at (205) 272-2797 or by FAX at (205) 260-9051.



8. Adjustment of fees



EPA shall collect 100 percent of its operating costs associated with its radon proficiency programs within five years
of the effective date of this rule. In order to do this, EPA shall adjust the initial fees established by this rule each
year over the next five years to collect the following percentages of program costs:






Assuming that the Agency's cost of running the proficiency programs remains unchanged over the next five years and
assuming that the level of participation in the proficiency programs remains constant, the fee schedule for the next
five years would be as follows:






The actual fees for each fiscal year will be calculated based on program costs and participation rates. New fee schedules
will be published in the 

Federal Register

 by January 1 of each year as a technical amendment final rule to become effective 30 days or more after publication.

EPA will use a three-step process to adjust fees annually. First, EPA will estimate the costs of providing each of the
proficiency programs for the upcoming year. EPA will account for future additional fixed costs (e.g., updating examinations)
and increases/decreases in variable costs due to inflation and other factors. In order to calculate increases/decreases
in cost due to inflation, EPA may use one of the three following indices: The Federal General Schedule (GS) pay scale,
the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and/or a component of the CPI, such as services. Second, EPA will estimate the number
of participants for each program. At a minimum, these participation rates will be based on past and current program
participation rates. Third, EPA shall calculate the per capita costs that individuals or organizations should pay
to enable it to recover its fixed and variable costs each year for each program. EPA shall also consider potential industry
impacts as it adjusts to levels to ultimately achieve full cost recovery over the period of five years.

IV. Response to Comments


EPA received comments to the proposed rule covering a broad range of subjects and concerns relating to the proficiency
programs, the fees proposed and the impact of the fees on various segments of the industry. Comments also focused on
the effects of fees on the availability of quality radon services to consumers. The following section summarizes
the major comments received and discusses the changes, where applicable, in the final rule in response to those comments.


A. Industry Impacts


1. Impact of Fees on Demand for Radon Services


Most of the comments received focused on the impact of fees on the radon industry. Comments suggested that all government-imposed
fees will likely be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices for services, thus leading to a decrease in
radon testing and mitigation. These comments suggested that a decrease in the number of tests and mitigations will
undermine the Agency's desired goal of reducing radon-related health risks.


Response:

 The Agency recognizes that all or some of the costs to firms of radon user fees may be passed on to consumers in the form
of higher prices for radon services. However, since firms would spread out the costs of compliance across the total
number of measurements, any potential increases in service costs are likely to be only a small portion of the total
costs of the service. Further, as a result of comments received on the proposed rule and EPA's analysis of the economic
impacts of the fees, this final rule establishes fees for the RMP program that are significantly lower than those in
the proposed rule. EPA does not believe that the imposition of the user fees in this final rule will have a significant
deleterious effect on the number of radon tests or mitigations conducted.


2. Impact of Fees on Participation


Several comments indicated that imposing fees will reduce participation in EPA's voluntary proficiency programs.
Some comments suggested that the proposed fee structure would lead to a greater reduction in participation than predicted
in the economic analysis prepared for the proposed rule. Several comments suggested that organizations will only
participate in the RMP program with one device to minimize their fees, although they will continue to provide measurement
services with a number of devices. Comments further suggested that firms might continue to provide radon services
without the benefit of an EPA listing. Still other comments suggested that the proposed fees would lead them to discontinue
their radon business altogether.


Response:

 EPA is sensitive to the concern that user fees could reduce participation in its proficiency programs. The Agency
conducted additional economic analyses in the development of this final rule to address this concern. As a result
of its analysis, EPA has selected a fee level substantially lower than the proposed rule so as not to discourage participation
in the program. Drop off rates for participation in the RMP program are predicted to range between 10 and 15% for the
final rule in contrast to the drop off rates with the proposed rule of between 25 and 50%.
While the Agency cannot directly address the potential for an organization to misrepresent the number or types of
RMP-listed devices it offers, EPA will take a strong role in working with the States to communicate to consumers the
importance of verifying an organization's listing status before using its services. EPA will certainly take action
to delist an organization if the Agency confirms a case of misrepresentation. State certification programs provide
consumers further assurance that the services they use are RMP listed or have met equivalent standards as outlined
in the Strategy on Federal/State Cooperation for Radon Certification Program Development, EPA 22A-5000,
January 1992.


3. Device Bias


Comments suggested that the fees will drive firms away from the electret measurement method and toward other less
accurate devices. Many organizations provide primary services with different types of electret devices (e.g.,
short-term, long-term, etc.). These comments expressed concern that the device-specific fees included in the proposed
rule would provide an incentive for them to switch to participation with a single charcoal canister device in order
to reduce their fee.


Response:

 The Agency evaluates participants in the RMP program with each device type separately to ensure that they are capable
of making accurate measurements with that specific device. EPA's costs to process a primary device through the RMP
program are similar, regardless of whether electret or charcoal canister devices are used. Furthermore, the reduced
fees being promulgated in this final rule will probably minimize any potential incentives to switch devices as a result
of the imposition of fees. The Agency is currently reviewing the way it evaluates electret and other devices that are
used to provide measurement services to the home. If this review yields changes in the RMP program and thus, in its costs,
EPA will reconsider its fee structure.
With regard to variations in device accuracy, all devices that have met the requirements of EPA's RMP program are capable
of accurately measuring radon and/or its decay products. Both charcoal canister and electret measurement devices
have been used successfully in the RMP program on numerous occasions.


4. Private Sector Certification


Some comments suggested that the imposition of fees on the radon industry will provide an incentive for private trade
associations to develop their own certification and accreditation programs with potentially lower standards than
EPA's RMP and RCP programs. These comments further suggest that organizations will be driven away from EPA's proficiency
programs in favor of private sector certification or accreditation programs. This approach was supported by comments
identifying other industries that successfully self-certify and test themselves.


Response:

 Private sector certification programs do not currently exist within the radon industry. There is reason to believe
that even in States where an EPA listing is not required, firms will gain a benefit from participating in the EPA programs
due to the public service messages and guidance documents which suggest that consumers look for the EPA-listed firm
or individual when deciding on radon measurements or mitigations. However, if the private sector were to develop
a self-certification program, the Agency would support industry efforts to establish requirements that supplement
and re-enforce existing Federal and State quality assurance programs.


B. Fairness Issues


1. State and Local Government Exemption for Fees


Comments suggested that government and private sectors should pay equal fees. The comments suggested that exempted
government agencies will use the subsidized proficiency program participation to take business away from the private
sector.

Section 305(e)(2) of the IRAA specifically exempts State and local government agencies from paying fees to participate
in the proficiency programs. There are currently 17 listed State or local government entities in the RMP program with
34 devices. This number represents approximately 4% of all listed participants in the RMP. There are currently 39
individuals who are State or local government agency employees in the RCP. This number represents about 4.5% of all
listed participants in the RCP. There is a direct benefit of having these individuals and governments in the EPA proficiency
programs in terms of quality assurance. The Agency does not believe that this level of participation by State or local
governments is a threat to the industry or would pose a burden to the other participants in the program.



2. Small Business Impacts



A number of comments suggested that EPA's fees would impose a significant burden on small businesses and stifle competition
between smaller and larger firms within the radon industry. They went on to suggest that the Agency should consider
a lower fee for smaller businesses or fees based on the volume of radon tests conducted annually.



Response: 

EPA acknowledges that a significant number of firms affected by this rule can be considered small businesses under
most definitions used by the Small Business Administration. About 90% of radon service providers have fewer than
10 employees. The Agency is concerned about the effects that this rule might have on small businesses, particularly
in the current economic climate. This concern led EPA to establish its user fees at a level that will only recover 30%
of its operating costs in the first year. Based on its economic analysis, EPA believes that the fee schedule promulgated
in this final rule will not place an undue burden on small businesses, or provide an unfair advantage to large businesses.
The Agency's phased approach to recovering its operating costs of the proficiency programs will allow small businesses
to adjust to incremental increases in the fees, rather than having to absorb a fee set at a level sufficient to recover
the Agency's full costs. In addition, EPA is continually looking for ways to reduce its operating costs.



3. Device-Based Fees



A number of comments suggested that the Agency establish fees on the basis of measurement methods, rather than measurement
devices. For example, several comments recommended that program participants pay only one fee for testing a variety
of devices within the electret method categories.



Response: 

The intent of this rule is to recover Agency costs associated with operating its proficiency programs. The RMP program
requires testing each specific type of measurement device, within particular method categories. Conducting these
tests is the single largest component of the RMP program's operating costs. For this reason, the Agency has decided
to collect fees from organizations on the basis of the number of specific types of devices tested and not on the number
of measurement methods used.



C. Economic Analysis



Comments also expressed concerns about the Agency's analysis of the economic impacts of its proposed rule. Specific
comments focused on the methodologies used to determine program costs and industry impacts; equity issues within
the industry; and, the long term effects of the Agency's fees on the radon industry.



Response: 

The Agency has considered these comments in preparing its new economic analysis of the final rule. For further explanation
on the development of EPA's economic analysis for this final rule, see section V, ``Economic Impacts,'' and Economic
Impact Analysis of the Radon Proficiency Program User Fee Rule, U.S. EPA/Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, November
17, 1993. Specific comments are addressed below.



1. Inadequate Sample Size



Several comments suggested that the survey used to determine the impacts of the fee on the radon industry was too small
to adequately characterize potential effects of the fee.



Response: 

At the time of the survey used in the proposed rule, it was estimated that there would be approximately 800 companies
participating in the RMP program with about 1,200 primary device applications and an estimated 6,000 secondary firms
in the RMP program in the first year of fee collection. As of October 1991, there are approximately 600 primary participants
with about 1,200 primary devices and about 1,000 secondary firms participating in the EPA RMP program. Of those organizations
and individuals surveyed in 1989, approximately 63% are still participating in the EPA proficiency programs. The
Agency believes that this survey data is still relevant and can be applied to the industry as it is today. Since the time
of the proposed rule, the Agency has developed several data bases from elements of the RMP program application's supplemental
data and from the RCP program. These data were used to validate the assumptions of the proposed rule and to develop models
of ``typical'' radon firms used to further analyze the impacts of various fee levels on participation and program
cost recovery. EPA believes that the sample size used to develop the final rule was adequate to assess the potential
economic impacts of the various options considered.

2. Explain All Assumptions



Several comments suggested that the Agency break out the category ``Other Activities'' in the economic analysis
that comprised about 70% of the Agency program costs.



Response:

 The economic analysis for the proposed rule has been extensively reviewed and updated to reflect the program costs
associated with EPA's proficiency programs as they are currently operating. All of the pertinent program activities
and analytical assumptions have been provided in the appendices B and C of the Economic Impact Analysis of the radon
Proficiency Program User Fee Rule, U.S. EPA/Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, November 17, 1993.



3. Consider All Inputs of Costs to Industry



Several comments suggested that the Agency did not consider other costs of doing business such as travel to test chambers,
lost business due to training, and travel to training. Other comments indicated that the economic analysis for the
proposed rule did not consider the issue of duplication of fees and multiple State certifications. Comments also
suggested that the RMP program fees in the proposed rule were not comparable to other State certification fees. These
comments suggested that the Agency consider certification costs for termite inspectors, home inspectors, etc.



Response:

 EPA did not do a detailed analysis of other compliance costs faced by firms in the radon industry because of the wide
variability of those costs and the difficulties in fully documenting these costs. The Agency does recognize that
its fees are not the only compliance costs a radon firm may incur. This was a key consideration in EPA's decision to promulgate
fees lower that those in the proposed rule and to pursue a staged approach to recovering its operating costs. Appendix
A, ``State Certification Programs,'' of the Economic Impact Analysis for the Radon Proficiency Program User Fee
Rule, U.S. EPA/Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, November 17, 1993 provides a list of States that currently require
the payment of radon user fees. Fee levels in this final rule are comparable to those charged by States.



4. Economic Analysis Should Reflect Current Program and Costs



Several comments suggested that the assumptions used for the economic analysis were based on a program that was significantly
changed by the time the proposed rule was published. These comments indicated that the analysis should reflect the
current program costs and participation rates. Comments suggested that this will significantly change the estimated
amount of drop out in participation.



Response:

 The Agency has updated the fees in this final rule to reflect the current structure of the radon proficiency programs,
as well as the current participation rates and program costs. These programmatic updates are outlined in the economic
analysis.



5. Analysis Should Reflect More Than One Year of Costs



Comments suggested that the first year fees do not reflect the real costs that could be imposed on participants in the
second and subsequent years. A comment offered the scenario that after the first year, participant fees would have
to more than triple to support full cost recovery in the face of declining participation.



Response:

 While the Agency does anticipate that some firms will not participate in EPA's voluntary proficiency programs as
a result of the imposition of user fees, this drop off will also reduce the costs the Agency is seeking to recover. By
adopting a staged approach to full cost recovery, EPA believes that the industry will have sufficient time to adjust
to the user fees and the impacts in future years are expected to be minimal. Furthermore, the Agency is always evaluating
ways in which it can reduce the cost of operating its proficiency programs.



D. Non-Fee Related Comments



The Agency received a number of comments relative to the overall operation of EPA's proficiency programs. These comments
were generally unrelated to the issue of fees. Many of the comments suggested improvements to the programs' structure
and operation. Other comments addressed the relationship between Federal and State quality assurance programs
and the adequacy of EPA's public information activities as they affect consumer demand for radon testing and mitigation.
The Agency will consider these comments as it continues to make improvements in its proficiency programs and other
radon-related programs.

V. Economic impacts



A. Introduction



EPA analyzed the estimated costs of each of the proficiency programs, estimates of participation, and the effects
of fees on program participation. In addition, the Agency considered comments received on its ``Economic Analysis''
of the proposed rule. EPA's final analysis is contained in Economic Impact Analysis of the Radon Proficiency Program
User Fee Rule, U.S. EPA/Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, November 17, 1993. 



B. Methodology



Three methodologies were employed for evaluating the economic impacts of the imposition of fees for radon proficiency
programs. The first methodology formed the basis of the participation drop off numbers in the proposed rule. This
methodology used data from selected interviews with industry representatives to help EPA predict the impact of several
levels of fees, and estimates the potential reduction in participation as the fee level increased. The Agency has
updated this analysis to account for current estimates of program participation and operating costs. A second methodology
involved the design of model firms to evaluate the effects of differing fee levels on estimated radon revenues and
profits. A third methodology involved examining fees charges for similar programs, both in the public and private
sector. The first and second methodologies were used in setting the fee schedule for participation in the RMP program.
The third methodology was used to develop fees for the RCP program and for the individual proficiency component of
the RMP program. 



C. Impacts



1. Total Costs



The total annual cost of operating EPA's radon proficiency programs was estimated at $2.6 million. This number is
based on budget estimates for operating the proficiency programs during FY92. The proposed rule estimated the total
program costs at $3.4 million annually. The difference of about $800,000 results from EPA's adoption of a continuous
program and privatization of the training courses that were part of the proposed rule, as well as the decline in the
number of organizations applying to the proficiency programs. The Agency will continue to work toward reducing its
costs of operating the proficiency programs. 



2. Radon Measurement Proficiency (RMP) Program



EPA'S analysis indicates that its final fee structure promulgated in this rule will have minimal impacts on the radon
industry and the general public. According to the demand/response curve developed in the ``Economic Analysis,''
drop off in participation is estimated to be about 10% of primary measurement devices; in contrast, the proposed rule
would have resulted in drop off of about 25% for primary devices. Secondary firm drop off is expected to be approximately
15%; the proposed rule would have resulted in a drop off rate of about 50%. Any level of fees is likely to have resulted
in some participation drop off. The Agency was sensitive, however, to the concerns raised by comments that the proposed
rule fees would have led to a dramatic reduction in the number of organizations participating in the RMP program. These
comments were further substantiated by EPA's model firm analysis which indicated that the proposed fees would have
represented a 80-95% of the average firm's radon profits. As a result of the lower fees in the final rule, EPA believes
that the drop off will be small enough to maintain the availability of listed measurement service providers throughout
the country. 

The total estimated cost of the RMP program is about $1.6 million and the fees recovered from the RMP program are expected
to equal about 30% of this cost during the first year of fee collection, or about $470,000. 



3. Individual Measurement Proficiency and the RMP Exam



EPA is publishing an annual fee of $150 for participation in the individual proficiency component of the RMP program.
The estimated Agency cost of operating the individual proficiency component of the RMP program is $435,000. The Agency
is establishing a fee that will maintain participation in this program and achieve the Agency's goal of measuring
the proficiency of individuals who provide ``in-house'' radon measurement services. EPA expects to collect approximately
$225,000 the first year of fee collection. The fee was set at a level expected to maintain a high level of existing participants.
The fee also reflects a fee that is comparable to existing environmental-related proficiency testing programs.




4. Radon Contractor Proficiency (RCP) Program



As in the case of the individual measurement proficiency component of the RMP, EPA is promulgating a fee that it believes
will maintain participation in the RCP. EPA has chosen to finalize the proposed annual fee of $200 based on the analysis
conducted for the proposed rule. Comments received did not indicate that this fee would result in significant drop
off of the RCP program participants. The $200 per RCP program applicant fee is consistent with fees established by
State radon mitigation certification programs and other comparable federal programs. EPA expects to collect $140,000
in the first year of the estimated program costs of $550,000.

VI. Rulemaking Record



EPA established a record for this rulemaking (docket control number A-90-09). The record for this rulemaking
is available to the public in the Clean Air Act Docket, located in M1500, first floor Waterside Mall, U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW, Mail Stop LE-131, Washington, DC, 20460, from 8:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1:30 p.m.
to 3:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays.

The record includes information considered by EPA in developing this rule. The record contains the following categories
of information: (1) 

Federal Register

 notices; (2) Support Documents; and, (3) Public Comments.



VII. Other Regulatory Requirements



A. Executive Order 12291



This rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under the provisions covered under
Executive Order (E.O.) 12291, which required the Agency to judge whether this regulation is ``major'' and was therefore
subject to the requirement to conduct a regulatory impact analysis. This rule was not considered a ``major'' rule
as that term is defined in section 1(b) of E.O. 12291 because the annual effect of the rule on the economy will be less
than $100 million; this rule is not expected to cause significant increases in costs or prices for significant sectors
of the economy or geographic region; and because the programs are voluntary in nature, they are not expected to result
in significant adverse effects on competition, investment, productivity, or innovation or on the ability of United
States enterprises to compete with foreign enterprises in domestic or foreign markets.

The same conclusion reached under E.O. 12291 would also apply to the provisions of E.O. 12866. Also, under the provisions
of E.O. 12866, this rule is not considered as ``significant,'' but because this rule is revenue generating it was submitted
to OMB for review. This rule was cleared by OMB on November 17, 1993.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



This rule has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 60 et seq.). EPA has determined that
a significant number of small businesses are affected by this regulation. Under the proposed rule, EPA defined small
businesses as those with less than 10 employees. This definition was reviewed and approved by the Small Business Administration.
Approximately 10% of the primary device applicants and 15% of the secondary firms are estimated to drop off of the RMP
program as a result of the imposition of fees. This drop off from the program is not considered significant because
EPA has determined that if the estimated 10-15% drop off rate does occur, an adequate number of proficient radon
measurement firms will be available to the public. In addition, since virtually all radon firms can be considered
small, this rule does not place an undue burden on small businesses nor does it give an unfair advantage to large businesses.
Estimates of drop off have not been quantified for the RCP program or the individual proficiency component of the RMP
program. The Agency believes, however, that its fees will not result in a substantial adverse impact because the fees
were established at a level designed to maintain participation in the program. Further, EPA received no comments
that indicated that fees of this magnitude would lead to a significant decline in participation.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The information associated with the Radon Proficiency Programs will be submitted for approval to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

 A separate 

Federal Register

 notice will be published requesting comments on the information collection requirements. The Agency will respond
to all OMB or public comments prior to receiving approval for these information requirements. A 

Federal Register

 notice will be published announcing approval of these information requirements, the OMB control number and the expiration
date.
