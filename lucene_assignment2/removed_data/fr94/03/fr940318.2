Membership on the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods; Nominations



Notice is hereby given of the Department's intent to solicit nominations for membership on the National Advisory
Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods. This Committee was established in April 1988, as a result of a recommendation
in the 1985 report of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Committee on Food Protection, Subcommittee on Microbiological
Criteria, titled ``An Evaluation of the Role of Microbiological Criteria for Foods.''



The Committee provides advice and recommendations to the Secretaries of Agriculture and Health and Human Services
concerning the development of microbiological criteria by which the safety and wholesomeness of food can be assessed,
including criteria for microorganisms that indicate whether food has been processed using good manufacturing processes.


Nominations for membership are being sought from individuals with scientific expertise in epidemiology, food science,
microbiology, packaging, pathology, public health, toxicology, and other relevant disciplines.


Appointment(s) to the Committee will be made by the Secretary of Agriculture after consultation with the Secretary
of Health and Human Services. Nominees will be considered without discrimination for any reason such as race, color,
religion, sex, national origin, age, or marital status. Because of the complexity of the issues to be addressed, it
is anticipated that the full Committee will meet semi-annually and subcommittees will meet as deemed necessary.


Interested persons are invited to submit a typed resume to The Office of the Administrator, Food Safety and Inspection
Service, room 2151, South Agriculture Building, 14th and Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20250. Nominations
for membership must be postmarked no later than March 31, 1994. For additional information please contact Mr. Craig

<USBUREAU>Forest Service</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Santiam Forest Health Project, Willamette National Forest, Linn County, OR</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare environmental impact statement.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to thin and/or regenerate forest
stands, construct roads, and use prescribed fire in Santiam Pass. The need for the forest health project is threefold:
(1) To change forest stand structure and composition, in order to reduce forest health problems; (2) create sustainable
stand structure and wildlife habitat conditions; (3) to salvage dead and dying trees and provide timber for local
mills. Project is proposed for fiscal year 1995. The Willamette National Forest invites written comments on the scope
of the analysis. The agency will give full notice of the full environmental analysis and decision making process for
the proposal so interested and affected people may participate and contribute to the final decision.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The USDA, Forest Service proposal includes: re-introduction of natural fire, through the prescribe burning of understory
layers in selected stands; harvest trees through thinning, understory removal, selection harvest and/or regeneration
harvest on about 1,000 acres; construct permanent roads and temporary roads to access treatment units; regenerate
new stands after harvest; continue to learn and interact with the public on forest health; develop opportunities
for post/pole/chip/firewood products from small sized trees; develop habitat improvement projects for a variety
of wildlife, fish, and sensitive plant species; implement Scenic Byway strategy for enhancement opportunities
along the Santiam Pass highway.


Preliminary issues have been identified and include: Roadless areas; forest health, long-term productivity, and
biodiversity; spotted owls; recreation experience; fire hazard and air quality; old growth and fragmentation;
socio-economic; threatened, endangered, and sensitive species (plants land animals); and cultural resources.
A range of alternatives will be developed including a no action alternative.
This draft EIS will tier to the 1990 Final EIS for the Willamette National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan
and will not be inconsistent with any of the Alternatives in the President's Forest Plan. The Forest Service is the
lead agency.
Initial scoping began in October 1993. Extensive scoping has already been done on the project through field trips,
newsletters, and public meetings. The public is invited to offer suggestions and comments in writing.
The draft EIS is expected to be completed in May 1994. The comment period on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date
the Environmental Protection Agency publishes the notice of availability in the 

Federal Register

.
The Forest Service believes it is important to give reviewers notice at this early stage of several court rulings related
to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of a draft EIS must structure their
participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's
position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v. 

NRDC, 

435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft EIS stage but that are not
raised until after completion of the final EIS may be waived or dismissed by the courts. 

City of Angoon 

v. 

Hodel, 

803 f. 2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir, 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. 

v. 

Harris, 

490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
EIS.
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft EIS should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters
of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated
and discussed in the statement. (Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations
for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing
these points.)
The final EIS is scheduled to be completed in August 1994. In the final EIS, the Forest Service is required to respond
to comments and responses received during the comment period that pertain to the environmental consequences discussed
in the draft EIS and applicable laws, regulations, and policies considered in making the decision regarding the Santiam
Forest Health Project. Darrel L. Kenops, Forest Supervisor, is the Responsible Official. As the Responsible Official,
he will decide whether to implement the project. The Responsible Official will document the decision and reasons
for the decision in the Record of Decision. That decision will be subject to Forest Service Appeal Regulations (36
CFR part 215).

Foreign-Trade Zone 82_Mobile, AL 
Application for Subzone Status 
Peavey Electronics Corporation Plant 
(Electronic Audio/Acoustical Products) 
Foley, AL 



An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the City of Mobile, grantee of FTZ
82, requesting special-purpose subzone status for the electronic audio and acoustical products manufacturing
plant of the Peavey Electronics Corporation (PEC), located in Foley, Alabama. The application was submitted pursuant
to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the
Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on March 3, 1994. An application for subzone status at PEC's Meridian,
Mississippi, facilities is pending with the FTZ Board (FTZ Doc. 47-93, 58 FR 46628, 9-2-93). 

PEC's Foley plant (10 acres) is located at 410 East Section Avenue, within the Foley Industrial Park, Foley (Baldwin
County), Alabama, some 35 miles southeast of Mobile. The facility (90 employees) is used to produce a variety of electronic
hi-fidelity audio and acoustical products for the U.S. market and export, including amplifiers, loudspeakers,
musical instrument processors, mixers, microphones, musical instruments (guitars, keyboards), public address
systems, lighting equipment, and related accessories. Components and materials purchased from abroad include:
loudspeaker parts, diodes, capacitors, resistors, printed circuit boards, electric motors, musical instrument
parts, and wiring harnesses (duty rate range: free_10.0%). 

Zone procedures would exempt PEC from Customs duty payments on 
the foreign components used in export production. On its domestic 
sales, PEC would be able to choose the duty rates that apply to 
finished electronic audio and acoustical products (5% average rate) for the foreign components noted above. The
application indicates that the savings from zone procedures would help improve the company's international competitiveness.


In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been appointed examiner to investigate the
application and report to the Board. 

Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall
be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is May 17,
1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the
subsequent 15-day period to June 1, 1994. 

A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following
locations:

accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of closed meeting.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice sets forth the schedule and proposed agenda of a forthcoming closed meeting of the Nominations Committee
of the National Assessment Governing Board. This notice also describes the functions of the Board. Notice of this
meeting is required under section 10(a)(2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The National Assessment Governing Board is established under section 406(i) of the General Education Provisions
Act (GEPA) as amended by section 3403 of the National Assessment of Educational Progress Improvement Act (NAEP Improvement
Act), Title III-C of the Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement
Amendments of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-297), (20 USC 1221e-1).



The Board is established to formulate policy guidelines for the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The
Board is responsible for selecting subject area to be assessed, developing assessment objectives, identifying
appropriate achievement goals for each grade and subject tested, and establishing standards and procedures for
interstate and national comparisons.

The Nominations Committee of the National Assessment Governing Board will meet in closed session on March 31, 1994,
from 11 a.m. until 12:30 p.m., to act for the Board in selecting and recommending final nominees to fill upcoming Board
membership vacancies in the categories, Chief State School Officer, Eighth Grade Classroom Teacher, Fourth Grade
Classroom Teacher, Elementary School Principal, Secondary School Principal, and General Public, beginning October
1, 1994.

This Committee will discuss nominees' qualifications for Board membership. These discussions will relate solely
to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency and would disclose information of a personal nature where
disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy if conducted in open session. Such
matters are protected by exemptions (2) and (6) of section 552b(c) of title 5 U.S.C.

A summary of the activities of the meeting and related matters, which are informative to the public, consistent with
policy of 5 U.S.C. 552b, will be available to the public within fourteen days after the meeting.

Records are kept of all Board proceedings and are available for public inspection at the U.S. Department of Education,
National Assessment Governing Board, suite 825, 800 North Capitol Street NW., Washington, DC, from 8:30 a.m. until
5 p.m.

PROCUREMENT REQUEST NO.: 

05-94IS40025




PROJECT SCOPE: 

This new grant is to conduct a course that has been held at the University of Florida every other year since 1963. The
primary purpose is to provide technical training for research entomologists world wide as part of an international
effort to increase food supplies through controlling pests that cause significant losses. The course promotes the
peaceful use of atomic energy as well as public interest in disseminating knowledge about techniques to control insect
pests harmful to the United States. The University of Florida has the unique availability and access to major Federal,
State, and University entomology laboratories that are all located within the Gainesville, Florida, commuting
area. Their location enables the course to enhance lectures by including site visits and hands-on laboratory work.
Eligibility for this award is, therefore, restricted to the University of Florida.

ACTION: 

Acceptance of an unsolicited proposal application of a grant award with the University of North Dakota, Energy and
Environmental Research Center.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy, Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.14 (D) and
(E), it intends to make a Non-Competitive Financial Assistance Grant Award through the Pittsburgh Energy Technology
Center of the University of North Dakota, Energy and Environmental Research Center for ``Direct Liquefaction of
Low-Rank Coal.''



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Grant No.:



DE-FG22-94PC94050



Title of Research Effort:



``Direct Liquefaction of Low-Rank Coal''



Awardee:



University of North Dakota, Energy and Environmental Research Center



Term of Assistance Effort:



12 months



Cost of Assistance Effort:



Total estimate cost is $200,000. There will be cost-sharing involved in this transaction; financial assistance
will be provided by the Federal Government to the University of North Dakota.



Objective



This project will develop a direct liquefaction process that specifically will convert Low-Rank Coals to transportation
fuels. An advantage of using Low-Rank Coals are that they contain less sulfur and nitrogen and would be more environmentally
acceptable.

The Energy and Environmental Research Center at the University of North Dakota has an extensive background in research
of Low-Rank Coals, and their recent process for the direct liquefaction of these coals has potential for being developed
into a commercial process. The Multistep process being developed by the Energy and Environmental Research Center
for the direct liquefaction of Low-Rank Coals consists of: (1) A preconversion treatment to prepare the coal for solubilization,
(2) solubilization of the coal in the solvent, and (3) polishing using cresylic acid to complete solubilization of
the remaining material. The product of these three steps can be upgraded using conventional hydrotreating.

The objective of this research is to optimize the above process via the following two tasks: (1) Determination of the
recyclability of the solvent used during solubilization, and (2) Determination of the minimum severity required
for effective hydrotreatment of the liquid product.

In accordance with 10 CFR 600.14, the University of North Dakota, Energy and Environmental Research Center, has been
selected as the grant recipient. The Department of Energy support of the activity would enhance the public benefits
to be derived by the usage of Low-Rank Coals in producing a product that can be easily upgraded to useful high quality
fuels. This activity represents a unique idea and a method which would not be eligible for financial assistance under
solicitation. The Department of Energy has determined that a competitive solicitation would be inappropriate.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Intent to award based on an unsolicited application.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy announced that pursuant to the provisions of 10 CFR 600.14, it intends to provide additional
funding and extend the budget period for Grant No. DE-FG02-90CH10451 based on an unsolicited application
received from West Virginia University Research Corporation for the continued operation of the transportable emissions
testing laboratory, and a multi-task research and development laboratory program. The determination to extend
this grant is based on the following information: A technical evaluation of the proposed project was performed pursuant
to 10 CFR 600.14 (d) and (e). The proposed project is of national interest because data from the proposed effort will
contribute to the understanding of heavy-duty alternative fuels emission characteristics and to the mandated Alternative
Motor Fuels Act of 1988 (AMFA) database. This project comprises a unique collection of laboratory facilities and
experienced technical talent focused on heavy-duty alternative fuels transportation. The data and information
brought back from the Field Operations effort is communicated to researchers assigned to the several R&D Tasks
who, in turn, have established excellent working relationships with engine and vehicle manufacturers. It is determined
that the proposed project is meritorious in offering a unique nationwide testing service which relieves the necessity
to take buses out of service for extended periods. The procedure proposed by West Virginia University will allow two
mobile facilities to perform on-site tests of heavy-duty trucks and buses without removing the vehicles from service
and arranging for them to be driven hundreds of miles for testing. The Environmental Protection Agency has also reviewed
this concept and supports the technical feasibility of this effort. The probability of success for a second year of
operation and a second test unit are excellent. The key personnel assigned to the project have excellent qualifications.
DOE knows of no other entity which is conducting or planning to conduct such an effort. This effort is not considered
suitable for competitive financial assistance. The DOE share of funding is estimated at $3,100,000 for a one-year
budget period estimated to be from April 1, 1994 through March 31, 1995.

(Commission) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for an original, minor license for the proposed Ramseur Hydroelectric Project, located on the Deep
River, in the City of Ramseur, Randolph County, North Carolina, and has prepared a Final Environmental Assessment
(FEA) for the project. In the FEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential environmental impacts of the
project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate mitigative and enhancement measures, would
not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.
The Notice of Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment for the Ramseur Hydroelectric Project was issued on
December 8, 1993. In response, the Commission received two comment letters which were reviewed by the Commission's
staff and addressed in the FEA.
Copies of the FEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.

<DOCTITLE>Colorado Interstate Gas Company; Application</DOCTITLE>


March 14, 1994. 


Take notice that on March 8, 1994, Colorado Interstate Gas Company (CIG), Post Office Box 1087, Colorado Springs,
Colorado 80944 filed an application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for an order granting permission
and approval to abandon by sale to Snyder Oil Corporation (SOCO) certain certificated natural gas facilities known
as the Blue Gap Gathering System, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 
CIG states that the facilities are located in Carbon County, Wyoming and consist of approximately 13.5 miles of 6-inch
and 2.3 miles of 4-inch lines two taps and side valves and a meter station. CIG states that the facilities will be sold
at their net book value at the time of the sale. It is stated that the net book value of the facilities on January 31, 1994
was $182,372.
CIG states that the Blue Gap Gathering System is remotely located from CIG's other facilities and this, coupled with
the system's small size, causes CIG to incur relatively high operating costs. It is stated that most of the volumes
flowing through the Blue Gap Gathering System are SOCO volumes and are transported into SOCO's Western Transmission
Corporation's system, an interstate pipeline. CIG further states that SOCO has other facilities in the area and for
this reason, SOCO is able to operate this system more efficiently than CIG. 
With regard to the Gas Transportation Agreement between CIG and Sinclair Oil Corporation (Sinclair) which provides
for transportation from the Blue Gas Gathering System (CIG's Rate Schedule X-41), CIG states that it was advised
that Sinclair has sold its properties from which it has in the past several years transported gas to CIG under the referenced
rate schedule. CIG states that on January 14, 1994 it filed to abandon this service in Docket No. CP94-186-000.
CIG states that it was advised that Sinclair shall use its existing interruptible agreement (see Docket No. ST94-412-000)
to transport its gas needs on CIG's transmission system to Sinclair's refineries. 
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before April 4,
1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. 
Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity.
If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing
is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. 
Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for CIG to appear or be represented
at the hearing.

<DOCTITLE>Minerals, Inc., Petition for Declaratory Order and Alternative Request for Extension and Waiver</DOCTITLE>


March 14, 1994.


Take notice that on March 8, 1994, Minerals, Inc. (Minerals), 600 E. John Carpenter Freeway, Irving, Texas 75062,
filed in Docket No. CP94-279-000 a petition for an order declaring that the facilities acquired by Minerals
are gathering facilities pursuant to section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act and therefore exempt from the Commission's
jurisdiction, all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.
It is stated that Minerals has recently purchased the gathering facilities of Llano, an intrastate pipeline with
facilities located in the State of New Mexico. Minerals states that since the date of acquisition, it has utilized
the acquired gathering facilities in conjunction with its processing, compression, treating and gas marketing
services, and is providing stand-alone gas gathering services for a number of producers.
Minerals states that the acquired facilities range in size from four inches to a maximum of twelve inches in diameter,
and have a combined total length of approximately 544 miles. It is stated that the facilities are connected to both
low- and high-pressure wells with flowing pressures ranging from 20 psig to a maximum of 600 psig. It is stated that
most of the gas is delivered unprocessed to the inlets of three processing plants connected to the acquired facilities:
the Hobbs Plant, the Antelope Ridge Plant and a processing plant owned and operated by American Pipeline Corporation,
an unrelated third party. It is further stated that the residue gas is delivered at the outlet of the plants to Llano's
intrastate pipeline facilities or to various interstate pipelines. In addition, it is stated that an average of 5,000
MMBtu per day and 3,500 MMBtu per day of unprocessed gas is delivered directly into the interstate pipeline facilities
of El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso) and Transwestern Pipeline Company, respectively, at the Rattlesnake Delivery
Point located on the southern end of the system, which deliveries will be terminated as soon as a pending interconnection
between El Paso and Llano is constructed and placed into operation.
Minerals seeks an order declaring and affirming that these facilities are gathering facilities, however, alternatively,
requests that it be granted an extension of time to file a petition for rate approval, in the event that the Commission
determines the facilities to be transmission facilities.
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said petition should on or before April 4, 1994,
file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance
with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211). All protests
filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve
to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.

Clean Air Act; Acid Rain Provisions



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Privately Offered Allowances for the 1994 EPA SO

2

 Allowance Auctions; the 1994 Direct Sale; and the Opening of the Allowance Tracking System Docket.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to title IV of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR part 73, the EPA is responsible for implementing a program to reduce
emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO

2

), a precursor of acid rain. The centerpiece of the SO

2

 control program is the allocation of transferable allowances, or authorizations to emit SO

2

, which are distributed in limited quantities for existing utility units and which eventually must be held by virtually
all utility units to cover their SO

2

 emissions. These allowances may be transferred among polluting sources and others, so that market forces may govern
their ultimate use and distribution, resulting in the most cost-effective sharing of the emissions control burden.



EPA is directed under section 416 of the Act to conduct annual sales and auctions of a small portion of allowances (2.8%)
withheld from the total allowances allocated to utilities each year. Sales and auctions are expected to stimulate
and support such a market in allowances and to provide a public source of allowances, particularly to new units for
which no allowances are allocated. In the Fall of 1992, EPA delegated the administration of the EPA allowance auctions
and sales to the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). The auctions and sales will be conducted under the regulations governing
the auctions and sales which were promulgated on December 17, 1991 (40 CFR part 73, subpart E). Today, the Acid Rain
Division is giving notice of (1) the total amount of allowances that will be auctioned in the second annual SO

2

 allowance auctions, which are scheduled for March 28, 1994; (2) the start date of the 1994 Direct Sale; and (3) the opening
of a docket to communicate information held in EPA's Allowance Tracking System. Notice of the date of the second annual
SO

2

 allowance auctions was previously given in the February 2, 1994 

Federal Register

, cite 59 FR 4919.



Auctions. 

Anyone can participate in the EPA auctions, and bidders are not restricted as to the quantity or price of their bid.
Allowances sold at the auctions will be sold to the highest bidder until no allowances remain. The 1994 auctions will
consist of one ``spot'' auction and two ``advance'' auctions. Allowances sold in the spot auction are usable for compliance
beginning in 1995. Allowances sold in the 6-year advance auction are useable for compliance beginning in 2000; allowances
sold in the 7-year advance auction are useable for compliance beginning in 2001. The 6-year advance auction will sell
the unsold allowances from the 1993 Direct Sale. The Act directs EPA to sell in the 1994 auctions any spot or advance
allowances that are offered by any Phase I or Phase II utility. However, offered will be sold after the allowances that
were withheld from the utilities, so offered allowances will consequently be sold at a lower price than the withheld
allowances. Owners of offered allowances may set a minimum price for their allowances. The number of withheld allowances
and offered allowances that are being sold in the 1994 auctions are listed in the table below. Bid Forms for the 1994
auctions must be received by the CBOT by the close of business on March 22, 1994.

Direct Sale.

 Anyone can participate in the EPA Direct Sale, and buyers are not restricted as to the quantity of their purchase request.
The 1994 Direct Sale will consist of one ``advance'' sale in which 25,000 allowances, first useable beginning in the
year 2001, will be available for purchase. These allowances will be sold for $1,677.88 each (this amount reflects
the $1,500 required price adjusted annually for inflation). The 1994 Direct Sale will run from June 1, 1994 to January
31, 1995. EPA will accept Direct Sale Application Forms during this time period. Buyers should not send payment with
their form; after EPA receives a Direct Sale Application Form, it will convey, in writing, the exact price for allowances
and payment instructions. Allowances from the Direct Sale will be sold on a first come, first served basis.


Allowance Tracking System Information Docket.

 A docket titled ``Allowance Tracking System Information,'' Docket number A-94-17, has been opened to
hold summary information from the Allowance Tracking System for public viewing and copying. The Docket is located
in room 1500 Waterside Mall, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Information will be available in the Docket beginning
Monday, March 21, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Lead Renovation and Remodeling Guidelines; Notice of Availability </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Availability and Request for Comment. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the availability for review and comment of EPA's draft renovation and remodeling (R&R)
guidelines document entitled ``Reducing Lead Hazards When Remodeling Your Home.'' This document is being developed
pursuant to Title IV, section 402(c)(1) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Section 402(c)(1) specifically,
mandates that EPA develop guidelines for homeowners and other persons who may engage in renovation and remodeling
activities. EPA is developing the R&R guidelines in response to Congressional concerns about the public's knowledge
of lead hazards when conducting R&R activities in homes. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The draft R&R guidelines text is available as an electronic file on the Federal Bulletin Board at 9 a.m. on the date
of publication in the 

Federal Register

. By modem dial 202-512-1387 or call 202-512-1530 for disks or paper copies. The document is
available in WordPerfect and ASCII formats.



 Under the Congressional mandate in section 402(c)(1) of TSCA, EPA has developed guidance for homeowners and building
occupants to alert them to potential lead hazards associated with renovation and remodeling activities (which may
create a risk of exposure to dangerous levels of lead). Congress specifically required that these guidelines be developed
for homes and buildings constructed prior to 1978. It is further mandated that these guidelines are to be distributed
through paint and hardware stores, employee organizations and trade groups, State and local agencies, and through
other appropriate means.

The Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics is seeking public comment on all aspects of the content and design of
the R&R Guidelines document.

In particular, EPA requests comment on the tone of the document, and the extent to which the current wording and design
tend to support (or undermine) its effectiveness as an informational tool. One issue that EPA has considered is the
need to balance technical accuracy with clarity and freedom from overly technical jargon. The extent to which the
current draft is clear and understandable is of primary concern to the Agency, given the broad distribution that the
document will have.

In addition to soliciting public input through this notice, EPA will conduct a series of focus group reviews on the
draft R&R guidelines document to evaluate the effectiveness of the current reading level, content, and graphic
presentation. EPA will include a summary of the focus groups' test results when it announces the availability of the
final R&R guidelines document in the 

Federal Register

.

EPA also recognizes that this lead hazard information may be important in some communities that may have a limited
ability to utilize information provided in English. For that reason, EPA is developing a Spanish language version
of the Guidelines document as well. The Spanish-language R&R guidelines document will be available after the
English version has been completed.

<DOCTITLE>Ozone Transport Commission; Recommendation That EPA Adopt Low Emission Vehicle Program for the Northeast Ozone
Transport Region </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability. 


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is announcing that on February 10, 1994, the Northeast Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) submitted a recommendation
to EPA for additional control measures to be applied throughout the Northeast Ozone Transport Region (OTR). Specifically,
the OTC has recommended that EPA require all State members of the OTC to adopt an Ozone Transport Commission Low Emission
Vehicle program for the entire OTR. The EPA is commencing a review of the recommendation to determine whether to approve,
disapprove, or partially approve and partially disapprove it. The Agency believes that its decision must be made
in the context of the Northeast States' overall ozone emission reduction needs to meet the ozone standard. The Agency
expects to consider the recommended measure as part of the overall attainment goal for the region, and anticipates
gathering information regarding the recommended measure as it relates to the overall attainment effort through
consultations and public hearings. 



The Agency will hold a public hearing before May 11, 1994, and will receive written comments until 30 days following
the public hearing. The Agency will consider all relevant data, views, and comments in responding to the recommendation.
The Agency will issue a second notice in the 

Federal Register

 in late March or early April 1994 that will provide specific information about the time and place of the public hearing
and more detail about the process EPA intends to follow in reaching a decision. EPA also expects, in the forthcoming


Federal Register

 notice, to describe a framework for reaching a decision and to identify and discuss significant issues. 


 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Northeast Ozone Transport Region (OTR) was established by operation of law under section 184 of the Clean Air Act
(the Act) and is comprised of the States of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, the District of Columbia, and the portion of Virginia
that is within the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas that includes the District of Columbia. 



These States include a large number of ozone nonattainment areas, which are classified under section 181 of the Act
into 4 categories with associated attainment dates: Marginal (1994); moderate (1996); serious (1999); and severe
(2005 or 2007). For moderate, serious, and severe ozone nonattainment areas, under section 182 of the Act the States
are obligated to submit demonstrations by November 15, 1994 that their State Implementation Plans (SIPs) will provide
for attainment of the ozone standard by the applicable dates. Congress established the OTR in the 1990 Amendments
to the Act based on the recognition that the transport of ozone and ozone precursors throughout the region may render
the Northeast States' attainment strategies interdependent.

Under section 184 of the Act, the Administrator established a Northeast Ozone Transport Commission for the OTR consisting
of the Governor of each State or their designees, the Administrator or her designee, the Regional Administrators
for the EPA regional offices affected (or the Administrator's designees), and an air pollution control official
representing each State in the region, appointed by the Governor.

Section 184(c) specifies a procedure for the OTC to develop recommendations for additional control measures to be
applied within all or a part of the OTR if the OTC determines that such measures are necessary to bring any area in the
OTR into attainment for ozone by the applicable dates in the Act. Section 184(c)(1) provides that:






Upon petition of any States within a transport region for ozone, and based on a majority vote of the Governors on the
Commission (or their designees), the Commission may, after notice and opportunity for public comment, develop recommendations
for additional control measures to be applied within all or a part of such transport region if the commission determines
such measures are necessary to bring any area in such region into attainment by the dates provided by [subpart II of
part D of title I of the Clean Air Act].






Section 184(c) also lays out procedures the Administrator is to follow in responding to recommendations from the
OTC. Upon receipt of the recommendations, the Administrator is to publish a 

Federal Register

 notice stating that the recommendations are available and providing an opportunity for a public hearing within 90
days. The Administrator is also to ``commence a review of the recommendations to determine whether the control measures
in the recommendations are necessary to bring any area in such region into attainment by the dates provided by [subpart
II] and are otherwise consistent with [the] Act.'' Finally, in undertaking her review, the Administrator is to consult
with members of the OTC and is to take into account the data, views, and comments received pursuant to the public hearing.

Last, sections 184(c)(4) and (5) govern EPA's response to the OTC recommendations. The Administrator is to determine
whether to approve, disapprove, or partially approve and partially disapprove the recommendations within nine
months of receipt. For any disapproval, the Administrator is to specify:






(i) Why any disapproved additional control measures are not necessary to bring any area in such region into attainment
by the dates provided by [subpart II] or are otherwise not consistent with the Act; and

(ii) Recommendations concerning equal or more effective actions that could be taken by the commission to conform
the disapproved portion of the recommendations to the requirements of [section 184].






Section 184(c)(5) provides that, upon approval or partial approval of any recommendations, the Administrator is
to issue to each State in the OTR to which an approved requirement applies a finding under section 110(k)(5) that the
State Implementation Plan (SIP) for that State is inadequate to meet the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D). Section
110(a)(2)(D) provides, in pertinent part, that each State's SIP shall contain adequate provisions:






(i) Prohibiting, consistent with the provisions of this title, any source or other type of emissions activity within
the State from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will_

(I) Contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other State with respect
to any such national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard.

Under section 184(c)(5), the Administrator's finding of inadequacy under section 110(a)(2)(D) is to require that
each affected State revise its SIP to include the approved additional control measures within one year after the finding
is issued.

The Administrator convened the OTC on May 7, 1991. Thereafter, the OTC moved to work toward a regional ozone strategy
with emphasis on consensus agreements to adopt regional measures to address the ozone problem in the Northeast. To
address the contribution of motor vehicles to the Northeast ozone problem, the OTC focused early on emissions standards
for new motor vehicles and on adoption of federal reformulated gasoline throughout the OTR as potential additional
control measures. The Clean Air Act, however, imposes certain limitations on the States' ability to adopt new motor
vehicle emissions standards.

Section 209 of the Act generally preempts States from establishing new motor vehicle emissions standards, leaving
such regulation to EPA under title II of the Act. Section 209 does, however, provide an exception for California to
adopt new motor vehicle emissions standards where the Administrator grants a preemption waiver based on a finding
that California's standards will be, ``in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable
Federal standards.'' Further, under section 177 of the Act, any State which has SIP provisions approved under part
D of title I may adopt and enforce new motor vehicle emission standards for any model year if:






(1) Such standards are identical to the California standards for which a waiver has been granted for such model year,
and

(2) California and such State adopt such standards at least two years before commencement of such model year (as determined
by regulations of the Administrator).






EPA has granted a waiver for California's ``Low Emission Vehicle'' program. This program generally calls for five
categories of vehicles meeting progressively more stringent emissions standards: California Tier I vehicles;
Transitional Low Emission Vehicles (TLEV); Low Emission Vehicles (LEV); Ultra-Low Emission Vehicles (ULEV); and
Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV). California has also established an overall non-methane organic gas (NMOG) standard
that each manufacturer must meet for its fleet of new vehicles in a particular model year by selling any combination
of vehicles certified by California as meeting standards for one of the five categories. In addition, under California's
program, at least 2% of each manufacturers' new vehicle fleet sold in California must be ZEV's by 1998, and 10% by 2003.

At its second meeting on July 16, 1991, the OTC adopted a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in which the State and District
of Columbia Representatives agreed that, in view of the significant contribution of motor vehicles to the Northeast
ozone problem, they all support California's Motor Vehicle Control Program, and call on their jurisdictions to cooperatively
evaluate the feasibility, air quality benefits, and associated costs of this Program in the OTR. At its third meeting
on October 29, 1991, the OTC States agreed to a further MOU providing that each OTC would take steps to implement California's
Low Emission Vehicle program as soon as possible. New York and Massachusetts are the only States that have fully adopted
the California LEV program in legislation and regulations without contingencies, and both States are set to implement
their programs. The automobile manufacturers' have challenged the legality of both programs and both lawsuits are
ongoing. Other States have adopted or are adopting the program contingent on regional program adoption, and the remaining
States are at various stages of the legislative or regulatory process to adopt the program.

In August 1993, Maine, Maryland, and Massachusetts petitioned the OTC to adopt a recommendation calling for the application
of the California LEV program throughout the OTR. During the fall of 1993, the OTC held a number of public forums in various
locations in the Northeast, and held a public hearing in Hartford, Connecticut on December 16-17, 1993. Finally,
at its winter meeting on February 1, 1994 in Washington, DC, the OTC voted by a 9 to 4 majority to recommend that EPA mandate
the California LEV program throughout the OTR. (The OTC refers to the program they recommend as ``OTC LEV.'') New Hampshire,
Virginia, Delaware, and New Jersey voted against the recommendation. The OTC's recommendation contains the following
elements:

(1) The OTC LEV program would be applicable to all 1999 and subsequent model year passenger cars and light duty trucks
in the OTR;

(2) Subject to certain very limited exceptions, all vehicles sold, imported, delivered, purchased, leased, rented,
acquired, received, or registered in the OTR that are subject to the OTC LEV program must be certified pursuant to a
California Air Resources Board (CARB) Executive Order;

(3) The OTC LEV program would allow the sale of the five categories of California vehicles: California Tier I, TLEV,
LEV, ULEV, and ZEV;

(4) Manufacturers could choose any combination of California certified vehicles to meet average NMOG fleet emission
standards in the OTR as follows: 






1999_0.113 g/mi 

2000_0.073 g/mi 

2001_0.070 g/mi 

2002_0.068 g/mi 

2003 and later_0.062 g/mi 






Regarding California's ZEV sales mandate, the OTC recommends that, to the extent it must apply to satisfy section
177, it shall apply. But if it is not required under section 177, the OTC recommends that the ``individual States within
the OTC may at their option include such a requirement and/or economic incentives designed to increase the sales of
ZEVs in the programs they adopt.'' 

(5) The effective date for the OTC LEV program would be January 1, 1996, allowing two vehicle model years prior to applicability
of the standards in 1999, but does not preclude earlier State implementation. 

EPA believes that its decision whether to approve the OTC's recommendation raises substantial and difficult questions
that must be made in the context of the Northeast States' overall emission reduction needs to attain the ozone standard.
The Agency thus believes that the scope of its review should be broad enough to encompass the context of the particular
LEV measure that the OTC recommends. The States are currently developing their overall strategy (including emissions
inventory work, modeling work, and analysis of the full range of potential control measures), in preparation for
the November 15, 1994 attainment demonstration deadline. The Agency believes that this November 15 deadline is critical
to the States' progress toward timely attainment. The Agency expects to undertake thorough consultations with the
members of the commission and the affected States, and to provide an opportunity for all interested members of the
public to provide data, views, and other information that may assist EPA in reaching a decision. The Agency believes
that, in determining whether the recommended LEV measure is ``necessary'' under section 184, it should consider
the measure as part of the overall emission reduction needs for the region, and anticipates gathering information
regarding the recommended measure as it relates to the overall emission reductions needs through consultations
and public hearings. The EPA urges those who intend to prepare testimony and written comments to begin considering
this issue in the context of the total attainment requirements for the region, and to provide comments on the overall
emission reduction needs of the region. 

As noted above, the Agency will provide a further 

Federal Register

 notice in late March or early April that will provide specific information about the time and place of the public hearing
and more detail about the process EPA intends to follow 
in reaching a decision. EPA also expects to describe a framework for reaching its decision and to discuss significant
issues for public comment in this forthcoming notice.

<DOCTITLE>Lindane; Proposed Decision not to Initiate a Special Review </DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces EPA's proposed decision not to initiate a Special Review of pesticide products containing
lindane. A Special Review was proposed based on contentions of irreversible kidney effects from certain lindane
exposure. EPA has determined that the kidney effects observed are specific to the male rat and are not relevant to human
health risk assessment; therefore, a Special Review is not appropriate.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice announces EPA's decision not to initiate a Special Review of lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane)
and sets forth the rationale for this proposed decision. In summary, EPA has reevaluated the concerns raised in the
September 18, 1985 preliminary notification to registrants and applicants in light of subsequent relevant information.
Based on this review, EPA has determined that a Special Review of lindane is not warranted based on its effects in the
male rat kidney. 


I. Introduction


A. Legal Background


A pesticide product may be sold or distributed in the United States only if it is registered or exempt from registration
under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended (7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.). Before a product
can be registered it must be shown that it can be used without causing ``unreasonable adverse effects on the environment''
(FIFRA section 3(c)(5), 7 U.S.C. 136a(c)(5)), that is, without causing ``any unreasonable risk to man or the environment,
taking into account the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of the use of the pesticide'' (FIFRA
section 2(bb), 7 U.S.C. 136(bb)). The burden of proving that a pesticide meets this standard for registration is,
at all times, on the proponent of initial or continued registration. If at any time the Agency determines that a pesticide
no longer meets this standard for registration, the Administrator may cancel this registration under FIFRA section
6, 7 U.S.C. 136d.
The Special Review process provides a mechanism to permit public participation in EPA's deliberations prior to issuance
of any Notice of Final Determination describing the regulatory action which the Administrator has selected. The
Special Review process, which was previously called the Rebuttable Presumption Against Registration (RPAR) process,
is described in 40 CFR part 154, published in the 

Federal Register

 of November 27, 1985 (50 FR 49015).
Prior to formal initiation of a Special Review, a preliminary notification is sent to registrants and applicants
for registration pursuant to 40 CFR 154.21 announcing that the Agency is considering commencing a Special Review.
If the Agency determines, after issuance of a preliminary notification pursuant to 40 CFR 154.21, that it will not
conduct a Special Review, it is required under 40 CFR 154.23 to issue a proposed decision to be published in the 

Federal Register

. That regulation requires that a period generally not less than 30 days be provided for public comment on the Proposed
Decision Not To Initiate a Special Review. Subsequent to receipt and evaluation of comments on the Proposed Decision
Not To Initiate a Special Review, the Administrator is required by 40 CFR 154.25 to publish in the 

Federal Register

 his/her final decision regarding whether or not a Special Review will be conducted.


B. Regulatory Background


Lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) is a broad-spectrum organochlorine insecticide/acaricide registered
for control of insects and other invertebrates on a wide variety of sites. Lindane is currently used for agricultural
crop seed treatments, livestock, hardwood lumber/logs, pecans, commercial ornamentals, and a variety of other
sites including households and structures, forest trees, pets, and assorted fruits and vegetables.
1. 

Special Review (1977-1983)

. The regulatory history of lindane includes a full Special Review based on questions of carcinogenicity, fetotoxicity/teratogenicity,
reproductive effects, its potential to cause blood dyscrasias, and acute toxicity to aquatic wildlife. Previous
Position Documents (PD) published on lindane include:
a. A PD-1 (which initiated a Special Review) in 1977, on the basis of carcinogenicity, chronic reproductive and fetotoxic
effects, and acute effects on aquatic organisms.
b. A PD-2/3 (which provided a full discussion of hazards, exposures, risks, benefits, regulatory options and a proposed
regulatory decision) in July 1980 proposed to cancel most of the uses of lindane. The proposal was based on a risk/benefit
determination which suggested that the risks considerably outweighed the benefits associated with lindane's continued
use. c. A PD-4 (final determination)/NOIC, published in the 

Federal Register

 of October 19, 1983 (48 FR 48512), presented EPA's final determination on lindane. It was based on a revised analysis
of the risks and benefits, following careful consideration of the comments EPA had received from the Scientific Advisory
Panel (SAP), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, members of the affected industries, and the general public. The
decision described in the PD-4/NOIC was quite different from the proposed decision in the PD-2/3. EPA originally
planned to cancel all of lindane's uses except for the commercial ornamental, livestock, and dog wash uses. The final
decision was to continue registration of most uses of lindane. The Agency cancelled the indoor uses of smoke fumigation
devices and the use of dog dips to control pests other than mites. All other uses were continued with various restrictions.
Those restrictions varied according to the degree of hazard associated with the use, but typical requirements included
protective clothing, label statements describing necessary precautions, and restrictions of some products to
certified pesticide applicators.
The carcinogenic effect was not rebutted by information submitted in response to the PD-4/NOIC. Following an Agency
risk/benefit analysis based on the carcinogenic risk, the registrations for lindane smoke fumigation devices for
indoor domestic use were phased out (with cancellation becoming effective May 1986), and lindane dog dips for the
control of pests other than mites were cancelled. The dog dip cancellation was challenged, and subsequently the dog
dip use for pests other than mites was permitted for commercial use (kennel, farm, and sport dog uses only) provided
additional precautions to limit applicator exposure appeared on the labeling. The PD-4/NOIC stated EPA's intent
to restrict certain lindane products to Certified Applicators or persons under their direct supervision. The restricted
uses include avocados, pecans, livestock sprays, forestry, Christmas trees, commercial ornamentals, structural
treatment, dog shampoos, and dog dusts. The PD4/NOIC also stated EPA's intent to require the use of protective clothing
for applicators using lindane products for seed treatment by manual means, livestock sprays, avocados, pecans,
forestry, Christmas trees, hardwood lumber, ornamentals, crawl space treatments, dog dips, and dog shampoos. 
2. 

Special Review Preliminary Notification (1985)

. Just prior to publication of the PD-4, the Agency received from the registrants of lindane a 90-day subchronic rat
feeding study showing kidney effects. In order to properly evaluate the study, a thorough review of the complete subchronic
and chronic data base was necessary. The Agency decided not to delay issuance of the PD-4 until this review was complete
because it did not want to delay the implementation of the regulatory measures outlined in the PD4. Pursuant to 40 CFR
154.21, on September 18, 1985, EPA notified registrants and applicants for registrations for lindane that it was
considering initiating a new Special Review based on the study results showing kidney effects. This notification,
which is the subject of today's notice, noted the Agency's concern for workers who are exposed to lindane for the forestry
and uninhabited building uses. Registrants and applicants for registration were given 30 days to comment on the Agency's
proposal to commence a Special Review for certain uses including forestry and warehouses. Registrants requested
and received a 3-week extension for submitting comments.
Registrant rebuttal comments were submitted by Centre International d'Etudes du Lindane (CIEL) on October 22, 1985.
(CIEL represents all lindane registrants holding U.S. registrations for the insecticide lindane). These comments
will be briefly addressed in Unit III. of this notice. Furthermore, a Registration Standard was scheduled to be issued
which would include a complete review of lindane's general toxic effects. 
3. 

Registration Standard.

 A Registration Standard was published on lindane in September 1985 (EPA RS-85-027) and reflected a reassessment
of the data base used in the Special Review for lindane as well as a review of all other data available to the Agency, including
the 90-day subchronic rat feeding study.
Based on a comprehensive rereview of previous submissions and some new data, the Agency determined that for most use
sites, the benefits of use of lindane exceeded the risks, so long as the precautions mandated by the PD-4 were adhered
to. As discussed above, potential unacceptable risks to workers were calculated for spray uses for forestry and warehouses
(uninhabited buildings and empty storage bins) based on irreversible kidney toxicity observed in the rat 90-day
feeding study. 
4. 

Section 6(f) Notice

. A notice, published in the 

Federal Register

 of November 17, 1993 (58 FR 60630), pursuant to section 6(f)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
Act (FIFRA), announced EPA's receipt of requests from a number of registrants to voluntarily amend registrations
of pesticide products containing lindane to delete certain uses. The section 6(f) notice included one site (uninhabited
buildings) which is also a subject of today's notice.


II. Risk Concerns Underlying Preliminary Notification


A. Toxicity Concerns


The Registration Standard discussed the results of the subchronic 90-day feeding study in the rat which showed that
lindane causes adverse pathological effects (i.e., lesions), primarily in the kidney of male rats, but also in the
liver of male and female rats. Kidney lesions were not completely reversed after allowing 6 weeks for recovery on a
lindane-free diet. No adverse effects on kidney structure in fe2male rats were noted. Renal changes, which included
tubular degeneration, hyaline droplets, tubular casts, tubular distention, interstitial nephritis, and basophilic
tubules, were stated to be irreversible with a no-observable-effect level (NOEL) of 4 parts per million (ppm) in the
diet equivalent to 0.3 milligram per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg/day). Hepatocellular hypertrophy was
noted at the same lowest effect level (LEL) as the kidney lesions. The liver toxicity results from the increased need
to produce enzymes to detoxify lindane and are considered a typical response and defensive mechanism to the presence
of foreign substances. The liver toxicity was not regarded as a specific response to lindane.


B. Exposure


The September 18, 1985 preliminary notification to affected registrants and applicants stated that the Agency's
concerns were limited to exposure from two uses: forestry and warehouse (uninhabited buildings and empty storage
bins). The Margins of Exposure (MOE) for forestry applicator/mixer/loaders and for warehouse applicators were
11 and 20, respectively. MOE's for forestry applicator uses ranged from 20 to 90. Applicators, mixers, and loaders
were assumed to follow precautions on the registered labels current at that time. The notification indicated that
the Agency would consider all comments in its determination of whether to initiate a Special Review of pesticide products
containing lindane. Since the issuance of the preliminary notification, the Agency has determined that the kidney
effects do not meet the risk criteria for initiation of Special Review. Because EPA no longer believes there is a kidney-related
hazard posed to humans, a discussion of exposure will not be presented. A more detailed discussion of the exposure
assessment used as a basis for the September 18, 1985 preliminary notification may be found in the Registration Standard.


III. New Information


After the initial demonstration that lindane produces kidney lesions, the Agency required and received 90-day subchronic
inhalation studies in rats (HED Document No.: 005059, April 25, 1986), and mice (HED Document No.: 007304, June 30,
1989), dermal studies in rats (HED Document No.: 007189, May 18, 1989) and rabbits (HED Document No.: 008610, September
27, 1991) and a chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study in rats (HED Document Nos.: 007461, August 30, 1989 and 009909,
December 30, 1992). In summary, only studies in rats demonstrated the occurrence of lesions in the kidneys, and only
the males were affected. There was no evidence that the kidneys of mice, rabbits, or female rats were similarly affected.
After publication of the Registration Standard, the Agency received a 90-day rat subchronic inhalation study with
lindane which was written in German. Translations of this study indicated a NOEL for the kidney changes of 0.1 mg/cubic
meter. The kidney lesions noted were transient in nature and were not noted in rats after allowing 6 weeks for a recovery
phase. The study results did not demonstrate any signs of kidney dysfunction.
The chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study did not indicate any evidence of lindane-induced kidney tumors or preneoplastic
lesions. However, the characteristic nonneoplastic lesions produced by a protein (Alpha 2

u

-Globulin (

a

2

u

-g)), found in the kidneys of male rats which induces kidney effects were present. For example, one aspect of this study
included a chemical analysis of the kidney for increased levels of the 

a

2

u

-g protein. Clear and pronounced increases in this protein were demonstrated in a dose-related manner (HED Document
No.: 007859, April 10, 1990). Independent industrial and academic researchers had, a few years earlier, reported
similar effects in the male rat kidney due to responses to certain chlorinated hydrocarbons and other chemicals.
A pattern of effects emerged that indicated that only the male rat kidney, but not the kidney of female rats or the male
and female kidneys of other species, was affected by this special group of chemicals. This particular kidney lesion
was ultimately demonstrated to be linked to the potential for this special group of chemicals to increase levels of


a

2

u

-g. This special group of chemicals apparently bind the 

a

2

u

-g in such a manner that it is not excreted in the urine but accumulates in the kidney of male rats and ultimately causes
pathological lesions. For some, but not all, 

a

2

u

-g binding chemicals, the pathological condition progresses to neoplasia (kidney tumors). Thus, consistent with
the chemical structure of lindane, animal models and analytical chemistry, lindane was demonstrated to be a classical
example of an 

a

2

u

-g-inducing kidney pathogen in the male rat kidney. 
The Agency published a document outlining the policy for risk assessment for chemical agents that affect the male
rat kidney through the 

a

2

u

-g mechanism (refer to document EPA/625/391/019F, September 1991, Risk Assessment Forum Monograph entitled ``Alpha2u-Globulin:
Association with Chemically Induced Renal Toxicity and Neoplasia in the Male Rat''). Consistent with this policy,
chemicals which cause lesions in the male rat kidney through the 

a

2

u

-g mechanism exclusively are not regulated on the basis for their potential to cause kidney effects in male rats. 


IV. Comments Received on Preliminary Notifications


The Centre Internationale d'Etudes du Lindane (CIEL), which represents all the lindane registrants, commented
in detail on the Agency's preliminary notification. The main points of CIEL's comments and the Agency's responses
are summarized below.


CIEL Comment

: CIEL challenged the Agency's claim that lindane exposure produced irreversible renal effects in rats by pointing
out that the 90-day subchronic data show a trend toward reversibility of renal effects; only the lack of a longer recovery
period in the study prevented a full reversibility of renal changes.


Agency Response

: After reinspecting the pathology report and data sheets, the Agency concurs with CIEL that the kidney pathology
should not be described as permanent or irreversible, but that the term ``slowly reversible'' more appropriately
describes the effect. Although some signs of pathology are evident after a 6-week recovery period, the intensity
or severity is much reduced and there is no tubular degeneration, the lesion that was considered to be the most serious.
In addition, the Agency believes that the kidney effects were the result of 

a

2

u

-g and are specific to male rats and not found in other species.


CIEL Comments

: The MOE values should be increased by a factor of 5 to 10 because the rats in the 90-day study received oral administration
of lindane, whereas the lindane applicators for the uses in question have mainly dermal exposure. CIEL commented
that there is a 5- to 10-fold lower acute toxicity after dermal exposure than after oral administration.


Agency Response:

 The Agency's original review of existing studies on lindane indicated that there were no adequate studies to assess
lindane toxicity through the dermal route of application. Therefore, the Agency required that registrants perform
additional studies to clarify this point. A rat dermal toxicity study was submitted on May 18, 1989, and a rabbit dermal
toxicity study on September 27, 1991. These studies support the hypothesis that lindane induces a lesion specific
to the male rat kidney. The Agency will use the 90-day dermal toxicity studies for future risk assessments.


CIEL Comment

: Studies on humans, including occupational exposure, revealed no kidney damage.


Agency Response:

 The Agency originally determined that the results of the studies on human occupational exposure were inconclusive.
Although the studies reporting the results of human exposure did not include specific kidney function tests, the
available data indicate that individuals potentially exposed to lindane did not develop overt kidney functional
changes. Although two studies showed decreases in levels of blood creatinine and increases in reticulocytes and
polymorphonuclear leukocytes relative to controls, it is not conclusive that these changes were the direct result
of exposure to lindane per se. However, the epidemiology studies have several weaknesses which include a small number
of subjects, failure to report the health status of absentees at the time the blood samples were taken, and failure
to test for subtle changes in kidney functions. Also, pathological changes in the kidney may occur in the absence of
overt functional changes; the studies designed could not assess this possibility. The Agency has no evidence that
human kidney function has been affected by lindane. 


CIEL Comment

: The Agency's estimates of applicator exposure are inaccurate because: (1) For forestry uses, the estimates are
based on a surrogate study using grassland application (Lavy et al., 1980), rather than forest trees; (2) the forestry
use exposure figure should be 1.3 mg/hour with a dermal absorption of 5 percent; and (3) for warehouse exposure, a study
with aerosol application should be used instead of the surrogate DDT fan-type spray study used by the Agency to estimate
exposure.


Agency Response:

 Regarding points (1) and (2), the Agency's assessment for forestry use of lindane utilized three surrogate studies
in addition to the study by Lavy et al., in order to increase replicates and minimize bias that could result from the
selection of a single surrogate study. The Lavy et al. study had a number of weaknesses by Agency standards, including
failure to specify the height of application; brush application when backpack equipment was used; failure to measure
hand dermal exposure (often an appreciable part of the total dermal exposure); and failure to measure exposure to
the legs. 
The Agency's mean value of 5.3 milligrams per hour is considered reasonable, given the degree of variability inherent
in exposure studies. The Agency is not aware of any dermal absorption study showing 5 percent dermal absorption and
therefore assumed a dermal absorption of 10 percent based on data on liquid formulations as described in the preliminary
determination (PD 2/3) of the earlier Special Review of lindane. EPA still considers the 10 percent dermal absorption
factor appropriate. Risk assessments, however, should be based on the 90-day dermal studies.
Regarding point (3) in which CIEL claims that a study using an aerosol sprayer would be more appropriate for warehouse
exposure assessment, the Agency realizes that the aerosol characteristics are partially dependent on the type of
equipment used. However, there is no evidence that a very fine spray is used for storage bin application; in fact, the
label of one registered product instructs the user to apply the material as a coarse spray, not a fine aerosol as claimed
by CIEL. Therefore, after careful consideration of the CIEL's comments about exposure, the Agency believes that
the exposure estimate used to calculate the MOE's were reasonable and appropriate for the forestry and warehouse
uses.


V. Agency's Decision Regarding Special Review


At this time, the Agency proposes not to initiate a Special Review of pesticide products containing lindane based
on the male rat kidney effects. EPA has concluded that any renal lesions in male rats observed in connection with 

a

2

u

-g accumulation is a species-specific effect that is not relevant to human risk assessment. The Agency agrees that
the evidence as provided in the 90-day subchronic rat study does not raise as great a concern regarding lindane as originally
suspected. The available evidence does not establish a credible relationship between lindane and potential renal
effects in humans. In conclusion, the Agency has determined that it is not appropriate to conduct a Special Review
of lindane based on male rat renal effects. 
The Agency is reexamining its assessment of lindane's potential to cause liver tumors in mice and developmental toxicity
in rats. Lindane is currently classified by the Office of Research and Development Carcinogenicity Assessment Group
(ORD CAG, July 23, 1985) as a ``B2-C'' (a probable-to- possible carcinogen) based on liver tumors primarily from reports
in the published literature. Based on these data CAG provided a cancer potency Q1

*

 of (1.1 mg/kg/day)

-1

 for risk assessment. The Office of Pesticide Program's Health Effects Division (HED) Reference Dose (RFD) Committee
Peer Review met on July 8, 1993, and determined that while the available mouse studies with lindane provide some information,
there are no mouse carcinogenicity studies which meet current criteria for acceptability for regulatory purposes.
Thus, the reevaluation of lindane for carcinogenicity classification is pending receipt and review of a new mouse
carcinogenicity study to be conducted under current guideline criteria which will be required in the form of a Data
Call In (DCI) to be published in the near future.
The committee also determined that a developmental neurotoxicity study should be conducted to assess the effects
of lindane on the development of the nervous system as previous studies suggest that lindane is able to cross the placenta
and to be a neurotoxicant. This data request will also be included in the above-mentioned DCI. 
Upon receipt and review of the above studies, if such review indicates any remaining concerns, EPA could initiate
a Special Review or take other appropriate regulatory action.


VI. Public Comment Opportunity and Public Docket


The Agency is providing a 60-day period to comment on this notice. Comments must be submitted by May 17, 1994. All comments
and information should be submitted in triplicate to the address given in this notice under ADDRESSES above. The comments
and information should bear the identifying notation OPP-30000/10H. After receipt and evaluation of comments on
this notice, the Agency will issue a final decision in the 

Federal Register

 regarding whether or not a Special Review will be conducted.
The Agency has established a public docket (OPP-30000/10H) for this proposal for not initiating a Special Review
of Lindane. This public docket will include this notice, any other notices pertinent to the Agency's decision regarding
the Special Review of Lindane, non-CBI documents and copies of written comments or other materials submitted to the
Agency in response to the pre-special review registrant notifications and this notice regarding Special Review
of Lindane, and a current index of materials in the public docket.

<DOCTITLE>Certain Chemicals Approval of a Test Marketing Exemption</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces EPA's approval of an application for test marketing exemption (TME) under section 5(h)(1)
of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and 40 CFR 720.38. EPA has designated this application as TME-94-5.
The test marketing conditions are described below.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 5(h)(1) of TSCA authorizes EPA to exempt persons from premanufacture notification (PMN) requirements and
permit them to manufacture or import new chemical substances for test marketing purposes if the Agency finds that
the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of the substances for test marketing purposes
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. EPA may impose restrictions on
test marketing activities and may modify or revoke a test marketing exemption upon receipt of new information which
casts significant doubt on its finding that the test marketing activity will not present an unreasonable risk of injury.


EPA hereby approves TME-94-5. EPA has determined that test marketing of the new chemical substance described
below, under the conditions set out in the TME application, and for the time period and restrictions specified below,
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. The Production volume and the number
of customers must not exceed that specified in the application. All other conditions and restrictions, including
the stated use and the worker protection provisions described in the application, in the accompanying Material Safety
Data Sheet, and in this notice must be met. 
Inadvertently, notice of receipt of the application was not published. Therefore, an opportunity to submit comments
is being offered at this time. The complete nonconfidential document is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information
Center (NCIC), Rm. ETG-102 at the above address between 12:00 noon and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding
legal holidays. EPA may modify or revoke the test marketing exemption if comments are received which cast significant
doubt on its finding that the test marketing activities will not present an unreasonable risk of injury. 
The following additional restrictions apply to TME-94-5. 
1.  A bill of lading accompanying each shipment must state that the use of the substance is restricted to that
approved in the TME. 
2.  During manufacturing and processing of the substance at any site controlled by the Company, any person
under the control of the Company, including employees and contractors, who may be exposed to the substance shall use
a NIOSH-approved respirator.
3.  The applicant must ensure that employees are provided with information and training on the TME substance.
This information and training must be provided at the time of each employee's initial assignment to a work area containing
the TME substance and whenever the substance is introduced into the employee's work area for the first time. 
4.  The company must affix a label to each container of the substance or formulations containing the substance
during manufacturing and processing. The label shall include, at a minimum, the following statement: 




WARNING:

 Breathing of this substance may be harmful. Chemicals similar in structure to (insert appropriate name) have been
found to cause genetic defects. To protect yourself, you must wear a NIOSH-approved respirator. 




5.  If the applicant wishes to distribute the TME substance outside the Company for purposes of processing,
the applicant must obtain in writing from the outside processor, an agreement to comply with the same worker protection,
worker training, and labeling requirements applicable to the applicant.
6.  The applicant shall maintain the following records until 5 years after the date they are created, and shall
make them available for inspection or copying in accordance with section 11 of TSCA:
 a.  Records of the quantity of the TME substance produced and the date of manufacture.
 b.  Records of dates of the shipments to each customer and the quantities supplied in each shipment.
 c.  Copies of the labels affixed to containers of the substance or formulations containing the substance.
 d.  Copies of the bill of lading that accompanies each shipment of the TME substance.
 e.  A copy of the written agreements with processors outside the Company agreeing to comply with the
same worker protection, worker training, and labeling requirements applicable to the applicant.




T-94-5 






Date of Receipt:

 December 27, 1993. The extended comment period will close April 4, 1994.


Applicant:

 Confidential.


Chemical:

 (G) Complex reaction product of 

t

-butyl, dihydroxycarbopolycycle and bis (dimethylaminosubstituted) carbomonocyle. 


Use:

 (G) Internal component of manufactured contained use - consumer article.


Production Volume:

 900 kg.


Number of Customers:

 Confidential.


Test Marketing Period:

 Eighteen months. Commencing on first day of commercial manufacture.


Risk Assessment:

 EPA identified human health concerns for mutagenicity based on data on an analogous chemical substance. However,
the health concerns were mitigated by requiring workers potentially exposed to the TME substance via inhalation
to wear a NIOSH-approved respirator. EPA identified aquatic toxicity based on analogous substance. However, during
manufacturing, processing, and or use, the PMN substance is not expected to be released to the aquatic environment
in significant amounts. Therefore, the Agency has determined that the test market activities will not present an
unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.
The Agency reserves the right to rescind approval or modify the conditions and restrictions of an exemption should
any new information come to its attention which casts significant doubt on its finding that the test marketing activities
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.

<DOCTITLE>Final Decisions by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on the List of Sources Identified by the State of Idaho,
Under Section 304(l) of the Clean Water Act as Amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Public notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 



I. Description of Section 304(l) Requirements 



Section 304(l) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) required every state to develop lists of waters impaired by pollutants,
along with a list of sources discharging toxic pollutants to the impaired waters. More recently, the EPA amended its
interpretation of section 304(l) in response to a decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. This amendment required
all states to revisit their previous list of section 304(l) sources and add to their list in accordance with EPA's broader
interpretation of section 304(l). EPA originally interpreted the statute to require states to identify point sources
that discharge toxic pollutants to the waters on the 304(l)(1)(B) list or ``short list''. In response to the remand,
EPA amended the regulation to require states to identify point sources discharging toxic pollutants to waters on
any of the 304(l) waterbody lists. 



II. The USEPA's Final Decisions on 304(l) Lists for the State of Idaho 



In 1991, the U.S. EPA approved, after public comment, the lists of waters and sources for the State of Idaho under section
304(l). In the decisions pertaining to this notice, EPA has approved that no additional listings or changes to Idaho's
section 304(l)(1)(C) list of sources is warranted based on the modified interpretation of Section 304(l). 



III. How To Obtain a Copy of the U.S. EPA's Decisions and the Administrative Record and Make Comment 



The U.S. EPA's decisions with regard to reviewing the lists of sources under section 304(l) are available to the public
for review and comment. To obtain copies of these decisions and supporting information, contact Ms. Connie Robinson;
WD-139, USEPA, Region X; 1200 Sixth Avenue; Seattle, Washington 98101 (telephone 206/553-1086). Comments
should be provided to Ms. Connie Robinson no later than April 18, 1994. 

The administrative record containing the USEPA's documentation on its review and final decision is on file and may
be inspected at the USEPA, Region X office between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday except holidays.
To make arrangements to examine the administrative record, contact the person named above.

Order Terminating Temporary Waiver Relief for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and Request for Comments


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Appraisal Subcommittee, Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Order terminating temporary waiver relief and request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Appraisal Subcommittee (``ASC'') of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (``FFIEC'') is
issuing an order finding that a scarcity of certified or licensed appraisers resulting in significant delays in obtaining
the services of such appraisers no longer exists in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (``CNMI'').
Therefore, the ASC is terminating the temporary waiver relief from State appraiser certification and licensing
requirements granted CNMI in the ASC's Final Order Granting Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Temporary
Waiver Relief (``Relief Order''), which was adopted on February 17, 1993, and published at 58 FR 11235 (February 24,
1993). In accordance with ASC rules and regulations, the ASC is requesting comments from interested members of the
public on this action, and, in the absence of ASC action to the contrary, this finding of waiver termination automatically
will become final 21 calendar days after the close of the comment period. The ASC also is extending the February 28,
1994 termination date stated in the Relief Order to the final termination date specified below.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background


A. Relevant Statutory Provisions and Regulations


As of January 1, 1993, Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (``FIRREA''),
as amended,
 required all federally regulated financial institutions to use State licensed or certified real estate appraisers,
as appropriate, to perform appraisals in federally related transactions. See Section 1119(a) of Title XI, 12 U.S.C.
3348(a). Thus, each State, territory and the District of Columbia (``State'') should have had in place at that time
its entire regulatory scheme for certifying, licensing and supervising real estate appraisers.




Section 1119(b) of Title XI, 12 U.S.C. 3348(b), provides the ASC and the States with a degree of flexibility in dealing
with extraordinary circumstances that may occur. The Section enables the ASC to waive, on a temporary basis and with
the FFIEC's concurrence, any State certification or licensing requirement on a written finding that: (1) ``There
is a scarcity of certified or licensed appraisers to perform appraisals in connection with federally related transactions'';
and (2) that the scarcity is ``leading to significant delays in the performance of such appraisals.'' Temporary waivers
terminate when the ASC ``determines that such * * * delays have been eliminated.''
ASC Rule 1102.2, 12 CFR 1102.2 (1993), requires a State appraiser regulatory agency (``State agency'') to address
seven informational areas when requesting temporary waiver relief. The ASC then must publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 respecting the received request and must give interested persons 30 calendar days from its publication in which to
submit written comments. The ASC must grant or deny a waiver in whole, in part, or upon specific terms and conditions,
within 45 calendar days of the date of publication of the notice in the 

Federal Register

. The ASC retains significant flexibility in the case of an emergency.
Rule 1102.7, 12 CFR 1102.7 (1993), relates to the termination of temporary waiver orders. The ASC at any time may terminate
such an order on a finding that: (1) The ``significant delays in obtaining'' certified or licensed appraiser services
``no longer exist''; or (2) the ``terms and conditions of the waiver order are not being satisfied.'' The ASC is required
under the Rule to publish its waiver termination finding in the 

Federal Register

 and to solicit public comments on the finding for at least 30 calendar days. Absent further ASC action, the finding
becomes final automatically 21 calendar days after the end of the commend period.

B. Procedural Status



On December 21, 1992, the ASC received a letter of December 16, 1992, from CNMI's Governor requesting a one-year waiver,
from January 1 through December 31, 1993, of the requirement to use certified or licensed real estate appraisers within
CNMI. Because of the immediacy of the January 1, 1993 implementation date of Title XI and the facts represented in the
Governor's letter, the ASC, on December 31, 1992, issued an order both granting CNMI emergency interim temporary
waiver relief and soliciting public comment on the request. The interim order was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 6, 1993 at 58 FR 551. No comments were received, and the ASC approved the issuance of the Relief Order on February
17, 1993. The next day, the Chairman of the FFIEC, pursuant to delegated authority, concurred in the ASC's determination,
and the Relief Order was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 24, 1993. The ASC found that a scarcity of State certified and licensed appraisers existed on CNMI and that
significant delays in obtaining the services of such appraisers were being experienced. Accordingly, the ASC ordered
temporary waiver relief for CNMI for the period of February 22, 1993, through February 28, 1994, subject to three conditions
described below. 

During the period of temporary waiver relief, the federally regulated lenders specified in Section 1120 of Title
XI, 12 U.S.C. 3349, could use appraisers who are not licensed or certified so long as appraisals are performed in a manner
that is consistent with the appraisal regulations, requirements, guidelines and standards of the appropriate Federal
financial institutions regulatory agency, as defined in section 1122(6) of Title XI, 12 U.S.C. 3350(6).



III. Compliance With the Relief Order



CNMI, through its Board of Professional Licensing (``Board''), has fully complied with the three conditions of the
Relief Order. Specifically, CNMI has taken appropriate steps during the temporary waiver period to alleviate the
scarcity of State certified and licensed appraisers in CNMI and the significant delays in obtaining the services
of those appraisers and has provided the ASC the three required monitoring reports on a timely basis. In addition,
CNMI undertook to notify the ASC promptly of any circumstances that might adversely affect CNMI's compliance with
the Relief Order.
According to CNMI's monitoring reports and other contacts between the ASC and the Board, the Board contracted with
a firm on March 26, 1993, to provide appropriate prelicensure/certification education meeting Appraiser Qualification
Board standards to persons desiring to become CNMI licensed or certified real estate appraisers. As of January 12,
1994, the Board reported that it has issued credentials to two licensed appraisers, one certified residential appraiser
and six certified general appraisers, and eight more persons have become qualified to take the next-scheduled Certified
General Real Estate Appraiser Examination. CNMI's Board also reported that it has requested the same firm to submit
a proposal to offer appropriate continuing education courses to CNMI licensed or certified appraisers. In short,
CNMI believes that a scarcity of certified or licensed appraisers leading to significant delays in the performance
of appraisals in connection with federally related transactions no longer exists.



IV. Conclusion



On the basis of the foregoing, the ASC finds that a scarcity of certified or licensed appraisers leading to significant
delays in the performance of appraisals in connection with federally related transactions no longer exists on CNMI.
The ASC requests comment on this finding for a 30 calendar day period and orders the termination of temporary waiver
relief to be effective on a final basis 21 calendar days after the close of the comment period, absent further ASC action
in the interim. The ASC also orders an extension of the original February 28, 1994 termination date to coincide with
the final date of temporary waiver termination as determined under this Order. Thereafter, federally regulated
lenders will be required to use real estate appraisers who are temporarily or permanently licensed or certified by
CNMI to perform appraisals in connection with federally related transactions.

<DOCTITLE>Change in Solicitation Procedures Under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
agency:

 Office of Acquisition Policy, GSA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 Title VII of the ``Business Opportunity Development Act of 1988'' (Pub. L. 100-656) established the Small Business
Competitiveness Demonstration Program and designated nine (9) agencies, including GSA, to conduct the program
over a four (4) year period from January 1, 1989 to December 31, 1992. The Small Business Opportunity Enhancement Act
of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-366) extended the demonstration program until September 1996 and made certain changes
in the procedures for operation of the demonstration program. The law designated four (4) industry groups for testing
whether the competitive capabilities of the specified industry groups will enable them to successfully compete
on an unrestricted basis. The four (4) industry groups are: Construction (except dredging); architectural and engineering
(A&E) services (including surveying and mapping); refuse systems and related services (limited to trash/garbage
collection); and non-nuclear ship repair. Under the program, when a participating agency misses its small business
participation goal, restricted competition is reinstituted only for those contracting activities that failed
to attain the goal. The small business goal is 40 percent of the total contract dollars awarded for construction, trash/garbage
collection services, and non-nuclear ship repair and 35 percent of the total contract dollars awarded for architect-engineer
services. This notice announces modifications to GSA's solicitation practices under the demonstration program
based on a review of the agency's performance during the period from January 1, 1993 to December 31, 1993. Modifications
to solicitation practices are outlined in the Supplementary Information section below and apply to solicitations
issued on or after April 1, 1994.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>

in SIC 1794 issued by GSA contracting activities in Regions 2, 3, and 5 will be set aside for small business when there

Jersey, New York, and the territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

<DOCTITLE>Performance Review Boards for Small Client Agencies Serviced by the General Services Administration, Names of Members
</DOCTITLE>



Section 4314 (C) (1) through (5) of Title 5 U.S.C., requires each agency to establish, in accordance with regulations
prescribed by the office of Personnel Management, one or more Performance Review Boards. The board shall review and
evaluate the initial appraisal by the supervisor of a senior executive's performance, along with any recommendations
to the appointing authority relative to the performance of the senior executive. The Performance Review Board also
shall make recommendations as to whether the career executive should be recertified, conditionally recertified,
or not recertified. 

As provided under Section 601 of the Economy Act of 1932, amended 31 U.S.C. 1525, the General Services Administration
through its Customer Service Branch, Personnel Division, provides various personnel management services to a number
of diverse Presidential commissions, committees, boards and other agencies through reimbursable administrative
support agreements. This notice is processed on behalf of the client agencies, and it supersedes all other notices
in the 

Federal Register

 on this subject. 

Because of their small size, a Performance Review Board register has been established in which SES members from the
client agencies participate. The Board is composed of SES members from various agencies. From this register of names,
the head of each client agency will appoint executives to a specific board to serve a particular client agency. 

The members whose names appear on the Performance Review Board standing roster to serve client agencies are:

H. Notification Under Executive Order 12372 


This program is covered under Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' and 45 CFR
part 100, ``Intergovernmental Review of Department of Health and Human Services Programs and Activities.'' Under
the Order, States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance under
covered programs. 

All States and Territories except Alaska, Alabama, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa and Palau have elected
to participate in the Executive Order (E.O.) process and have established Single Points of Contact (SPOCs). Applicants
from these seventeen jurisdictions need take no action regarding E.O. 12372. Otherwise, applicants should contact
their SPOCs as soon as possible to alert them of the prospective applications and to receive any necessary instructions.
Applicants must submit any required material to the SPOCs as soon as possible so that the program office can obtain
and review SPOC comments as part of the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all required materials,
if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal (or the date of contact if no submittal is required) on the
Standard Form 424, item 16a. Under 45 CFR 100.8(a)(2), a SPOC has 60 days from this application deadline date to comment
on proposed new or competing continuation awards. SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements
as official recommendations. 
Additionally, SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between mere advisory comments and those official state
process recommendations which they intend to trigger the ``accommodate or explain'' rule. 
When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to the Department of Health and Human Services,
Administration for Children and Families, Office of Community Services, Division of State Assistance, 370 L'Enfant
Promenade, SW., Washington, DC 20447. A list of the Single Points of Contact for each State and Territory is included
as Attachment A of this announcement. 


I. Paperwork Reduction Act 


Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Public Law 96-511, all Departments are required to submit to the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval any reporting or record-keeping requirement inherent in a
proposed or final rule, or program announcement. This program announcement contains information collection requirements
in sections (F) and (G), which require that certain information must be provided in an annual report and as part of a
grantee's application. We estimate that all of the information requirements for this program will take each grantee
approximately 6 hours to complete. As there are 53 projected grantees, the total number of hours annually will be 318.

Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirement should direct
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, New Executive Office Building (room 308), Washington,
DC, 20503, Attention: Desk Officer for the Administration for Children and Families. 


J. Certifications 


Applicants must comply with the required certifications found at Attachments B, C, and D, as follows: 



Pursuant to 45 CFR part 93, the Anti-Lobbying Certification and Disclosure Form must be signed and submitted with
the application. If applicable, a standard form LLL, which discloses lobbying payments must be submitted. 
Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace Requirements and Certification Regarding Debarment: The signature
on the application by a Coalition official responsible for the administration of the program attests to the applicant's
intent to comply with the Drug-Free Workplace Requirements and compliance with the Debarment Certification. The
Drug-Free Workplace and Debarment Certifications do not have to be returned with the application.

A. Legislative Authority 


Title III of the Child Abuse Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-457, 42 U.S.C. 10401 et seq.) is entitled the ``Family
Violence Prevention and Services Act'' (the Act). It was first implemented in FY 1986 and was reauthorized and amended
for fiscal years 1993 through 1995 by Congress in May 1992 by Public Law 102-295. 
The purposes of this legislation are to assist States in supporting the establishment, maintenance, and expansion
of programs and projects to prevent incidents of family violence and provide immediate shelter and related assistance
for victims of family violence and their dependents. 
Both State and Indian tribal grantees are required to use not less than 70 percent of funds awarded for the purpose of
providing immediate shelter and related assistance and not less than 25 percent of the funds are to be distributed
for the purpose of providing related assistance as defined in section 303(f). 


B. Background 


During FY 1993, 139 family violence prevention grants were made to States, Territories, and Indian Tribes; the Department
also made 51 family violence prevention grant awards to nonprofit State domestic violence coalitions. In response
to the information and technical assistance needs of the family violence community the Department has established
the National Resource Center for Domestic Violence (NRC) and three Special Issue Resource Centers (SIRC). The purpose
of the NRC and the SIRCs is to provide resource information, training, and technical assistance to Federal, State,
and Native American agencies, as well as to local domestic violence prevention programs and to other professionals
who provide services to victims of domestic violence. 
In addition to the resource center network, the Department also awarded 21 family violence grants to assist in the
development of public information and community awareness campaign projects and activities to serve as information
models in the prevention of family violence. Six family violence prevention grants also were awarded to implement
demonstration models/courses to train public prosecutors to successfully try cases of domestic violence. 


C. Definitions 


_Family Violence: Any act or threatened act of violence, including any forceful detention of an individual, which;
(a) Results or threatens to result in physical injury and (b) is committed by a person against another individual (including
an elderly person) to whom such person is or was related by blood or marriage or otherwise legally related or with whom
such person is or was lawfully residing. 
_Shelter: The provision of temporary refuge and related assistance in compliance with applicable State law and regulation
governing the provision, on a regular basis, of shelter, safe homes, meals, and related assistance to victims of family
violence and their dependents. 
_Related assistance: The provision of direct assistance to victims of family violence and their dependents for the
purpose of preventing further violence, helping such victims to gain access to civil and criminal courts and other
community services, facilitating the efforts of such victims to make decisions concerning their lives in the interest
of safety, and assisting such victims in healing from the effects of the violence. Related assistance includes: 



(a) Prevention services such as outreach and prevention, services for victims and their children, employment training,
parenting and other educational services for victims and their children, preventive health services within domestic
violence programs (including nutrition, disease prevention, exercise, and prevention of substance abuse), domestic
violence prevention programs for school age children, family violence public awareness campaigns, and violence
prevention counseling services to abusers; 
(b) Counseling with respect to family violence, counseling by peers individually or in groups, and referral to community
social services; 
(c) Transportation, technical assistance with respect to obtaining financial assistance under Federal and State
programs, and referrals for appropriate health-care services (including alcohol and drug abuse treatment), but
does not include reimbursement for any health-care services; 
(d) Legal advocacy to provide victims with information and assistance through the civil and criminal courts, and
legal assistance; or 
(e) Children's counseling and support services, and child care services for children who are victims of family violence
or the dependents of such victims.

D. Eligibility: States 


``States'' as defined in section 309(6) of the Act are eligible to apply for funds. The term ``State'' means each of
the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands,
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the remaining eligible entity previously a part of the Trust
Territory of the Pacific Islands_the Republic of Palau. In the past, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth
of the Northern Mariana Islands, have applied for funds as a part of their consolidated Grant, under the Social Services
Block grant. These jurisdictions need not submit an application under this Program Announcement if they choose to
have their allotment included in a consolidated grant. 


E. Eligibility: Indian Tribes and Tribal Organizations
 


Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations are eligible for funding under this program if they meet the definition of
such entities as found in sections (e) and (l), respectively, of section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education
Assistance Act and are able to demonstrate their capacity to carry out a family violence prevention and services program.
The required capacity must be demonstrated in the application. Methods of demonstrating such capacity can include,
but are not limited to showing: 
(1) The current operation of a shelter, safehouse, or family violence prevention program; 
(2) Establishment of joint, collaborative, or service agreements with a local public agency or a private non-profit
agency for the operation of family violence prevention activities or services; or 
(3) Establishment of social services as evidenced by receipt of ``638'' contracts with the Bureau of Indian Affairs
(BIA); Title II Indian Child Welfare grants from the BIA; or Child Welfare Services grants under Title IV-B of
the Social Security Act. 
A list of currently eligible Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations is found at appendix B of this Announcement. Any
Tribe or Tribal organization that believes it has met the eligibility criteria and should be included in the list of
eligible tribes should provide supportive documentation and a request for inclusion addressed to the contact person
at the above address. 
As in previous years, Indian Tribes may apply singly or as a consortium. In addition, a non-profit private organization,
approved by an eligible Indian Tribe for the operation of a family violence shelter on a reservation, is eligible for
funding. 
Because section 304(a) specifies a minimum base amount for State allocations, we have set a base amount for Indian
Tribal allotments. Since FY 1986, we have found, in practice, that the establishment of such an allocation, based
on population, has facilitated our efforts to make a fair and equitable distribution of limited grant funds. 
Tribes which meet the application requirements and whose reservation and surrounding Tribal Trust Lands population
is less than 3,000 will receive a minimum of $3,000; Tribes which meet the application requirements and whose reservation
and surrounding Tribal Trust Lands population exceeds 3,000 will receive a minimum of $8,000, except for the Navajo
Tribe which will receive a minimum of $24,000 because of its population. We have used these population figures to determine
minimum funding levels since the beginning of the program. 
In computing Indian Tribal allocations, we will use the latest available population figures from the Census Bureau.
Where Census Bureau data are unavailable, we will use figures from the BIA Indian Population and Labor Force Report.
If not all eligible Tribes apply, the available funds will be divided proportionally among the Tribes which apply
and meet the requirements.

F. Funds Available 



Family violence grants to the States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are based on population.
Each grant shall be not less than 1% of the amounts appropriated for grants under section 303(a) or 
$200,000, whichever is the lesser amount. Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands,
and the Republic of Palau will each receive grants not less than one-eighth of 1% percent of the amounts appropriated.
State allocations are listed at the end of this Announcement and have been computed based on the formula in section
304 of the Act. 

The Secretary is required to make available not less than 10% of amounts appropriated for Section 303 in the form of
grants to Indian Tribes, Tribal organizations, and non-profit private organizations approved by an Indian Tribe.
The grant awards are for the operation of a family violence shelter on a reservation and for projects designed to prevent
family violence and to provide immediate shelter and related assistance. 

Public Law 103-112, the Department of Health and Human Services Appropriations Act, 1994, made $27,679,000
available for carrying out the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act. Of this amount $2,500,000 will be allocated
to State Domestic Violence Coalitions to coordinate services with local programs and do planning and training of
criminal justice personnel. The distribution of funds for the State Domestic Violence Coalitions will be made in
a separate announcement. 

Of the remaining $25,179,000, the Department will make $20,143,200 available for grants to States and Territories,
$2,517,900 available for grants to Indian Tribes or Tribal organizations, and $1,258,950 available to the National
Resource Center and the Special Issue Resource Centers (80%, 10%, and 5%, respectively, of the total amount appropriated
under section 310(a)). 

Approximately $1.2 million of FY 1994 family violence funds will be used in various technical assistance projects
currently in the planning phase. 

For FY 1995 the Department intends to make funding available for family violence prevention and services programs
subject to Congressional appropriations. The requirements set forth in this announcement will apply to the family
violence program for FY 1995. Specific information regarding funds available, State allocations, and requirements
regarding grant award periods will be provided by program announcement or program instruction as soon as the FY 1995
appropriation is known. 



G. Grant Award Period 



All FY 1994 funds must be obligated by grantees by June 30, 1995 and liquidated not later than June 30, 1996. 
FY 1994 grant funds which are made available to the States through reallotment, under section 304(d)(1), must be obligated
and liquidated by the States no later than September 30, 1995. 



H. Reporting Requirements 



All State and Tribal grantees are reminded that annual program activity reports and annual Financial Status Reports
(Standard Form 269) are due 90 days after the end of each Federal fiscal year. First reports are due on December 31, 1994.

Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guide; Availability


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance document entitled ``Fish
and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guide,'' which the agency has developed on seafood hazards and controls.
FDA has prepared this document as, among other things, an adjunct to regulations proposed by FDA on procedures for
the safe processing of fish and fishery products. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA is in the process of developing a guidance document entitled ``Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls
Guide.'' The draft guide is now available to the public through NTIS. 


The guide is designed to serve several purposes. First, FDA anticipates that it will help members of the commercial
fish and fishery products industry identify and control potential hazards associated with the fish and fishery products
that they handle and process. In addition to human food safety hazards and controls, the guide will address controls
associated with quality, marketability, and economic fraud. 
The guide also is designed to help members of the seafood industry develop and implement Hazard Analysis Critical
Control Point (HACCP) plans for their operations, as will be required if FDA adopts the proposed regulations. The
proposed regulations provide that seafood processors and importers must establish HACCP systems of preventive
controls to ensure the safety of the food they produce. The guide provides information that processors and importers
can use in the development of their HACCP plans. This information consists largely of an identification of hazards
that can affect seafood and a discussion of the control measures that can keep these hazards from actually occurring
or that can at least minimize the likelihood of their occurrence. 
Another purpose of the guide is to help consumers and the public to understand seafood safety in terms of the hazards
that are presented by seafood and the controls that can be applied to those hazards. 
FDA believes that the guide will assist Federal and State regulatory officials in developing uniform and consistent
regulatory strategies and controls for seafood. This guide should be useful in the evaluation of HACCP plans and systems
by both State and Federal regulatory officials.
Comments concerning the draft Guide were solicited with the announcement of the proposed regulations in the 

Federal Register

 of January 28, 1994. FDA will study the comments it receives, revise the draft guide as warranted, and then issue the
guide. The agency intends to issue the guide by the time that the proposed HACCP regulations for seafood are issued
in final form, should the agency decide to do so. 
Interested persons may, on or before April 28, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this draft guide. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments and the draft guide may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
Comments received after April 28, 1994, will be considered in the drafting of subsequent editions of the guide, as
the agency finds it necessary. FDA will publish subsequent editions based on public comments and as circumstances
warrant, e.g., as new knowledge on hazards is obtained or new types of controls are developed.

 Notice of availability of funds. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the availability of approximately $478,000
under section 338L of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act for Grants to States for Community Scholarship Programs.


The purpose of the Community Scholarship Program (CSP) is to enable States to increase the availability of primary
health care in urban and rural federally designated health professional shortage areas (HPSAs) by assisting community
organizations to provide scholarships for the education of individuals to serve as health professionals in these
communities. 
The PHS is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000,
a PHS-led national activity. This grant program is related to the objectives of improving access to and availability
of primary health care services for all Americans, especially the underserved populations. Potential applicants
may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report: Stock No. 017-001-00474-0) or Healthy People
2000 (Summary Report; Stock No. 017-001-00473-1) through the Superintendent of Documents, Government

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 An estimated $478,000 will be available to support approximately 10 to 15 new awards for a 12-month budget period with
project periods of up to 3 years. The FY 1994 range of project support for new and competing continuation awards will
be approximately $5,000 to $75,000. Under this program, States enter into agreements with public or private nonprofit
community organizations located in federally designated HPSAs. These organizations will recruit qualified residents
of their communities and provide scholarships to them to become physicians, certified nurse practitioners, certified
nurse midwives, or physician assistants based on the needs of the communities. 



This grant program is intended to be consistent with the efforts of the NHSC Scholarship and Loan Repayment Programs
to meet the needs of underserved populations in federally designated HPSAs through the placement of primary care
practitioners. For purposes of this program, the term ``primary health care'' means health services regarding family
medicine, general internal medicine, general pediatrics, or obstetrics and gynecology, that are provided by physicians,
certified nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, or physician assistants. The Secretary is required by
statute [section 338L(l)(3) of the PHS Act] to ensure that, to the extent practicable, not less than 50 percent of the
amount appropriated will be in the aggregate expended by the States for making grants to community organizations
that are located in rural federally designated HPSAs. 



Eligibility Requirements



In order for a State to receive a grant under this program, the State must: 

1. Receive funding for at least one grant, cooperative agreement, or contract under any provisions of the PHS Act other
than section 338L for the fiscal year for which the State is applying; 

2. Agree that the grant program will be administered directly by a single State agency; 

3. Agree to make grants to community organizations located in federally designated HPSAs in order to assist those
community organizations in providing scholarships to individuals enrolled or accepted for enrollment as full-time
students in health professions schools accredited by a body or bodies recognized for accreditation purposes by the
Secretary of Education; 

4. Agree that 40 percent of the total costs of the scholarships will be paid from the Federal grant made to the State;
and 

5. Agree that 60 percent of the total costs of the scholarships will be paid from non-Federal contributions made in
cash by both the State and the community organization through which the scholarship is provided. 
a. The State must make available through these cash contributions not less than 15 percent nor more than 25 percent
of the scholarship costs. 

b. The community organization must make available through these cash contributions not less than 35 percent nor more
than 45 percent of the scholarship costs. 

c. Non-Federal contributions provided in cash by the State and community organization (as described in a and b above)
may not include any amounts provided by the Federal Government to the State, or community organization involved,
or to any other entity. Non-federal contributions required may be provided directly by the State and community organization
involved, and may be provided through donations from public and private entities. States should be aware, however,
that donations from providers may be subject to provisions of Public Law 102-234, the Medicaid Voluntary Contribution
and Provider-Specific Tax Amendments of 1991. 



Scholarship Requirements



To receive a grant, the State must agree that it will award a grant to a community organization for scholarships only
if: 

1. The individual who is to receive the scholarship under a contract is a resident of a federally designated HPSA in
which the community organization is located and will provide primary health care services for:

a. A number of years equal to the number of years for which the scholarship is provided, or for a period of 2 years, whichever
period is greater; or 

b. Such greater period of time as the individual and the community organization may agree. 

2. The individual agrees, while enrolled in a health professions school, to maintain an acceptable level of academic
standing (as determined by the school) at the school as a full-time student in accordance with regulation issued by
the Secretary pursuant to Section 338A(f)(1)(B)(iii) of the PHS Act; 

3. The individual and the community organization agree that the scholarship:
 
a. Will be expended only for tuition expenses, other reasonable educational expenses, reasonable living expenses
incurred while in attendance at the school, and/or payment to the individual of a monthly stipend of not more than the
amount authorized for NHSC scholarship recipients under section 338A(g)(1)(B) of the PHS Act; and 

b. Will not, for any year of such attendance for which the scholarship is provided, be in an amount exceeding the total
amount required for the year for the purposes indicated in paragraph (a) above. 

4. The individual agrees to meet the educational and certification or licensure requirements necessary to become
a primary care physician, certified nurse practitioner, certified nurse midwife, or physician assistant in the
State in which the individual is to practice under the contract; and 

5. the individual agrees that, in providing primary health care pursuant to the scholarship, he/she: 

a. Will not, in the case of an individual seeking care, discriminate on the basis of the ability of the individual to
pay for such care or on the basis that payment for such care will be made pursuant to the programs established in Titles
XVIII (Medicare) or XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act; and, 

b. Will accept assignment under Section 1842(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Social Security Act for all services for which payment
may be made under part B of Title XVIII, and will enter into an appropriate agreement with the State agency that administers
the State plan for medical assistance under Title XIX to provide service to individuals entitled to medical assistance
under the plan. 




Evaluation Criteria



For new and competing continuation grants the following criteria will be used to evaluate applications: (a) The magnitude
and extent of the need for the grant to provide primary health care, as described in the proposal; (b) the extent to which
the applicant's and community's recruitment plans are consistent with the State's plans for meeting the needs of
the community's primary care system; (c) the adequacy of the methodology for selecting community organizations,
and for monitoring and evaluating the community organization's compliance with the terms and conditions of the grant;
(d) the degree of documented community commitment to and involvement with the grant; (e) the appropriateness of the
proposed plan to administer and manage the grant; and (f) the soundness of the budget and the budget justification
for assuring effective utilization of grant funds. For competing continuation applications, evaluation will also
be made of program outcomes and the degree to which stated goals and objectives were achieved. 



Other Grant Information



The CSP is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, as implemented by 45 CFR part 100, which allows States
the option of setting up a system for reviewing applications from within their States for assistance under certain
Federal programs. The application package for this program will include a list of States with review systems and the
single point of contact (SPOC) in each State for the review. Applicants (other than federally-recognized Indian
tribal governments) should contact their State SPOCs as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications
and receive any necessary instructions on the State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the
applicant is advised to contact the SPOC of each affected State. The due date for State process recommendations is
60 days after the application deadline. The BPHC does not guarantee that it will accommodate or explain its response
to State process recommendations received after that date. 

Grants will be administered in accordance with HHS regulations in 45 CFR part 92. The OMB Catalog of Federal Domestic
Assistance number for this program is 93.931.

 Notice of availability of funds.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) and Bureau of Health
Professions (BHPr), jointly announce that fiscal year 1994 funds are available for awards to federally-funded community
and migrant health centers, health care for the homeless programs, and public housing primary care programs for Junior
National Health Service Corps/Junior Health Careers Opportunity Program (JrNHSC/JrHCOP) demonstration programs.
This program will be conducted under the authority of section 301 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. 



The goal of the JrNHSC/JrHCOP initiative is to increase the number of primary care professionals who come from disadvantaged
backgrounds. In order to increase the numbers of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds pursuing primary care
health careers, interventions must begin early to enable students to develop the prerequisite skills, academic
competence and motivation to pursue a career as a health professional. 
These grants are intended to demonstrate the merit of early introduction to and involvement of students in community
oriented primary health care settings; academic enrichment experiences in mathematics, science and communication
skills (i.e., reading, writing, and oral skills); and in sustained interaction with mentors and role models. The
objectives of the JrNHSC/JrHCOP program are to: (1) Identify and recruit students who reside within the Health Center's
service area and expose them to primary health care service and service to the underserved; (2) work with students
to increase their interest and knowledge in their own good health and the health of others; (3) encourage educational
preparation and development of prerequisite skills through academic enrichment programs; and (4) nurture and encourage
students to pursue primary care health careers by developing a corps of peer counselors and exposing participants
to role models, mentors and practicing primary care health professionals. The projects will target students in the
6th through 12th grades. Working with students of these ages will, in the long run, significantly increase the numbers
of disadvantaged individuals in the health professions dedicated to serving the underserved.

of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402-9325 (telephone number 202-783-3238).

This project is also in concert with the National and Community Service Trust Act which focuses on national service
efforts to address the most critical issues facing communities across the nation, bringing energy and commitment
to address education, human needs, public safety, and environmental needs. 



<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A total of $1,000,000 is available for awards in FY 1994. It is projected that awards will be made to 10 competing applicants
and will range from $75,000 to $125,000 for a 12-month budget period and up to a 3-year project period. The need to develop
models at each of the targeted grade levels, or strategically grouped grade levels, will be taken into consideration
in the awarding of grants. 


Program Expectations 


Each project funded under this demonstration grant program is expected to identify, with the assistance of schools
and other local organizations within the local community, a cohort of 15 to 20 disadvantaged students for participation
in activities in the first year of the grant. These students are to be involved in a year-round program designed to expose
them to the various primary care fields through on-site and community experiences, provide them with necessary prerequisite
skills in mathematics, science and communication (i.e., reading, writing, and oral skills), and stimulate and reinforce
their interest in their own health and in providing care in underserved communities. The students are to continue
with the project each year, participating in age-appropriate activities as they advance through secondary school.
It is anticipated that the level of activity will be more intense during the summer months than during the academic
year. 
Projects are to provide activities to build participants' self-esteem; nurture the development of peer counseling
skills, and the formation of a corps of peer counselors; foster the participants' interest in health care careers;
impact their educational and subject choices; influence them to select a health career track; 
cultivate their awareness of and interest in primary care; and nurture their development into community responsive,
culturally competent primary care health professionals committed to serving the underserved.

The projects must provide academic and community/clinical experiences for the targeted students designed not only
to develop their interest in but to enhance the foundation required for their entry into the health professions. The
projects must include: Academic enhancement initiatives in mathematics, science and communication skills appropriate
to grade level to augment the targeted students' normal school offerings; exposure to peer counselors, health professions
students, and health professionals as role models; student mentors; and experiences, appropriate to grade level,
at community based health care settings. The projects must involve a formalized arrangement between the applicant
and an institution of higher education that has Health Careers Opportunity Program (HCOP) grant funding through
1996. A listing of these HCOP institutions is appended. The HCOP institution must be located in sufficiently close
proximity to the health center to allow for visits and other interaction between faculty, health center staff and
students. The HCOP institution is expected to develop and/or expand current academic enrichment activities appropriate
to the needs of the targeted population. Other activities which may be appropriate 
include presentations by health professions students serving as role models; personal, academic and career counseling;
parental information sessions; campus visits to local undergraduate and health professions schools; etc. All of
these activities could be offered in summer programs and/or during the school year. Linkages are also encouraged
with a health professions school in the area to provide a continuum throughout the educational pathway. 
Applications from Health Centers with school based health clinics must include the clinics as a partner in the development
and implementation of the project. All funded projects are expected to develop appropriate experiences and activities
to expose students to community oriented primary health care. 
These experiences should be age-appropriate, and could focus on the development of healthy lifestyles, peer counseling,
on-site observation of health care professionals, development of patient care skills, extensive summer internships
at the facility, etc. Other health center activities which may be appropriate include outreach in local educational
institutions and clinics to reach interested students; establishment of peer support groups; involvement of students
in peer health education programs; guest speakers; presentations by health professionals; encouragement/facilitation
of mentor/mentee relationships; tours of various health care facilities; shadowing experiences; 
volunteer activities in health care facilities; seminars; research projects on health care issues; etc. 
Grant funds are available to organize and execute all relevant activities related to: the provision of supervised
age level appropriate community service projects and practicums at 
community primary health services settings; coordination of initiatives with active HCOP programs at linking institution(s)
of higher education, including the development and delivery of academic enrichment programs; and provision of appropriate
support and motivational activities. Varied levels of stipend support are also available, depending upon the program
activity and grade level of the student. All programs are to involve faculty from participating students' schools,
representatives from the grantee organization, and key staff of the HCOP programs at the linking institutions in
the planning, development and execution of the program. Parental involvement is to be built in as appropriate. 
The federally-funded community or migrant health center, health care for the homeless program, or public housing
primary care program would function as the lead entity, coordinating and providing oversight of all program initiatives.

Eligible Applicants



Community and migrant health centers, health care for the homeless programs, and public housing primary care programs,
currently funded under sections 329, 330, 340, and 340A of the PHS Act, and in close proximity to an HCOP program listed
in the Appendix, are eligible to apply for these grants. 


Eligible Participants



Students in grades 6 through 12, who are from disadvantaged backgrounds and who reside within the service area of the
applicant are eligible to participate in the JrNHSC/JrHCOP. 


Definitions

from an environment that has inhibited the individual from obtaining the knowledge, skills and abilities required
to enroll in and graduate from a health professions school or from a program providing education or training in an allied
health profession or (b) comes from a family with an annual income below a level based on low-income thresholds according
to family size, published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, adjusted annually 
for changes in the Consumer Price Index and adjusted by the Secretary for use in all health professions programs 
(42 CFR 57.1804(b)(2)). 

The following income figures determine what constitutes a low-income family for purposes of these JrNHSC/JrHCOP
grants for fiscal year 1994: 





For purposes of this program, ``primary care health career'' means a career as a primary care physician (family medicine,
general internal medicine, general pediatrics, or obstetrics and gynecology), dentist, nurse practitioner, certified

Rural Telemedicine Grant Program 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Public Health Service (PHS).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability of funds. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Rural Health Policy, HRSA, announces that applications are being accepted for Rural Telemedicine Grants
to (1) develop a base of information for conducting a systematic evaluation of telemedicine systems serving rural
areas; and (2) facilitate development of rural health care networks through the use of telemedicine. Awards will
be made from funds appropriated under Public Law 103-112 (HHS Appropriation Act for FY 1994). Grants for these
projects are authorized under section 301 of the Public Health Service Act. 



National Health Objectives for the Year 2000 


The PHS is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000,
a PHS-led national activity for setting priority areas. The Rural Telemedicine Grant program is related to the priority
areas for health promotion, health protection, and preventive services. Potential applicants may obtain a copy
of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report: Stock No. 017-001-00474-C) or Healthy People 2000 (Summary
Report: Stock No. 017-001-00473-1) through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing
Office, Washington, DC 20402-9325 (Telephone (202) 783-3238). 



Funds Available 


Approximately $4.0 million is available for the Rural Telemedicine Grant program in FY 1994. With these funds, the
Office of Rural Health Policy expects to make approximately eight awards for one year. Applicants may propose project
periods for up to three years. However, applicants are advised that continued funding of grants beyond the one-year
period supported under this announcement is subject to appropriation of funds and assessment of grantee performance.
The start date for the new projects will be September 30, 1994. 



Funding Limits 



Individual grant awards under this notice will be limited to a total amount of $500,000 (direct and indirect costs)
per year. Applications for smaller amounts are strongly encouraged. 
Equipment costs up to 40 percent of the total grant award are allowable. However, the costs of purchasing and installing
transmission equipment, such as laying cable or telephone lines, microwave towers, digital switching equipment,
amplifiers, etc., are not allowable. Transmission costs are allowable. Indirect costs are allowable up to 20 percent
of the total grant award. 

Grant funds may not be used for construction, except for minor renovations related to the installation of equipment.
Grant funds may not be used to acquire or build real property. 



Cost Participation 



Cost participation serves as an indicator of community and institutional support for the project and of the likelihood
that the project will continue after Federal grant support has ended. Applicants are required to demonstrate cost
participation in the form of equipment, personnel, building space, indirect costs, other in-kind contributions,
or cash.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Program Objectives 



The purpose of the program is to demonstrate and collect information on the feasibility, costs, appropriateness,
and acceptability (to practitioners and patients) of telemedicine for improving access to health services for rural
residents and reducing the isolation of rural practitioners. Grants will be awarded for implementing and operating
telemedicine systems that link multi-specialty entities with rural health care facilities for the purposes of delivering
health care services to the rural sites and exchanging information between the sites. 

A central goal of the program is to demonstrate how telemedicine can be used as an effective tool in the development
of integrated systems of health care. Integrated systems of care provide comprehensive, coordinated health care
services to the rural residents served by the system through referrals, consultations, and support systems that
ensure patient access to a comprehensive set of services and reduce practitioner isolation. In particular, the program
is to promote systems of health care in rural areas that link rural primary care practitioners with specialty and referral
services. 

For the purposes of this grant program, telemedicine is defined as the use of telecommunications for medical diagnosis
and patient care. A clinical consultation is defined as a person-to-person interaction relating to the clinical
condition or treatment of the patient. The consultation could be between two practitioners, with or without the patient
present, or between a specialty practitioner and a patient.

<TEXT>
 

In order to compete for the program, applicants must participate in a telemedicine network that includes at least
three sites: A multispecialty entity (tertiary care hospital, multi-specialty clinic, or a collection of facilities
that, combined, could provide 24-hour a day specialty consultations), a small rural hospital (fewer than 100 beds),
a rural primary care practitioner office or clinic. Networks that include a long-term care facility are especially
encouraged. The network may include additional rural sites, such as mental health clinics, school-based clinics,
emergency service providers, home health providers, community and migrant health centers, rural health clinics,
Federally qualified health centers, health professions schools, etc. The telemedicine network must be used to provide
clinical consultations between the multispecialty entity (hub) and the rural sites (spokes). Projects that use
low cost technologies are particularly encouraged. 
For purposes of this grant program, a telemedicine network is characterized by a full partnership among all the members
that includes the following elements: (1) Resource participation; (2) a specific role for each member; (3) a contractual
relationship; (4) a long-term commitment to the project by each member; (5) documentation of the network's activities;
and (6) active participation by each member so that the network is not solely dependent on any particular member organization.

The applicant must be willing to participate in an evaluation of telemedicine services. This may include, but is not
limited to, collecting data, completing surveys, and participating in on-site observations by independent evaluators.

In order to facilitate an evaluation of telemedicine, it is important that there be some level of uniformity in the
types of clinical services provided among the projects. All projects, at a minimum, must be able to provide teleconsultations
in the following services: Teleradiology, cardiology, dermatology, mental health and/or substance abuse, obstetrics
and gynecology, orthopedics, subspecialties of pediatrics, and resuscitation of trauma patients. Applicants
may propose to provide teleconsultations for additional services. 
This grant program is intended to support telemedicine for medical diagnosis and treatment of patients, including
patient counseling. It is not for didactic distance learning programs, such as lectures or other programs designed
solely for the purposes of instructing health care personnel or patients. 
Applicants must develop projects to address specific, well-documented needs of the rural communities. In doing
so, applicants are advised to consider both the health care needs of the rural communities served by the project, and
the extent to which the project can build upon existing telecommunications capacity in the communities to facilitate
efficient use of that capacity by multiple users. Needs can be established through a formal needs assessment or by
population specific demographic data. 
All the grant funding must be used for services provided to or in rural communities. A majority of grant dollars must
actually be spent in rural communities for direct services to those communities, including salaries, maintenance
of equipment, and transmission costs. 


Eligible Applicants 


A grant award will be made only to an entity that is part of a telemedicine network and can provide a wide range of specialty
consultation services on a 24-hour basis to rural spoke sites. The grant recipient can be a public (non-Federal) or
private entity located in either a rural or urban area. Rural spoke sites may be public or private entities, either
nonprofit or for-profit. All spoke facilities supported by this grant must meet one of the two requirements stated
below.



(1) The facility is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area as defined by the OMB. A list of the cities and
counties that are designated as being within a Metropolitan Statistical Area will be included with the application
kit. 
(2) The facility is located in a rural census tract of one of the counties listed in Appendix I to this announcement.
Although each of these counties is a Metropolitan Statistical Area, or part of one, large parts of the counties are
rural. Facilities located in these rural areas are eligible for the program. Rural portions of these counties have
been identified by census tract since this is the only way we have found to clearly differentiate them from urban areas
in the large counties. Appendix I provides a list of these census tracts for each county. Appendix II includes the telephone
numbers for regional offices of the Census Bureau. Applicants may call these offices to determine the census tract
in which they are located. 


Review Procedure 


Applications will be assessed by the Office of Grants Management for responsiveness to this notice. Any applications
that are judged nonresponsive because they are inadequately developed, in an improper format, exceed the specified
page length, or otherwise are unsuitable for peer review and funding consideration, will be returned without further
consideration. All responsive applications will undergo objective peer review. 



Review Consideration 


Grant applications will be evaluated on the basis of the following criteria:

(8) The feasibility of plans to continue the project after Federal grant support has ended. 
(9) The extent to which the proposed project would be capable of replication in rural areas with similar needs and characteristics,
particularly with regards to its affordability by other communities. 


Other Information 


Applicants are advised that the narrative description of their program and the budget justification may not exceed
30 pages in length. Applications that exceed the 30 page limit for the program narrative and budget justification
will not receive consideration. All applications must be typewritten and clearly legible, using print no smaller
than 12 characters per inch and having no less than one-half inch margin on all sides. 


Public Health System Impact Statement 


This program is subject to the Public Health System Reporting Requirements. Reporting requirements have been approved
by the OMB_0937-0195. Under these requirements, the community-based nongovernmental applicant must prepare
and submit a Public Health System Impact Statement (PHSIS). The PHSIS is intended to provide information to State
and local health officials to keep them apprised of proposed health services grant applications submitted by community-based
nongovernmental organizations within their jurisdictions. 
Community-based non governmental applicants are required to submit the following information to the head of the
appropriate State and Local health agencies in the area(s) to be impacted no later than the Federal application receipt
due date: 
a. A copy of the face page of the application (SF 424) 
b. A summary of the project PHSIS, not to exceed one page, which provides:

 

(1) A description of the population to be served. 
(2) A summary of the services to be provided. 
(3) A description of the coordination planned with the appropriate State of local health agencies. 


Executive Order 12372 


The Rural Telemedicine Grant program has been determined to be a program that is subject to the provisions of Executive
Order 12372 concerning intergovernmental review of Federal programs by appropriate health planning agencies as
implemented by 45 CFR part 100. Executive Order 12372 allows States the option of setting up a system for reviewing
applications from within their States for assistance under certain Federal programs. Applicants (other than Federally-recognized
Indian tribal governments) should contact their State Single Point of Contact (SPOCs), a list of which will be included
in the application kit, as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary
instructions on the State process. For proposed projects serving more then one State, the applicant is advised to
contact the SPOC of each affected State. All SPOC recommendations should be submitted to Opal McCarthy, Office of
Grants Management, Bureau of Primary Health Care, East West Building, 11th floor, 4350 East West Highway, Rockville,
Maryland 20857, (301) 594-4260. The due date for State process recommendations is 60 days after the application
deadline for new and competing awards. The granting agency does not guarantee to ``accommodate or explain'' for State
process recommendations it receives after that date. (See part 148, Intergovernmental Review of PHS Programs under
Executive Order 12372 and 45 CFR part 100 for a description of the review process and requirements.

Indian Health Service Research Program; Grants Application Announcement



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Indian Health Service, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Competitive Grant and Cooperative Agreement Applications for the Indian Health Service (IHS) Research
Program.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The IHS announces that competitive applications for fiscal year (FY) 1995 are now being accepted for the IHS Research
Program authorized by section 208 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 1621g. There will
be only one funding cycle for FY 1995. Grants and Cooperative Agreements shall be administered in accordance with
applicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) circulars and HHS policies. This program is within the Catalog of
Federal Domestic Assistance Number 93.905. Executive Order 12372 requiring intergovernmental review is not applicable
to this program.



The Administration's budget request for FY 1995 includes $300,000 for the Indian Health Service Research Program.
It is anticipated that $300,000 will be available to support approximately 15 competing awards averaging $20,000.

This program announcement is subject to the appropriation of funds. This notice is being published early because
awards to IHS components are made by special allotments which must be expended by September 30 of the FY. Research awards
must be issued early in each FY to allow researchers full use of funds.

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led activity for setting priority areas. This program announcement is directly related
to many priority areas, including nutrition, alcohol and other drugs, unintentional injuries, oral health, maternal
and infant health, heart disease and stroke, cancer, diabetes and chronic disabling conditions, human immunodeficiency
virus infection, sexually transmitted diseases, clinical preventive services, and surveillance and data systems.
Potential applicants may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report; Stock No. 017-001-00474-0)
or Healthy People 2000 (Summary Report; Stock No. 017-001-00473-1) through the Superintendent
of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402-9325 (Telephone 202-783-3238).

A. In accordance with OMB Circular A-102, Grants and Cooperative Agreements for State and Local Governments,
interested parties are invited to comment on the proposed funding emphases. This comment period is 30 days; written
comments received by April 18, 1994, will be considered before the final funding emphases are established. No funds
will be allocated or selections made until a final notice is published stating what funding emphases will be applied.
Written comments on the proposed funding emphases should be addressed to: William L. Freeman, M.D., Director, IHS
Research Program, 5300 Homestead Road, NE., Albuquerque, NM 87110-1293. All comments received will be available
for public inspection and copying at the above address, weekdays (except Federal holidays) between the hours of 7:30
a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Mountain Standard Time, beginning approximately 2 weeks after publication of this notice.
B. A pre-application is due on or before April 18, 1994. The pre-application is required of all applicants, including
applicants for a competitive renewal. The purposes of the pre-application are: (1) To establish communications
between the IHS and the applicant; (2) to determine the applicant's eligibility; and (3) to determine how well the
project can compete with other similar pre-applications. The pre-application will consist of: (1) the Standard
Form 424 (cover sheet), sections 1., 2., 5., 6., 7., 8., 11., and 15.; (2) a Research Plan (see section I); and (3) the
Importance and Utility section (see section J). In meeting this pre-application deadline, it is the researcher's
responsibility to assure that Grants Management Branch, Division of Acquisition and Grants Operations, IHS, receives
the original pre-application and the appropriate IHS Research and Publication Committees (RPCs) simultaneously
receive a copy of the pre-application. The RPCs will use the same review criteria as the Indian Health Research Study
Section. The review criteria are discussed under Section M. Review Process, of this announcement. An applicant submitting
a pre-application may be declared ineligible to submit an application, based on the results of the pre-application
review.
C. An original and 2 copies of the completed final grant application must be received by the Grants Management Branch,
Division of Acquisition and Grants Operations, IHS, suite 100, 12300 Twinbrook Parkway, Rockville, MD 20852, on
or before June 30, 1994.
Pre-applications and applications shall be considered as meeting the deadline if they are either: (1) Received on
or before the deadline with hand carried applications received by close of business 5 p.m., or (2) postmarked on or
before the deadline and received in time to be reviewed along with all other timely pre-applications and applications.
A legibly dated receipt from a commercial carrier or the U.S. Postal Service will be accepted in lieu of a postmark.
Private metered postmarks will not be accepted as proof of timely mailing.
Pre-applications and applications received after the announced closing date(s) will not be considered for funding
and will be returned to the applicant.


Additional Dates


D. Pre-application Review Period: On or about April 18-May 18, 1994.
E. Comments on pre-application to applicants: On or about June 1, 1994.
F. Application Reviews: IHS Study Section: On or about September 13-15, 1994.
G. Applicants notified of results (approved, approved unfunded, or disapproved): On or about November 16, 1994.
H. Earliest anticipated starting date: On or about December 1, 1994.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This announcement provides information on the general program goals, eligibility requirements, research emphases,
availability of funds application process, and review process for the IHS Research Program for FY 1995.



A. General Program Goals



1. To support practice and community-based research projects likely to improve the health of American Indians and
Alaska Natives (AI/AN) served by the IHS. Projects that are basic science or laboratory research are not considered
as conforming to the program goals, and will be returned to the applicant.

2. To develop research skills among IHS and tribal health professionals. The applicant, as the direct and primary
recipient of PHS funds, must perform a substantive role in carrying out project activities and not merely serve as
a conduit for an award to another party, or to provide funds to another party.



B. Eligibility



The grant application process affords Indian tribes and tribal organizations which have contracts with the IHS under
the Indian Self-Determination Act, 25 U.S.C. 450 

et seq.

, an equal opportunity to compete with IHS components for research funds. Awards to tribal contractors will be made
as grants or cooperative agreements. The IHS components will receive special allotments of funds to carry out approved
research activities.



C. Research Emphases

Grants or special allotments will be made under this announcement with special but not exclusive regard to the following
IHS research emphases for FY 1995.
1. Studies of documented high importance to the community in which the research is to be done.
2. Studies with high relevance for the AI/AN populations. (The series ``The Research Agenda for Indian Health'' in
the IHS Primary Care Provider, lists many relevant research subjects. Reprints are available from the IHS Research
Program and the Area Research Offices.)
3. For studies that involve problems that are both social and medical (e.g., dysfunctional families), research on
factors that enable the community or individuals to overcome the problems.
4. Competing continuations of previously-funded research projects.


D. Fund Availability, Period of Support, and Funding Level


Subject to the availability of FY 1995 funds, $300,000 will be available to support approximately 15 research grants
to tribes and special allotments to IHS components and up to 5 demonstrative cooperative agreements to tribes. (Cooperative
agreements are financial assistance awards that require the substantial programmatic involvement of the Federal
Government. Specific programmatic involvement by the IHS in a project will be negotiated with an approved applicant
before award of a cooperative agreement. This involvement will include the statement of the study question(s) and
objective(s); the adequacy of the research literature; the research design and methods proposed; the management,
quality control, and analysis of the data sources; the development of new methods and information; the importance
of community involvement; the applicability of the research to AI/AN people; the budget sufficiency; and the adequacy
of the principal investigator and research team.)
The detail required in a research project application and funding needs for the project differ widely between experienced
and inexperienced researchers. Therefore, we anticipate two levels of project application and funding. This will
allow both the inexperienced and experienced researchers to apply for grants and to compete with others of similar
expertise. The grant application must designate for which level the researcher is applying.
(1) The first level is for a one year pilot research project. This level is for less experienced researchers and for
less complex and detailed applications. A less experienced researcher is defined as an investigator who has never
received a funded research award in his or her own right. The Research Plan and Importance & Utility sections of
the pilot research project application should be of less detail and complexity than expected for the small grant research
project application; only biographical sketches, not Curriculum Vitae, are required. The anticipated maximum
funding for a pilot research project is $15,000.
(2) The second level is for a small grant research project. This level is for more experienced researchers. A more experienced
researcher is defined as an investigator who has received at least one funded research award in his or her own right.
The Research Plan and Importance and Utility sections of the small grant research project application must be complete
and discussed in detail. The small grant project application should be more complete, and have more detail and complexity,
than the pilot research project application. The anticipated maximum funding for a small grant research project
is $50,000 per year. The project may be planned for up to three years with a competing continuation application for
each succeeding year.
Research projects are normally funded for a 1 year project period. No cost extensions can be requested by the researcher
to finish work that has encountered unanticipated delays. All applicants must compete annually; however, among
applications of similar merit, priority will be given to applicants for a competing continuation of a previously-funded
research project. No projects may be funded for more than 3 years.

Part 1-7.4 A. of the IHS Manual which establishes the Area RPC as the Area Director's reviewing authority for
research proposals.



L. Protection of Human Subjects



The application shall contain assurances that the applicant will comply with the following:

1. Regulations to protect all human subjects of the research.

If the research project will involve human subjects, the applicant must submit for approval the completed protocol
to the applicable IHS Area Institutional Review Board(s) (IRB). If one or more co-investigator(s) is (are) from an
institution that has a permanent IRB (i.e., has a Multiple Project Assurance [MPA]), the applicant must submit form
HHS 596 to that IRB as well. All IRB approvals must be secured prior to funding of the proposal. (See section M. Review
Process, below.) It is recommended that any applicant who proposes to involve human subjects, or who is not sure if
the project meets the definition of research involving human subjects in 45 CFR part 46, contact the appropriate Area
Research Coordinator listed in this announcement for technical assistance as the application is being developed.

2. Maintenance of data confidentiality, anonymity (if indicated), and subject privacy.

Applicants must describe the process to maintain the confidentiality of data collected, the protection of patient
records, and the privacy of human subjects. If subjects are to be protected by anonymity, applicants must describe
the process to maintain anonymity.



M. Review Process



1. Review by authorized Institutional Review Boards (IRB).

All applications involving human subjects will be reviewed by the authorized Area or National IRBs in the IHS for compliance
with requirements to protect human subjects contained in 45 CFR 46, and as specified in the IHS MPA. It is suggested
but not required that the application be sent to the appropriate Area (IRB(s) 2 (two) months before the deadline, for
the IRB review of the proposal to permit making the changes before the final submission. The IRB will review only IRB
issues, not purely technical methods. Any applications involving investigators from institutions with IRBs with
MPAs and involving human subjects must also be reviewed by the IRBs of the respective institution(s). The researcher
should contact non-IHS IRBs for their deadline requirements. No research project can be funded by IHS unless it has
been approved by, and has met the conditions of, all applicable IRBs.

2. Review by the Indian Health Research Study Section (IHRSS).

Applications meeting eligibility requirements that are complete, responsive, and conform to this program announcement
will be reviewed for merit by the IHRSS appointed by the IHS to review these applications. The IHRSS review will be conducted
in accordance with the IHS objective review procedures. The technical review process ensures selection of quality
research projects in a national competition for limited funding. The IHRSS will include at least 60 percent non-IHS,
Federal or non-Federal, individuals, all experts in research. For each application, the IHRSS will decide to disapprove,
or to defer pending more information, or to approve the project. If the IHRSS decides to approve the project, it will
review the application against established criteria, and will assign a numerical score to the application. The members
of the IHRSS will use the following criteria and weights to make the score.

<DOCTITLE>Refugee Resettlement Program; Proposed Availability of Formula Allocation Funding for FY 1994 Targeted Assistance
Grants for Services to Refugees1 in Local Areas of High Need </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), ACF, HHS. 





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed availability of formula allocation funding for FY 1994 targeted assistance grants to States for
services to refugees in local areas of high need. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the proposed availability of funds and award procedures for FY 1994 targeted assistance grants
for services to refugees under the Refugee Resettlement Program (RRP). These grants are for service provision in
localities with large refugee populations, high refugee concentrations, and high use of public assistance, and
where specific needs exist for supplementation of currently available resources. In order to provide States increased
flexibility, this notice proposes to eliminate the specific requirement that at least 85% of targeted assistance
funds must be used for services which directly enhance refugee employment potential and proposes to replace this
requirement with a more general requirement that targeted assistance funds must be used primarily for employment-related
services. In addition, this notice proposes to eliminate the requirement that cash assistance recipients must make
up a percentage of the targeted assistance caseload which is not less than the State's current welfare dependency
rate among refugees. This notice also proposes to eliminate welfare dependency as a factor in the targeted assistance
allocation formula in light of the unavailability of up-to-date national welfare dependency data since FY 1989.
The formula has been updated to take into account FY 1993 arrivals. In FY 1994, targeted assistance funds will be available
only for a one-year grant project period.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Purpose and Scope 


This notice announces the proposed availability of funds for grants for targeted assistance for services to refugees
in counties where, because of factors such as unusually large refugee populations, high refugee concentrations,
and high use of public assistance, there exists and can be demonstrated a specific need for supplementation of resources
for services to this population. 
The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) has available $49,397,000 in FY 1994 funds for the targeted assistance program
(TAP) as part of the FY 1994 appropriation for the Department of Health and Human Services (Pub. L. 103-112).

The House Appropriations Committee Report reads as follows with respect to targeted assistance funds (H.R. Rept.
No. 103-156, p. 93): 
This program provides grants to States for counties which are impacted by high concentrations of refugees and high
dependency rates. The Committee intends that $19,000,000 of the total be provided to continue the current program
of support to communities affected as a result of the massive influx of Cuban and Haitian entrants during the Mariel
boatlift. The Committee also intends that 10 percent of the total appropriated for targeted assistance be used for
grants to localities most heavily impacted by the influx of refugees such as Laotian Hmong, Cambodians, and Soviet
Pentecostals, including secondary migrants who entered the United States after October 1, 1979. The Committee expects
these grants to be awarded to communities not presently receiving targeted assistance because of previous concentration
requirements and other factors in the grant formulas, as well as those who do currently receive targeted assistance
grants. The Committee intends that the State of California shall be held harmless in the formula allocation of targeted
assistance funds as a result of any reductions to the total amount appropriated for the targeted assistance program.
California's total share of funding under the formula allocation in fiscal year 1994 should be no less than the percentage
share of California's allotment under fiscal year 1993 appropriations. In determining the hold harmless allocation
to California, the total amount appropriated for targeted assistance will be used. 
The Senate Appropriations Committee Report (S. Rept. No. 103-143, p. 162) is less specific than, but consistent
with, the above-quoted House Report. 

The Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) proposes to use the $49,397,000 appropriated for FY 1994
targeted assistance as follows: 

 $25,457,300 is proposed for allocation under the updated formula, as set forth in this notice.

<PARENT> FR940318-2-00079 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 $19,000,000 will be awarded to Florida for the Dade County public schools and Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami.


 $4,939,700 (10% of the total) will be awarded under discretionary grant announcements which will be issued
separately setting forth application requirements and evaluation criteria. 
The purpose of targeted assistance grants is to provide, through a process of local planning and implementation,
direct services intended to result in the economic self-sufficiency and reduced welfare dependency of refugees
through job placements. 
The targeted assistance program reflects the requirements of section 412(c)(2)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act (INA), which provides that targeted assistance grants shall be made available ``(i) primarily for the purpose
of facilitating refugee employment and achievement of self-sufficiency, (ii) in a manner that does not supplant
other refugee program funds and that assures that not less than 95 percent of the amount of the grant award is made available
to the county or other local entity.'' 


II. Authorization 



Targeted assistance projects are funded under the authority of section 412(c)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act (INA), as amended by the Refugee Assistance Extension Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-605), 8 U.S.C. 1522(c); section
501(a) of the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-422), 8 U.S.C. 1522 note, insofar as it incorporates
by reference with respect to Cuban and Haitian entrants the authorities pertaining to assistance for refugees established
by section 412(c)(2) of the INA, as cited above; section 584(c) of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related
Programs Appropriations Act, 1988, as included in the FY 1988 Continuing Resolution (Pub. L. 100-202), insofar
as it incorporates by reference with respect to certain Amerasians from Vietnam the authorities pertaining to assistance
for refugees established by section 412(c)(2) of the INA, as cited above, including certain Amerasians from Vietnam
who are U.S. citizens, as provided under title II of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs
Appropriations Acts, 1989 (Pub. L. 100-461), 1990 (Pub. L. 101-167), and 1991 (Pub. L. 101-513).



III. Client and Service Priorities 


Targeted assistance funding should be used to assist refugee families to achieve economic independence. To this
end, ORR expects States and counties to ensure that a coherent plan of services is developed for each eligible family
that addresses the family's needs from time of arrival until attainment of economic independence. Each service plan
should address a family's needs for both employment-related services and other needed social services. 

Services funded under the targeted assistance allocations are required to focus primarily on those refugees who,
either because of their protracted use of public assistance or difficulty in securing employment, continue to need
services beyond the initial years of resettlement. The targeted assistance program, however, is not intended to
be limited to cash assistance recipients. TAP-funded services may also be provided to other refugees in need of services,
regardless of whether the refugees are receiving cash assistance. 
In addition to the statutory requirement that TAP funds be used ``primarily for the purpose of facilitating refugee
employment'' (section 412(c)(2)(B)(i)), funds awarded under this program are intended to help fulfill the Congressional
intent that ``employable refugees should be placed on jobs as soon as possible after their arrival in the United States''
(section 412(a)(1)(B)(i) of the INA). Therefore targeted assistance funds must be used primarily for services which
directly enhance refugee employment potential, have specific employment objectives, and are designed to enable
refugees to obtain jobs with less than one year's participation in the targeted assistance program. Examples of these
activities are: Job development; job placement; job-related and vocational English; short-term job training specifically
related to opportunities in the local economy; on-the-job training; business and employer incentives (such as on-site
employee orientation, vocational English training, or bilingual supervisor assistance); and business technical
assistance. General or remedial educational activities_such as adult basic education (ABE) or preparation for
a high school equivalency or general education diploma (GED)_may be provided within the context of an individual
employability plan for a refugee which is intended to result in job placement in less than one year. ORR encourages
the continued provision of services after a refugee has entered a job to help the refugee retain employment or move
to a better job. Targeted assistance funds cannot be used for long-term training programs such as vocational training
that last for more than a year or educational programs that are not intended to lead to employment within a year. If TAP
funds are used for the provision of English language training, such training should be provided concurrently, rather
than sequentially, with employment or with other employment-related services, to the maximum extent possible.

A portion of a local area's allocation may be used for services which are not directed toward the achievement of a specific
employment objective in less than one year but which are essential to the adjustment of refugees in the community,
provided such needs are clearly demonstrated and such use is approved by the State.

<TEXT>
 

Reflecting section 412(a)(1)(A)(iv) of the INA, the Director of ORR expects States to ``insure that women have the
same opportunities as men to participate in training and instruction.'' In addition, States are expected to make
sure that services are provided in a manner that encourages the use of bilingual women on service agency staffs to ensure
adequate service access by refugee women. In order to facilitate refugee self-support, the Director also expects
States to implement strategies which address simultaneously the employment potential of both male and female wage
earners in a family unit. States and counties are expected to make every effort to assure availability of day care services
in order to allow women with children the opportunity to participate in employment services or to accept or retain
employment. To accomplish this, day care may be treated as a priority employment-related service under the targeted
assistance program. Refugees who are participating in TAP-funded or social services-funded employment services
or have accepted employment are eligible for day care services. For an employed refugee, TAP-funded day care must
be limited to one year after the refugee becomes employed. States and counties, however, are expected to use day care
funding from other publicly funded mainstream programs as a prior resource and are encouraged to work with service
providers to assure maximum access to other publicly funded resources for day care. 
Targeted assistance services should be provided in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible with
a refugee's language and cultural background. In light of the increasingly diverse population of refugees who are
resettling in this country, refugee service agencies will need to develop practical ways of providing culturally
and linguistically appropriate services to a changing ethnic population. To the maximum extent possible, particularly
during a refugee's initial years of resettlement, targeted assistance services should be provided through a refugee-specific
service system rather than through a system in which refugees are only one of many client groups being served. 
ORR strongly encourages States and counties when contracting for targeted assistance services, including employment
services, to give consideration to the special strengths of MAAs, whenever contract bidders are otherwise equally
qualified, provided that the MAA has the capability to deliver services in a manner that is culturally and linguistically
compatible with the background of the target population to be served. 
ORR defines MAAs as organizations with the following qualifications: a. The organization is legally incorporated
as a nonprofit organization; and 
b. Not less than 51% of the composition of the Board of Directors or governing board of the mutual assistance association
is comprised of refugees or former refugees, including both refugee men and women. 

Finally, in order to provide culturally and linguistically compatible services in as cost-efficient a manner as
possible in a time of limited resources, ORR strongly encourages States and counties to promote and give special consideration
to the provision of services through coalitions of refugee service organizations, such as coalitions of MAAs, voluntary
resettlement agencies, or a variety of service providers. ORR believes it is essential for refugee-serving organizations
to form close partnerships in the provision of services to refugees in order to be able to respond adequately to a changing
refugee picture. Coalition-building and consolidation of providers is particularly important in communities
with multiple service providers in order to ensure better coordination of services and maximum use of funding for
services by minimizing the funds used for multiple administrative overhead costs. 
The award of funds to States under this notice would be contingent upon the completeness of a State's application as
described in section IX, below.

IV. [Reserved for Discussion of Comments in Final Notice] 
V. Eligible Grantees 



The following requirements, which have previously applied to TAP, would continue to apply with respect to FY 1994
awards: Eligible grantees are those agencies of State governments which are responsible for the refugee program
under 45 CFR 400.5 in States containing counties which qualify for FY 1994 targeted assistance awards. The use of targeted
assistance funds for services to Cuban and Haitian entrants is limited to States which have an approved State plan
under the Cuban/Haitian Entrant Program (CHEP). 

The State agency will submit a single application on behalf of all county governments of the qualified counties in
that State. Subsequent to the approval of the State's application by ORR, local targeted assistance plans will be
developed by the county government or other designated entity and submitted to the State. 

A State with more than one qualified county is permitted, but not required, to determine the allocation amount for
each qualified county within the State. However, if a State chooses to determine county allocations differently
from those set forth in this notice, the FY 1994 allocations proposed by the State must be included in the State's application.


Applications submitted in response to this notice are not subject to review by State and areawide clearinghouses
under Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs.'' 



VI. Qualification and Allocation Formula 



A. Qualification Criteria 



The INA authorizes the Director at section 412(c)(2)(A) ``to make grants to States for assistance to counties and
similar areas in the States where, because of factors such as unusually large refugee populations (including secondary
migration), high refugee concentrations, and high use of public assistance by refugees, there exists and can be demonstrated
a specific need for supplementation of available resources for services to refugees''. 


ORR is willing to consider data for the purpose of determining the eligibility of new counties to participate in TAP
in FY 1994. Interested counties should submit the following written evidence: (a) A list of refugees identified by
name, alien number, social security number, date of birth, and date of arrival; and (b) a description of the source
of data. Listings of refugees who are not identified by their alien numbers will not be considered. Written evidence
should be submitted separately from comments on the proposals in this notice no later than 30 days from date of publication
of this notice and should be addressed to: Loren Bussert, Office of Refugee Resettlement, 
370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW., Washington, DC 20447, Telephone: (202) 401-4732.

In determining whether a new county would be eligible to participate in the targeted assistance program, the same
four criteria used previously will be used, including the same cutoff points. Updated information on refugee arrivals,
concentrations, dependency rates, and receipt of cash assistance will be taken into account. To qualify for TAP funds,
a county (or group of adjacent counties within the same Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area, or SMSA) is required
to be above the median or above a specified cutoff point of jurisdictions for which data are reviewed in three of the
four following criteria: (1) The number of refugees placed in the county during FY 1983-1993; (2) the ratio of
the overall county population to the refugees in item (1), above; (3) the number of refugees in the county who were receiving
cash assistance under the programs of aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) and refugee cash assistance
(RCA) on October 1, 1993; and (4) the ratio of refugees in item (3) to the number of refugees in item (1). A county which
places above the cutoff point in any three of the above categories is determined to be qualified to apply for targeted
assistance funds. 

The median for Criterion 1, above, is 2,066.5. The median for Criterion 2 is 244.5. The cutoff point for Criterion 3
is 1,000. The cutoff point for Criterion 4 was established at 50%. Counties which meet three of the four criteria are
qualified for the program. 



B. Allocation Formula 



Since current welfare dependency data on refugees are not available at the national level, the Director of ORR proposes
to eliminate welfare dependency rates as a factor in calculating targeted assistance formula allocations to States
in FY 1994. In all other respects, the FY 1994 TAP formula allocations would be based on the same formula as in FY 1993,
updated to reflect arrivals through September 30, 1993. 

Under this formula, one portion of the allocation is based on refugee and Cuban/Haitian entrant arrivals during FY
1980-1982; funds for this portion of the formula are allocated on the same proportionate basis among participating
counties as in FY 1992. The second portion of the allocation is based on refugee and entrant placements in these counties
during calendar year (CY) 1983_September 30, 1993. 

For the participating counties, the $25,457,300 which is proposed to be allocated by formula would be apportioned
as follows: 

a. $8,655,482 or 34%, would be allocated on the basis of the formula which has been used for all previous targeted assistance
allocations (``old formula'') and which is based on initial placements during FY 1980-1982 and other factors
as described under ``Formula Used to Date'' in the FY 1989 TAP notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 3, 1989 (54 FR 27944). 

b. $16,801,818 or 66%, would be allocated on the basis of arrivals during CY 1983_September 30, 1993 (``new formula'').


The above percentages are based on the proportion of initial placements in these counties during the two periods:
338,247 refugee arrivals, or 34% of the total number of placements, during the old-formula period; and 658,930 or
66%, during the new-formula period. 

The old-formula allocation of $8,655,482 follows the same distribution among counties as in the past.

<DOCNO> FR940318-2-00141 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940318-2-00079 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The new-formula allocation of $16,801,818 is based on the 
number of initial placements in each county during CY 1983_September 30, 1993. Welfare dependency rates were not
used as a factor in this portion of the formula. 



VII. Proposed Allocations 



Table 1 lists the participating counties, the number of placements in each county during CY 1983_September 30, 1993,
the amount of each county's proposed allocation which is based on the old formula, the amount of each county's allocation
which is based on the new formula, and the county's total proposed allocation. 

Although Table 1 shows an amount for each county, the Director proposes, in the case of a State which contains more than
one qualified county, to continue to permit the State to determine (in accordance with the requirements set forth
in this notice) the appropriate allocation of the State's targeted assistance award among the qualified counties
in the State. If a State chooses to make allocations which are different from the notice, the State, as in the FY 1993
TAP, would be responsible for determining an appropriate and equitable basis for allocating the funds among the qualified
counties in the State and for including in its application a description of this allocation basis, the data to be used,
and the allocation proposed for each county. 



Table 2 provides State totals for the proposed county allocations set forth in Table 1. 

Table 3 indicates the areas that each participating county represents.

VIII. Application and Implementation Process 



Under the FY 1994 targeted assistance program, States would apply for and receive grant awards on behalf of qualified
counties in the State. A single allocation would be made to each State by ORR on the basis of an approved State application.
The State agency would, in turn, receive, review, and determine the acceptability of individual county targeted
assistance plans. 

Beginning in FY 1994, TAP funds will be awarded through a more streamlined grant process similar to that used for the
ORR social services formula grant program. An application and assurances will still be required of the States eligible
to receive TAP funding. Guidance on application content will be provided later this year in the FY 1994 final targeted
assistance notice. FY 1994 funds will be available for obligation by the State agency for a period of one year from the
date of the grant award. There will be no carryover of unobligated funds into the FY 1995 grant award. Funds obligated
by the States during this one-year period must be liquidated within 2 years from the date of obligation. 

Although funding for educational services in Dade County, FL, and for medical services at Jackson Memorial Hospital
in Miami, FL, is part of the appropriation amount for targeted assistance, the scope of activities for these special
projects will be administratively determined. Applications for those funds are therefore not subject to provisions
contained in this notice but to other requirements which have been conveyed separately. Similarly, the requirements
regarding the 10% portion of the targeted assistance appropriation that will be awarded separately will be addressed
in the grant announcement for those funds. 



IX. Application Requirements 



The proposed State application requirements for grants for the FY 1994 targeted assistance formula allocation are
as follows: States that are currently operating under approved management plans for their FY 1993 targeted assistance
program and wish to continue to do so for their FY 1994 grants may provide the following in lieu of resubmitting the full
currently approved plan: The State's application for FY 1994 funding shall provide: A. Assurance that the State's
current management plan for the administration of the targeted assistance program, as approved by ORR, will continue
to be in full force and effect for the FY 1994 targeted assistance program, subject to any additional assurances or
revisions required by this notice which are not reflected in the current plan. Any proposed modifications to the approved
plan will be identified in the application and are subject to ORR review and approval. Any proposed changes must address
and reference all appropriate portions of the FY 1993 application content requirements to ensure complete incorporation
in the State's management plan. 


B. Assurance that, for each qualified local area, targeted assistance funds will be used primarily for, but not limited
to, services to cash assistance recipients. 

C. Assurance that targeted assistance funds will be used primarily for the provision of services which directly enhance
refugee employment potential, have specific employment objectives, and are designed to enable refugees to obtain
jobs with less than one year's participation in the targeted assistance program. States must indicate what percentage
of FY 1994 targeted assistance formula allocation funds will be used for employment services. 

D. Timetables for awarding funds to the local areas consistent with the conclusion of services under the FY 1993 program.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940318-2-00146 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940318-2-00079 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

E. A line item budget and justification for State administrative costs limited to a maximum of 5% of the total award
to the State. Each total budget period funding amount requested must be necessary, reasonable, and allocable to the
project. 


States Administering the Program Locally


States that have administered the program locally or provide direct service to the refugee population (with the concurrence
of the county) must submit a program summary to ORR for prior review and approval. The summary must include a description
of the proposed services; a justification for the projected allocation for each component including relationship
of funds allocated to numbers of clients served, characteristics of clients, duration of training and services,
projected outcomes, and cost per placement. In addition, the program component summary should describe any ancillary
services or subcomponents such as day care, transportation, or language training. 


States With Two or More Counties Receiving Targeted Assistance Funds


As in FY 1993, a State with two or more local areas which qualify for the program may choose to determine respective county
allocations. If the State chooses to determine county allocations differently from those set forth in Table 1 of this
notice, the State should provide a description of the State's proposed allocation plan and the basis for the proposed
allocations. The allocation approach should be based upon existing FY 1993 funds, prior-year funds carried forward,
and indicators of refugee need for targeted assistance services. The application should contain a description of
the allocation approach, data used in its determination, the calculated allocation amount for each county, and the
rationale for the proposed allocations. States are encouraged to revise allocation formulas to assure appropriate
funding among eligible counties for the duration of the grant such that targeted assistance activities within the
State conclude simultaneously. Where the State chooses not to determine county allocation amounts, the State must
provide the allocations which are specified in this notice. 


X. Reporting Requirements 


States would be required to submit quarterly reports on the outcomes of the targeted assistance program, using the
same form which States use for reporting on refugee social services formula grants. This is Schedule A and Schedule
C of the ORR-6 Quarterly Performance Report form. ORR is no longer using the ORR-12 form which was originally
used to report on the outcomes of the targeted assistance program. ORR is in the process of consolidating its reporting
requirements. The new reporting form will consolidate social services and targeted assistance performance reporting
in one format in order to simplify and coordinate reporting. ORR expects this new form to be available when reporting
on FY 1994 grants begins, which would be at the end of the first quarter of FY 1995.

HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the
application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their
written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications,
the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991).

For properties listed as suitable/to be excess, the property may, if subsequently accepted as excess by GSA, be made
available for use by the homeless in accordance with applicable law, subject to screening for other Federal use. At
the appropriate time, HUD will publish the property in a Notice showing it as either suitable/available or suitable/unavailable.

For properties listed as suitable/unavailable, the landholding agency has decided that the property cannot be declared
excess or made available for use the assist the homeless, and the property will not be available.

Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this Notice.
Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the
toll free information line at 1-800-927-7588 for detailed instructions or write a letter to Mark
Johnston at the address listed at the beginning of this Notice. Included in the request for review should be the property

Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR part 1152 subpart F_Exempt Abandonments
to abandon approximately 0.43 miles of railroad between milepost 275.17

#

 and milepost 275.60

#

, in Richland County, OH. 
Conrail has certified that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) there is no overhead
traffic on the line; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government
entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission
or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the
requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental report), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic report), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal
letter), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have
been met. 
As a condition to this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under Oregon
Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects
affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. 
Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption
will be effective on April 17, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve
environmental issues,

1

 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2),

ab initio.

 
Conrail has filed an environmental report which addresses the abandonment's effects, if any, on the environmental
and historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA)
by March 23, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEA (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission,
Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEA, at (202) 927-6248. Comments on environmental
and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA is available to the public. 
Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where
appropriate, in a subsequent decision. 





Decided: March 9, 1994.

SUMMARY: 

This notice informs asylum applicants in Michigan, Delaware, and eastern Pennsylvania of changes in certain interview
locations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Chicago Asylum Office



Effective upon publication of this notice, applicants who live within the Michigan zip code areas 48800 through 49699
will have their interviews scheduled to take place at the Asylum Office in Chicago. The INS is unable to continue to
conduct circuit rides to Detroit to interview applicants who live in these locations. Interviews that have already
been scheduled to take place will be conducted in Detroit as scheduled. Applicants residing in the immediate Detroit
area and Eastern Michigan, in zip code areas 48000 through 48799 and 49700 through 49999, will continue to be scheduled
for appointments in Detroit.

The Chicago Asylum Office is located at 209 S. LaSalle Street, suite 625, Chicago, IL 60604.



Newark Asylum Office



All applicants who reside in Delaware and eastern Pennsylvania, within the jurisdiction of the Philadelphia District
Office, will now have their interviews scheduled to be conducted at the Newark Asylum Office. As is the case with the
Detroit circuit rides, resource limits do not permit the INS to continue to conduct circuit rides to Philadelphia
from the Newark Asylum Office.

The Newark Asylum Office is located at 200 Washington Place, Newark, NJ 07102.

All asylum applicants affected by this change in the location of circuit rides will be notified of the proper location
of the interview when the interview is scheduled. Questions regarding interviews should be directed to the appropriate
Asylum Office having jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence.

OSHA currently requests that employers cited during inspections submit abatement verification information and,
when appropriate, multi-step abatement plans and progress reports. The Agency is proposing the Abatement Verification
Rule so that it will have regulatory authority to require employers to submit proof of abatement. Abatement verification
information is used by OSHA to determine if hazards cited during OSHA inspections have been abated, to close inspection
case files, and to determine appropriate Agency action.

<USBUREAU>Employment Standards Administration; Wage and Hour Division</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions </DOCTITLE>



General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein. 

The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR part 1, appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein. 

Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest. 

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersede as decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR parts. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.

Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue NW., room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

John Roberts/Act II, Incorporated; Biddeford, ME; Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration



On February 7, 1994, the New England Regional Joint Board of the Amalgamated Clothing & Textile Workers Union
(ACTWU) requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's notice of Negative Determination
Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject firm.

The Department's Negative Determination was issued on January 27, 1994, and was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 14, 1994 (59 FR 6963).

The union submitted the name of the subject firm's major manufacturer in 1992 and stated that the manufacturer has
replaced the subject firm's production with imports.



Conclusion



After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration
of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.




Signed at Washington, DC, this 9th day of March 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Washington State Standards; Notice of Approval</DOCTITLE>



1. 

Background.

 Part 1953 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, prescribes procedures under Section 18 of the Occupational Safety
and Health Act of 1970 (hereinafter called the Act) by which the Regional Administrator for Occupational Safety and
Health (hereinafter called Regional Administrator) under a delegation of authority from the Assistant Secretary
of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health (hereinafter called the Assistant Secretary) (29 CFR 1953.4) will review
and approve standards promulgated pursuant to a State plan which has been approved in accordance with section 18(c)
of the Act and 29 CFR part 1902. On January 26, 1973, notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 (38 FR 2421) of the approval of the Washington plan and the adoption of subpart F to part 1952 containing the decision.

The Washington plan provides for the adoption of State standards that are at least as effective as comparable Federal
standards promulgated under section 6 of the Act. Section 1953.20 provides that where any alteration in the Federal
program could have an adverse impact on the at least as effective as status of the State program, a plan change supplement
shall be required.

By letter dated June 24, 1987, from Richard A. Davis, Director, to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, the State,
on its own initiative, submitted an amendment to WAC 296-24-165, Fixed and Portable Power Tool Requirements,
to change the scope and application of the standard from wood and woodworking tools to all tools. The State standard
is comparable to the Federal standard at 29 CFR 1910.213, Woodworking Machinery Requirements. The State change was
adopted on July 13, 1983, effective September 13, 1983, under Administrative Order 83-19. National Office
review revealed that the State standard was not at least as effective as the Federal standard, and the submission was
returned to the State for correction. On December 20, 1991, by letter from Joseph A. Dear, Director, to James W. Lake,
the State submitted a corrective amendment which deleted the changes submitted under Administrative Order 83-19,
and incorporated the suggested language from the National Office. The State's original Fixed and Portable Power
Took standard received 

Federal Register

 approval (41 FR 22655) on June 4, 1976. The State's corrective amendment was adopted on November 22, 1991, effective
December 24, 1991, under Washington's Administrative Order 91-07. The corrected State standard reduced the
1983 scope, but is still different from the Federal: The standard applies not only to wood, but also to wood products
that contain plastic materials.

By letter dated February 8, 1991, from Joseph A. Dear, Director, to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, the State,
on its own initiative, submitted an amendment to its Machine Guarding Code. The State's original Machine Guarding
Code received 

Federal Register

 approval (41 FR 22655) on June 4, 1976. The amendment was adopted on January 10, 1991, effective February 12, 1991,
under Administrative Order 90-18. The amendment added WAC 196-24-16531(6) to incorporate the
coverage of public school woodworking shops.

By letter dated December 20, 1991, from Joseph A. Dear, Director, to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, the State,
on its own initiative, submitted an amendment to its Portable Powered Tools Code. This housekeeping amendment changed
a reference in the standard. The State's original Portable Powered Tools standard received 

Federal Register

 approval (41 FR 4687) on January 30, 1976. The amendment was adopted on November 22, 1991, effective December 24, 1991,
under Administrative Order 91-07.

In response to a Federal standards change, and on its own initiative, the State submitted by letters dated December
30, 1988, and April 24, 1990, from Joseph A. Dear, Director, to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, a State standard
comparable to the Federal Benzene standard, 29 CFR 1910.1028. The State's submission was in response to the Federal
standard, published in the 

Federal Register

 (52 FR 34562) on September 11, 1987, and amended in the 

Federal Register

 (54 FR 24334) on June 7, 1989. The State standard was adopted on July 29, 1988 as an emergency temporary standard, with
permanent adoption on October 6, 1988, effective November 11, 1988, under Administrative Order 88-23. The
State amended Appendix D on May 15, 1989, effective June 30, 1989, under Administrative Order 89-03. A State-initiated
amendment to Appendix D was adopted on April 10, 1990, effective May 25, 1990, under Administrative Order 90-01.
The State's Benzene standard, located at WAC 296-62-07523, contains these minor differences: The State
specifies an alternate analytical method for determination of Benzene in air and bulk samples in Appendix D, and in
the Detection Limits Section the State broadens the sampling rate from the Federal standard statement of 0.2 L/min
to ``0.05 to 0.2 L/min''. Other corrections are administrative or typographical adjustments.

1990, effective November 15, 1990, under Administrative Order 90-14. On September 20, 1990, corrections to
the Federal standard were published in the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 38677). The State's second submission, dated June 17, 1991, adopted these corrections on May 20, 1991, effective
June 20, 1991, under Administrative Order 91-01. National Office review revealed discrepancies, and the submissions
were returned to the State for correction. On November 23, 1992, the State resubmitted its standard, as amended on
October 30, 1992, effective December 8, 1992, under Administrative Order 92-06. The State standard is contained
in WAC 296-24-11001 through 119. The standard is identical except for these minor differences: The State
adds gravity to the list of energy sources, and requires the employer's energy control program to be written. The State
also requires an outside employer (contractor) to follow the on-site employer's energy control program, while the
Federal standard requires the on-site employer to understand and comply with the restrictions and prohibitions
of the outside employer's program.

By letter dated December 20, 1991, from Joseph A. Dear, Director, to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, the State
submitted a standard comparable to the Federal standard 29 CFR part 1926 Subpart X, Stairways and Ladders in Construction,

(56 FR 41793) on August 23, 1991. The State standard was adopted on November 22, 1991, effective December 24, 1991,
under Administrative Order 91-07.

as published in the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 47687) on November 14, 1990. The State standard was identical except for minor changes to references in the standard
and renumbering of paragraphs. The State standard was adopted on November 22, 1991, effective December 24, 1991,
under Administrative Order 91-07. The State standard was originally approved in the 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 5956) on February 9, 1982.

By letters dated December 20, 1991, from Joseph A. Dear, and September 27, 1993, from Mark O. Brown, Director, to James
W. Lake, Regional Administrator, the State submitted a standard comparable to changes in the Federal standards,
29 CFR 1926.500 and .501, Floor and Wall Openings in Construction, as published in the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 47687) on November 14, 1990. The State made minor changes to the references in the standards, renumbered some
paragraphs, and changed some definitions to conform to other parts of Washington's standards. Some sections were
deleted to avoid duplication with other standards. The State standard was adopted on November 22, 1991, effective
December 24, 1991, under Administrative Order 91-07. The State standard was originally approved in the 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 5956) on February 9, 1982.

By letters dated February 15, 1989, and September 15, 1989, from Joseph A. Dear, Director, to James W. Lake, Regional
Administrator, the State submitted standards comparable to the Federal standards, 29 CFR 1910.211(d) and .217,

under Administrative Order 88-25. Amendments were adopted on August 10, 1992, effective September 10, 1992,
under Administrative Order 92-06. The State standard was originally approved in the 

Federal Register

 (41 FR 22655) on June 4, 1976. Washington accepts the Federal third-party validation and certification program for
presence sensing devices on mechanical power presses.

By letter dated February 8, 1991, from Joseph A. Dear, Director, to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, the State

was adopted on August 10, 1992, effective September 10, 1992, under Administrative Order 92-06. Regional Office
review revealed minor discrepancies in an otherwise identical standard, and the submission was returned to the State
for correction. On November 17, 1993, the State submitted a corrected copy. The State had adopted Federal and State-initiated
corrective amendments on October 20, 1993, effective November 1, 1993, under Administrative Order 93-06.

In response to Federal standards changes, the State submitted by letters dated March 3, 1993, from Mark O. Brown, Director,
to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, State standards comparable to Federal standards 29 CFR 1910.19, 1910.1050,
and 1926.60, Occupational Exposure to 4,4 Methylenedianiline (MDA); Final Rule, as published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 35666) on August 10, 1992. The State's standards were adopted on February 3, 1993, effective March 15, 1993,
under Administrative Order 92-15. They are contained in WAC 296-56-60001(2), WAC 296-62-076,
and WAC 296-155-173. The standards are identical to the Federal except for one minor difference: The sampling
and lab analysis procedures in 29 CFR 1910.1050 Appendix D and 29 CFR 1926.60 Appendix D were developed for the OSHA
Tracer 222 Gas Chromatograph. The State of Washington uses a Hewlett Packard 5880 Gas Chromatograph. Therefore,
the State needed to change the analytical procedures to reflect the Hewlett Packard procedures.

In response to Federal standards changes, the State submitted by letters dated April 21, 1992, and January 4, 1993,
from Joseph A. Dear, Director, to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, a State standard comparable to the Federal
standard 29 CFR 1910.1030, Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens, as published in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 64175) on December 6, 1991, and corrected (57 FR 29206) on July 1, 1992. The State's standard was adopted on April
1, 1992, effective May 5, 1992, under Administrative Order 92-01. The State's corrections were adopted on December
11, 1992, effective January 15, 1993, under Administrative Order 92-15. The State standard, at WAC 296-62-080,
contains some minor differences: At 29 CFR 1910.1030(b), the State's comparable standard WAC 296-62-08001(2)
adds the word ``contaminated'' before the last word ``sharps'' in the definition for contaminated laundry; punctuation
changes have been made; editorial changes have been added to incorporate the State agency title and the State's numbering
system.

In response to Federal standards changes, the State submitted by letters dated January 25, 1989, and November 30,
1992, from Joseph A. Dear, Director, and October 22, 1993, from Mark O. Brown, Director, to James W. Lake, Regional
Administrator, a State standard comparable to the Federal standard 29 CFR 1926, Subpart K, Electrical, as published
in 

Federal Register

 (51 FR 25318) on July 11, 1986. The State's first submission, dated January 25, 1989, was adopted on May 11, 1988, effective
June 10, 1988, under Administrative Order 88-04. After review by the National Office, the standard was determined
to be less effective than 29 CFR 1926, Subpart K, and was returned to the State on June 10, 1991. The State's second submission,
dated November 30, 1992, was adopted on November 10, 1992, effective December 18, 1992, under Administrative Order
92-13. This submission incorporated the corrections. Regional Office review revealed discrepancies, and
the submission was returned to the State for correction on December 18, 1992. On October 22, 1993, the State re-submitted
its standard, as revised September 22, 1993, effective November 1, 1993, under Administrative Order 93-04.
The State had changed the 750 volts requirements to 600 volts, as requested by OSHA. The State standard in contained
in WAC 296-155 part I. Minor editorial changes were made which did not change the meaning of the standard. The
State added provisions for construction site precautions to make open wiring inaccessible to unauthorized personnel.
Also, provisions were added concerning attaching, bonding, and grounding clamps or clips; receptacles for attaching
plugs and temporary outlet boxes; skirted-typed attachment plugs for equipment at more than 300 volts; hard usage
electrical cords for temporary lights; trailing cables protection; and electrical barriers. The State added definitions
for Hazard, J-Box (Junction Box), Shock Hazard, and Transformer. OSHA has determined that these changes are minor.

The above program change supplements have been incorporated as part of the State plan. All of the administrative orders
were adopted pursuant to RCW 34.040(2), 49.17.040, 49.17.050, Public Meetings Act RCW 42.30, Administrative Procedures
Act RCW 34.04, and the State Register Act RCW 34.08.

2. 

Decision.

 Having reviewed the State submissions in comparison with Federal standards, OSHA has determined that the State standard
for Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals is identical to the Federal standard; OSHA therefore
approves this standard. OSHA has also determined that the State standards and amendments for Machine Guarding, Portable
Powered Tools, Benzene, Control of Hazardous Energy (Lockout/Tagout), Stairways and Ladders in Construction,
Scaffolding in Construction, Floor and Wall Openings in Construction, Floor Openings and Stairways in Construction,
Presence Sensing Device Initiation of Mechanical Power Presses, 4,4 Methylenedianiline (MDA), Bloodborne Pathogens,
and Subpart K Electrical are at least as effective as the comparable Federal standards as required by section 18(c)(2)
of the Act. OSHA has also determined that the differences between the State and Federal standards and amendments are
minimal and that the standards are thus substantially identical. OSHA therefore approves these standards and amendments;
however, the right to reconsider this approval is reserved should substantial objections be submitted to the Assistant
Secretary.

<PARENT> FR940318-2-00097 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, OSHA has determined that the State's amendments for Fixed and Portable Power Tool Requirements are at
least as effective as the Federal amendment. The Fixed and Portable Power Tool Requirements amendment has been in
effect since September 13, 1983 with a broader scope that applied these requirements to the processing of all materials.
A 1991 amendment reduced the scope, but it is still broader than the Federal. During this time OSHA has received no indication
of significant objection to this different State standard either as to its effectiveness in comparison to the Federal
standards or as to its conformance with the product clause requirements of section 18(c)(2) of the Act. (A different
State standard applicable to a product which is distributed or used in interstate commerce must be required by compelling
local conditions and not unduly burden interstate commerce.) OSHA therefore approves these amendments; however,
the right to reconsider this approval is reserved should substantial objections be submitted to the Assistant Secretary.

3. 

Location of Supplements for Inspection and Copying.

 A copy of the standards supplements, along with the approved plan, may be inspected and copied during normal business
hours at the following locations: Office of the Regional Administrator, Occupational Safety and Health Administration,
1111 Third Avenue, Suite 715, Seattle, Washington 98101-3212; State of Washington Department of Labor and
Industries, Division of Industrial Safety and Health, 7273 Linderson Way, SW., Tumwater, Washington 98501; and
the Office of State Programs, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, room N-3700, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210.

4. 

Public Participation.

 Under 29 CFR 1953.2(c), the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternative procedures to expedite the review process
or for other good cause which may be consistent with applicable laws. The Assistant Secretary finds that good cause
exists for not publishing these supplements to the Washington State Plan as a proposed change and making the Regional
Administrator's approval effective upon publication for the following reason: The standards were adopted in accordance
with the procedural requirements of State law and further public participation would be repetitious.

This decision is effective March 18, 1994. (Sec. 18, Pub. L. 91-596, 84 Stat. 1608 [29 U.S.C. 667]).

This Environmental Assessment has been prepared to address potential environmental issues related to the licensee's
application of November 24, 1993, as supplemented January 7, 1994, to amend the Susquehanna, Unit 2 operating license.
The proposed amendment would increase the licensed core thermal power from 3293 MWt to 3441 MWt, which represents
an approximate increase of 4.5% over the current licensed power level.

The proposed action involves NRC issuance of a license amendment to uprate the authorized power level by changing
the operating license, including Appendix A of the license (Technical Specifications). No change is needed to Appendix
B of the license (Environmental Protection Plan_Nonradiological).



The Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed action is needed to permit an increase in the licensed core thermal power from 3293 MWt to 3441 MWt and provide
the licensee with the flexibility to increase the potential electrical output of Susquehanna, Unit 2, providing
additional electrical power to service domestic and commercial areas of the Pennsylvania Power and Light (PP&L)
Company and Allegheny Electric Cooperative, Inc. grid.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The ``Final Environmental Statement (FES) related to operation of Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and
2'' was issued June 1981 (NUREG-0564). By letter of June 15, 1992, the licensee submitted ``Licensing Topical
Report NE-092-001 for Power Uprate With Increased Core Flow'' for Susquehanna Steam Electric Station
(SSES), Units 1 and 2. The report was submitted to support future proposed amendments to Units 1 and 2 licenses to permit
up to a 4.5-percent increase in reactor thermal power and an 8-percent increase in core flow for each unit. The NRC approved
the topical report by letter of November 30, 1993. The licensee submitted the proposed amendment to implement power
uprate for Unit 2 by the letter of November 24, 1993, which is the subject of this environmental assessment. The licensee
expects to submit a similar application for Unit 1 within the next year. Section 11.4 of the above Topical Report provided
an environmental assessment of the proposed power uprate, including projected nonradiological environmental
effects and radiological effects from postulated accidents. Sections 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 of the Topical Report discussed
the potential effect of power uprate on the liquid, gaseous and solid radwaste systems. Sections 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6 discussed
the potential effect of power uprate on radiation sources within the plant and radiation levels from normal and post-accident
operation. Section 9.2 of the Topical Report presented the results of the calculated whole body and thyroid doses
at uprated power vs. current authorized power conditions at the exclusion area boundary and the low population zone
(LPZ) that might result from the postulated design basis radiological accidents [i.e., loss-of-coolant accident
(LOCA), main steam line break accident (MSLBA) outside containment, fuel handling accident (FHA) and control rod
drop accident (CRDA)]. Other accidents (non-LOCA) that were previously analyzed in the licensee's Final Safety
Analysis Report (FSAR) were also reassessed. All off-site radiological doses remain well below established regulatory
limits for power uprate operation.

Supplemental information related to the non-radiological environmental assessment was also presented in the licensee's
letter of February 7, 1994. 

The licensee summarized their reassessment of potential radiological and non-radiological impacts of station
operation at a slightly higher power level as follows:



Non-Radiological Environmental Assessment



Since power uprate will not significantly change the methods of generating electricity, nor of handling any influents
from the environment or effluents to it, no new or different environmental impacts are expected. The conservative
models and methods used in the environmental assessments of the original design, confirmed by studies conducted
during actual operation, show that more than adequate margin exists for the proposed power uprate without exceeding
the nonradiological environmental effects estimated in the original estimates and analyses and cited in the original
permit applications and impact statements.

The maximum withdrawal rate from the river will increase from the current value of 38,800 gpm to 40,700 gpm after power
uprate, an increase of 5%. The maximum blowdown rate will increase from the current value of 10,300 gpm to 10,800 gpm,
an increase of 5%.

After reviewing the additional water withdrawal requirements and increased blowdown rate from the natural draft
cooling towers at the Susquehanna SES (SSES) associated with power uprate, PP&L determined that there will be
no adverse effects to the river flow or river biota. This conclusion is based on two factors. First, the projected number
of fish estimated to be impinged per day would increase from 20 to 21 and the number of larvae estimated to be entrained
would increase by only 13,000 to 363,000 per day. Biologically, these estimated increases represent a negligible
impact to the river ecosystem. Second, the maximum cooling tower blowdown flow after power uprate is estimated to
increase by only 5% which amounts to 500 gpm. This amounts to less than .5% of the average river flow.

The cooling blowdown from the cooling tower basin is through a diffuser into the river. The characteristics of the
cooling tower are such that there is greater air flow through the tower caused by the higher circulating water return
temperature at power uprate conditions. This increased air flow removes the additional heat load resulting in negligible
cooling tower basin temperature changes.

Estimates, assuming that both SSES cooling towers are operating at the original 100% power level for a year, would
result in 58,000 pounds of solids per year as salt drift, spread over a large area. Modelling indicated the heaviest
localized deposition of solids would be 3 pounds/acre/year (SSES Environmental Report section 5.3.4). The power
uprate should have no impact on these estimates, especially with the conversatism built into the model by assuming
100% capacity factor. Note also that the design cooling tower drift is a function of circulating water flow which is
not changing for power uprate.

Studies on the possible effects of salt drift have been conducted at the SSES since 1977. These studies have included
monthly examination of natural vegetation during the growing season (1977 to date), annual quantitative vegetation
studies (1977 to date), a two-year study on the effect of simulated salt drift on corn and soybeans (1985-86),
and annual forest inspections since 1982.

The monthly examinations have utilized several transects (salt drift transects) in the vicinity of the power station
for possible salt damage to natural vegetation and incidence of parasitic plant diseases. The annual vegetation
studies consider possible long-term changes in forest utilized salt spray approximating the composition of the
cooling tower drift from the SSES at ``worst case'' concentration on agricultural crops in two fields.

None of the studies have found evidence for damage to agricultural crops or natural vegetation from salt drift. It
should be noted that the water used at the SSES (from the Susquehanna River) does not contain the same salts as brackish
water used at estuarine coo[l]ing tower[s]; its effects are more like plant micronutrients. The natural vegetation
studies over 15 years have found no salt drift damage and plant diseases in accordance with host presence and location.
The simulated salt drift studies utilized concentrations estimated at 5 and 10 times maximum salt drift concentration
in the SSES plume. It is therefore unlikely that salt drift damage would occur from an approximate 5% consumptive rise
in water usage.

There will be no changes to the cooling tower water chemistry as a result of power uprate. The pre-uprate levels of cycles
of concentration will be maintained. Since there will be a 5% increase in blowdown flow, there will be a 5% increase
in chemical discharge to the river.

The velocity of the intake water will increase by 5% to .37 ft/sec with power uprate which is below the recommended intake
design velocity of 0.5 ft/sec.

Sound level monitoring was conducted at both near site (less than 1 mile) and far site locations (greater than 1 mile)
from the Susquehanna SES site from 1972 and 1985. This survey was conducted prior to and during construction and during
one and two unit operation. The tow Cooling Towers were identified to be one of the major site nose sources. The cumulative
effects of all noise sources associated with station operation were determined to be less than the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency recommended day-night equivalent sound level limit of 55 dBA at all monitoring locations. It is
not expected that this level will be exceeded at any of the locations with the possible exception of an area approximately
2,200 feet southeast of the Cooling Towers where the measured sound level including a nighttime weighting factor
of +10 dBA was 54 DBA. Sound levels will be monitored at power uprate conditions.

As indicated previously, water discharge flow from power uprate may increase 5% above the design discharge rate to
10,800 gpm. This is well below the maximum flow of 16,000 gpm reviewed in the SSES Environmental Report (Table 3.3-1)
and, therefore, the additional flow from power uprate is not considered to be an adverse impact to the river.

At the Susquehanna SES cooling tower blowdown discharges into the river through a diffuser pipe located on the river
bottom. Velocity of this discharge was calculated in Appendix G, Thermal Discharge, Response 1, pages THE-1.1
and 1.2 of the Environmental Report. Water discharges through 72-4
'
' ports into the river. The velocity associated with a 10,000 gpm discharge was calculated to be 5.83 fps and
rounded to 6 fps. This rounded off value was used when preparing [the] SSES Environmental Report. The velocity associated
with a 10,800 gpm discharge is also approximately 6 fps.

Thermal plume studies conducted in the fall, winter, and spring of 1986-87 indicated a maximum temperature
rise of 1
 F within an 80 foot mixing zone from the diffuser pipe. Present Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources
water quality criteria states that ambient river temperature rise from thermal discharges shall not cause the temperature
in the receiving water body to rise more than 2
 F in one hour. The thermal discharges from the cooling tower blowdown from power uprate will not exceed this water
quality criteria.

Chemical composition of the blowdown after power uprate will not exceed the NPDES permit limits.




The staff reviewed the potential effect of power uprate on plant makeup water usage. There will be no significant increase
in makeup water requirements for any plant systems as a result of power uprate. This includes the reactor coolant system,
the condensate, feedwater and steam systems, the emergency service water system, the reactor and turbine building
closed cooling water systems or any of the normal service water systems. The only effect of power uprate on the component
cooling water system and turbine plant cooling water system from power uprate is an increased heat load. The service
water system removes heat from the heat exchangers in the turbine, reactor and radwaste buildings and transfers this
heat to the cooling towers where it is dissipated. The increased heat load on intermediate systems is reflected in
the discussion of potential impacts from increased cooling tower blowdown and thermal discharges remain acceptable.
Inventory makeup is not affected. Makeup requirements for the auxiliary boiler, the fire protection system or other
auxiliary systems are unaffected by power uprate.



The licensee has stated that there are no changes required to the SSES Environmental Protection Plan as a result of
operation at uprated power. Specifically, the licensee stated:




Chapter 3, Consistency Requirements, section 3.1, Plant Design Operations, of this plan discusses how proposed
changes need to be addressed. Through the PP&L Unreviewed Environmental Question Program, changes such as that
of power uprate will be reviewed.

An ``Unreviewed Environmental Question'' evaluation was conducted in accordance with each unit's ``Environmental
Protection Plan'' to determine if power uprate could cause any significant environmental impacts. This included
a review of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit and other environmental permits,
and indicated that power uprate should not contribute to any new noncompliances. No significant increase in generation
of hazardous or nonhazardous waste is expected, except for a 3 to 5% increase in sediment removed from the cooling tower.
Nor is any change expected in the load on the sewage treatment plant. River water use will remain within the existing
agreement with the Susquehanna River Basi[n] Commission. PP&L has determined that power uprate is not an ``unreviewed
environmental question.''

The proposed power uprate therefore requires no change to the ``Environmental Protection Plans'' since it does not
involve:

(a) A significant increase in any adverse environmental impact previously evaluated in the ``Environmental Report_Operating
License Stage,'' or the ``Final Environmental Statement,'' or in any decision of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board;

(b) A significant change in effluents or power levels, or

(c) A matter not previously reviewed and evaluated in the documents specified in paragraph (a) which might have a significant
adverse environmental impact.



Radiological Environmental Assessment



As discussed previously, the licensee addressed potential radiological impacts attributable to operation at uprated
power conditions in Sections 8, 9, and 11 of the initial Topical Report. The licensee concluded:




Adequate margin also exists for the proposed power uprate without exceeding regulatory limits for radiological
effects. Current operating experience indicates that actual releases and waste disposal after power uprate will
continue to be significantly less than the original estimates. For these reasons, power uprate is not expected to
have an adverse effect on the routine operation ``dose commitment'' estimated by previous radiological environmental
analyses, and no revision of these analyses is required.

<TEXT>
 

The environmental assessment includes an estimate of potential exposure from all accident types combined. Regulatory
Guide 1.49 requires calculation of accident doses at 102% of uprated thermal power, or 3510 MWt. Although direct comparison
with the original analyses is not meaningful because of changes in methodology, a comparison on a consistent basis
would show that the expected dose is approximately proportional to power. The original calculation was done at 3439
MWt. The estimated potential exposure from all accident types combined will therefore change by about the ratio of
3510/3439, or about 2 percent, which is not a significant change compared to the uncertainty in the probability estimates.
No revision of these analyses is therefore required.

(Liquid radwaste throughput may increase up to 5% to a level which is within the processing capability of the system.)
The activity levels of some radwaste streams containing coolant activation products may increase up to 10%, due to
the 4.5% core flux increase and a 5% crud increase to the reactor which are assumed to occur.

Since the power uprate level of 3441 MWt is not significantly different from that analyzed previously, it is not anticipated
there will be a significant increase in radiological effluents. Also, pre-power uprate technical specification
limits will be maintained.




The NRC staff has concluded that the NRC's FES (NUREG-0564) is valid for operation at the proposed uprated power
conditions. The staff also concluded that the plant operating parameters impacted by the proposed power uprate would
remain within the bounding conditions on which the conclusions of the FES are based.

The NRS staff has reviewed the licensee's re-evaluation of the potential radiological and non-radiological environmental
impacts for the proposed action. On the basis of this review, the NRC staff finds that the radiological and non-radiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed small increase in power are essentially immeasurable and do
not change the conclusion in the FES that the operation of Susquehanna would cause no significant adverse impact upon
the quality of the human environment.

Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological or
non-radiological environmental impact.



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the proposed
license amendment, any alternative with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.

The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. This would not significantly reduce the environmental
impact of plant operation but would restrict operation of Susquehanna, Unit 2 to the currently licensed power level
and prevent the facility from generating the approximately 50 MWe that is obtainable from the existing plant design.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the ``Final Environmental Statement
related to the operation of Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and 2,'' dated June 1981.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and consulted with the Bureau of Radiation Protection, Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Resources. The State Liaison Officer had no comment regarding the NRC's proposed action.



Finding of No Significant Impact



Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed license amendment.

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated November 24, 1993. This document
is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the Osterhout Free Library, Reference Department, 71 South Franklin Street, Wilkes-Barre,

<DOCTITLE>Carolina Power & Light Co.; (H.B. Robinson Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 2); Exemption Amendment</DOCTITLE>


I



Carolina Power & Light Company (CP&L or the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR-23
that authorizes operation of the H.B. Robinson Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 2 (HBR), at a steady-state reactor power
level not in excess of 2300 megawatts thermal. The facility consists of one pressurized water reactor located at the
licensee's site in Darlington County, South Carolina. The license provides, among other things, that it is subject
to all rules, regulations and Orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC) now or hereafter
in effect.


II



Section 50.54(q) of 10 CFR part 50 requires a licensee authorized to operate a nuclear power reactor to follow and maintain
in effect emergency plans that meet the standards of 10 CFR 50.47(b) and the requirements of appendix E to 10 CFR part
50. Section IV.F.2 of appendix E requires that each licensee annually exercise its emergency plan. Section IV.F.3
of appendix E requires that each licensee shall exercise with offsite authorities such that the State and local emergency
plans are exercised biennially.

The NRC may grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations which, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), are (1) authorized
by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and
security; and (2) present special circumstances. Special circumstances exist when the exemption would result in
benefit to the public health and safety that compensates for any decrease in safety that may result from the granting
of the exemption (see 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(iv)). In addition, special circumstances exist when the exemption would
provide only temporary relief from the applicable regulation and the licensee has made a good faith effort to comply
with the regulation (see 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v)). 

On December 30, 1993, the Commission granted an Exemption to the H.S. Robinson Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 2, from
the requirements of 10 CFR 50.47 and 10 CFR part 50, appendix E, section F.2, to conduct an annual exercise of the Emergency
Plan in 1993, and authorized the rescheduling of the annual exercise of the HBR Emergency Plan from November 30, 1993,
to the week of March 21, 1994.

By letter dated February 21, 1994, the licensee requested an amendment to the Exemption to allow the annual emergency
preparedness exercise to be conducted on March 30, 1994. The licensee stated that the schedule to conduct the exercise
during the week of March 21, 1994, conflicted with scheduled training being conducted by the affected State agencies.
In addition, due to the extended forced outage the plant is undergoing, deferral of licensed operator requalification
training and examinations has resulted in the unavailability of the plant simulator, which is necessary to support
the exercise during the week of March 21, 1994. The Commission's staff has evaluated the information provided by the
licensee to support the amendment to the Exemption and finds the 3-day delay of the annual exercise is acceptable.


Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the Exemption Amendment as requested
by the licensee's letter dated February 21, 1994, as discussed above, is authorized by law and will not endanger life
or property and is otherwise in the public interest. Furthermore, the Commission hereby grants an Exemption Amendment
to the Exemption granted on December 30, 1993, and authorizes a delay until March 30, 1994, of the annual emergency
preparedness exercise which had been scheduled for the week of March 21, 1994. The amendment to the Exemption is subject
to modification by rule, regulation or Order of the Commission.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission previously determined on December 28, 1993, that granting the Exemption
would have no significant impact on the environment (59 FR 100). The Exemption Amendment does not alter that finding.

This Exemption Amendment is effective upon issuance.

<DOCTITLE>Atomic Safety and Licensing Board; Indiana University School of Medicine; Indianapolis, IN; Hearing</DOCTITLE>




Notice is hereby given that, by Memorandum and Order, dated March 11, 1994, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board has
granted the request of the Indiana University School of Medicine (Licensee) for a hearing in the above titled proceeding.
The hearing concerns an Order Imposing Civil Monetary Penalty, issued by the NRC Staff on January 18, 1994 (published
at 59 FR 4123, January 28, 1994). The parties to the proceeding are the Licensee and the Staff. The issues to be considered
at the hearing are: (a) Whether the Licensee was in violation of NRC requirements set forth in a written notice of violation
and proposed imposition of civil penalty, dated October 7, 1993; and (b) whether, on the basis of such violation, the
order imposing a civil penalty should be sustained.
Materials concerning this proceeding are on file at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555, and at the Commission's Region III Office, 801 Warrenville Road, Lisle, Illinois 60532-4351. 

During the course of this proceeding, the Licensing Board will conduct one or more prehearing conferences and evidentiary
hearing sessions. The time and place of these sessions will be announced in later Licensing Board orders. Members
of the public will be invited to attend any such sessions. 



It is so ordered.

<DOCTITLE>Tennessee Valley Authority (Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Unit 2); Exemption</DOCTITLE>



I



The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR-79, which authorizes
operation of the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Unit 2 (the facility, Unit 2). The license provides, among other things,
that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission)
now or hereafter in effect.

The facility consists of a pressurized water reactor located on TVA's Sequoyah site in Hamilton County, Tennessee.



II



Sections III.D.2(a) and III.D.3 of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 require that Types B and C local leak rate tests be performed
during reactor shutdown for refueling, or other convenient intervals, but in no case at intervals greater than 2 years.

On March 15, 1992, SQN Unit 2 started the Cycle 5 refueling outage. All Type B and Type C local leak rate tests were performed
during the outage and the unit was returned to service on May 17, 1992. Between March 1, 1993, and October 19, 1993, Unit
2 was shut down. Several forced outages also occurred following restart. Due to the accumulated length of time the
Unit was shut down, TVA has postponed the start of the Unit 2 Cycle 6 refueling outage from September 1993 to July 1994.
As a result, the expiration of the 2-year time interval for some Type B and Type C tests occurs before the outage starts.
To perform the tests in accordance with the requirement would force the unit to shut down in March 1994. To prevent this,
the licensee has requested an exemption that would allow a one-time deferment of the Appendix J 2-year interval requirement
from March 15, 1994, until the shutdown for the refueling outage starting in July 1994, a total of approximately 4 months.

The extension would affect 39 bellows penetrations, 47 electrical penetrations, 196 isolation valves, 11 flanges,
1 hydrogen analyzer, and 10 residual heat removal system spray header valves. These valves and components, which
represent approximately 88 percent of the total leak rate test program, are considered by the licensee to be leak tight
and in good condition, which was verified by the leak rate tests performed during the Cycle 5 refueling outage. Based
on the present containment leak rate that accounts for less than 8.0 percent of the applicable limit, the licensee
believes that the remaining margin is sufficient to ensure that any incremental increase in leakage because of the
extension, will not result in unacceptable as-found test results. Also, based on historical data, the licensee believes
that any incremental increase in leakage from these components because of the extension would be small. In addition,
many of the components were included in the boundary for the last Type A test that was performed in April 1992, and have
been subjected to improve maintenance practices, which provide increased assurance that the components will be
capable of performing their intended safety function. The only valves that had appreciable leakage during both the
Unit 2 Cycle 4 and Cycle 5 leak rate tests were essential raw cooling water system valves, 2-FCV-67-87
and 2-FCV-67-575A (in each case, retests following repairs showed there was no leakage). To further
assure safe plant operation, the licensee has committed to perform a leak rate test of these valves should the unit
experience a forced outage to Mode 5.



III



Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the Commission may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own initiative,
grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50 when: (1) The exemptions are authorized by law, will not present
an undue risk to public health or safety, and are consistent with the common defense and security; and (2) when special
circumstances are present. Special circumstances are present whenever, according to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), ``Application
of the regulation in the particular circumstances would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule or is not necessary
to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule * * *.''

The underlying purpose of the requirement to perform Type B and Type C containment leak rate tests at intervals not
to exceed 2 years, is to ensure that any potential leakage pathways through the containment boundary are identified
within a time span that prevents significant degradation from continuing or being unknown, and long enough to allow
the tests to be conducted during scheduled refueling outages. This interval was originally published in appendix
J when refueling cycles were conducted at approximately annual intervals and has not been changed to reflect 18-month
or 2-year operating cycles. It is not the intent of the regulation to require a plant shutdown solely for the purpose
of conducting the periodic leak rate tests. Based on historical data at SQN, any incremental increase in leakage because
of the extension would be small. Improved maintenance practices implemented during the Unit 2 Cycle 5 outage and improved
testing techniques of containment isolation valves to detect any degraded performance indications, provide increased
assurance that these components will perform their safety function. In addition, on the average, as-left leak rates
are less than 25 percent of the established reference leak rates. Therefore, since the maximum extension is relatively
short (4 months) compared to the 2-year test interval requirement, it is unlikely that substantial degradation of
the containment components leading to the failure of the containment to perform its safety function would occur.
As a result, the application of the regulation in the particular circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying
purpose of the rule.



IV



For the foregoing reasons, the NRC staff has concluded that the licensee's proposed increase of the 2-year time interval
for performing Type B and Type C Containment Leak Rate Tests until the Cycle 6 refueling outage will not present an undue
risk to public health and safety and is consistent with the common defense and security. The NRC staff has determined
that there are special circumstances present, as specified in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2), such that application of 10 CFR
part 50, appendix J, sections III.D.2(a) and III.D.3 are not necessary in order to achieve the underlying purpose
of this regulation.

Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), an exemption is authorized by law,
will not endanger life or property or common defense and security, and is, otherwise, in the public interest. Therefore,
the Commission hereby grants the Tennessee Valley Authority exemption from the requirements of Sections III.D.2(a)
and III.D.3 of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 as requested in the submittal.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not result in any significant
adverse environmental impact (59 FR 11812).

This exemption is effective upon issuance.

<DOCTITLE>Western Nuclear Incorporated; Split Rock Mill</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent to amend Source Material License SUA-56 to modify the erosion protection design of the plan
for reclamation of the Split Rock Mill disposal area which is located in Fremont County, Wyoming, and Notice of Opportunity
to request a hearing.





1. Proposed Action



By letters dated October 29, 1993, and February 7, 1994, Western Nuclear Incorporated (WNI), holder of Source Material
License SUA-56 for the Split Rock Mill in Wyoming, requested an amendment to revise the approved reclamation
plan for the Split Rock Mill disposal area. Proposed revisions included a new radon attenuation barrier design and
minor changes to the flood protection design.



2. Reason for Request to Amend License



WNI proposes to revise the design of the radon attenuation barrier by using clay soil from an offsite source instead
of the onsite soil previously proposed. In addition, the alignment of the diversion ditches is being altered slightly
based on actual field surveys.

The proposed revisions will not significantly change the approved reclamation plan. The tailing will still be reclaimed
in place by covering them with a clay layer protected by a layer of rock. Runoff originating in areas adjacent to the
tailings will still be diverted around the pile as was originally proposed. The only notable change in the proposal
is that the clay to be used for the radon attenuation barrier will be obtained from an offsite source instead of the onsite
borrow areas originally proposed. An environmental assessment of this action is not required as the Bureau of Land
Management has already issued a ``Decision of Record and Finding of No Significant Impact'' for the soil borrow area.
The date of that decision was September 29, 1993. In conjunction, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality
issued Small Mining Permit No. 694 on December 13, 1993, for this action.

Paragraph (c)(11) of 10 CFR 51.22, categorically excludes the requirement for an environmental assessment for this
licensing action. That paragraph states that the categorical exclusion applies to the issuance of amendments to
licenses for uranium mills provided that : (1) There is no significant change in the types or significant increase
in the amounts of any effluents that may be released offsite, (2) there is no significant increase in individual or
cumulative occupational radiation exposure, (3) there is no significant construction impact, and (4) there is no
significant increase in the potential for or consequences from radiological accidents.

The licensing action meets these criteria as the proposed amendment involves only minor changes in the erosion protection
and radon attenuation barrier designs and in the source of soil borrow. An environmental report is not required from
the licensee since the amendment does not meet the criteria of 10 CFR 51.60(b)(2).



3. Notice of Opportunity to Request Hearing



In accordance with title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, part 2 (10 CFR 2), paragraph 2.1205(c)(1), interested parties
are hereby notified that they may request a hearing pursuant to the procedures set forth in 10 CFR 2.1205 within thirty
( 3) days of the publication of this notice.

<USDEPT>POSTAL RATE COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Postal Rate and Fee Changes, 1994; U.S. Postal Service's Filing of Proposed Postal Rate and Fee Changes; Ruling on
Motion for Settlement Conference; and Order Concerning Related Commission Proceedngs</DOCTITLE>








Issued March 15, 1994

 


Notice is hereby given that on March 8, 1994, the United States Postal Service filed a request with the Postal Rate Commission
for a recommended decision on proposed changes in rates of postage and fees for postal services.

1

 The Service simultaneously filed a motion seeking Commission authorization of settlement negotiations, which
it suggests could proceed on a parallel track with the usual rate case deliberations. In furtherance of a settlement,
the Service is distributing a proposed draft Stipulation and Agreement. 





The Service's request has been assigned Docket No. R94-1. The request is on file with the Commission's docket
section and available for public inspection during regular business hours. The Service's draft Stipulation and
Agreement, which will provide a basis for settlement discussions, has been sent to previous rate case participants.
Additional copies are available from the Postal Service by contacting Ms. Stephanie Majors at (202) 268-2988.




Justification for Filing



The Postal Service asserts that without rate and fee changes, it will incur a substantial revenue deficiency in the
proposed test year,

2

 in contravention of 39 U.S.C. 3621. Request at 1. In support of this claim, the Service identifies a test-year revenue
requirement of approximately $55.2 billion and total revenues of approximately $50.5 billion, producing a revenue
deficiency of approximately $4.7 billion. As 39 U.S.C. 3621 requires that total estimated income and appropriations
equal as nearly as practicable total estimated costs, the Service proposes rate and fee changes ``as a basis for providing
sufficient revenues in the test year to cover the projected revenue deficiency.'' Id. at 1-2. (Footnote omitted.)
The Service claims that adoption of the suggested rates will increase total revenues by approximately $4.1 billion,
change the revenue requirement by $0.61 billion, and yield a revenue deficiency of about $0.8 million. Current and
proposed rates and fees are contained in Attachment A to the Service's request, which is reproduced as Attachment
A to this notice and order. 





Overview of Proposed Rate Changes. 



Testimony supporting the Service's request describes this rate filing as ``an across-the-board increase'' of 10.3
percent, which corresponds to a three-cent increase over the current 29-cent First-Class (first-ounce) stamp.
Rates, fees and discounts for subclasses of mail and special services are adjusted by 10.3 percent, or the nearest
percentage that corresponds with historical rounding constraints, such as a whole-cent increment for the First-Class
Mail additional-ounce rate and a tenth of a penny increment for third-class bulk regular rates. USPS-T-11
at 6. Significantly, Postal Service testimony acknowledges that in certain cases, an adjustment other than 10.3
percent is required, entailing larger increases for subclasses which have experienced large attributable cost
increases, and larger or smaller increases to achieve legislated cost coverages for preferred rate categories.
The net result of these considerations is described as an overall average rate increase of 10.0 percent. Id. at 6-7.


Average percentage increases, by major class, subclass or category, are set out in the following table.

I. Settlement Conference 


As indicated above, the Postal Service has stated its intention to pursue a settlement in this case and has moved for
a settlement conference pursuant to rule 29 of the Commission's rules of practice and procedure (39 CFR 3001.29).

3

 A copy of this motion and a draft copy of the proposed Stipulation and Agreement have been mailed to every party who participated
in the last general rate case (Docket No. R90-1). In support of its motion, the Service cites the relatively limited
nature of this filing compared to previous requests; widespread expressions of interest in a settlement; and the
potential for simplifying and expediting the case and saving significant expense. Statement and Motion at 2. In the
interests of expedition, the Service suggests that the Commission allow the settlement to proceed on a parallel track
with normal rate case procedures. 




The Service asks the Commission to take several steps in furtherance of the proposed settlement proceedings. These
encompass logistics and scheduling matters (including a relatively early date for the first conference); expedited
public notice of the conference and of information on obtaining the Service's proposed Stipulation and Agreement;
and appointment of the Postal Service as coordinator. 


Ruling on the Settlement Motion 


Given the Service's representations about the degree of interest in a settlement, and the feasibility of proceeding
on parallel tracks, the Commission grants the Service's motion for early scheduling of an off-the-record initial
settlement conference. The conference will be held on March 24, 1994 in the Commission's hearing room at 1333 H Street
NW., Washington, DC 20268-0001 beginning at 9:30 a.m. We also grant the Postal Service's request that it serve
as settlement coordinator. The coordinator will be expected to provide a meaningful opportunity for all interested
participants to take part in the settlement proceedings. The Postal Service and other potential signatories should
be aware that intervention will be allowed through April 6, 1994, and that all intervenors will be given an adequate
opportunity to provide comments concerning any proposed settlement. 
As the Service indicates, announcing the settlement conference in this Notice will foreclose those who have not already
intervened from an opportunity to respond to the instant motion. Although we are reluctant to forgo the possibility
of hearing from a full spectrum of the mailing public, the factors cited by the Postal Service lead us to agree that an
expedited decision on the Service's motion is in the best interests of the general public. These factors include the
limited nature of this rate filing, the potential savings in time and expense, and the likelihood that immediately
scheduling a settlement conference on the terms outlined above will facilitate careful review of the proposal without
delaying or otherwise limiting participants' ability to respond to the Postal Service's request should settlement
not be effectuated. 


II. Procedural Aspects of Docket No. R94-1 


As indicated above, initiation of settlement negotiations does not foreclose the Commission from planning procedural
aspects of the ``rate case track''. The following material addresses certain procedural matters and alerts interested
parties to a proposed procedural schedule (reproduced as Attachment B.) The latter is published with the understanding
that settlement negotiations may overtake some of the deadlines and/or actions listed. 


Intervention: Full, Limited and Commenter Status 


In line with its obligations under 39 U.S.C. 3624, the Commission intends to hold hearings on the Service's proposal
to the extent required by law and consistent with its rules of practice. Any person wishing to be heard in this matter
or to participate as a party in the hearings should file a written notice of intervention with the Secretary of the Commission
on or before April 6, 1994. Notices must conform to  3001.20 of the Commission's rules of practice (39 CFR 3001.20).
The Commission directs specific attention to  3001.20(b) which provides that notices of intervention shall
affirmatively indicate whether the intervenor intends to participate actively in the hearings. Persons interested
in limited participation who do not wish to become full intervenors may, on or before April 6, 1994 file a written notice
of intervention as a limited participator pursuant to  3001.20a of the Commission's rules of practice (39 CFR
3001.20a). In addition, persons wishing to express their views informally, in a capacity other than a party or limited
participant, may file comments pursuant to  3001.20b of the Commission's rules (39 CFR 3001.20b). Informal
comments may be filed at any time. Active participation in settlement negotiations is conditioned on intervention
as either a full or limited participant. 


Representation of the General Public 



The Commission designates W. Gail Willette, Acting Director of the Commission's Office of the Consumer Advocate
(OCA), as the representative of the general public in this proceeding, including authorized settlement negotiations.
Ms. Willette will direct the activities of Commission personnel assigned to assist her and, at an appropriate time,
will provide the names of these employees for the record. Neither she nor the assigned personnel will participate
in or advise as to any Commission decision in this proceeding.

4

 




Service on the OCA 


Parties shall serve the OCA separately with three copies of all filings in addition to, and simultaneously with, service
on the Commission of the original and 24 copies required by 10(c) of the rules of practice (39 CFR 3001.10(c)). 


Discovery 

The Commission directs participants' attention to the provisions of   3001.25, 3001.26, 3001.27 and
3001.28 of the rules of practice concerning discovery requests (39 CFR 3001.25, 3001.26, 3001.27 and 3001.28). The
discovery process is an aspect of this proceeding the Commission is especially interested in expediting. In this
regard, we point out that under rules of practice, interested parties may immediately obtain active status in this
proceeding by filing a notice of intervention. Accordingly, all parties filing a notice may immediately engage in
discovery of the Postal Service's direct case without any additional action by the Commission. In accord with the
Commission's interest in expediting this case, parties are actively encouraged to begin discovery as soon as possible.

To facilitate development of an orderly record, discovery requests should be addressed to a specific party and witness
and numbered sequentially. For example, the Postal Service's sixteenth question concerning the testimony of the
OCA's first witness should be identified as USPS/OCA-T1-16. Participants should identify filings as
informatively as possible, including an indication of relief sought or the issue being addressed. 


Prehearing Conference 

An initial prehearing conference will be held on April 7, 1994. In accordance with the Commission's goal of expeditious
consideration, the Commission will conduct all prehearing conferences and hearings en banc (39 CFR 3001.30(b)).
Additional prehearing conferences will be scheduled if needed. Unless otherwise indicated, all conferences and
hearings will begin at 9:30 a.m. in the Postal Rate Commission's hearing room, 1333 H Street NW., suite 300, Washington,
DC 20268-0001. Hearings will be conducted on the record and transcribed by an official reporter, except where
the presiding officer determines otherwise.

III. Procedures for Expedition 



The Commission's decision to grant the Service's motion for a settlement conference indicates our interest in and
support for measures directed at expediting omnibus rate case proceedings. In line with our decision to pursue parallel
settlement/rate case tracks, we are issuing this detailed order so all who anticipate participating in this proceeding
will have sufficient time to prepare for the prehearing conference. In this regard, we direct the attention of parties
and those who intend to intervene to Commission rule 24(d) (39 CFR 3001.24(d)), which sets forth the matters the presiding
officer and participants may consider and resolve at the prehearing conference, including the limitation of issues.
All interested persons will have an opportunity to comment, at that time, on the tentative procedural schedule (Attachment
B) and on proposed special rules of practice which will be distributed shortly by the presiding officer. Accordingly,
participants are expected to appear at the prehearing conference fully prepared to discuss these and any other pertinent
matters in detail and to make the necessary scheduling commitments that resolution of these matters will entail.
In particular, we note that the Service's request does not contain any proposed changes to the Domestic Mail Classification
Schedule (DMCS). Further, there is some expectation that the Postal Service may request major changes in the DMCS
in the near future. The Postal Service should be prepared to state whether and when it expects to propose major reclassification
initiatives applicable to each of the classes of mail, and all participants should be prepared to discuss whether
the consideration of proposals for changes in mail classifications in this proceeding will be productive given the
pendency of major reclassification initiatives. In addition, to the extent feasible, parties are requested to provide
comments on the tentative procedural dates and proposed special rules seven days prior to the prehearing conference.



In conformity with the requirement of the Postal Reorganization Act and consistent with our past practice in general
rate cases, we are resolved to expedite the conduct of this proceeding. We intend to adhere to the procedural requirements
and filing deadlines set forth in our rules of practice and in any special rules of practice subsequently issued. 

The Commission orders: 

(A) The Commission intends to hold public hearings, and will sit en banc in the above-captioned proceeding. Interventions
must be filed by April 6, 1994. 

(B) W. Gail Willette, Acting Director of the Office of the Consumer Advocate, is designated to represent the interests
of the general public in this proceeding. Service of documents on the Commission shall not constitute service on the
OCA, who shall be served separately with three copies of all documents. 

(C) The Commission authorizes settlement negotiations in this proceeding in accordance with Commission rules and
with the considerations identified in the body of this order. 

(D) The Commission appoints the Postal Service as Settlement Coordinator. 

(E) The first settlement conference will be held March 24, 1994, beginning at 9:30 a.m. in the Postal Rate Commission
hearing room, 1333 H Street NW., suite 300, Washington, DC 20268-0001. The settlement coordinator may determine
the need for, and date of, any additional settlement conferences. 

(F) The Postal Service should provide a copy of its proposed Stipulation and Agreement to intervenors in this proceeding
who were not intervenors in Docket No. R90-1. 

(G) A prehearing conference in this proceeding will be held on April 7, 1994, beginning at 9:30 a.m. in the Postal Rate
Commission hearing room, 1333 H Street NW., suite 300, Washington, DC 20268-0001. The conference will be held
for the purposes specified in  3001.24 of the Commission's rules of practices (39 CFR 3001.24) and in this Notice
and Order. 

(H) The appropriateness of the proposed schedule (set out in Attachment B to this Order) will be discussed at the prehearing
conference. Recommendations for extensive changes should be filed with the Commission at least seven working days
prior to the prehearing conference. 

(I) The Secretary shall cause this Notice and Order to be published in the 

Federal Register

.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Proposed Rule Change by the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc., Relating to Amendments to the NASD's Proposed Short Sale Rule



March 11, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on March 8, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') Amendment No. 6 to the proposed rule
change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change, as amended, from interested
persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The NASD is amending its proposed short sale rule or ``bid test'' applicable to stocks traded on the Nasdaq National
Market by expanding the options market makers' exemption from the rule to include certain short sales effected by
index options market makers. Specifically, for an eighteen-month pilot period, the proposal provides that an NASD
member shall be permitted, consistent with its quotation obligations, to execute a short sale for the account of an
index options market maker that would otherwise be in contravention of the NASD's short sale rule so long as: (1) The
short sales are hedges of existing or contemporaneously established index options positions and (2) the dollar value
of all stock sold short to hedge the offsetting stock index options position(s) does not exceed the aggregate current
index value of the offsetting index options position(s).

The NASD also is proposing four other amendments to the NASD's short sale rule. First, the NASD proposes to amend the
filing to provide that all market maker exemptions from the rule will be uniform in duration. Specifically, under
the proposal, the exemptions afforded qualified Nasdaq market makers, Nasdaq warrant market makers, and qualified
options market makers will all expire eighteen months after the effective date of the NASD's short sale rule. Prior
to the termination of the eighteen-month period, the NASD will evaluate whether these exemptions should be extended,
modified, approved on a permanent basis, or terminated. Second, with respect to the trading activity of options market
makers and warrant market makers, the amendment clarifies that transactions unrelated to normal options/warrant
market making activity, such as index arbitrage or risk arbitrage that in either case is independent of an options/warrant
market maker's market making functions, will not be considered a hedging transaction for purposes of the options/warrant
market maker exemption from the NASD's short-sale rule. Third, consistent with Rule 10a-1 under the Act, the
amendment expands the exemption from the NASD's short-sale rule for certain transactions in special arbitrage accounts
and special international arbitrage accounts to include short-sales effected by non-members. Prior to this amendment,
only NASD members would be able to avail themselves of these two exemptions from the rule. Fourth, the NASD proposes
to amend the options and warrant market maker exemptions to provide that an NASD member would not be in violation of
the NASD's short sale rule if it executed an order for the account of an options or warrant market maker in the good faith
belief that the order was in full compliance with the NASD's short sale rule and it was subsequently determined that
the order was either not entitled to the exemption or it was incorrectly marked long. The NASD also proposes to make
some minor stylistic modifications and grammatical corrections to the short sale rule and amend the section numbers
for the rule. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary of the NASD and at the Commission.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the proposed Rule Change



On November 19, 1993, the NASD submitted Amendment No. 4 to its proposed short sale rule or ``bid test'' applicable
to stocks traded on the Nasdaq National Market to provide for an eighteen-month pilot program that would afford equity
options market makers with a limited exemption from the rule if the short sales were effected to hedge options positions
established as a result of bona fide market making activity.
 This amendment reflected the NASD's efforts to strike a reasonable balance between the needs of equity options market
makers to effectively hedge their long options positions through short sales
and the NASD's need to implement a meaningful short sale rule for the Nasdaq Stock Market (``Nasdaq'') that does not
contain broad and sweeping exemptions that eviscerate the rule's effectiveness.






Recently, however, the options exchanges have maintained that it is equally important for the efficiency of the marketplace
that index options market makers be able to avail themselves of an exemption from the NASD's short sale rule for hedging
purposes. Accordingly, the NASD is proposing another amendment to its short sale rule to accommodate the hedging
needs of index options market makers. In particular, the NASD proposes to modify the equity options market maker exemption
to include short sales effected by index options market makers.

Specifically, under the proposed index options market maker exemption, an NASD member will be permitted, consistent
with its quotation obligations, to execute a short sale for the account of an options market maker that would otherwise
be in contravention of the NASD's short sale rule so long as: (1) The short sale is an ``exempt hedge transaction'';
and (2) the options market maker is registered with a ``qualified options exchange''
 as a ``qualified options market maker'' on a ``qualified stock index.'' An ``exempt hedge transaction'' is defined
to be a short sale in a Nasdaq National Market security that was effected to hedge, and in fact serves to hedge, an existing
offsetting stock index options position or an offsetting stock index options position that was created in a transaction(s)
contemporaneous with the short sale, provided certain conditions are satisfied. These conditions are as follows:
(a) The security sold short must be a component security of the index underlying such index option; (b) the index underlying
such offsetting index options position must be a ``qualified stock index''; and (c) the dollar value of all exempt
short sales effected to hedge the offsetting stock index options position(s) does not exceed the aggregate current
index value of the offsetting options position(s).

<TEXT>
 

A ``qualified stock index'' is defined to be a stock index that includes one or more Nasdaq National Market securities,
provided that more than 10% of the weight of the index is accounted for by Nasdaq National Market securities. The amendment
also provides that a qualified stock index shall be reviewed as of the end of each calendar quarter, and the index shall
cease to qualify if the value of the index represented by one or more Nasdaq National Market securities is less than
8% at the end of any subsequent calendar quarter. In this connection, the NASD has proposed the 10% minimum requirement
for qualified stock indexes to help ensure that exempted short sales effected by index options market makers are in
fact the result of legitimate hedging needs.
Thus, an index options market maker would become a ``qualified options market maker'' for certain classes of stock
index options only if it has received an appointment as such from a qualified options exchange. In this regard, the
rule is designed to ensure that only those index options market makers who regularly engage in making markets in options
classes overlying indexes containing Nasdaq-listed securities are designated as qualified options market makers.
Specifically, before an options exchange can become a qualified options exchange, it must have rules in place to identify
and designate as qualified options market makers those market makers who regularly engage in market making activities
in particular options classes.
As with the equity options market maker exemption, the NASD also has proposed that the index options market maker exemption
shall only be in effect for an eighteen-month pilot period. Throughout this eighteen-month period, the NASD will
review and analyze with the options exchanges whether the exemption is resulting in destabilizing trading in Nasdaq
stocks.
In addition, the NASD notes that the Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, which provides for the sharing of
surveillance information between the exchanges and the NASD, may assist in evaluating possibly manipulative activity
and other possibly destabilizing short selling activity by qualified options market makers and other options market
makers in Nasdaq securities.
The NASD also is proposing four other amendments to its short-sale rule. First, the NASD proposes to amend its short
sale rule to provide that all market maker exemptions from the rule are uniform in duration. Specifically, under the
proposal, the exemptions afforded qualified Nasdaq market makers, Nasdaq warrant market makers, and qualified
options market makers all will expire eighteen months after the effective date of the NASD's short sale rule. Previously,
only the options market maker exemption was proposed on a pilot basis. With all of the market maker exemptions expiring
simultaneously, the NASD believes it will be better able to evaluate and respond to the market impacts, if any, resulting
from these exemptions. Accordingly, prior to the termination of the eighteen-month pilot period, the NASD will evaluate
whether these exemptions should be extended, modified, approved on a permanent basis, or terminated.
Second, the NASD is clarifying that transactions by options market makers and warrant market makers unrelated to
their normal options/warrant market making activity, such as index arbitrage or risk arbitrage that in either case
is independent of an options/warrant market maker's market making functions, will not be considered a hedging transaction
for purposes of the options/warrant market maker exemption from the NASD's short-sale rule. Amendment No. 4 to the
short sale rule provided that Nasdaq market makers will not be able to avail themselves of an exemption from the short
sale rule for ``transactions unrelated to normal market making activity, such as index arbitrage and risk arbitrage
that is independent from a member's market making functions * * *''. Thus, this amendment merely extends
to options and warrant market makers the same restriction that already applies to Nasdaq market makers.

Third, the NASD proposes to amend its short sale rule to track provisions of SEC Rule 10a-1(e) (7) and (8) concerning
short sales effected by special arbitrage accounts and special international arbitrage accounts (``arbitrage
accounts''). Currently, the NASD's short sale rule only affords NASD members an exemption from the rule for certain
short sales effected in arbitrage accounts. The exemptions from the SEC's short sale rule afforded by Rule 10a-1(e)
(7) and (8), however, are available to any person and are not limited to members of an exchange or the NASD. Thus, the
NASD is proposing to replace the word ``member'' with the word ``person'' in the exemptions for arbitrage accounts
so that the NASD's short sale rule better tracks comparable provisions of SEC Rule 10a-1.

Fourth, to clarify that the onus for determining entitlement to an exemption falls squarely on options and warrant
market makers, the NASD proposes to add new Sections (h)(2)(f) and (i)(4) to the short sale rule to provide that an NASD
member will not be in violation of the NASD's short-sale rule if the member executes a short sale for the account of an
options or warrant market maker that is in contravention of the options or warrant market maker exemptions, provided
that the member did not know or have reason to know that the options or warrant market maker's short sale was in contravention
of these exemptions.

The NASD also is proposing several minor changes to its short sale rule and the accompanying rule governing the designation
of Primary Nasdaq Market Makers. First, the NASD proposes to replace references to Nasdaq/NMS securities in these
rules with the term Nasdaq National Market securities to ensure uniformity and avoid confusion. Second, because
another NASD rule has been designated as Section 46, the same section number proposed for the short sale rule, the NASD
proposes to delete the section numbers for short sale rule and the accompanying rule governing Primary Nasdaq Market
Makers. Once this filing is approved, these Sections will be numbered sequentially with the next available section
numbers. Third, the NASD proposes two minor amendments to the first paragraph of Interpretation C to the short sale
rule to correct grammatical mistakes.

The NASD believes the proposed rule change is consistent with sections 15A(b)(6) and 11A(c)(1)(F) of the Act. Section
15A(b)(6) requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with
persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions
in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market. Section 11A(c)(1)(F)
assures equal regulation of all markets for qualified securities and all exchange members, brokers, and dealers
effecting transactions in such securities. Specifically, as noted in prior filings regarding the NASD's short sale
rule, approval of the proposed short sale rule would result in equivalent short sale regulation in the exchange and
Nasdaq markets and would work to prevent fraud and manipulation with respect to short sales in the Nasdaq market. Moreover,
the NASD believes that affording index options market makers with an exemption from the rule for legitimate hedging
transactions associated with their bona fide options market making activity will serve to minimize the potential
adverse impacts, if any, on the options markets resulting from adoption of the NASD's short sale rule. In addition,
in light of the safeguards proposed in conjunction with the index options market maker exemption (

e.g.,

 the requirement that the short sales be hedges of existing or contemporaneously established index options positions
and the limitation of the exemption to index options market makers on indexes with a substantial Nasdaq component),
the NASD does not believe that the index options market maker exemption will subsume or eviscerate the effectiveness
of the NASD's short sale rule.

In addition, as with the exemption for equity options market makers, the NASD believes it is reasonable and appropriate
to approve the index options market maker exemption on an eighteen-month pilot basis. As noted in prior NASD filings
concerning the NASD's short sale rule, in the absence of a comparable short sale rule for the options markets, it is
not entirely clear to the NASD that abusive short sellers will not be able to circumvent the NASD's short sale rule through
the use of the index options markets. Specifically, if index options market makers are not required to adhere to the
NASD's short sale rule, the NASD believes it is possible that market participants would aggressively buy puts or sell
calls on indexes with a large Nasdaq component confident in the knowledge that the options market makers likely to
bear the other side of the contract would almost surely employ their short sale exemption to sell into the bid on Nasdaq.
Accordingly, the NASD believes it would be prudent and consistent with the maintenance of fair and orderly markets
to approve the index options market maker exemption on an eighteen-month pilot basis. During the term of the pilot,
the NASD, in cooperation with the options exchanges, will conduct a thorough analysis of the market impacts, if any,
resulting from short sales effected pursuant to the exemption. Depending on the results of the study, the NASD will
consider whether to seek permanent approval of the exemption, modify the exemption, or withdraw the exemption. In
this connection, it is the NASD's intention to not modify or withdraw the exemption unless it can be shown that the exemption
is causing demonstrable harm to Nasdaq. Moreover, should it become clear during the term of the pilot that the index
options market marker exemption is having an adverse impact on Nasdaq, the NASD will endeavor to make a good faith effort
to work with the options exchanges to correct or rectify the concerns associated with the operation of the exemption
before seeking to withdraw the pilot.

The NASD also believes that approving the exemption for qualified Nasdaq market makers on an eighteen-month pilot
basis is consistent with the maintenance of fair and orderly markets. While the NASD continues to believe that Nasdaq
market makers regularly performing an effective market making function must be permitted the flexibility to sell
short when necessary to adjust quickly to market movements and that there are more compelling reasons to provide Nasdaq
market makers with an exemption from the short sale rule than options market makers, the NASD, nevertheless, believes
it is appropriate to thoroughly examine whether the Nasdaq market maker exemption is causing any adverse market impacts
before adopting the exemption on a permanent basis. In addition, approving the Nasdaq market maker exemption on an
interim basis is consistent with the proposed pilot exemption for options market makers. Finally, with respect to
the other proposed amendments discussed in this filing, the NASD believes they will serve to reduce investor confusion
concerning the application and operation of the NASD's short sale rule, thereby promoting efficient and fair markets.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change and Amendments No. 1 and No. 2 to Proposed
Rule Change by Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc., Amending Its Listing and Maintenance Requirements</DOCTITLE>


March 14, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on August 11, 1993, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change, and on January 10, 1994, filed Amendment No.
1 to the proposed rule change,
 and on February 3, 1994, filed Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change,
 as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The
Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change.


The PSE is submitting this proposed rule change in order to strengthen its listing requirements and practices.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries set forth in Section A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose




Introduction. 

The development and enforcement of adequate regulations governing the listing of securities on the Exchange is of
critical importance to the investing public. Therefore, the Exchange proposes to amend Rule 3 of its rules to revise
its listing requirements for initial and continued listing of securities on the Exchange.
The Exchange seeks to impose more stringent listing requirements by establishing mandatory minimum requirements.
The Exchange believes that the employment of mandatory requirements, as opposed to mere guidelines, will serve as
a mechanism to equitably screen issuers and to provide listed status only to bona fide companies (

i.e.,

 companies with sufficient financial resources to meet their financial obligations). Limited exceptions to the
mandatory minimum requirements will be made only in cases, described more fully below, where a security is also listed
on the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''), American Stock Exchange (``Amex'') or NASDAQ National Market System (``NASDAQ/NMS'').
However, no exceptions will be made for any security listed under the Tier I designation under the Exchange's rules.


Initial Listing Requirements. 

The amendments proposed by the Exchange are substantial and comprehensive, as they impact not only common stock but
also preferred stock, warrants, and debt instruments. In addition to reorganizing and defining specific terms within
Rule 3.1,
 the Exchange is proposing to add Rule 3.2(a), which outlines definitive requirements to be considered in an application
for listing. The Exchange will consider not only established numerical requirements, but also other qualitative
factors, including the nature and scope of the company's operations, the financial condition and accounting practices,
composition of assets, management experience, and the extent of competition and economic conditions within the
particular industry.

<DOCNO> FR940318-2-00235 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940318-2-00117 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Most significantly, the Exchange is proposing a multi-tiered structure for original listing and maintenance of
securities on the Exchange. Securities may be listed pursuant to either the Tier I or Tier II listing requirements,
and are distinguished with respect to blue-sky exemptions, transaction reporting, listing fees, and corresponding
maintenance requirements.

A listing under the Tier I designation generally signifies that the company has achieved maturity and high status
in its industry in terms of assets, earnings, and shareholder interest and acceptance. The Tier I listing requirements
for common stock include numerical as well as corporate governance policies that conform with the standards set forth
in the Memorandum of Understanding between the North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. (``NASAA'')
and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE'').
 Any other securities that are listed pursuant to the requirements set forth in Rule 3.2, paragraphs (d) through (i),
including any equity option or index product listed in accordance with Rule 3.6 or Rule 7, respectively, shall qualify
for inclusion under the Tier I designation. These requirements are in uniformity with the CBOE, and also meet the same
standards established by the NYSE and Amex.







The Exchange's proposed Tier II designation is limited to the listing of common stock, preferred stock, bonds, debentures,
and common stock purchase warrants. These listing requirements are less stringent than the requirements under Tier
I, but they nevertheless include both quantitative and non-quantitative (such as corporate governance standards)
requirements that are materially higher than the Exchange's existing listing standards.
 The Exchange believes that the listing of a company's securities under this designation is important because it will
continue to provide small companies with access to the capital markets and will supply much-needed liquidity to public
investors within a regulated marketplace. The Exchange notes that it previously submitted to the Commission a rule
filing to list and trade common stock that qualifies under the Small Corporate Offering Registration/Regulation
A (``SCOR'') designation.
 The proposed rule is also intended to facilitate the capital formation process for small companies. The SCOR listing
requirements would, in effect, constitute a third tier of listing requirements; however, for purposes of the exchange
exemption under most state blue sky laws, SCOR securities will not be deemed ``listed'' on the Exchange.






In cases where a company's security does not qualify for inclusion under the Tier I designation, yet the security is
listed or has been approved for listing on either the NYSE, Amex (except for so-called ``ECM'' securities)
 or NASDAQ/NMS, the Exchange may list such security under the Tier II designation in reliance upon the listing requirements
of the applicable exchange (or association).







Maintenance Requirements and Delisting Procedures.

 The proposal will establish under Rule 3.5 more stringent numerical maintenance requirements, and also includes
other factors or events that would invoke the suspension or delisting of a company's securities.
 As with its initial listing requirements, the Exchange's maintenance requirements will be strictly enforced.
 Whenever the issuer fails to meet any provision of the proposed maintenance requirements, the matter will be immediately
evaluated by the Equity Listing Committee. The Committee will determine whether to suspend dealings in the security
and/or request the issuer to take immediate action to remedy any identified deficiency. Should the issuer fail to
correct any deficiency by the prescribed date, the Committee shall take action to delist the security. In cases where
the issuer's security fails to meet the applicable maintenance requirements under Tier I of Rule 3.5, the security
will be removed as soon as practicable from trading under this designation. The security of the company will be admitted
to trading under Tier II should it meet the applicable maintenance requirements.

<DOCNO> FR940318-2-00236 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940318-2-00117 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Finally, the proposal will also establish as Rule 3.5(t) specific delisting procedures to provide the issuer with
the opportunity to appeal a delisting decision.



Corporate Governance and Disclosure Policies.

 As set forth in Rule 3.3, the proposal will require that specific corporate governance and disclosure policies be
established by domestic issuers of any equity security listed on the Exchange.
 The Exchange believes that effective and responsive corporate governance ensures that shareholders' interests
are sufficiently protected. Therefore, each listed company will be expected to follow certain practices aimed at
maintaining appropriate standards of corporate responsibility, integrity, and accountability to their shareholders.
This rule also includes the Exchange's formal disclosure policy, which describes procedures for a listed company
to employ in their communication of material information to the Exchange and investing public.







Trading Environment and Transaction Reporting.

 All securities, regardless of the requirements used for their admission to listing, will be subject to auction market
trading rules and real-time reporting. Transactions in Tier II and SCOR designated securities will be identified
by a special suffix to the ticker symbol so that members, public investors and others can distinguish these securities
from other securities traded on the Exchange.
 Finally, all of the Exchange's rules and surveillance procedures will be applicable to transactions in securities
listed under the Tier I, Tier II and SCOR designations.







Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990.

 The Exchange believes that the heightened listing requirements will serve to enhance the integrity of the marketplace
and to protect the public interest. As recognized by the Commission,
 adequate listing criteria are necessary to screen out companies that lack substantial float, assets and shareholders,
thereby assuring sufficient liquidity for fair and orderly markets. The Exchange believes that the proposed rule
change also acts in furtherance of the interests of Rule 15c2-6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 Rule 15c2-6, also referred to as the Penny Stock Rule, was enacted by the Commission in response to concerns of
widespread misconduct by broker-dealers in the recommendation, to persons who are not established customers, of
low-priced securities that are not registered on an exchange or authorized for quotation on NASDAQ. The Commission
noted that, due to the effect that the Rule may have on small business capital formation, many such businesses may seek
listing on an exchange in order to avoid the restrictions of the Rule.
 As such, and since broker-dealer abuses may extend to exchange traded low-priced securities, the Commission stated
its expectation that self-regulatory organizations develop new regulatory initiatives designed to address fraud
and manipulation in low-priced securities. The Exchange believes that the heightening of its listing requirements,
thereby precluding the listing of many low-priced securities, addresses the Commission's concern.







Finally, the Exchange believes that the proposed rule change serves to create uniformity of enhanced listing standards
among the various exchanges and that general uniformity in raising the standards will benefit the marketplace as
a whole, thereby further serving the public's interest. With the enactment of Rule 15c2-6, the Exchange has
been made aware of the necessity for higher listing requirements, and with this rule change is seeking to address the
Commission's concerns.

2. Statutory Basis



The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers the objectives of Section
6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote
just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market,
and to protect investors and the public interest.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received.

By orders dated June 12, 1986 and July 16, 1986, HCAR No. 24128 and 24150 (``Original Orders''), respectively, CNG
and all except five of the subsidiaries were authorized to establish the Consolidated System Money Pool (``Money
Pool''). By order dated May 27, 1987 (HCAR No. 24399), Pipeline and Service were authorized to become participants
in the Money Pool. By order dated February 14, 1990 (HCAR No. 25040), VNG was authorized to become a participant in the
Money Pool. By order dated May 13, 1991 (HCAR No. 25311), Storage was authorized to become a participant in the Money
Pool. Iroquois now requests authorization through June 30, 1996 to participate in the Money Pool on the same terms
and under the same conditions as previously authorized by the Commission in the Original Orders.

Funds taken from and provided to the Money Pool would be made in the form of open account advances. Open account advances
would be repayable not more than one year from the date of the first advance. If no such borrowings are outstanding on
the date of any advance, then the interest rate would be the Federal Funds' effective rate of interest as quoted daily
by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

By order dated July 6, 1993 (HCAR No. 25845), the Commission authorized Transmission to provide Iroquois with up to
$20 million in funds (``Transmission Advances'') through either purchases of common stock or through short-term
loans. The aggregate outstanding amount of funds obtained by Iroquois from the Money Pool, together with Transmission
Advances, would not at any time exceed $20 million.

Additionally, CNG and the Subsidiaries request authority to change the interest rate on outstanding borrowings
by participants in the Money Pool. The current rate charged to borrowers from the Money Pool equals the effective short-term
borrowing costs of CNG, as stated in the Original Orders. CNG and the Subsidiaries request authority to change this
rate to a rate equal to the effective weighted average rate of interest on CNG's commercial paper and/or revolving
credit borrowings.



Gulf Power Company, et al. (70-7294)



Gulf Power Company (``Gulf''), 500 Bayfront Parkway, Pensacola, Florida 32501 and Mississippi Power Company (``Mississippi'')
(together, ``Applicants''), 2993 West Beach, Gulfport, Mississippi 39501, electric utility subsidiary companies
of The Southern Company, a registered holding company, have filed a post-effective amendment under section 6(a),
7, 9(a), 10, 12(b), 12(c) and 12(d) and Rules 42, 45 and 50(a)(5) thereunder to their declaration previously filed
under sections 6(a), 7 and 12(b) and Rules 45 and 50(a)(5) thereunder.

Mississippi and Gulf are joint owners, as tenants in common, of Plant Daniel, an electric generating facility in Jackson,
Mississippi. By order dated December 16, 1986 (HCAR No. 24261), the Commission authorized Mississippi, acting as
agent for Gulf, to enter into various transactions with Fuelco, a special purpose subsidiary of the Corporation Trinity
Company, a nonassociated company, to finance Termination and Closure Payments relating to the termination of existing
coal supply contracts and its entrance into new lower cost arrangements for the supply of coal to Plant Daniel. In this
regard, Fuelco issued notes (``Notes'') in the aggregate principal amount of $121.325 million to private investors,
which mature on December 31, 1995 and bear interest at an 8.25% annual rate, payable semi-annually. Mississippi borrowed
the proceeds from the sale of the notes and issued a secured note (``Secured Note'') to Fuelco in the same principal
amount and containing the same terms and conditions. The aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Notes is approximately
$35 million. The Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time on or after January 1, 1994 at 101.03% of the principal
amount thereof during 1994 and 100.00% of such principal amount during 1995, together in each case with accrued interest
to the prepayment date.

The Applicants now propose to refinance the Notes and the Secured Note by: (1) Having Fuelco, or another similar special
purpose corporation, issue and sell, on or before December 31, 1994, up to $36 million aggregate principal amount
of new notes (``Refunding Notes'') maturing on December 31, 1995; and (2) Mississippi issuing a new Secured Note in
the same principal amount as the Refunding Notes and containing the same terms and conditions. The proceeds from the
sale of the Refunding Notes would be applied to the prepayment of the outstanding Notes. While the interest rate to
be borne by the Refunding Notes has not been determined at this time, it is anticipated based upon current market conditions
and rate levels that such rate would not exceed 51/2% per annum. The Refunding Notes would not be prepayable prior to
maturity.

As an alternative for refinancing the Notes, it is proposed that Mississippi may effect borrowings of up to $36 million
from a bank or banks or other institutional lender or lenders. Such borrowings may be evidenced by Mississippi's promissory
note or notes, may be secured by a subordinated lien on certain properties of Mississippi, would have a final maturity
of December 31, 1995, and would not be prepayable. As in the case of the Refunding Notes, it is currently anticipated
that the interest rate of such borrowings would not exceed 51/2% per annum. The proceeds from such borrowings would
be loaned to Fuelco and applied to the prepayment of the outstanding Notes. The obligation of Fuelco to repay such loan
may be evidenced by a note issued to Mississippi the payments on which would correspond to the payments due on Mississippi's
note or notes described above and would be included in the minimum payments owing under the existing coal supply agreement
between Fuelco and Mississippi.

Gulf will be responsible for one-half of all costs incurred by Mississippi pursuant to the arrangements proposed
herein, in accordance with the agreement between the parties relating to Plant Daniel (HCAR No. 19696, September
28, 1976).

The refinancing will not be consummated unless the estimated present value savings derived from the net difference
between interest payments on the obligations to be issued for refunding purposes and the outstanding Notes is, on
an after-tax basis, greater than the present value of all prepayment and issuance costs, assuming an appropriate
discount rate. Such discount rate is based on the estimated after-tax interest rate on the obligations issued for
refunding purposes.



EUA Energy Investment Corp. (70-7426)



EUA Energy Investment Corp. (``EEIC''), P.O. Box 2333, Boston, Massachusetts 02107, a wholly-owned, non-utility
subsidiary company of Eastern Utilities Associates (``EUA''), a registered holding company, has filed a post-effective
amendment to its application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 13(b) of the Act and Rules 43(a),
45(a), 86, 87, 90 and 91 promulgated thereunder. EEIC requests authorization to invest up to $5 million in energy and
energy conservation research.

By order dated December 4, 1987 (HCAR No. 24515), which was amended on January 11, 1988 (HCAR No. 24515-A) (``Amended
Order''), EUA was authorized to establish EEIC to participate in the development of cogeneration and small power
production facilities and to engage in energy and energy conservation research. EUA also was authorized to invest
up to $25 million in EEIC, which itself was authorized to invest up to $2 million in energy and energy conservation research.
To date, EEIC has invested about $1.85 million in energy and energy conservation research.

EEIC now requests authorization to invest, through December 31, 1999, up to $5 million in energy and energy conservation
research, which funds it would acquire from the $25 million that the Amended Order authorized EUA to invest in EEIC.
EEIC contemplates that it will engage in research relative to new generation technology, new transformer efficiency
and design, air quality management, and electric vehicle development. The post-effective amendment states that
any acquisition of securities by EEIC or any subsidiary or affiliate of EEIC using any or all of the research and development
funds requested will remain subject to Commission jurisdiction.



Central Power and Light Co., et al. (70-8327)



Central Power and Light Company (``CP&L''), 539 North Carancahua Street, Corpus Christi, Texas 78401; Public
Service Company of Oklahoma (``PSCO''), P.O. Box 201, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74102; Southwestern Electric Power Company
(``SWEPCO''), 428 Travis Street, Shreveport, Louisiana 71101; and West Texas Utilities Company (``WTUC''), 301
Cypress Street, Abilene, Texas 79601-5820, all of which are electric public utility subsidiaries of Central
and South West Corporation, a registered holding company, have filed an application pursuant to Sections 9(a) and
10 of the Act.

CP&L, PSCO, SWEPCO, and WTUC (``Applicants'') propose to engage in meter reading, billing, and collecting services
(``Services'') to non-affiliate companies through December 31, 1997. The non-affiliate companies include non-affiliated
water, gas and electric utilities, cooperatives, towns, cities, counties, water authorities and other entities
located in or closely adjacent to the service territories of the Applicants.

In 1992, Tulsa, Oklahoma requested that PSCO assess whether it would be feasible for PSCO to provide the Services on
behalf of Tulsa. PSCO has estimated that it will require nine or ten additional employees to provide Tulsa with the
Services. For the five year period 1994-1998, PCSO expects that the average annual revenues from the Services
will be about $534,000 and the average cost thereof_based on annual bills of $534,000_will be about $493,000. Other
Oklahoma cities have expressed an interest in the Services through PSCO.

PSCO first proposes to conclude a contract with Tulsa. Second, PSCO proposes to market the Services to other non-affiliate
companies within six months thereafter through PSCO employees responsible for customer service, community relations,
and business development as well as through printed materials. PSO will market the Services tailored to meet the customer
requirements of non-affiliate companies.

The Applicants state that revenues and expenses from the Services, which will be non-utility activities, will be
accounted for in accordance with accepted principles and will conform to the FERC Uniform System of Accounts, 18 CFR
part 101. The Applicants state they believe that the Services can be provided with margins that would provide them
with positive cash flows. The Applicants state that the Services would not be provided to non-affiliate companies
for less than cost.

Appalachian Power Company, et al. (70-8347)



Appalachian Power Company (``Appalachian''), 40 Franklin Road, Roanoke, Virginia 24022, Columbus Southern Power
Company (``Columbus''), 215 North Front Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215, and Ohio Power Company (``Ohio Power''),
301 Cleveland Avenue SW., Canton, Ohio 44702, all electric public-utility subsidiary companies of American Electric
Power Company, Inc., a registered holding company, have filed a declaration under Section 12(c) of the Act and Rule
42 thereunder.

Appalachian, Columbus, and Ohio Power intend to issue and sell, in one or more series through June 30, 1995 shares of
their cumulative preferred stock (``Stock'') up to $30 million (no par), $100 million (par value $25 per share and/or
$100 per share), and $85 million (par value $25 per share and/or $100 per share), respectively, under Rule 52. If market
conditions require, Applicants propose to include a redemption provision and/or a sinking fund with their sale of
the Stock, and request authorization from the Commission to acquire or redeem such Stock through the operation of
such redemption provision and/or sinking fund.

Should the Stock include a redemption provision, the Stock would not otherwise be redeemable at the option of Applicants
for a period ending on a date occurring up to 15 years following the date of its issuance. Alternatively, Applicants
may provide in the terms of the Stock that the Stock would not be redeemable at the option of Applicants for a period of
up to 15 years if the monies for such redemption are obtained by Applicants through a borrowing or issuance of stock
at an effective interest rate or dividend cost to Applicants of less than the dividend rate per annum of such Stock.
After the expiration of such non-redemption or non-refunding period, such Stock may be redeemable at Applicants'
option at a price per share equal to the stated value thereof together with accrued dividends to the date of redemption,
plus 100% of the dividend rate, declining annually on a straight-line or other formula basis until arriving at the
stated value thereof, and thereafter at the stated value thereof. Applicants state that they will not exercise any
right of redemption by using the proceeds of any new issue of securities unless the estimated present value savings
(derived from the net difference between interest or dividend payments on a new issue of comparable securities and
on the cumulative preferred stock to be redeemed) is, on an after-tax basis, greater than the present value of all redemption
and issuing costs, assuming an appropriate discount rate.

Should the Stock be subject to a sinking fund, Applicants may be required, after the expiration of a non-redemption
or non-refunding period, to annually redeem a number of the shares of the Stock equal to between 5% and 20% of the number
of shares of Stock initially issued. In addition, Applicants may, at their option, redeem on any such date an additional
equivalent amount of Stock. The price of such shares subject to the sinking fund would be the price per share equal to
the stated value thereof together with accrued dividends to the date of redemption. The Stock also may be subject to
a final balloon sinking fund payment which would require Applicants to redeem at per share equal to the stated value
thereof, together with accrued dividends to the date of redemption, a number of the shares of the Stock of up to 80% of
the number issued.



CECo Holding Company (70-8353)



CECo Holding Company (``CECo''), 37th Floor, 10 South Dearborn Street, P.O. Box 767, Chicago, Illinois 60690-0767,
a wholly owned subsidiary company of Commonwealth Edison Company (``Edison''), an Illinois public-utility holding
company exempt from registration under section 3(a)(1) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (``Act'')
by order and pursuant to rule 2, has filed an application under sections 3(a)(1), 9(a)(2) and 10 of the Act in connection
with the proposed acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of Edison and, indirectly, Commonwealth Edison
Company of Indiana, Inc. (``Indiana Company''), an Indiana electric public-utility subsidiary company of Edison.






CECo requests an order approving the proposed acquisition of interests in Edison and Indiana Company under sections
9(a)(2) and 10, and granting an exemption under section 3(a)(1) from all provisions of the Act, except section 9(a)(2).

CECO's proposed acquisition of the common stock of Edison and the Indiana Company (``Acquisition'') is part of a corporate
restructuring in which CECo will become a holding company over Edison. CECo states that the proposed restructuring
is intended to permit Edison affiliates to engage in nonutility businesses in competition with other unregulated
companies while protecting Edison and its ratepayers. 

CECo and its wholly owned subsidiary, CECo Merging Corporation (``Merging Corp.''), were incorporated under Illinois
law for the purpose of carrying out the proposed restructuring. Neither CECo nor Merging Corp. owns any utility assets
or engages in any business. Edison and the Indiana Company are ``electric utilities'' as defined in section 2(a)(3)
of the Act and ``public utilities'' as defined in section 2(a)(5) of the Act. 

Applicant proposes to accomplish the Acquisition through a merger (``Merger'') of Edison and Merging Corp., with
Edison as the surviving corporation. As a result of the Merger, the common stock of Merging Corp. owned by CECo would
be converted into common stock of Edison; the outstanding common stock of Edison would be converted, on a share-for-share
basis, into common stock of CECo; and Edison would become a subsidiary of CECo.

CECo proposes that there will be no exchange of, or any change to, the outstanding preferred and preference stock,
warrants and debt of Edison in connection with the restructuring. Following the restructuring Edison preferred
stock and warrants will continue to be convertible into shares of Edison common stock, creating a possible minority
interest in Edison common stock. 

CECo states that following the consummation of the Merger, it will be a public-utility holding company entitled to
an exemption under section 3(a)(1) of the Act from all of the provisions of the Act, except for section 9(a)(2), because
it and each of its public utility subsidiaries from which it derives a material part of its income will be predominantly
intrastate in character and will carry on their businesses substantially within the State of Illinois. CECo states
that Indiana Company will not provide it with a material part of its income. Following the Acquisition, Edison will
remain a holding company exempt from registration under section 3(a)(1.). 

For the year ended December 31, 1992, Indiana Company represented approximately 1.2% of Edison's consolidated operating
revenues, 1.0% of consolidated net income, 0.4% of consolidated net utility plant, and 0.6% of consolidated total
assets.

Edison also has six wholly owned non-utility subsidiaries. All but one, CECo Enterprises, Inc. (``CECo Enterprises''),
will remain Edison subsidiaries subsequent to the Acquisition. CECo Enterprises was recently established by Edison
to provide, through subsidiaries, unregulated energy-related services to Edison's customers and others. Following
the Acquisition, Edison will transfer the stock of CECo Enterprises to CECo.

Central and South West Corp. (70-8357)


Central and South West Corporation (``CSW''), 1616 Woodall Rodgers Freeway, Dallas, Texas 75202, a registered holding
company, has filed a declaration under Sections 6(a) and 7 of the Act and Rule 50(a)(5) thereunder.
CSW proposes to issue and sell up to 11 million shares of its authorized and unissued Common Stock, par value $3.50 per
share (``Additional Common Stock''), as well as provide net proceeds to it of approximately $300 million, in one or
more issues from time-to-time through December 31, 1996. CSW will issue and sell shares of Additional Common Stock
under the competitive bidding procedures of Rule 50 of the Act, as modified, by the Commission's Statement of Policy
Concerning the Application of Rule 50 under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, dated September 2, 1982
(HCAR No. 22623), or in negotiated sales to underwriters pursuant to an exception from the competitive bidding requirements
of Rule 50 under subsection (a)(5).
As of December 31, 1983, CSW has common stock equity of $1.849 billion, consolidated total capitalization of $4.108
billion and consolidated short-term debt of $110.3 million. As of December 31, 1993, CSW had common stock equity of
$2.930 billion, consolidated short-term debt of $110.3 million. As of December 31, 1993, CSW had common stock equity
of $2.930 billion, consolidated total capitalization of $6.042 billion and consolidated short-term debt of $769
million.
At December 31, 1993, CSW's consolidated capitalization ratios were 48.5% common stock equity; 5.8% preferred stock;
and45.7% long-term debt. In order to keep its capital ratios at the appropriate levels to support its growth and to
support the credit rating of its subsidiaries' outstanding securities, CSW desires to issue the Additional Common
Stock.
CSW intends to apply the net proceeds from the sale of the Additional Common Stock to reduce short-term debt. Although
CSW's current intention is to apply all net proceeds to reduce its short-term debt, any proceeds not used for such purposes
would be used for general corporate purposes, including but not limited to capital contributions to its subsidiaries,
subject to further authorization by the Commission.
CSW will not, however, use such proceeds, or any short-term borrowing availability created by the repayment of short-term
debt with such proceeds to acquire the securities of or any interest in (1) any exempt wholesale generators, as such
term is defined in section 32(e) of the Act (``EWG'') until such time as such investment shall be approved by order or
regulation of the Commission or (2) any foreign utility companies, as such term is defined in section 33(a) of the Act
(``FUCO'') until such time as such investment shall be approved by order or regulation of the Commission. Neither
CSW nor any of its subsidiaries has an ownership interest in an EWG or FUCO, and neither CSW nor any of its subsidiaries
is a party to a service, sales or construction agreement with an EWG or FUCO.
CSW requests an exception from the competitive bidding requirements of Rule 50 under subsection (a)(5) thereunder,
and also requests authority to enter into negotiations with potential underwriters with respect to the timing, pricing
and other terms and conditions applicable to the Additional Common Stock, subject to receipt of the order of the Commission
requested authorizing the issuance and sale of the Additional Common Stock. It may do so.


Central Power and Light Co. (70-8359)


Central Power and Light Company (``Company''), 539 N. Carancahua Street, Corpus Christi, Texas, 78401-2431,
an electric utility subsidiary company of Central and South West Corporation, a registered holding company, has
filed an application-declaration under sections 6(a) 7, 9(a), 10 and 12(c) of the Act of Rules 42 and 50(a)(5) thereunder.
The Company requests authority to issue and sell in one or more series, through December 31, 1996, up to one million
additional shares of its authorized and unissued preferred stock, par value $100 per share (``Additional Preferred
Stock'') under the competitive bidding procedures or, in the alternative, in a negotiated underwriting.
The Company proposes to sell the Additional Preferred Stock as depositary preferred stock if market conditions at
the time of issuance and sale are such that preferred stock having an offering price other than $100 per share is likely
to have a better market reception than preferred stock having an offering price of $100 per share. In an offering of
depositary preferred stock, the Company would issue and sell Additional Preferred Stock to underwriters for deposit
with a Depositary. The underwriters would then receive from the Depositary, and deliver to purchasers in a subsequent
public offering, receipts (``Depositary Receipts'') evidencing Depositary Preferred Shares, each representing
a proportional share of Additional Preferred Stock. Any additional terms of such an arrangement would be established
at the time of the proposed issuance.
The Company requests the flexibility to set the terms and amount of Additional Preferred Stock to be issued at the time
of the issuance of any series thereof. The terms of the Additional Preferred Stock may include provisions for mandatory
or optional redemption at various prices and may include various restrictions on optional redemption for a specified
number of years. The exact terms of any redemption or refunding restrictions would be determined at or about the time
of sale of the Additional Preferred Stock.

Further, the Company may include provisions for a sinking or retirement fund for any series of the Additional Preferred
Stock designed to redeem annually, commencing a specified number of years after the first day of the calendar month
in which such series is issued, a number of shares specified in such provision. Such provisions may also give the Company
the option to credit against any sinking fund requirement shares of Additional Preferred Stock of that series theretofore
purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company and not previously credited against any sinking fund requirement.
Additionally, any such sinking or retirement fund provision may give the Company the option to redeem or purchase
on an annual basis up to an additional equivalent amount of the shares so retired pursuant to the sinking or retirement
fund requirement. The Company would not expect to determine whether to include a sinking or retirement fund as part
of the terms of any series of the Additional Preferred Stock until at or about the time of issuance and sale of such series.
The Company is requesting authority, for the period during which any shares of the Additional Preferred Stock are
outstanding to (1) redeem shares of Additional Preferred Stock in accordance with any mandatory or optional redemption
provisions established in any series of the Additional Preferred Stock, and (2) redeem (or purchase in lieu of redemption)
shares of Additional Preferred Stock in accordance with any sinking or retirement fund provisions established in
any series of the Additional Preferred Stock.
The proceeds from the sale of the Additional Preferred Stock will be applied to redeem, or reimburse the Company's
treasury in connection with the redemption of, all or a portion of one or more series of the Company's outstanding preferred
stock, including the Company's 10.05% Preferred Stock, $100 par value and 8.72% Preferred Stock, $100 par value (collectively,
``Old Preferred Stock'') at the then current redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to the
redemption date. Any net proceeds from the issuance of the Additional Preferred Stock not used for the redemption
of the Old Preferred Stock, or reimbursement of the Company's treasury, will be used to repay outstanding short-term
borrowings that provide working capital or for other general corporate purposes. In the event that the proceeds from
the sale of the Additional Preferred Stock are less than the amount required to redeem the Old Preferred Stock, the
Company will pay a portion of the redemption price from internally generated funds or available short-term borrowings
pursuant to an order of the Commission dated March 31, 1993 (HCAR No. 24777) (``Order'').
The Company will not redeem the Old Preferred Stock with the proceeds from the sale of the Additional Preferred Stock
unless the estimated present value savings derived from the net difference between dividend payments on a hypothetical
new issue of preferred stock of a structure comparable to the structure on the Old Preferred Stock is greater, on an
after-tax basis, than the present value of all redemption, tendering and issuance costs, assuming a discount rate
based on the estimated dividend rate on the Additional Preferred Stock.
The Company is also requesting authority for the period during which any shares of the Old Preferred Stock are outstanding
to repurchase, reacquire or redeem shares of the Old Preferred Stock. The Company will pay for any such repurchase,
reacquisition or redemption from the proceeds of the issuance of debt securities approved by the Commission or from

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. The Funds are open-end diversified management investment companies. Each Fund is organized as a Maryland corporation
and as a series fund that is authorized to issue its shares of common stock in more than one series representing a separate
portfolio of assets and liabilities. Each Fund has outstanding one series of shares. Adviser serves as the investment
adviser of each Fund. Distributor, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adviser, serves as the distributor of the common
shares of each Fund.

2. The Funds, other than State Bond Money Funds, Inc., currently offer one class of shares at net asset value plus a front-end
sales charge.
 The shares are sold subject to an annual rule 12b-1 fee of .25% of average net assets.





3. Under applicants' proposal, the Funds could offer shares either: (a) Subject to a front-end sales charge and a rule
12b-1 plan initially providing for a service and a distribution fee at an annual rate of up to .25% of the average
daily net assets (``Class A shares''); (b) without a front-end sales charge but subject to a CDSC (which applicants
expect will range from 4% on redemptions made during the first two years following purchase to 1% on redemptions made
during the sixth year since purchase), a rule 12b-1 service fee initially at an annual rate of up to .25%, and a
rule 12b-1 distribution fee at an annual rate of up to .75%, of average daily net assets (``Class B shares''),
and automatically convertible into Class A shares after a certain period of time; (c) without a front-end sales charge
but subject to a CDSC (which applicants expect will be 1% on redemptions made during the first two years following purchases),
a rule 12b-1 service fee initially at an annual rate of up to .25%, and a rule 12b-1 distribution fee at an
annual rate of up to .75%, of average daily net assets (``Class C shares''); (d) without a CDSC but subject to a front-end
sales charge (which applicants expect will be 1% or less of the amount invested), a rule 12b-1 service fee initially
at an annual rate of up to .25%, and a rule 12b-1 distribution fee at an annual rate of up to .75%, of average daily
net assets (``Class D shares''); (e) without a front-end sales charge or CDSC, but subject to a rule 12b-1 service
fee at an annual rate of up to .25% of average daily net assets, for purchase exclusively by investors meeting such minimum
investment and/or other eligibility criteria established by the Funds and the Distributor (``Class Y shares'');
and (f) without any sales or rule 12b-1 plan charges for purchase exclusively by Adviser, Distributor, certain
agents and affiliates of Adviser and Distributor, and officers, directors, and employees of such entities and employee
benefit plans established for the benefit of such persons, as may be approved for purchase of this class of shares by
the Funds and Distributor and disclosed in the applicable Funds' registration statements (``Class Z shares'').
 Applicants also seek authority for the Funds to establish one or more additional classes to be sold with different
sales load and service and distribution fee structures, as described below. The Funds will not impose front-end sales
charges, CDSCs, rule 12b-1 service fees, or distribution fees (or any combination thereof) in excess of amounts
permitted by article III, section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice.





4. Daily expenses of a Fund will be allocated to each share class depending on the nature of the expense item. Operating
expenses which are attributable to all classes will be allocated daily to each share class based on the percentage
of net assets at the beginning of the day. Class-specific expenses (including rule 12b-1 fees, if any) will be
calculated and charged to the respective class.

5. The CDSC will be calculated on the lesser of the net asset value at the time of the issuance of the shares or the net asset
value at the time of the redemption. No CDSC will be imposed on (a) an amount that represents an increase in the value
of the shares due to capital appreciation, (b) shares, or amounts representing shares, purchased through the reinvestment
of dividends or capital gains distributions, or (c) shares held for longer than the applicable period of time following
the issuance of shares that the CDSC applies (the ``CDSC Period''). Upon any request for redemption of shares subject
to a CDSC, it will be assumed that shares subject to no CDSC will be redeemed first in the order purchased (however, if
a shareholder owns Class B and Class C shares, then, absent a shareholder choice to the contrary, Class C shares not
subject to a CDSC will be redeemed in full prior to any redemption of Class B shares not subject to a CDSC), and all remaining
shares that are subject to a CDSC will be redeemed in the order purchased. It is expected that the CDSCs and the CDSC Periods
of the Funds will vary depending in part on the front-end sales load (if any) and 12b-1 fees (if any) that are imposed
by any Fund regarding its Class B or Class C shares, and on the distribution arrangements entered into by the Distributor
regarding any such class of shares. Any variation in the CDSCs or DCSC Periods will be set forth in the applicable prospectus.
No DCSC will be imposed on shares issued prior to the effective date of the requested order.

6. Applicants request the ability to waive the CDSC regarding involuntary redemptions effected pursuant to a Fund's
right to liquidate shareholder accounts having an aggregate net asset value of less than the minimum account balance
set forth in the Fund's then-current prospectus.

7. Applicants intend to provide a one time credit for any CDSC paid upon redemption of any shares, the proceeds of which
are reinvested in the same class of shares of a Fund within 90 days of redemption. The Distributor will provide this
credit from its own assets.
8. Class B shares of a Fund held for a specified number of years (including any Class B shares issued upon the reinvestment
of dividends and other distributions paid in respect of Class B shares of such Fund) will convert automatically to
Class A shares of such Fund at the relative net asset values of each of the classes. For purposes of calculating the holding
period, Class B shares will be deemed to have been issued on the sooner of: (a) The date on which the issuance of Class
B shares occurred; or (b) for Class B shares obtained through an exchange, or a series of exchanges, the date on which
the issuance of the original Class B shares occurred.
9. A given class of shares will be exchangeable only for shares of the corresponding class of other Funds. The exchange
privilege will be subject to the eligibility criteria applicable to the class of shares of the Fund into which the shareholder
wishes to exchange. Applicants will permit exchanges into shares of money market funds managed by Adviser, and the
CDSC will not be imposed at the time of any exchange of shares into the money market fund. Applicants will comply with
rule 11a-3 as to all exchanges.
10. Additional classes of shares created in the future will differ from Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, Class Y, and
Class Z shares only in the following respects: (a) Each class of shares would have a different designation; (b) each
class of shares might be sold under different sales arrangements (

e.g., 

subject to a front-end sales load, a CDSC, or a combination of a front-end sales load and a CDSC, or at net asset value);
(c) each class may bear any rule 12b-1 plan payments related to that class (and any other costs related to obtaining
shareholder approval of the rule 12b-1 plan for that class or an amendment to its rule 12b-1 plan; (d) each
class of shares may bear expenses determined by the board of directors to be allocated to that class (``Class Expenses''),
as described in condition 1 below; (e) only shareholders of the affected classes would be entitled to vote on matters
pertaining to the rule 12b-1 plan relating to their respective class of shares in accordance with the procedures
set forth in rule 12b-1; (f) each class of shares would have different exchange privileges; and (g) classes that
impose a rule 12b-1 fee may convert into another class.


Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. Applicants request an order exempting them from the provisions of sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) of the Act
to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of various classes of shares representing interests in the same Fund
might be deemed: (a) To result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g); (b) to be prohibited by
section 18(f)(1); and (c) to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i).
2. Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement will better enable the Funds to meet the competitive
demands of today's financial services industry. Under the multi-class arrangement, an investor will be able to choose
the method of purchasing shares that is most beneficial given the amount of his or her purchase, the length of time the
investor expects to hold his or her shares, and other relevant circumstances. The proposed arrangement would permit
the Funds to facilitate both the distribution of their securities and provide investors with a broader choice as to
the method of purchasing shares without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs or unnecessary investment
risks.
3. The proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights relating to the rule 12b-1 plans in the manner described
is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. In addition, such arrangements should
not give rise to any conflicts of interest because the rights and privileges of each class of shares are substantially
identical.
4. Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement does not present the concerns that section 18 of
the Act was designed to address. The multi-class arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the shares
of the Fund. The multi-class arrangement does not involve borrowing, nor will it affect the Funds' existing assets
or reserves, and does not involve a complex capital structure.

5. Applicants also request an order exempting them from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act and
rule 22c-1 thereunder to the extent necessary to permit the Funds to assess a CDSC on certain redemptions, and
to waive the CDSC in certain instances. The proposed CDSC arrangements will provide shareholders the option of having
their full payment invested for them at the time of their purchase of shares of the Funds with no deduction of an initial
sales charge.



Applicants' Conditions



Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:

1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all
respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among various classes of shares of the same Fund will relate
solely to: (a) the designation of each class of shares of the Fund; (b) the impact of the respective sales charges, if
any, for each class of shares (

e.g.,

 Class A shares generally would be subject to a front-end sales charge or CDSC depending on the amount of investment,
Class B and Class C shares would be subject to a CDSC, Class D shares would be subject to a front-end sales charge, and
Class Y and Class Z shares would not be subject to a front-end sales charge or a CDSC); (c) expenses assessed to a class
as a result of a rule 12b-plan providing for a service and/or distribution fee (

e.g.,

 Class A and Class Y shares would pay a service fee, Class B, Class C, and Class D shares would pay a service fee and a distribution
fee, and Class Z shares would not pay a service fee or a distribution fee); (d) different expenses which the board of
directors of a Fund may in the future determine to allocate to a specific class, which will be limited to: (i) Transfer
agency fees as identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class; (ii) printing and postage
expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses and proxies
to current shareholders; (iii) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) SEC registration fees
incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to support the
shareholders of a specific class; (vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to one class of shares;
and (vii) directors' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; (e) voting rights on matters
exclusively affecting one class of shares (

e.g.,

 the adoption, amendment, or termination of a rule 12b-1 plan in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule
12b-1), except as provided in condition 15 below; (f) the different exchange privileges of the various classes
of shares as described in the prospectuses (and as more fully described in the statements of additional information)
of the Funds; and (g) classes that impose a 12b-1 fee may convert to another class. Any additional incremental
expenses not specifically identified above that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated
to one class of shares shall not be so allocated until approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order.

2. The directors of each of the Funds, including a majority of the independent directors, shall have approved the multi-class
arrangement, prior to the implementation thereof by a particular Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the directors
of each of the Funds regarding the deliberations of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to implement
the multi-class arrangement will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the proposed system is in the
best interest of the Fund and its shareholders.

3. The initial determination of the class-specific expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class
of a Fund and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the directors of the affected
Fund, including a majority of the independent directors. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition
of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet class-specific expenses shall provide to the directors, and the directors
shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purpose for which the expenditures
were made.

4. On an ongoing basis, the directors of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and
otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes
of shares. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action as is reasonably
necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible for
reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Distributor
at their own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment
company.

5. The directors of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder
servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to
time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of
shares will be used to justify and distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to
the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the directors to justify any fee attributable to
that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and
approval of the independent directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.

6. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that fee payments made under
the rule 12b-1 plan relating to a particular class will be borne by each such class and except that any Class Expenses
will be borne by the applicable class of shares.

7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of income and expenses among the classes has been reviewed by the Independent Examiner
(the ``Independent Examiner''). The Independent Examiner has rendered a report, which has been provided to the staff
of the SEC, stating that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations
will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Independent Examiner, or an appropriate substitute
Independent Examiner, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and based
upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being
made properly. The reports of the Independent Examiner shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the
SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Independent Examiner with respect to
such reports, following request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make, will be available for inspection by the
SEC staff upon the written request for such work papers by a senior member of the SEC's Division of Investment Management
or of a Regional Office of the SEC, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief
Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate or Assistant Administrators.
The initial report of the Independent Examiner is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation'' and
the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness''
as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards
as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.

8. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset value dividends/distributions among the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of income
and expenses among such classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Independent Examiner
in its initial report referred to in condition 7 above and will be concurred with by the Independent Examiner, or appropriate
substitute Independent Examiner, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition
7 above. The applicants agree to take immediate corrective action if the Independent Examiner, or appropriate substitute
Independent Examiner, does not so concur in the ongoing reports.

9. The prospectuses of the Funds will include a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled
to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different levels of compensation for selling
one particular class of shares over another in a Fund.

10. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when shares of a particular class may appropriately be sold
to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to these
standards.

11. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the directors
of the Funds with respect to the multi-class arrangement will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to
the directors.

12. Each Fund prospectus (regardless of whether all classes of shares of such Fund are offered through such prospectus)
will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, service and distribution
fees, front-end sales charges, CDSCs, exchange privileges, and conversion features applicable to each class of
shares. The shareholder reports of each Fund will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement
of operations, information related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share
data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent
any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares,
it will disclose the expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes. The information provided by applicants
for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Fund's net asset values and public offering prices will
separately present each class of shares.

13. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply SEC
approval, authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to
rule 12b-1 plans in reliance on the exemptive order.

14. Any class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase Class'') will convert into another class (``Target
Class'') of shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales
load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge
and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any,
that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to
the conversion.

15. If a Fund implements any amendment to its rule 12b-1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of non-rule 12b-1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by the Target Class Shares under the plan, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target
Class shares unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The directors
shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into
a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior
to implementation of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class
shares. If deemed advisable by the directors to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all
existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares
in all material respects except that New Purchase Class shares will convert into New Target Class shares. New Target
Class or New Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in
this condition shall be effected in any manner that the directors reasonably believe will not be subject to federal
taxation. In accordance with condition 4, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion
of New Target Class or New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the Adviser and the Distributor. Purchase Class shares
sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment,
provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class
shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement.

16. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act, Investment Company Act
Release No. 16169 (Nov 2, 1988), as currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended.

<DOCTITLE>TCW Investment Funds, Inc., et al.; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>



March 11, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







Applicants:

 TCW Investment Funds, Inc. (``MMP Company''), TCW Funds, Inc. (``Galileo Company''), and TCW Funds Management,
Inc. (``Adviser'').




Relevant Act Sections:

 Order requested under section 17(b) of the Act for an exemption from section 17(a) of the Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order that would permit MMP Company to transfer substantially all its assets and liabilities to
Galileo Company in exchange for shares of Galileo Company's common stock.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations




1. MMP Company, a Maryland corporation, is a registered no-load, open-end investment company. Although it was formed
as a series mutual fund, it has offered shares in only one fund, the TCW Money Market Portfolio (``MMP Fund''). Various
affiliates of Adviser have discretionary investment and voting powers regarding several client accounts, group
trusts, and limited partnerships that owned, on February 17, 1994, 38.3% of the outstanding shares of MMP Fund.

2. Galileo Company, a Maryland corporation, is a registered no-load, open-end investment company. It was formed
as a series mutual fund with different investment portfolios, and currently offers six portfolios. Galileo Company
will offer a new portfolio, the TCW Galileo Money Market Fund (``Galileo MM Fund''), that will have the same investment
objectives and policies as the MMP Fund.

3. A board of directors consisting of five directors currently manages MMP Company. One of the three independent directors
of MMP Company also is an independent director of Galileo Company, and Galileo Company recently elected to its board
as an independent director another independent director of MMP Company.

4. Adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the TCW Group, Inc., and is the investment adviser to MMP Fund and the Galileo
Company existing funds under separate advisory agreements (the ``MMP Advisory Agreement'' and ``Galileo Advisory
Agreement,'' respectively.)

5. Applicants propose that, pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization, all the assets and liabilities of
MMP Fund will be transferred to Galileo Company in exchange for Galileo MM shares (the ``Reorganization''). Those
shares will have an aggregate net asset value equivalent to the net asset value of the assets transferred by MMP Company
to Galileo Company. Upon consummation of the Reorganization, the Galileo MM shares received by MMP Company will be
distributed by MMP Company to its shareholders, with each shareholder receiving a number of Galileo MM shares equal
to the number of MMP Fund shares, and having an aggregate net asset value equivalent to the net asset value of the MMP
Fund shares held by such shareholders. MMP Company then will be dissolved.

6. Following the reorganization, Adviser will render to the Galileo MMP Fund services substantially the same as those
it has been rendering to the MMP Fund under the MMP Advisory Agreement.

7. The Reorganization will establish Galileo Company as a successor investment vehicle to MMP Company. Combining
the operations of the MMP Fund with those of Galileo Company will help reduce overall expenses because of economies
of scale. Directors fees, and the costs of printing shareholder reports, updating prospectuses and performing similar
administrative functions will be spread across a larger asset base. Including MMP Fund in the Galileo family also
will permit more cohesive marketing under a single corporate name. This in turn may help accelerate the realization
of benefits from economies of scale. Moreover, the Reorganization will not result in the recognition of any gain or
loss by MMP Company shareholders and will allow Galileo Fund to acquire portfolio securities without incurring brokerage
or transaction expenses.

8. The Reorganization must be approved by at least a majority of the outstanding shares of MMP Company, and a special
meeting of MMP Company shareholders has been called for that purpose. Unless postponed by MMP Company and Galileo
Company, the Reorganization is expected to occur on or about May 15, 1994, on the basis of the net assets of MMP Fund as
of the close of business on the day of the Reorganization.

9. All the expenses generated by the Reorganization will be borne by Adviser.

10. The boards of directors of MMP Company, and Galileo Company have considered the desirability of the Reorganization
from the respective points of view of their companies. All the members of the two boards have approved the Reorganization
and concluded that, among other things, the Reorganization is in the best interests of Galileo Company, MMP Company,
and the interests of existing shareholders of both companies will not be diluted as a result of the Reorganization.
These findings, and the basis upon which such findings were made, have been fully recorded in the respective minute
books of Galileo Company and MMP Company.

11. The Reorganization will not be effected until each of the following conditions is satisfied: the Post-Effective
Amendment to Galileo Company's Registration Statement on Form N-1A has been declared effective, the SEC has
issued an order relating to the application, MMP Company shareholders have approved the Reorganization in accordance
with applicable law, and Galileo Company and MMP Company have receive an opinion of counsel that the Reorganization
will not require recognition of taxable income or loss by the holders of MMP Fund shares.



Applicants' Legal Conclusions



1. Applicants seek an exemption under section 17(b) of the Act from section 17(a) to the extent necessary to permit
the Reorganization. Section 17(a) of the Act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company,
or any affiliated person of such a person, from selling to or purchasing from such registered investment company any
security or other property. Section 17(b) provides for SEC approval of a proposed affiliated transaction that otherwise
would be prohibited by section 17(a) if the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received,
are reasonable and fair, and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, the transaction is consistent
with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, and the transaction is consistent with the general
purposes of the Act.

2. MMP Company may be deemed to be an affiliated person of Galileo Company because affiliates of Adviser serve in investment
management capacities, with discretionary voting power, regarding several client accounts, group trusts and limited
partnerships that own, in the aggregate, more than 5% of the outstanding shares of MMP Company. Thus, the Reorganization
may be deemed to be prohibited under section 17(a) if the Reorganization is viewed as a principal transaction between
Galileo Company and MMP Company or between Galileo Company and the aforementioned accounts, trusts and limited partnerships.

3. Applicants believe that the Reorganization is consistent with section 17(b) of the Act. The investment objectives
and policies of Galileo MM Fund are identical to those of MMP Fund. Neither the MMP Fund shareholders nor Adviser will
receive any financial benefit from the Reorganization, apart from the administrative convenience and potential
cost savings of incorporating MMP Fund into the Galileo family of funds. Additionally, after the Reorganization,
former MMP Fund shareholders will hold the same assets as Galileo Company shareholders as they had previously held
as MMP Fund shareholders. In this sense, the Reorganization can be viewed as a mere change in corporate form, rather
than a disposition giving rise to section 17(a) concerns.

<USBUREAU>Federal Railroad Administration</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Petition for Waivers of Compliance </DOCTITLE>


In accordance with title 49 CFR 211.9 and 211.41, 
notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has received from The Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe Railway Company a request for waiver of compliance with certain requirements of Federal regulations. The
petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved, the nature of the relief being requested
and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief. 


The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company (ATSF) 


(FRA Waiver Petition Docket Number SA-93-8) 


The ATSF seeks a waiver of compliance from certain sections of 49 CFR part 231, Railroad Safety Appliance Standards.
ATSF is requesting a permanent waiver of the provisions of 49 CFR part 231 which requires that bolts attaching handholds
and other safety appliances on freight equipment be ``riveted over''. Title 49 CFR 231.1 (h)(4) requires that side
handholds be securely fastened with not less than 1/2 inch bolts with nuts outside (when possible) and riveted over,
or with not less than 1/2 inch rivets. Several other sections in part 231 address the application of safety appliances
(sill steps, ladder treads, etc.) which requires that they be securely fastened with not less than 1/2 inch bolts with
nuts outside (when possible) and riveted over, or with not less than 1/2 inch rivets. 
ATSF states that there is an inconsistency in the manner in which bolts on freight cars and those on locomotives must
be secured. The regulations pertaining to bolts securing handholds on locomotives contain no similar requirement.
See 49 CFR 231.30. 

ATSF relates that they use state-of-the-art elastic stop nuts which are not riveted over but have locking effectiveness
and application advantages superior to those of metal bolts that are ``riveted over''. ATSF states that because there
appears to be no safety related justification to treat safety appliance standards differently, the requirement
that bolts on freight cars be riveted over is superfluous. 
Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments.
FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear
to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comments, they should notify FRA, in
writing, before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. 
All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition
Docket Number SA-93-8 and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Chief Counsel, Federal
Railroad Administration, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Communications received
before April 18, 1994 will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will
be considered as far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for
examination during regular business hours (9 a.m.-5 p.m.) in room 8201, Nassif Building, 
400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590.

<DOCTITLE>Petition for Waivers of Compliance </DOCTITLE>


In accordance with title 49 CFR 211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration
(FRA) has received from Plum Creek Charters a request for waiver of compliance with certain requirements of the Federal
rail safety regulations. The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved, the nature
of the relief being requested and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief. 


Plum Creek Charters (PCCX) 


(FRA Waiver Petition Docket Number SA-93-9) 


The PCCX seeks a waiver of compliance from certain sections of the Railroad Safety Appliance Standards (49 CFR part
231). PCCX is requesting a permanent waiver of the provisions of 49 CFR 231.14 (d)(3) requiring that horizontal end
handholds be located one on each side on each end projecting downward from face of end sill or sheathing. The PCCX request
that this requirement be waived for passenger car number 800245. Passenger car number 800245 was equipped with 480
volt wiring which necessitated the removal of the original end handholds to accommodate the electrical coupling
fixtures. The passenger car is equipped with end handholds approximately 48 inches from top of rail and not more than
16 inches from the side of car and project downward 
21/2 inches beyond the face of the end sill. 
Passenger car number 800245 is currently leased to and operated by the City of Prineville (COP) in excursion service.
The car is used on three trains per week during the summer and two trains per week in the winter. The excursion train travels
a distance of 38 miles over COP trackage. 
Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments.

FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear
to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comments, they should notify FRA, in
writing, before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. 
All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition
Docket Number SA-93-9) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Chief Counsel, Federal
Railroad Administration, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Communications received
before April 18, 1994, will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will
be considered as far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for
examination during regular business hours (9 a.m.-5 p.m.) in room 8201, Nassif Building, 
400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590.

<DOCTITLE>Petition for a Waiver of Compliance </DOCTITLE>


In accordance with 49 CFR 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has received
a request for a waiver of compliance with certain requirements of Federal railroad safety regulations. The individual
petitions are described below, including the party seeking relief, the regulatory provisions involved, the nature
of the relief being requested and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief. 
Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments.
FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear
to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for comment, they should notify FRA, in writing,
before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. 

All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition
Docket No. RSEQ-92-1) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel,
Federal Railroad Administration, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Communications
received before April 18, 1994 
will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will be considered as far
as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for examination during
regular business hours (9 a.m.-5 p.m.) in room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC
20590. The waiver petitions are as follows: 


Bellefonte Historical Railroad Society (BHRX) 


(Waiver Petition Docket No. RSAD-93-2) 


The BHRX seeks a permanent waiver of compliance from the provisions of Control of Alcohol and Drug Use (49 CFR part 219,
subparts E, F and G). The BHRX is an all-volunteer, non-profit railroad that operates two rail diesel cars in excursion
service at slow speeds under a trackage rights agreement on Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad on a regular weekend schedule
in the spring, summer, and fall. BHRX believes that the threat to safety from drug or alcohol abuse is very limited because
BHRX supervisory personnel contact their few operating employees regularly during train operations and would recognize
any unusual behavior. The petitioner indicates that granting the exemption is in the public interest and will not
adversely affect safety. 


Fillmore and Western Railroad FMWX


FRA Waiver Petition Docket No. HS-93-23 


The FMWX seeks an exemption from the Hours of Service Act to permit certain employees to remain on duty not more than

16 hours in any 24-hour period. The FMWX provides service for the movie industry in the Los Angles, California, area.
The FWR conducts no interchange services. 


Texas Gonzales and Northern Railway Company (TXGN) 
FRA Waiver Petition Docket No. HS-93-24 


The TXGN seeks an exemption from the Hours of Service Act to permit certain employees to remain on duty not more than

16 hours in any 24-hour period. The TXGN provides service over 12 miles of track in Gonzales County, Texas. The TXGN
conducts interchange services with Southern Pacific Transportation Company at Hardwood, Texas. The petitioner
indicates that granting the exemption is in the public interest and will not adversely affect safety. 


Carolina Rail Services Company (CRIJ) 


FRA Waiver Petition Docket No. HS-93-25 


The CRIJ seeks an exemption from the Hours of Service Act. The CRIJ is a Class III intra-port switching railroad serving
approximately seven to eight customers at the Port of Morehead City, North Carolina. The CRIJ operates only two switching
locomotives which pull its cars over three to four miles of line at extremely low speeds without traversing a public
crossing. The CRIJ has four full-time employees and several part-time employees. Occasionally, CRIJ's crews are
required to wait for a specific ship to be unloaded and the 12 hour limitation imposed by the Hours of Service Act unduly
restricts CRIJ's operations. In no case will CRIJ exceed 16 hours should the exemption be provided. The petitioner
indicates that granting the exemption is in the public interest and will not adversely affect safety. Additionally,
the petitioner asserts it has demonstrated good cause for granting this exemption.

Wilmington Terminal Railroad, L.P. (WTRY) 



FRA Waiver Petition Docket No. HS-93-26 



The WTRY seeks an exemption from the Hours of Service Act. The WTRY is a short line railroad which serves the port of Wilmington,
North Carolina, and operates over 5 miles of yard and industry track. WTRY has only five train crew personnel and does
not intend to operate over 12 hours per shift under normal operating conditions. However, an exemption would help
should the railroad encounter unusual operating conditions. WTRY indicates that granting the exemption is in the
public interest and will not adversely affect safety. Additionally, the petitioner asserts it has demonstrated
good cause for granting this exemption. 



CSX Transportation (CSX) 



FRA Waiver Petition Docket No. RSOP-94-1 



The CSX seeks an exemption to 49 CFR 218.37 which requires that torpedoes be part of flagging equipment. CSX Operating
Rules 99, 99A and 99E describe the conditions that require the application of torpedoes. Because of the antiquity
of torpedo use in the industry today, the petitioner is requesting a waiver from this requirement. CSX indicates that
granting the exemption is in the public interest and will not adversely affect safety. Additionally, the petitioner
asserts it has demonstrated good cause for granting this exemption.



Metro North Commuter Railroad Company (MNCW) 



FRA Waiver Petition Docket No. RSOP-94-2 




The MNCW seeks an exemption to 49 CFR 218.37 which requires that torpedoes be part of flagging equipment. MNCW is a public
benefit subsidiary corporation of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and operates commuter rail service
on its Harlem, Hudson, and New Haven Lines. MNCW indicates that in those rare occasions that torpedoes would be used
that adequate protection can be provided by use of flags, lamps and fuses. MNCW indicates that granting the exemption
is in the public interest and will not adversely affect safety. Additionally, the petitioner asserts it has demonstrated
good cause for granting this exemption.

Thomas Built Buses, Inc.; Disposition of Petition For Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance



Thomas Built Buses, Inc. (Thomas) of High Point, North Carolina determined that some of its buses failed to comply
with the requirements of 49 CFR 571.131, ``School Bus Pedestrian Safety Devices,'' Federal Motor Vehicle Safety
Standard (FMVSS) No. 131, and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance
Reports.'' Thomas also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic
and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 

et seq.

) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety.

Notice of receipt of the petition was published on November 15, 1993, and an opportunity afforded for comment (58 FR
60240).

Paragraph S5.5 of FMVSS No. 131 requires that:




[T]he stop signal arm shall be automatically extended. * * * at a minimum whenever the red signal lamps
* * * are activated; except that a device may be installed that prevents the automatic extension of
a stop signal arm * * *. While the device is activated, a continuous or intermittent signal audible
to the driver shall sound.




Between September 2, 1992, and July 30, 1993, Thomas produced 305 Type A, B, C, and D school buses which were not equipped
with a continuous or intermittent signal audible to the driver when the device is activated that prevents the automatic
extension of a stop signal. Thus, these school buses do not comply with the standard.

Thomas supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following:




Delivery of the noncomplying vehicles has been limited to one state, Virginia. That state has had a stop arm requirement
since the early 1980's and has required an interrupt switch, wired to the stop arm and crossing gate, since approximately
1986. Drivers use that switch only when the vehicle is loading or unloading passengers in the school yard so that buses
can be positioned close together without damaging the crossing gate (emphasis original). Bus drivers in Virginia
have been accustomed to activating the interrupt switch without an audible signal since the signal was not required
prior to the September 2, 1992 (sic) effective date of FMVSS 131.




However, Thomas stated in its Defect and Noncompliance Report that:




All vehicles will be repaired through customer notification by the Thomas distributor in Virginia. Repair parts
will be supplied at no charge. The repair will consist of installing a chime, adding a wire to the existing wire harness,
and connecting the wire to the chime.




No comments were received on the petition.

NHTSA contacted Thomas for a clarification of this statement, and received a letter from Thomas that stated that a
repair kit had been provided to all owners of the affected buses. This was accomplished through its dealer, Sonny Merryman,
Inc. (Merryman), in Rustburg, Va. The letter that Merryman sent owners offered to reimburse owners who performed
their own repair. Because the effect of an inconsequentiality determination is to excuse notification and remedy
of noncompliance, and because the acts of Thomas amounted to notification and remedy as contemplated by statute,
NHTSA has determined that the petition has been mooted by the actions of the petitioner, and no further action is required
with respect to it.

ACTION:

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces a determination, under Notice 
89-61, that the list of taxable substances in section 
4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code will be modified to 
include acetylene black.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Under section 4672(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an 
importer or exporter of any substance may request that the 
Secretary determine whether such substance should be listed 
as a taxable substance. The Secretary shall add such 
substance to the list of taxable substances in section 
4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines that taxable chemicals 
constitute more than 50 percent of the weight, or more than 
50 percent of the value, of the materials used to produce 
such substance. This determination is to be made on the 
basis of the predominant method of production. Notice 89-61, 
1989-1 C.B. 717, sets forth the rules relating to the 
determination process. 



Determination 



On March 10, 1994, the Secretary determined that acetylene 
black should be added to the list of taxable substances in 
section 4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, effective 
October 1, 1991. However, if this substance is produced from 
acetylene derived from coal it is not a taxable substance. 

The rate of tax prescribed for acetylene black, under 
section 4671(b)(3), is $5.50 per ton unless it is produced 
from acetylene derived from coal. This is based upon a 
conversion factor for acetylene of 1.13. 

The petitioner is Chevron Chemical Company, a manufacturer 
and exporter of this substance. No material comments were 
received on this petition. The following information is the 
basis for the determination.




HTS number: 2903.00.00.50 

CAS number: 1333-86-4




Acetylene black is derived from acetylene, a taxable 
chemical unless it is derived from coal. Acetylene black is 
a solid produced predominantly by direct thermal 
decomposition of acetylene. 

The stoichiometric material consumption formula for 
acetylene black is:

 


C

2

H

2

 (acetylene)__> 2 C (acetylene black) + 2 H 
(hydrogen)




Acetylene black has been determined to be a taxable 
substance because a review of its stoichiometric material 
consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant 
method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 100 
percent by weight of the materials used in its production.
