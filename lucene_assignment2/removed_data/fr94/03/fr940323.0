Prevailing Rate Systems; Rockingham, NH, NAF Wage Area



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management is issuing an interim regulation to redefine the Rockingham, New Hampshire, Federal
Wage System nonappropriated fund (NAF) wage area for pay-setting purposes. After this change, a new wage area, York,
Maine, will include the same three counties, with York County, Maine, designated as the survey area and Rockingham
County, New Hampshire, and Windsor County, Vermont, designated as areas of application. With the closing of Pease
Air Force Base, there are no longer enough NAF wage employees in Rockingham County to satisfy the requirements established
by regulation for a survey county.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Rockingham, New Hampshire, NAF wage area is presently composed of three counties: Rockingham County, New Hampshire
(survey area); York County, Maine (area of application); and Windsor County, Vermont (area of application). After
this change, a new wage area, York, Maine, will include the same three counties, with York County designated as the
survey area and Rockingham County and Windsor County designated as areas of application.



This change was made necessary by the closing of Pease Air Force Base, which left only two NAF employees in Rockingham
County. By regulation (5 CFR 532.219) there must be a minimum of 26 NAF wage employees in the survey area, and a local
activity in the area must have the capability to conduct the survey. Neither of these conditions can now be met by Rockingham
County. However, York County does not meet the minimum requirements to be the survey area. The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard
has 58 NAF employees and has the capability to conduct the survey. York County also meets the other regulatory requirement
of a minimum of 1,800 private enterprise employees in establishments within survey specifications. There are approximately
23,025 such employees in York County. The remaining employees in the wage area are the 8 Veterans Administration employees
of the White River Junction Medical Center and Regional Office in Windsor County, Vermont, bringing the total wage
area employment to 68.


The full-scale surveys will continue to be ordered in September of even numbered fiscal years_e.g., in September
1994. The Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee (FPRAC) reviewed this request and by consensus recommended
approval.


Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking.
Also, pursuant to section 553(d)(3) of title 5, United States Code, I find that good cause exists for making this rule
effective in less than 30 days. The notice is being waived and the regulation is being made effective in less than 30
days because preparations for September 1994 surveys must begin immediately.



Regulatory Flexibility Act




I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because they affect only Federal agencies and employees.

Changes in Fees for Federal Meat Grading and Certification Services 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is revising the hourly fee rates for voluntary Federal meat grading and
acceptance services. The hourly fees will be adjusted to incorporate new program costs and ensure that the Federal
meat grading program is operated on a financially self-supporting basis as required by law. The new program costs
are the result of a congressional budget action which requires the Agency to recover the costs of livestock and meat
standardization activities. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Executive Order 12778 



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This final rule is not intended
to have preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations, or policies that do not conflict with
this final rule. This final rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. There are no administrative procedures
which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to this final rule or the application of its provisions. 



Regulatory Impact Analysis 



This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been
reviewed by OMB. 



Effect on Small Entities 



This final rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (Pub. L. 96-354, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The changes to the hourly fees are necessary to recover directly related costs of livestock and meat standardization
activities. The per-hour increase translates to a $.000031 increase in the per-pound unit cost of meat grading and
certification services. However, the unit cost for providing meat grading and certification services to all applicants_including
the cost to fund directly related livestock and meat standardization activities_has been reduced by cost-reduction
actions in both the program and the meat industry to approximately $.0009 per pound. Accordingly, the Administrator
of AMS has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities as defined by the RFA. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act do not apply to this rulemaking as it does not require the collection
of any information or data. 



Background 



The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized under the Agricultural Marketing Act (AMA) of 1946, as amended, 7 U.S.C.
1621 

et seq., 

to provide voluntary Federal meat grading and acceptance services to facilitate the orderly marketing of meat and
meat products and to enable consumers to obtain the quality of meat they desire. The AMA also provides for the collection
of fees from users of Federal meat grading and acceptance services, which is approximately equal to the costs of providing
these services. Program operating costs for fiscal year (FY) 1993 and previous years have included graders' salaries,
fringe benefits, supervision, travel, training, and administrative costs. When the program incurs increases in
operating costs which are beyond its control, such cost increases must be recovered through increases in the fee rate
charged to users of meat grading and acceptance services so that the program can remain financially self-supporting.


The recent appropriations bill HR 2493, requires collection of fees for standardization activities for FY 1994 and
subsequent years as established by regulation pursuant to law 
(31 U.S.C. 9701). Standardization programs and activities include, but are not limited to, the development, maintenance,
and demonstration of the official U.S. standards for carcass grades, live animal grades, and wool and mohair grades
and specifications for livestock, meat, and meat products. The congressional action places the obligation of funding
standardization programs and activities on those individuals or groups that benefit from such programs or activities.
For the livestock and meat industry, those portions of the total costs for standardization activities which support
the meat grading and acceptance services or otherwise provide a service to the meatpackers and processors will be
recovered through increases in fees charged to users of meat grading and acceptance services. Prior to FY 1994, the
total cost to operate the livestock and meat standardization program was funded entirely by congressionally-appropriated
funds. However, as a result of the new congressional mandate, all funds appropriated for standardization programs
and activities must be reimbursed to the U.S. Treasury beginning with FY 1994 and for each FY thereafter. Based upon
an analysis of standardization programs, activities, and related staffing levels, the Agency has determined that
for 1994 the projected costs to operate the livestock and meat standardization program is $885,000, of which $610,500
are attributable to the meatpacking and processing industries. Accordingly, this amount must be recovered through
the fees charged to users of meat grading and acceptance services. The remaining portions of the standardization
costs not attributable to the meat grading and acceptance services or otherwise not identifiable as providing a service
to 
the meatpacking and processing industry (i.e., wool and mohair standards, a portion of the live standards) will be
(1) Reimbursed by direct transfers of funds from those programs whose services are supported or dependent on those
standards; or (2) terminated if the costs incurred cannot be recovered. The amount to be reimbursed through the meat
grading and acceptance user fees includes (1) The costs for the development and maintenance of carcass standards;
(2) a portion of the costs for live animal standards; (3) a portion of the costs for the development and maintenance
of specifications; and (4) related administrative and management overhead costs. 

The Agency recognizes the impact of any user-fee increase on the meat industry. This increase in the user fees implemented
by this rule is due to the congressional budget action that requires the Agency to recover the costs of funding standardization
programs and activities. Accordingly, the Agency has taken action to minimize the amount of the increase in the hourly
fee rate necessary to recover the costs for standardization programs and activities which support the meat grading,
acceptance, or related services provided to the meatpacking and processing industry. These actions include projected
cost reductions in the review and evaluation functions and in employee training and development related to conduct
of the meat grading and acceptance services. Additionally, the Agency will continue to review standardization programs
and activities which support the meat grading, acceptance, or related services provided to the meatpacking and processing
industry to effect further cost reductions wherever possible.

Comments 



On December 9, 1993, the Agency published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 64669) an interim final rule increasing the fees for Federal meat grading and certification services. On January
13, 1994, the Agency published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 1890) a correction to make the interim rule effective on December 9, 1993. This rule was implemented on an interim
basis without prior proposal because increased revenues were needed to cover the increased cost of providing service.
The interim rule was published with request for comments as a means of providing full public participation in the rulemaking
process. Comments were requested by February 7, 1994. During the 60-day comment period the Agency received no letters
responsive to the interim final rule. 

In view of the foregoing considerations, the Agency will increase the base hourly rate for commitment applicants
for voluntary Federal meat grading and acceptance services from $35.20 to $36.60. A commitment applicant is a user
of the service who agrees, by commitment or agreement memorandum, to the use of meat grading and acceptance services
for 8 consecutive hours per day, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., excluding legal holidays.
The base hourly rate for noncommitment applicants for voluntary Federal meat grading and acceptance services will
increase from $37.60 to $39.00, and will be charged to applicants who utilize the service for 8 hours or less per day,
Monday through Friday, between the hours of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., excluding legal holidays. The premium hourly rate for
all applicants will be increased from $43.20 to $44.60, and will be charged to users of the service for the hours worked
in excess of 8 hours per day between the hours of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., and for hours worked from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., Monday through
Friday, and for any time worked on Saturday and Sunday, except on legal holidays. The holiday rate for all applicants
will be increased from $70.40 to $73.20, and will be charged to users of the service for all hours worked on legal holidays.


Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is hereby found that good cause exists for not delaying the effective action until 30 days
after publication of this final rule in the 

Federal Register

. Therefore, this final rule will be effective on March 23, 1994.

Milk in the Tennessee Valley Marketing Area; Temporary Revision of Rule 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Temporary revision of rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document revises certain provisions of the Tennessee Valley Federal milk order (Order 11) for the months of March
through July 1994. The action was requested by Armour Food Ingredients Company (Armour), which operates a proprietary
supply plant pooled under Order 11. This revision is necessary to prevent the uneconomical movement of milk and to
ensure that producer milk associated with the market in the fall will continue to be pooled in the spring and summer
months.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Prior document in this proceeding: 



Notice of Proposed Temporary Revision: Issued February 8, 1994; published February 16, 1994 (59 FR 7665). 

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens
the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensure that dairy farmers will continue to
have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. 

The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of
an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in
any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the
date of the entry of the ruling. 

This temporary revision is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the
provisions of  1011.7(b) of the Tennessee Valley order. 

Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 7665) concerning a proposed relaxation of the supply plant shipping requirement. 

The revision was proposed to be effective for the months of March 1, 1994, through July 31, 1994. The public was afforded
the opportunity to comment on the proposed notice by submitting written data, views and arguments by February 23,
1994. No comments were received. 



Statement of Consideration 



This rule revises from 40 to 30 percent the supply plant shipping requirement for the period of March through July 1994.
The Tennessee Valley order requires that a supply plant ship a minimum of 60 percent of the total quantity of milk physically
received at the supply plant during the months of August through November, January, and February, and 40 percent in
each of the other months. The order also provides authority for the Director of the Dairy Division to increase or decrease
this supply plant shipping requirement by up to 10 percentage points if such a revision is necessary to obtain needed
shipments of milk or to prevent uneconomic shipments. 

Armour states that it would have to make uneconomical shipments of milk to meet the 40 percent supply plant shipping
requirement to continue its pool status. Additionally, the proponent states that its inability to meet the 40 percent
requirement could jeopardize the continued association of its producers with the market. 

The reduction in the supply plant shipping requirement by 10 percentage points will enable a supply plant operator
to qualify its plant as a pool plant without making inefficient and uneconomical shipments of milk. The revision will
also allow producers who supplied the market in the fall to continue their association with the market during the flush
production months. 

After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal set forth in the aforesaid notice, and other
available information, it is hereby found and determined that the supply plant shipping percentage set forth in  1011.7(b)
should be reduced from 40 to 30 percent for the months of March through July 1994.

It is hereby found and determined that 30 days' notice of the effective date hereof is impractical, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest in that: (a) This temporary revision is necessary to reflect current marketing conditions
and to maintain orderly marketing conditions in the marketing area for the months of March through July 1994; 

(b) This temporary revision does not require of persons affected substantial or extensive preparation prior to the
effective date; and 

(c) Notice of the proposed temporary revision was given to interested parties and they were afforded opportunity
to file written data, views, or arguments concerning this temporary revision. No comments were received. 

Therefore, good cause exists for making this temporary revision effective less than 30 days from the date of publication
in the 

Federal Register

.

Termination of the Order: Issued June 25, 1993; published July 1, 1993 (58 FR 35361). 

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a final rule on
small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It simply terminates
the remaining administrative provisions of the Nashville order. 

The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This final rule also has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended
to have a retroactive effect. This action does not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of
an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in
any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date
of the entry of the ruling. 



Determinations 



Pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601, et seq.),
and of the current order regulating the handling of milk in the Nashville, Tennessee, marketing area (7 CFR Part 1098),
it is hereby found and determined that: 

(a) Section 1098.1, the remaining provision of the order, no longer tends to effectuate the declared policy of the
Act.

A public hearing that considered proposed amendments to all Federal milk orders was held in September, October, and
November 1990, pursuant to notice thereof issued July 11, 1990 (55 FR 29034). Following the issuance of a recommended
decision and the opportunity for filing exceptions, the Acting Assistant Secretary for Marketing and Inspection
Services on February 5, 1993, issued a final decision on the issues considered at the hearing. In a referendum held
following the issuance of the final decision, the proposed amended Nashville order was not approved by at least two-thirds
of the order's producers who voted. The Act requires that an order, as amended, be approved by at least two-thirds of
the producers who voted in the referendum or by producers who, during the representative period, produced at least
two-thirds of the volume of milk marketed. 

On the basis of the record of the public hearing, the comment received in response to the proposed termination of Order
98, and the results of the producer referendum, the Department issued a termination order, effective midnight July
31, 1993. The order terminated the monthly operating provisions of the Nashville, Tennessee, order, but left intact
certain administrative provisions that were embodied, by reference, in  1098.1 of the order. 

The market administrator, in his capacity as the order's liquidating agent, has completed the disbursement of all
of the money remaining in the administrative, producer-settlement, and marketing service funds established under
the order. Hence, the remaining provisions of the order should be terminated. 

(b) Notice of proposed rulemaking and public procedure thereon, and 30 days notice of the effective date are impracticable,
unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest because all of the business related to the operation of the order
has been concluded. 

Therefore, good cause exists for making this order effective upon publication in the 

Federal Register

. 



Order 





It is therefore ordered, 

That the remaining provisions of Part 1098 represented by  1098.1, which incorporates the General Provisions,
are hereby terminated, and Part 1098 is vacated effective upon publication of this order in the 

Federal Register

. Termination of the remaining provisions of the said order shall not affect or waive any right, obligation, duty,
or liability under the said order with respect to milk delivered prior to the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

 or release or extinguish any violations of the said order, or affect or impair any right or remedy of the United States,
the Secretary of Agriculture, or any other person with respect to any such violation which has arisen or occurred or
which may arise or occur prior to the time that termination of such remaining provisions becomes effective.

Airworthiness Directives; British Aerospace Model BAe 146-100A, -200A, and -300A Series Airplanes






<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain British Aerospace Model BAe 146-100A,
-200A, and -300A series airplanes, that requires modification of the electrical power supply system.
This amendment is prompted by a report that a single phase fault current can cause sequential failure of all onboard
main electrical generators. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent such failures and subsequent
loss of electrical power sources onboard the airplane. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain British Aerospace Model BAe 146-100A, -200A, and -300A series airplanes
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 13, 1993 (58 FR 52929). That action proposed to require modification of the electrical power supply system.



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 

One commenter supports the proposal.

Another commenter notes that a statement in the preamble to the notice, which indicated that the cause of the subject
single phase fault currents ``had not been determined,'' was inaccurate. This commenter advises that, following
the original incident, an investigation by the airplane manufacturer revealed that the cause was due to the loosening
of an adjustment locking nut in a remote control circuit breaker (RCCB) that caused one phase of the 3-phase power supply
to remain energized. Replacement of the RCCB's was recommended by British Aerospace Service Bulletin SB.24-69-70484A,
Revision 1, which was the subject of AD 91-04-07, Amendment 39-6899 (56 FR 5751, February 13, 1991).
Therefore, the cause of the original failure has been determined and rectified. However, there may be other fault
causes that have not been identified; it is for this reason that the proposed modification of the generator control
unit (GCU) is necessary so that the GCU can better handle failures of this type without causing the loss of all primary
electric power sources. The FAA acknowledges this information.

This same commenter also points out that certain wording in the preamble to the notice that described the addressed
unsafe condition could be misinterpreted. The statement indicates that a single fault in one phase of a 3-phase power
supply can cause ``sequential failure of all onboard main electrical generators and subsequent loss of electrical
power sources onboard the airplane.'' The commenter states that it is unlikely that all generated power will be lost,
however, since these airplanes have a hydraulically-driven standby generator that could provide essential AC and
DC current if all main generators fail. The FAA concurs with this observation. However, since loss of all main generators
has been determined to be an unsafe condition, the requirements of this rule are intended to address that condition.


This commenter also states that the description of the referenced British Aerospace service bulletin in the preamble
to the notice was incomplete. This commenter states that, while British Aerospace Service Bulletin SB.24-91-70488B&C
does describe installation Modification HCM70488B, which is the only modification referenced in the proposed AD
for mandatory installation, it also describes two other modifications: Modification HCM70488C (which must be installed
concurrently with Modification HCM70488B) deletes the neutral connection from the Vickers electrically-driven
hydraulic pump; and Modification HCM01321A, although not classified as mandatory, introduces into the GCU's improved
standard components that have a higher reliability. The commenter also notes that Modification HCM70488B adds an
unbalanced current detector circuit into the GCU's, in addition to replacing the lowest phase detector type undervoltage
protection circuit with an average voltage sensing detector circuit. The FAA acknowledges this information. 

This same commenter requests that the proposed compliance time of 3,100 hours time-in-service be revised to ``December
15, 1995,'' since the referenced British Aerospace service bulletin recommends that airplanes be modified by that
date. The manufacturer of the required modification parts has estimated that it will take until that date to accomplish
the modification of all of the affected GCU's worldwide. In light of this, the commenter states that it is possible
that operators who accumulate 3,100 hours prior to December 15, 1995, may not be able to obtain the required modified
units. The FAA does not concur that a change to the compliance time is necessary. It is the FAA's normal policy to use
a calendar date as a compliance time only when a direct analytical relationship can be established between that date
and failure of subject component. In developing an appropriate compliance times for AD actions, the FAA normally
takes into account the safety implications, the fleet's average utilization rate, logistical support considerations
(parts availability, repair facility availability), normal maintenance schedules for timely accomplishment
of the modification, and parameters to which failure of subject component is related. The FAA took into account all
of these factors, as well as the manufacturer's recommended time for modification installation, and has determined
that 3,100 flight hours is the appropriate compliance time interval. Since the average operating time for most of
the affected U.S.-registered Model BAe 146 series airplanes is 148 hours per month, most U.S. operators will have
accumulated 3,100 flight hours by approximately December 15, 1995.

This commenter also requests that the proposed rule be revised to cite the latest revision of the referenced service
bulletin. British Aerospace has issued Service Bulletin SB.24-91-70488B&C, Revision 2, dated
July 19, 1993, which provides additional details concerning the effectivity listing in the service bulletin. This
revision also specifies that the Model BAe 146RJ series of airplanes are not affected by the service bulletin. The
FAA concurs and has revised the final rule to include this later revision of the referenced service bulletin as an additional
source of service information. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined
that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 

The FAA estimates that 49 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 4 work
hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on
these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $10,780, or $220 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption

<ACTION>
action:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 This rule modifies Federal Airways V-93 and V-451 located in Maine. Modifying V-93 and V-451
is necessary because a segment of the description for each airway utilizes the Navy Brunswick, ME, Very High Frequency
Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) facility which is scheduled to be decommissioned on April
28, 1994. This action also corrects an inadvertent error in the description of V-451: ``Calverton, RI'' should
read ``Calverton, NY.''


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
History


On January 12, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify
V-93 and V-451 (59 FR 1686). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding
by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Except
for editorial changes, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Domestic VOR Federal airways are
published in paragraph 6010(a) of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is
incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The airways listed in this document will be published
subsequently in the Order.


The Rule


This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations modifies V-93 and V-451. A segment of the
description for each airway utilizes the Navy Brunswick (NHZ) VORTAC which is scheduled to be decommissioned on April
28, 1994. This action becomes effective concurrent with the decommissioning of the Navy Brunswick VORTAC. This action
also corrects an inadvertent error in the description of V-451: ``Calverton, RI'' should read ``Calverton,
NY.''
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action is to establish Class E airspace by correcting the current airspace reference for Oscoda, MI from Class
D to Class E2. A Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has
been developed at Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport. Controlled airspace to the surface is needed to contain instrument
flight rules (IFR) operations at the airport. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace
for IFR operators executing the recently established SIAP.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




History



On December 27, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class E airspace at Oscoda, MI (58 FR 68328). An Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS) has been installed at
the Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport that will continuously provide weather data, and a non-federal VOR SIAP has been established.
Controlled airspace to the surface is needed to contain IFR operations at the airport. Interested parties were invited
to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments
objecting to the proposal were received. Minor changes were made to the legal description to correct the geographical
coordinates for Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport and to accurately identify this Class E airspace as operating continuously
by deleting the last two sentences in referencing to publication of specific hours. Other than these editorial changes,
this amendment is the same at that proposed in the notice. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North
American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17,
1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993).
The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E2 airspace at Oscoda, MI, to provide
controlled airspace to the surface for aircraft executing the VOR SIAP into the Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport. The FAA
has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent
and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Rule


This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations revises Class E airspace at (Class E airspace areas extending
upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth) at Oconto Municipal Airport, Oconto, WI, to accommodate
Nondirectional Beacon (NDB) Runway 29 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP). Controlled airspace extending
from 700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed to contain aircraft executing the approach.
Aeronautical maps and charts will reflect the defined area which will enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in
order to comply with applicable visual flight rule requirements.

ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of dimethyldibenzylidene
sorbitol as a clarifying agent for polypropylene and high-propylene olefin copolymers intended for use in contact
with food. This action is in response to a petition filed by Milliken Chemical.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of April 22, 1993 (58 FR 21583), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 2B4341) had been filed by Milliken
Chemical, c/o 1001 G St. NW., suite 500 West, Washington, DC 20001, proposing that  178.3295 

Clarifying agents for polymers

 (21 CFR 178.3295) be amended to provide for the safe use of dimethyldibenzylidene sorbitol as a clarifying agent in
polypropylene articles intended for use in contact with food. 


Upon further review of the petition, the agency noted that the petitioner had requested use of the additive as a clarifying
agent in high-propylene olefin copolymers in addition to its use in polypropylene films. In a notice published in
the 

Federal Register

 of January 4, 1994 (59 FR 307), FDA amended the filing notice of April 22, 1993, to state that the petitioner had requested
that the food additive regulations be amended to provide for the safe use of dimethyldibenzylidene sorbitol as a clarifying
agent in polypropylene and high-propylene olefin copolymers for use in contact with food.
FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material. The agency concludes that the proposed use of the
food additive is safe and that the regulations in  178.3295 should be amended as set forth below.
In accordance with  171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule amends the section 8 Housing Assistance Payments program regulations for new construction and substantial
rehabilitation to comply with section 151 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. Section 151 requires
that the Secretary promulgate regulations to implement section 555 of the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990,
which requires that section 8 new construction and substantial rehabilitation projects assisted under section
8(b)(2) as it existed before October 1, 1983, and with a contract for assistance under such section, be reserved for
occupancy by low-income and very low-income families. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



Section 151 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (1992 HCD Act) requires that the Secretary promulgate
regulations implementing section 555 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (NAHA).
Section 555 of NAHA provides that any dwelling unit in any housing constructed or substantially rehabilitated pursuant
to assistance provided under section 8(b)(2) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, as that section existed before October
1, 1983, and with a contract for assistance under that section, be reserved for occupancy by low-income and very low-income
families. 

As we stated in the proposed rule published on July 1, 1993 (58 FR 35416), the Department administers six section 8 programs
that involve newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated housing: (1) The section 8 New Construction Program,
24 CFR part 880; (2) the Section 8 Substantial Rehabilitation Program, 24 CFR part 881; (3) the State Housing Agencies
program (insofar as it involves new construction and substantial rehabilitation), 24 CFR part 883; (4) the New Construction
Set-Aside for Section 515 Rural Rental Housing Projects Program, 24 CFR part 884; (5) the Section 202 Loans for Housing
for the Elderly or Handicapped Program, 24 CFR part 885; and (6) the Section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the Disposition
of HUD-Owned Projects (insofar as it involves substantial rehabilitation), 24 CFR part 886. 

Before 1981, owners could rent up to 10 percent (20 percent in the Set-Aside Program for Rural Rental Housing Projects)
of assisted units to ineligible families. Moreover, before 1984, and except in the section 202 loan program, the Department's
regulations did not require a reduction in assisted units under the contract until rental to ineligibles exceeded
10 percent (20 percent in the Set-Aside Program for Rural Rental Housing Projects). 

Section 325(l) of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1981 amended section 8(b)(2) of the U.S. Housing
Act of 1937 by adding the following provision: 




Each contract to make assistance payments for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated housing assisted
under this section entered into after the date of enactment of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of
1981 shall provide that during the term of the contract the owner shall make available for occupancy by families which
are eligible for assistance under this section, at the time of their initial occupancy, the number of units for which
assistance is committed under the contract. 




As a result of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1981, the Department implemented the existing
regulations governing section 8 substantial rehabilitation or new construction (except 24 CFR part 885) which require
that owners make available all assisted units for eligible families for Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Contracts
entered into pursuant to an Agreement to enter into a HAP Contract (AHAP) executed on or after October 1, 1981. The existing
regulations, however, exempt owners who entered into an AHAP prior to October 1, 1981, from the statutory requirement
that owners make all assisted units available for leasing by eligible families. 

The Department believes that the purpose of section 555 of NAHA was to remove the exemption for owners who entered into
an AHAP prior to October 1, 1981. Accordingly, this final rule change requires that owners make available all assisted
units for eligible families for all HAP Contracts, regardless of when the Owner entered into the AHAP.

<TEXT>
 

The Section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the Disposition of HUD-owned Projects (24 CFR part 886, subpart C) involves
existing housing in addition to substantially rehabilitated housing. The Additional Assistance Program for Projects
with HUD-Insured and HUD-Held Mortgages (24 CFR part 886, subpart A) involves only existing housing. Under both subparts,
the assistance is project based. 

In implementing the existing regulations, the Department previously determined administratively that project-based
assistance should be treated similarly to new construction and substantial rehabilitation for the purposes of this
rule. As such, any contracts entered into after October 3, 1984 (the effective date of the current regulations) already
are subject to the requirement that Owners make available all assisted units for eligible families. Since application
of this final rule to an owner of existing housing is not mandated by section 555 of NAHA, this rule would not affect the
obligation of a section 8 project owner of existing housing assisted under part 886 who executed a Contract before
October 3, 1984. 

Finally, this rule does not change the section 202 loan program regulations. The changes in this rule are consistent
with the current regulations for the section 202 handicapped housing program, and so no changes are necessary for
that program. Moreover, no regulations currently exist on this matter for the Section 202 elderly housing loan program.
However, the Department is preparing a separate regulation amending part 885 which, among other matters, will incorporate
this amendment into that part. 



II. Discussion of Public Comments 



The Department received one public comment from a housing development authority in response to the proposed rule
published on July 1, 1993 (58 FR 35416). The commenter suggested that the Department exempt rural housing developments
from the 100% occupancy by income eligible families requirement since there is a limited number of 50-80% of
median income eligible tenants to fill the units. 

The Department appreciates the difficulty that some rural housing developments may experience with regard to filling
projects with income eligible families. However, section 555 of NAHA does not provide for an exemption for rural housing
developments, and so the Department does not have the discretion to create such an exemption. Moreover, the regulations
which allow an owner to rent to an ineligible family if the owner is temporarily unable to fill all units with eligible
families remain unchanged by this final rule. Finally, the regulations continue to allow formerly eligible tenants
who are currently income ineligible to continue to remain in their units subject to paying the market rent. 



III. Other Matters 



A. Environmental Impact 



At the time of publication of the proposed rule, a finding of no significant impact with respect to the environment
was made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). The proposed rule is adopted by this final rule without change. Accordingly, the
initial finding of no significant impact remains applicable, and is available for public inspection between 7:30
a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address. 



B. Executive Order 12612, Federalism 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the Federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of government. Specifically, the rule is directed to owners of multifamily
housing projects, and will not impinge upon the relationship between the Federal Government and State and local governments.
As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the order. 



C. Executive Order 12606, the Family 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, 

The Family

, has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance,
and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD
policies or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.




D. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) has reviewed and approved this
rule, and in so doing certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities. This rule reflects a statutory requirement which applies to all section 8 newly constructed or substantially
rehabilitated housing without regard to the size of entities involved. 



E. Regulatory Agenda 



This final rule was listed as sequence number 1543 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published
on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 56402, 56431) in accordance with Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Temporary final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone on the Ohio River back channel that separates Coraopolis, Pennsylvania
from Neville Island, Pennsylvania. This regulation is needed to control vessel traffic in the regulated area during
demolition of one main span and a center support pier of a bridge at Ohio River back channel mile 9.6. This regulation
will restrict general navigation in the regulated area during demolition operations for the safety of vessel traffic.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Drafting Information




The drafters of this regulation are LT John Meehan, Project Officer, Marine Safety Office, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
and LCDR A.O. Denny, Project Attorney, Second Coast Guard District Legal Office.



Regulatory History



In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, a bridge is being removed from a navigable waterway. Bridge
removal operations pose inherent risks to the waterway because the structure is progressively weakened as the operation
proceeds. Once commenced, such operations should be completed as quickly as possible. Removal operations involving
the southern main span of the bridge and various northern span structural supports have already been completed, leaving
insufficient time to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking. The Coast Guard deems it to be in the public's best interest
to issue a regulation without waiting for a comment period, as immediate implementation of navigation restrictions
is needed to ensure the safety of vessels transitting the area and to minimize the time a bridge in a weakened condition
remains over the waterway.

Background and Purpose



The Coraopolis Highway Bridge at mile 9.6 on the Ohio River back channel between Coraopolis, Pennsylvania and Neville
Island, Pennsylvania is no longer an active highway bridge and is in the process of being removed. The bridge originally
consisted of several small spans that were located over land and two 300 foot main spans that crossed over the waterway
and met atop a stone pier at the center of the channel. As part of the overall bridge removal operation, each main span
and the center support pier have been scheduled for demolition with explosive charges. The first main span demolition,
involving the southern span (Coraopolis side of the back channel) occurred on March 1, 1994. The second main span demolition,
involving the northern span (Neville Island side of the back channel) is scheduled for approximately 10 a.m. on March
22, 1994. Steel members and debris from the demolition of this northern span will fall into the sailing line of the channel,
creating an unsafe condition for vessels attempting to transit. The contractor will immediately commence clearing
operations in the channel, but it will require 3 days to restore the navigability of this section of the Ohio River back
channel. Accordingly, no vessel traffic will be permitted in the safety zone extending from Ohio River back channel
mile 9.3 to mile 9.9 during this second demolition and subsequent channel clearing operations from 8 a.m. on March
22, 1994 to 4 p.m. on March 25, 1994. For the remaining period that this safety zone is in effect, vessel traffic will
be permitted to proceed without restriction, except during periods when the bridge's center pier is undergoing actual
demolition operations. These pier demolition operations are tentatively scheduled for 3 p.m. on March 30, 1994 and
3 p.m. on April 6, 1994, and each will last approximately four hours. During these times, no vessel traffic will be permitted
within the safety zone. In the event of unanticipated delays involving the demolitions discussed above, the Captain
of the Port Pittsburgh will notify the marine community of schedule changes affecting the duration of vessel traffic
restrictions within the safety zone via Marine Safety Information Radio Broadcasts on VHF Marine Band Radio, Channel
22 (157.1 MHz) and via on site broadcast advisories on Channel 13 (156.650 MHz).



Regulatory Evaluation



This temporary final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not
significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,
1979), it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no
collection of information requirements. A full regulatory analysis is unnecessary because the Coast Guard expects
the impact of this regulation to be minimal due to the relatively short duration of vessel traffic restrictions, the
relatively small size of the area regulated, and the infrequency of commercial vessel transits along this section
of Ohio River back channel.



Federalism Assessment



Under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 12612, this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Environmental Assessment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c.
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation
as an action required to protect public safety.

commodities soybean grain at 0.1 ppm, soybean forage at 0.7 ppm, soybean hay at 1.1 ppm, wheat forage at 0.5 ppm, wheat
straw at 0.1 ppm, sorghum forage at 0.1 ppm, sorghum fodder at 0.1 ppm, sorghum silage at 0.05 ppm and sorghum hay at 0.2
ppm.
No comments were received in response to the notices of filing. 
Monsanto Co. and Zencea Ag Products formed a partnership, Acetochlor Registration Partnership (ARP). The ARP revised
PP 3F2966 and PP 1F4011 by proposing the establishment of tolerances for residues of acetochlor and its metabolites
containing the ethylmethyl aniline (EMA) moiety and the hydroxy ethyl methyl aniline (HEMA) moiety to be analyzed
as acetochlor, and expressed as acetochlor equivalents in or on the raw agricultural commodities field corn grain
at 0.05 ppm, field corn forage at 1.0 ppm, and field corn fodder at 1.5 ppm.
The company name for the filing notice of October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54354) should have read Acetochlor Registration Partnership
instead of Zeneca Ag Products. During the course of review, it was determined that the proposal for PP 3F4232 needed
further clarifications. The ARP amended PP 3F44232 by proposing the establishment of tolerances for residues of
acetochlor and its metabolites containing the ethyl methyl aniline (EMA) moiety and the hydroxy ethyl methyl aniline
(HEMA) moiety to be analyzed as acetochlor, and expressed as acetochlor equivalents, in or on the raw agricultural
commodities soybean grain at 0.1 ppm, soybean forage at 0.7 ppm, soybean hay at 1.0 ppm, wheat grain at 0.02 ppm, wheat
forage at 0.5 ppm, wheat straw at 0.1 ppm, wheat forage at 0.1 ppm, sorghum grain at 0.02 ppm, sorghum forage at 0.1 ppm,
sorghum fodder at 0.1 ppm, sorghum silage at 0.05 ppm, and sorghum hay at 0.2 ppm. The forthcoming update of Table II
of the Residue Chemistry Guidelines will not list sorghum silage and sorghum hay as commodities requiring residue
data. Therefore, the tolerance proposals of sorghum silage at 0.05 ppm and sorghum hay at 0.2 ppm are being withdrawn,
since establishment of tolerances on these commodities is not necessary.
Because the tolerances on wheat grain at 0.02 ppm and sorghum grain at 0.02 ppm were not previously published, EPA will
soon publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of the ARP's petition to establish these tolerances. This document will allow 30 days for public comment on
the regulated wheat grain and sorghum tolerances. All other revisions to pesticide petitions 3F2966, 1F4011, and
3F4232 by the ARP involved clarifications of recent rewording of previously published proposals or minor changes,
e.g., lowering the soybean hay tolerance to 1.0 ppm from 1.1 ppm; therefore, no additional period of public comment
is needed.
The data submitted in the petitions and other relevant material have been evaluated. The acetochlor toxicological
data listed below were considered in support of these tolerances.
1. Acute toxicology data submitted place technical acetochlor in toxicity category II for eye irritation, toxicity
III for acute oral, acute dermal, and acute inhalation. Technical acetochlor is in category IV for primary skin irritation
and is a skin sensitizer.
2. A 3-month feeding study submitted by Monsanto with rats fed dosages of 0, 40, 100, and 300 milligrams /kilograms/day
(mg/kg/day) resulted in a no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) of 40 mg/kg/day based on loss of body weight and decreased
food consumption at 100 mg/kg/day.
3. A 3-week dermal study submitted by Monsanto with rabbits fed dosages of 0, 100, 400, and 1,200 mg/kg/day resulted
in a NOEL for systemic effects of 6,400 mg/kg/day based on mortality and decreased body weight at 1,200 mg/kg/day,
(HDT). The lowest effect level (LEL) for dermal irritation was 100 mg/kg lowest dose test (LDT). A NOEL for dermal irritation
was not established.
4. A 3-week dermal study submitted by ICI with rats fed dosages of 0.1, 1.0, 10, or 100 mg/kg/day resulted in minimal
to mild skin irritation after 21 days. Signs of systemic toxicity were not apparent at any level. Higher doses were
not possible because of severe dermal toxicity at higher doses.
5. In a 1-year feeding study submitted by Monsanto, with dogs fed dosages of 0, 4, 12, and 40 mg/kg/day, the NOEL was 12
mg/kg/day based on decreased body weight gains in males, decreased terminal body weight in females, testicular atrophy
with accompanying decreases in absolute and relative testicular weight, increase in relative liver weights in male
and females, and clinical chemistry changes at 40 mg/kg/day (HDT).
6. In a 1-year feeding study submitted by ICI, with dogs fed dosages of 0, 2, 10, and 50 mg/kg/day, the NOEL was 2 mg/kg/day
based on increased salivation, ornithine carbamyl transferase, and triglyceride values accompanied by decreased
blood glucose levels and liver glycogen levels at 10 mg/kg/day. Interstitial nephritis, tubular degeneration of
the testes and hypospermia were reported.
7. In a developmental study submitted by Monsanto, with rats fed dosages of 0, 50, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day, acetochlor
did not induce developmental toxicity in rats up to 400 mg/kg/day (HDT). The maternal NOEL was 200 mg/kg/day based
on matting and/or staining of the anogenital region, a decrease in mean maternal weight gain during the treatment
period, and in adjusted mean weight gain on gestation day 20 at 400 mg/kg/day (HDT).
8. In a developmental study submitted by ICI, with rats fed dosages of 0, 40, 150, and 600 mg/kg/day, the developmental
NOEL was 150 mg/kg/day based on increased resorptions, post-implantation loss, and decrease in mean fetal weight
at 600 mg/kg/day (HDT). The maternal toxicity for this study was 150 mg/kg/day based on animals sacrificed moribund,
clinical observations, and decreased body weight gain at 600 mg/kg/day (HDT).
9. In a developmental study submitted by Monsanto, with rabbits fed dosages of 0, 15, 50, and 190 mg/kg/day, (females)
acetochlor did not induce developmental toxicity in rabbits up to 190 mg/kg/day (HDT). The maternal toxicity NOEL
was 50 mg/kg/day based on loss of body weight during dosing at 190 mg/kg/day (HDT).
10. In a developmental study subbmitted by ICI, with rabbits fed dosages of 0, 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg/day, acetochlor
did not induce either maternal or developmental toxicity up to 300 mg/kg/day (HDT).
11. In a two-generation reproduction study submitted by Monsanto, with rats fed dosages of 0, 30.4, 74.1, and 324.5
mg/kg/day (males) or 0, 44.9, 130.1, and 441.5 mg/kg/day (females), the reproductive NOEL was 30.4 mg/kg/day for
males and 44.9 mg/kg/day for females, based on decreased body weight gain of F2b pups at 74.1 mg/kg/day for males and
130.1 mg/kg/day for females. A NOEL for systemic effects was not established.
12. In a two-generation reproduction study submitted by ICI, with rats fed dosages of 0, 1.6, 21, and 160 mg/kg/day,
the reproductive NOEL was 21 mg/kg/day based on significant reductions in pup weight at lactational day 21 and total
body weight gain during lactation at 160 mg/kg/day (HDT). The parental NOEL was 21 mg/kg/day based on reductions in
body weight, accompanied by slight reductions in food consumption and significant increases in relative organ weights
at 160 mg/kg/day (HDT).
13. In a chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study submitted by Monsanto with mice fed dosages of 0, 75, 225, and 750 mg/kg/day
carcinogenic effects noted included increased incidence of liver carcinomas in high-dose males, total lung tumors
in females at all dose levels, carcinomas of lungs in females fed 75 and 750 mg/kg/day, uterine histiocytic sarcomas
in females at all dose levels, and total benign ovarian tumors in mid-dose females. Other dose-related changes included
(1) increased mortality and decreased mean body weights in both high-dose males and females, (2) decreased red blood
cell count, hematocrit, and hemoglobin in high-dose females at terminal sacrifice, (3) increased white blood count
in high-dose males at terminal sacrifice, (4) increased platelet count in mid- and high-dose females at terminal
sacrifice, (5) increased mean liver weight and liver-to-body-weight ratios at study termination in all dose groups
of males and in high-dose females; increased absolute and relative kidney weights in all dose groups of males at termination;
increased absolute and relative adrenal weights in all groups of males and in high-dose females at study termination;
and (6) increased interstitial nephritis in high-dose males and females.
14. In a chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study submitted by ICI with mice fed dosages 0, 1.1, 11, and 116 mg/kg/day
in males and 0, 1.4, 13, and 135 mg/kg/day in females, carcinogenic effects noted included an increase in pulmonary
adenoma in both male and females at the high dose. Pulmonary tumors were confirmed as adenomas or carcinomas of the
lung parenchyma and were all of the alveolar type. The NOEL for systemic toxicity in females was 13 mg/kg/day based
on a significant increase in anterior polar vacuoles in the lens of the eye at 135 mg/kg/day. 
15. In a chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study submitted by Monsanto, with rats fed dosages of 0, 22, 69, and 250 mg/kg/day
(males) or 0, 30, 93, and 343 mg/kg/day (females), carcinogenic effects noted at 250 mg/kg/day in males and 343 mg/kg/day
in females included hepatocellular carcinoma in both sexes and thyroid follicular cell adenoma in males. Nasal papillary
adenomas were noted in male rats at 69 mg/kg/day and above and in females at 93 mg/kg/day. A NOEL for chronic effects
was not established.
16. In a repeat chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study submitted by Monsanto, in rats fed dosages of 0, 2, 10, and 50
mg/kg/day oncogenic effects noted at 50 mg/kg/day (HDT) included neoplastic nodules of the liver, follicular adenoma/cystadenoma
of the thyroids and papillary edema of the mucosa of the nose/turbinates in high dose animals. The NOEL for chronic
effects was 10 mg/kg/day based on decreased body weights and body weight gain in both sexes, high cholesterol levels
in males, increased absolute and relative kidney and liver weight in males, and increased testicular weights at 50
mg/kg/day (HDT).
17. In a 2-year chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study submitted by ICI, with rats fed dosages of 0, 0.8, 7.9, and 79.6
mg/kg/day, carcinogenic effects noted at 79.6 mg/kg/day (HDT) included a significant increase in nasal epithelial
adenomas and thyroid follicular cell adenomas in both sexes at 79.6 mg/kg/day. Also, at that dose nasal carcinoma
was present in two males and one female rat at this dose. Rare tumors in the form of benign chondroma of the femur and basal
cell tumor of the stomach were also observed at 79.6 mg/kg/day. The systemic NOEL was 7.9 mg/kg/day based on decreased
body weight gain, decreased food efficiency, increased organ to body weight ratios, increased plasma GGT and cholesterol
at 79.6 mg/kg/day (HDT). 
18. In mutagenicity testing, submitted by Monsanto, acetochlor was weakly positive in the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation
assay with and without activation in the mouse lymphoma assay. Acetochlor was negative in a DNA damage repair assay
in rat hepatocytes, a Salmonella assay, and two (2) 

in vivo

 chromosomal aberration studies.
19. In mutagenicity tests conducted by ICI, acetochlor induced a reproducible, positive, mutagenic response in
strain TA 1538 of Salmonella typhimurium with metabolic activation at 100 

u

g/plate (however, this was less than the 2 X background mutation, but was significant at p less than 0.05). Significant
increases in number of revertant colonies were not induced in strains TA 1535, TA 1537, TA98, and TA100. Acetochlor
was not clastogenic in a mouse micronucleus test at doses tested (898 and 1,436 mg/kg in males; 1,075 and 1,719 mg/kg
in females). Acetochlor was clastogenic in cultured human lymphocytes both in the presence and absence of 59 mix at
100 

u

g/ml, and in the absence of 59 mix at 50 

u

g/ml. Acetochlor induced a weak DNA repair (measured by UDS) in rat hepatocytes derived from animals exposed in vivo
at 2,000 mg/kg. In a structural chromosome aberration study, acetochlor at doses 1,000 and 2,000 mg/kg resulted in
reduced fertility during weeks 2, 3, and 4 of this study, as shown by reduced pregnancy incidence, decreased implants
per pregnancy incidence, increased preimplantion loss, and loss, and decreased time implant per pregnancy. Early
late intrauterine deaths were not affected in this study. There was positive evidence of mutagenicity at the mid-
and high-dose levels in this study. Available testing for acetochlor by Monsanto was referred to the Toxicology Branch
Peer Review Committed (PRC) for evaluation on September 12, 1985. Based on available information, the PRC classified
acetochlor as a B2 Carcinogen-Probable Human Carcinogen for the following reasons. 
1. Increased incidence in rats of hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes and thyroid follicular cell adenomas in
males.
2. An increased incidence in mice of hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes, lung carcinomas, uterine histiocytic
sarcomas, benign ovarian tumors, and kidney adenomas in females.
3. Positive mutagenic data in the CHO/HGPRT and mouse lymphoma assays.
4. Positive carcinogenicity data on structural analogues, alachlor, butachlor, and metolachlor.
After review of the repeat chronic feeding/oncogenicity study in rats and reevaluation of slides from the original
rat study, the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee met February 8, 1989, to discuss acetochlor with special
reference to its carcinogenic potential for causing nasal tumors. The PRC cited an increased incidence of nasal adenomas
in rats in (2) studies and a stronger analogy to alachlor which also causes tumors. The PRC reaffirmed the classification
of acetochlor as a B2 carcinogen (probable human carcinogen) and recommended that the quantitative risk assessment
(Q

*1

) be based on the data on nasal turbinate papillary adenomas in male and female rats.
Results of the peer reviews were referred to the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) on September 28, 1989. The SAP
agreed that acetochlor should be classified as a B2 carcinogen.
Available testing for acetochlor, submitted by ICI, was referred to the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee
on October 16, 1991, for discussion and evaluation of the weight-of-the-evidence on acetochlor with particular
reference to its carcinogenic potential. The PRC agreed that acetochlor should be classified as a Group B2_Probable
Human carcinogen. This was consistent with earlier decisions based on Monsanto data. The combined data strengthens
the Group B2 classification. The committee noted that the two data bases on acetochlor from two different registrants
were in close agreement with each other concerning the major tumor types. 
For the purpose of risk characterization for acetochlor, a low-dose extrapolation model applied to the experimental
animal tumor data was used for quantification of human risk (Q

1*

). For quantification, the Committee recommended separate calculations for both sexes of rats using the combined
incidence for nasal tumors for each sex. The separate values were then combined using appropriate statistical methods.
The RfD was based on a NOEL of 2.0 mg/kg/day established in a 1-year feeding study with dogs (ICI) and using an uncertainty
factor of 100 is calculated to be 0.02 mg/kg/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) for the general
U.S. population for corn uses is 1.7 X 10

-3

 mg/kg/day or 0.1% of the RfD. The TMRC for the soybean, sorghum and wheat rotational crop tolerance is 1.1 X 10

-4

 mg/kg/ kwt/day or 0.5% of the RfD. The total TMRC for all crop tolerances for the general U.S. population is 1.3 X 10

-4

 mg/kg kwt/day or 0.6% of the RfD. For the mostly highly exposed subgroup, nonnursing infants less than 1 year old, the
TMRC from the corn uses and rotational crop uses is 4.9 X 10

-5

 mg/kg kwt/day (0.2% of RfD) and 3.6 X 10

-4

 mg/kg kwt/day (2% of the RfD) respectively, for a total of 4.1 X 10

-4

 mg/kg kwt/day or 2% of the RfD. TMRC is calculated assuming that residues are at the established tolerances or at maximum
residue limits if the tolerances do not include all metabolites and that 100 percent of the corn crop is treated with
acetochlor and that the rotational crops would all be grown in fields where acetochlor-treated corn has been grown.
The TMRC discussed here include the commodities wheat grain and sorghum grain being proposed elsewhere in this issue
of the 

Federal Register

.
Based on a Q

*1

 of 0.017 mg/kg/day, the upper-bound lifetime cancer risk was calculated to be 2.9 X 10

-7

 for field corn tolerances and 1.9 X 10

-6

 for the rotational crop tolerances. The upper-bound carcinogenic risk from corn and the rotational crop tolerances
(including sorghum grain and wheat grain which are proposed elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

) was calculated to be 2.2 X 10

-6

.
Data lacking include an unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes (

in vivo

 exposure and 

in vitro

 culture) for metabolite 57, and a cytogenetics assay for aberrations using cultured human lymphocytes for metabolite
57. The petitioner has been notified of these deficiencies and has agreed to submit the studies.
There are currently no regulations against the registration of this chemical for use on corn. Even though acetochlor
is classified as a B2- carcinogen, EPA believes that the establishment of these tolerances will not pose an unreasonable
risk to humans as a result of dietary exposure. The establishment of these tolerances utilize less than 1% (0.6%) of
the RfD. The upper bound carcinogenic risk of 2.2 X 10

-6

 is in the range of 1 X 10

-6

, a level generally presumed to be no greater than a negligible risk. Morever, this estimate is considered worst-case,
and it probably overestimates the dietary cancer risk. It is unlikely that the following assumptions made by the Agency,
namely, (1) that residues will be at the establised tolerances levels, (2) that 100 percent of the corn crop will be
treated with acetochlor, and (3) that all rotational crops will be grown where acetochlor treated corn has been grown,
are actually the case.
The pesticide is useful for the purpose for which tolerances are sought. The nature of the residue is adequately understood
for the purposes of establishing these tolerances. Adequate analytical methodology (high-pressure liquid chromotography
(HPLC) using an oxidative coulometric electrochemical detector (OCED)is available for enforcement purposes.
Because of the long lead-time from establishing tolerances to publication, the enforcement methodology is being
made available in the interim to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement. Request by mail from Calvin Furlow,
Public Response and Program Tesources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs,
Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm.
1130A, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202. No detectable secondary residues are expected in milk;
eggs; meat, fat, or meat byproducts of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, sheep or poultry.
Based on the data and the information cited above, the Agency has determined that the establishment of tolerances
by amending 40 CFR part 180 will protect the public health. Therefore, EPA is establishing the tolerances as described
below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

, file written objections and/or request for a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket

the following; there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested.
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12866.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the
Administrator has determined that requlations establishing new tolerances or food additive regulations or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substanial number of small
entities. A certification statement of this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Ronnel; Revocation of Tolerances




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document revokes the tolerances for residues of the pesticide ronnel (

O,O

-dimethyl 

O

-dimethyl 

O

-(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl) phosphorothioate), including its 2,4,5-trichlorophenyl-containing metabolites,
in or on all raw agricultural commodities. EPA is taking this action because all registered uses of ronnel on these
commodities have been canceled; therefore, there is no need to maintain these tolerances. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of November 17, 1993 (58 FR 60573), EPA issued a rule that proposed to revoke tolerances established under section
408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a, for residues of the insecticide ronnel, including
its 2,4,5-trichlorophenyl-containing metabolites, in or on the commodities listed in 40 CFR 180.177. EPA proposed
this because the insecticide ronnel is no longer registered in the United States for any food or animal feed crops (the
sole manufacturer of ronnel, Dow Chemical Co., ceased all production of ronnel in 1979 and in 1986 voluntarily canceled
its ronnel technical registration), and a tolerance is generally not necessary for a pesticide chemical that is not
registered for a particular food use.



There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance revocation will protect
the public health. Therefore, the tolerance revocation is established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule establishes an exemption from the requirement of a pesticide tolerance for residues of the microbial pest
control agent 

Autographa californica

 nuclear polyhedrosis virus in or on all raw agricultural commodities. The product Gusano is an insecticidal virus
product containing the polyhedral occlusion bodies of the naturally occurring 

Autographa californica

 nuclear polyhedrosis virus (Family: Baculoviridae). This tolerance exemption was requested by Crop Genetics International.
This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of

 of June 10, 1992 (57 FR 24645), EPA issued a notice that it had received PP 2F4089 from Espro, Inc., requesting that 40
CFR part 180 be amended to establish a tolerance for acal (the company and product, renamed ``Gusano,'' have since
been acquired by Crop Genetics International, 10150 Old Columbia Rd., Columbia, MD 21046). Gusano contains the polyhedral
occlusion bodies of 

A. californica

 nuclear polyhedrosis virus and is proposed for use in or on all raw agricultural commodities when used to control the
alfalfa looper.


No comments were received in response to the notice of filing.


Residue Chemistry Data


Although Gusano bioinsecticide will be applied on a variety of vegetable and silvaculture crops at rates varying
from 5 to 50 grams per acre, residue chemistry data were not required. Such data were determined to be necessary only
if the submitted toxicology studies indicate that additional Tier II or III toxicology data would be required as specified
in 40 CFR 158.165(e). The submitted toxicology data for this use indicate that the product is of low mammalian toxicity;
therefore, Tier II or III data were not required. 


Toxicology Data


Toxicology data requirements in support of this exemption from the requirement of a tolerance were satisfied via
data waivers from the open scientific literature. These waivers include literature from an acute oral toxicity/pathogenicity
study in the rat, an acute pulmonary toxicity/pathogenicity study in the rat, an acute dermal toxicity study in the
rabbit, and a primary eye irritation study in the rabbit. Findings from the open scientific literature showed no toxic,
pathogenic, or adverse effects. 
Reference Dose (RfD) and maximum permissible intake (MPI) considerations are not relevant to this petition because
of the low toxicity and lack of pathogenicity or infectivity as reported in the open scientific literature.
Based on the information cited above, the Agency has determined that the potential acute toxicity/pathogenicity
of 

Autographa californica

 nuclear polyhedrosis virus is sufficiently low to support the proposed exemption from the requirement of a tolerance
on all raw agricultural commodities. Thus, a tolerance for the active ingredient 

Autographa californica

 nuclear polyhedrosis virus is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, 40 CFR part 180 is amended as
set forth below. 
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is closing the directed fishery for pollock by 
vessels catching pollock for processing by the inshore component 
in the Aleutian Islands subarea (AI) of the Bering Sea and 
Aleutian Islands (BSAI) management area. This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the pollock total allowable
catch (TAC) for the inshore component in this area.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. 



In accordance with  675.20(a)(7)(ii), the TAC of pollock for vessels catching pollock for processing by the
inshore component in the AI was established by the final 1994 initial groundfish specifications (59 FR 7656, February
16, 1994), as 16,838 metric tons (mt). 

The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with  675.20(a)(8),
that the pollock TAC for the inshore component in the AI soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional Director has
established a directed fishing allowance of 16,338 mt with consideration that 500 mt will be taken as incidental catch
in directed fishing for other species in the AI. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock by
operators of vessels catching pollock for processing by the inshore component in the AI, effective from 12 noon A.l.t.,
March 18, 1994, through 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. 

Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at  675.20(h).

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Corporation for National and Community Service (the 
Corporation) is issuing this final rule concerning the 
Corporation's grantmaking programs and various support and 
investment activities as authorized by the National and Community Service Act of 1990, as 
amended by the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 
(the Act). The activities and grants described in this rule are 
designed to help address the Nation
s education, public safety, human, and environmental needs through national and community 
service. This rule describes the different types of national and 
community service programs the Corporation may support, the 
funding available for those programs, the processes by which 
grants will be awarded, the training and technical support services 
available for program development and applications, and the 
Corporation's plans to invest in service infrastructure. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background Information 



The Corporation's Mission 



The Corporation's mission is to engage Americans of all ages 
and backgrounds in community-based National service. This 
service will address the Nation
s education, public safety, human, and environmental needs to achieve direct and 
demonstrable results. In doing so, the Corporation will foster 
civic responsibility, strengthen the ties that bind us together 
as a people, and provide educational opportunity for those who make a substantial commitment to service. 



The Purpose of This Rule 



The purpose of this rule is to establish policies and 
procedures for the activities that the Corporation will undertake 
to achieve the goals described above. This rule should serve as 
a guide to explain the eligibility requirements, application 
processes, selection criteria, program requirements, and other 
relevant information for individuals, programs, public and 
private nonprofits, institutions of higher education, States, 
Indian tribes, and other entities wishing to participate. 



Impact of Programs 



All programs under the National and Community Service Act 
have in common the goal of achieving three types of impact: 
``getting things done'' through direct and demonstrable service, 
strengthening communities, and developing the leadership and other skills 
of participants. All programs, whether they involve elementary 
school children or senior citizens, are equally able to achieve 
the goal of strengthening communities `` by involving people of different backgrounds together in a common effort,
by promoting 
civic responsibility so that every member of a community feels 
responsibility for its stewardship, and by breaking down barriers 
of mistrust and misunderstanding. The other two impacts are weighted differently for different program types based
on the age 
and experience of the participants. 

At the one extreme, the service-learning programs for 
school-age youth may indeed help to solve the pressing problems 
of communities, but their primary impact will be, and should be, on the lives of the participants. 
They should improve their educational motivation and achievement, 
citizenship skills, teamwork, and problem solving abilities. At 
the other extreme, for a professional corps of adults who are highly educated and highly skilled, the primary impact
must be on 
getting things done in communities. Given the higher costs of 
these programs and the advanced education level of the 
participants, it is imperative that the work they do be highly 
valued by communities and the Nation. Programs like youth corps, which lie 
somewhere in the middle in terms of age and education level of 
participants, should achieve a balance of impacts by getting 
things done and meeting the educational or training needs of 
participants. By keeping this calculus in mind, potential applicants 
can gauge the appropriate amount of program resources that should 
be dedicated to participant education, life skills training, and 
other types of participant support. 



Proposed Regulations 



On January 7, 1994, the Corporation for National and Community 
Service published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 1194) a proposed 
rule implementing the National and Community Service Act of 1990, 
as amended. In response to the proposed rule, the Corporation received over 280 comments from, among others, States,
Indian 
tribes, schools, institutions of higher education, 
community-based organizations, public and private nonprofit 
organizations, volunteer organizations, and individuals. 



Summary and Analysis of Public Comment 



Many comments suggested changes to Corporation policies that 
were discussed in the preamble to the Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking but that were not addressed by the rule itself. 
Although the Corporation is not required to discuss these comments here, they have been considered carefully and
some changes 
have been made. The most salient of these issues, along with 
updates to other non-regulatory Corporation policies, are 
discussed separately in the section on Preamble Issues. 

The Regulations Issues section summarizes substantive comments received on the 
regulatory provisions of the Corporation's proposed rule. Each 
issue that was raised in the comments is identified and 
discussed, and, where appropriate, any changes to the regulations 
are noted with regulatory citations. 

Finally, the Corporation received a significant number of 
comments that suggested changes to regulatory provisions that 
reflect statutory requirements. None of these is discussed here. 
Also not discussed are any technical, non-policy changes that were made either in response to comments or as a result
of internal review.

(A) Comments on Non-Regulatory Corporation Policies



Application Deadlines and Availability



A number of commenters requested that the Corporation move back the deadlines for its various applications. The Corporation
has done so. The new deadlines for the announced competitions are as follows (please note that the applications must
be received by the Corporation by 6 p.m. Eastern time of the announced due dates):







Applications may be obtained by writing the Corporation at 1100 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20525; by sending
a fascimile request to (202) 606-4871; or by calling (202) 606-4949. Applications are also available
on Internet. To retrieve applications via Internet, please send a blank electronic message to: cncs@ace.esusda.gov.
There should be no text in the body of the message. An automatic response will be sent back with information on how to
retrieve the applications through electronic mail, gopher and anonymous file transfer protocol (ftp).

Since most local Americorps applicants (other than professional corps) will be applying through their respective
States, they should contact their State Commissions to obtain applications.



National Priorities

The statute and regulations give the Corporation the authority to establish priorities governing the competitive
distribution of funds_both directly and through the States. The Corporation received a number of comments suggesting
changes to and clarifications of both the applicability and content of the national priorities. (Programs included
in the State formula application are not governed by these priorities but rather by priorities established by the
State consistent with part 2513 of this rule.) The national priorities, which have been slightly revised, are as follows:




Education. 

School Readiness: Furthering early childhood development; and 

School Success: Improving the educational achievement of school-age youth and adults who lack basic academic skills.




Public safety. 

Crime Prevention: Reducing the incidence of violence; and 

Crime Control: Improving criminal justice services, law enforcement, and victim services. 



Human needs. 

Health: Providing independent living assistance and home- and community-based health care; and 

Home: Rebuilding neighborhoods and helping people who are homeless or hungry. 



Environment. 

Neighborhood Environment: Reducing community environmental hazards; and 

Natural Environment: Conserving, restoring, and sustaining natural habitats. 

Two changes were made to the priorities. Within the education priority, the former priority, ``School success: improving
the educational achievement of school-age children,'' was changed to ``School success: improving the educational
achievement of school-age youth and adults who lack basic academic skills.'' Within the human needs priority, ``Home:
Rebuilding neighborhoods and helping people who are homeless,'' was changed to ``Home: Rebuilding neighborhoods
and helping people who are homeless or hungry.'' This amendment was made to clarify that, as commenters suggested,
programs designed to provide basic academic skills to adults and hunger programs are included. 

There were many suggestions for further changes to the priorities, including the following: within Education, add
priorities for English as a Second Language, school-to-work transition, and programs targeting out-of-school
youth; within Public Safety, add programs that include as participants former gang members and other troubled youth,
as well as fire-safety programs; within Environment, there were suggestions for specific language changes. Similarly,
there were suggestions for additional priority categories: One commenter suggested adding programs that target
individuals with disabilities, and another suggested making economic development a national priority. 

After careful consideration, the Corporation did not make additional changes to the national priorities. Most suggested
changes would have narrowed the priorities by delineating subcategories of programs that already fit under the priorities
as drafted. For example, programs that include gang members as participants might apply under the education priority
as programs that prepare youth for school success, under the public safety priority as programs that reduce violence,
or, depending on the activities of the participants, under the human needs or environmental priorities. Indeed,
quality programs often involve an holistic approach to meeting local needs and thus often address more than one national
priority. The priorities are designed to allow programs maximum flexibility to respond to unique local needs but,
concomitantly, to focus the investment of limited Corporation funds to achieve demonstrable impact. To further
narrow the priorities would undermine these objectives. Programs should be aware that the priorities are intended
to provide parameters within which to focus their efforts; more specific activities within these parameters are
allowable. 

Several commenters expressed concern about whether every participant or every project in a given program had to address
one or more of the priority areas in order for the program as a whole to qualify. Every project and every participant
in a program do not have to be working in a priority area in order for the program to be considered to meet a national priority;
rather, the program as a whole must substantially address one or more priority areas. The Corporation intentionally
has not attempted to quantify the definition of ``substantially address.'' Instead, the Corporation will make this
judgment on a case-by-case basis to allow for flexibility. 



AmeriCorps State Applications 



The Corporation has changed the State AmeriCorps application process. The Corporation's previous plan considered
the formula and competitive components of a State's application to be discrete. Programs had to be placed in one component
or the other, and States did not have the flexibility to rearrange the components of their applications once submitted.


There were a number of reasons behind this policy. First, it is the Corporation's policy to distribute competitive
funds only to States that receive their formula allocations; this suggests evaluating the formula component of the
applications prior to the competitive component. Second, programs should know up front which component of the State
application they are in to be able to estimate accurately their chances of receiving funding. Third, because State
priorities may differ from national priorities, some programs may not be eligible for both formula and competitive
funding. Fourth, it gives autonomy to the States, allowing them to decide where to place programs. Finally, from a
logistical standpoint, the review process is kept relatively simple by keeping the two components of the State application
separate; therefore, the Corporation would be able to finish the reviews quickly and meet its goal of distributing
funds to programs in the field on a timely basis. 

The major drawback of this policy is that it unnecessarily would require States to make difficult decisions that,
ultimately, may not lead to the best programs being funded. Specifically, a State would have to decide_for every program
for which it wants to seek funding_whether that program should go into the formula or competitive component of its
application. A State would have to decide whether to take a risk and put its best programs into the competitive pool,
or to play it safe and place those programs in the formula portion of its application. If the State gambled, put its best
programs in the competition, and those programs did not receive funding, then the best programs in that State would
go unfunded. That is not a desirable outcome either for the States or for the Corporation.

For the above reasons, the Corporation has revised the application process so that States will have the opportunity
to replace programs included in the formula portion of their application with programs that were unsuccessful in
obtaining competitive funding. The application and simultaneous review processes will be as follows: (a) States
will submit applications consisting of the State Plan, formula programs, and, at the State's discretion, competitive
programs and a request for program development assistance; 

(b) If the State Plan is approved, and if a State's formula programs meet a minimum quality threshold, that State's
competitive programs will be entered into the State competition;






(c) Through a peer and staff review process, the competitive programs will be selected; 

(d) States will be notified of which programs were selected in the competition and given an opportunity to revise their
formula applications to include programs that were not selected in the competition. (The Corporation will be neutral
here_neither encouraging nor discouraging States to put rejected competitive programs into the revised formula
list. This is the States' choice completely, although at the request of the States the Corporation may provide review
forms, etc. which may aid States in assessing the quality of those programs); and 

(e) The formula portions of the State applications will receive final approval from the Corporation. 

It is the Corporation's view that this revision to the State application process will leave most decisions in the hands
of the States, allow for the best programs to be funded, and still get programs up and running quickly. 



Eligibility of U.S. Territories for State Competitive Funds 



At the request of one commenter, the regulations ( 2521.30) have been amended to clarify that U.S. Territories
are eligible to apply for State Competitive funds and educational awards if they receive their formula allotments.
Each eligible Territory may include up to three programs in its application for State competitive funds. 



Timeline 



One commenter objected to the timelines established for the completion of the State Plan and State applications.
In particular, the commenter stated that the tight timelines would make it difficult to coordinate State grant applications
with the State Plan. Several commenters noted that the timing of notification of funding will make it difficult to
hire staff, which usually happens in the spring. 

The Corporation agrees that the timeline is very tight and regrets any inconveniences it will cause. In future years,
programs will have significantly longer to prepare applications. However, in fiscal year 1994, the current timeline
is necessary in order for Corporation-funded programs to be up and running by the Fall. 



Starting Dates and Attrition Policies 



One commenter suggested that all participants should not be required to start at the same time and that vacancies be
filled on a rolling basis. Another commenter suggested the option of a mid-year starting date to fill vacant positions.


The regulations allow for policies to change over time if experience demands a revision. The current policy allows
programs to begin terms of service in June, September or January. All participants in a program need not start simultaneously_thus
one class could serve September-September, another January-January, thereby allowing the option of a mid-year
starting date to fill vacancies. In addition, if a program can demonstrate a compelling reason for alternative starting
dates, including the need for rolling admissions, the Corporation may waive this requirement. 



Allocation of Educational Awards Within Programs

One commenter expressed concern that not treating all participants the same in terms of educational awards might
be a disadvantage in the selection process. The commenter suggested that it should not be a selection criterion.

Because of the limited amount of funding available for program assistance, the Corporation anticipates that in some
cases programs (especially existing programs) may not apply for or receive adequate support for all participants
enrolled in the program, and the potential thus may arise for some participants (who are serving in approved AmeriCorps
positions) to receive AmeriCorps educational awards while other similar participants do not. The Corporation is
therefore requiring every applicant to describe the rationale for its distribution of educational awards to program
participants in those cases where distinctions among participants are necessary. In general, this distribution
should treat equally all participants doing the same or essentially similar work. This reflects a matter of principle
as well as a pragmatic concern for the equal treatment of participants within a single program.

The Corporation recognizes that equal treatment may not be feasible or desirable in some instances. For example,
an intergenerational program or a program with a specialized component or division assigned special projects may
make distinctions among participants that justify the provision of educational awards to some but not to others.
An example of the latter of these is a corps where team leaders receive AmeriCorps education awards whereas regular
corps participants do not. Similarly, a program may choose to offer alternative post-service benefits to participants
in lieu of the AmeriCorps educational awards provided by the Corporation. AmeriCorps programs are strongly encouraged
to offer alternative post-service benefits from non-Corporation funds to participants who will not receive AmeriCorps
educational awards. The Corporation will evaluate on a case-by-case basis the rationales of programs that do not
plan to provide all participants with educational awards. However, the Corporation will not approve rationales
based solely on a determination of economic need of participants.

The existence of a reasonable method of allocating educational awards will still be a selection criterion; however,
in cases where programs have legitimate reasons for not offering educational awards to all participants, those programs
will not be disadvantaged in any way in the selection process.



AmeriCorps Priorities for Existing Grantees and for Programs Targeting Participants with College Experience



Some commenters suggested that programs involving college-educated participants should not be given priority
for funding in the national direct competition.

Although current grantees of the Commission on National and Community Service_which have a high percentage of participants
without college experience_are not guaranteed funding, they receive a priority for funding. The special consideration
for programs involving individuals with college experience was provided in order to achieve the overall goal of diversity
across programs based on many factors. An alternative would be to drop both the priority for existing grantees and
the special consideration for programs involving individuals with college experience. However, given the need
to include a base of experienced programs and the advisability of completing the third year of programs that received
three-year grants from the Commission, the applications retain the first alternative.

Potential applicants should be aware that special consideration is not the same as an absolute preference. Nor does
it mean that every participant must be college-educated in order for a program to receive special consideration,
or that no programs involving youth who have not attended college will be funded in the national direct competition.
Rather, the purpose of the special consideration is to ensure that participants with and without college experience
are both represented in National service.



Small State Priority in the AmeriCorps State Competition



Several commenters requested that the regulations be revised to increase from 20 to 50 both the recommended minimum
number of participants in a program and the priority for small states in the State competition.

After careful consideration, the Corporation has not changed these policies. Because there are many high-quality
programs with between 20 and 50 participants, and because the Corporation does not want to send the message that these
programs should consider expanding to 50 participants, the recommended minimum size of a program has not been raised
to 50. Similarly, the Corporation chose not to raise the small State priority to 50 participants because it would have
resulted in approximately half the States receiving the priority. States with widely disparate populations thus
would be treated equally. This is not only unfair to the larger of these States but undermines Congress' intent of distributing
these AmeriCorps funds in proportion to population.



Relocation Expenses



In the preamble to the January 7 notice of proposed rulemaking, the Corporation stated that it would pay for the relocation
expenses of participants who are recruited by the Corporation or the State Commissions and need to move in order to
participate. One commenter argued that this is a poor use of scarce resources.

The Corporation has revised this policy such that the Corporation will only pay reasonable relocation expenses in
instances where participants would not be able to participate without this support.



(B) New and Updated AmeriCorps Tables



Maximum Number of Programs in the AmeriCorps Competitive State Applications



One commenter suggested that the Corporation revisit whether any restrictions should be placed on how many AmeriCorps
programs may be submitted in a State competitive application. The Corporation has limited the number of programs
a State may include in its application for competitive funding to three plus an additional program for each full percentage
point of the total State population (rounded to the nearest full percentage point) that State contains.

The Corporation is not changing this policy for a number of reasons. First, from a purely pragmatic standpoint, some
sort of limitation must be placed on the overall number of applications. If the Corporation is inundated with applications
it will be difficult to ensure that each application is properly reviewed. Second, the Corporation wants to encourage
States to submit only their very best programs. Finally, it is likely that with the restriction now in place only about
one in five programs submitted will actually be funded. It would be unfair to programs to allow a significantly larger
number of submissions.

Formula Allocation of AmeriCorps Program Funds and Educational Awards to Territories


In fiscal year 1994, the Corporation has set aside $1,550,000 and up to 112 educational awards to be distributed to
U.S. Territories on a formula basis. The amount of a Territory's program funds allocation is determined by multiplying
the total amount of money available by the ratio of that Territory's population to the population of all the Territories.
(Population figures are taken from the 1990 Census, the most recent official figures available.) The maximum number
of educational awards for which a Territory may apply is determined by dividing that Territory's formula funds allocation
by the expected average Federal share of program costs per participant ($13,800).




Competitive Distribution of AmeriCorps Program Funds and Educational Awards to Indian Tribes


The Corporation has set aside $1,550,000 and up to 112 educational awards for competitive distribution to Indian
tribes.


II. Regulations Issues


General Comments


(1) 

Multiple applications. 

Several commenters asked for clarification of the multiple applications rule.
This rule states that the Corporation will reject any application for a project if an application requesting funding
for that project is already pending before the Corporation. In other words, a program can only submit one application
at a time for Corporation funds (either directly or indirectly) for a given project.
Confusion sometimes arises over the difference between a program and a project. For the Corporation's purposes,
a program recruits and selects participants, trains them, and places them in projects; a project is a specific set
of related activities carried out by a program. A program may conduct or undertake more than one project and receive
Corporation funding from different pools for those projects. A program is allowed, for example, to propose one project
in a national direct application and another project in a State formula application. However, an applicant may not
propose the same project for funding in more than one application at the same time. Thus if a program submits an application
for a project in the national direct competition, that project may not also be included in a State application. (Once
an applicant is notified that a proposal has been rejected, however, the applicant is free, if time permits, to resubmit
the proposal in a different Corporation grant competition.)




Change:   2516.730, 2517.730, 2519.730 and 2522.320 have been revised.




(2) 

Reinventing government. 

One commenter urged the Corporation to include regulatory provisions that would encourage States to minimize administrative
burdens on grantees by streamlining reimbursement and contracting procedures, as well as by providing cash advances
to grantees when possible.
The Corporation will issue separate administrative regulations that will require States and other grantmaking
entities receiving grants from the Corporation to provide cash advances and prompt expense reimbursements to subgrantees.
Contracting procedures for supplies and services are governed primarily by State regulations and OMB Circulars
102 and 110.


Part 2510_Overall Purposes and Definitions




Definition of administrative costs ( 2510.20). 

A number of commenters requested clarification of and suggested changes for the definition of administrative costs.
One commenter stated that insurance costs should not count as administrative costs in certain instances; another
argued that costs such as rent, utilities, travel, supplies, etc. should be allocated through an approved joint cost
allocation plan; another stated that indirect costs that directly support programs should not be treated as administrative
costs.
The Corporation agrees that the definition of administrative costs was not sufficiently clear and it has been rewritten
in response to these comments.
Change:  2510.20 has been revised.


Part 2513_State Plan


(1) 

Coordination. 

Some commenters recommended including a requirement that States include in their State Plans a description of how
their activities will be coordinated with those of the State agency responsible for administering the Community
Service Block Grant Act and with other State agencies.
The Corporation encourages each State to develop a truly comprehensive and coordinated national and community service
effort. However, the Corporation declines to require such coordination.
(2) 

Consideration of State Plan. 

One commenter requested that the Corporation state in the regulations what weight the State Plan will have in the evaluation
of State applications.
The Corporation agrees that this is an important piece of information for States as they put together applications.
The applications will indicate the extent to which the State Plan will be considered. However, because the Corporation
wishes to maintain flexibility on this issue, it has not been incorporated into the regulations.
(3) 

Consolidation. 

One commenter suggested consolidating the SEA and State Commission plans into one.
Again, the Corporation encourages coordination of efforts, and a consolidated plan perhaps would be a good means
for a State to accomplish this. However, due to the separation between State Education Departments and other agencies
in many States, this will not be established as a requirement.

Parts 2515-2517_K-12 Learn and Serve Programs



(1) 

Training investment

. Several commenters recommended that the Corporation require 5-10% of a program's Learn and Serve grant to
be spent on training.

The Corporation agrees that adequate training_for both staff and participants_is a critical component of any high-quality
program. In general, States and Indian tribes that receive K-12 school-based grants must spend a total of between
10% and 15% of those funds on training and capacity building. Moreover, in order to receive a grant, a program will have
to demonstrate the existence of an appropriate training program. Because the training and capacity-building needs
of the various other entities eligible to apply for school and community-based Learn and Serve America grants vary
widely, the Corporation is not setting regulatory guidelines on what percentage of those grants must be spent on training
and capacity building. However, the Corporation reserves the right to set such guidelines in the applications.

(2) 

Partnerships

. Several commenters suggested that the definition of ``partnership'' be revised to require that the written agreement
specify the partnership's goals and activities, as well as the responsibilities of each partner. The Corporation
has made this change. Change:  2510.20 has been revised. (3) 

Coordination

. Some commenters suggested that the meaning of coordination should be clarified so that nonprofits and grant-making
entities are required to communicate with State Commissions, but not to receive their approval to go ahead with the
program. Coordination is not a program requirement for K-12 programs. Rather, programs must describe in their
applications the extent to which they have coordinated with State Commissions. The regulations have been revised
to indicate that while coordination should include meeting and consulting with State Commissions, it does not imply
that those State Commissions have the power to approve or disapprove a program.

Change:   2516.410(a)(1) and 2517.400(a)(3) have been revised.

(4) 

Preselection of community-based programs

. One commenter objected to the regulatory requirements for pre-selection of programs ( 2517.400). Some commenters
noted that the competitive process is likely to be circumvented if the Corporation requires preselection because
of the tightness of the timeline.

The regulations have been revised to not require preselection. Under the final regulations, State Commissions and
grantmaking entities applying for Learn and Serve America community-based service-learning grants are not required
to preselect their proposed subgrantees. However, State Commissions and grantmaking entities are expected to describe
in detail the types of models that would be funded through grants to local partnerships.

Change:  2517.400 has been revised.

(5) 

Components of School-based application

. Several commenters recommended that the regulations be revised to more specifically identify the application
requirements and selection criteria. For example, one commenter suggested that the application described in  2516.400(a)
include descriptions of the following items: The relationship between the program goals and strategic plans of the
State Plan and SEA Plan; the relationship of the SEA Plan and the strategic goals of the SEA's systemic education reform
efforts; the relationship of the SEA Plan and the program development plan of the State Commission's K-12 Community-based
program; and the relationship of the SEA plan and specific systemic reform and school improvement efforts in the State
or among targeted LEAs. The same commenter suggested that under  2516.410(c) applicants be required to ensure
that a mechanism is provided by which school and community needs will guide the integration of service-learning into
existing curriculum in order to meet those needs. Another commenter recommended a number of additions to  2516.500.

Many of these recommendations are in fact incorporated into the applications; however, in order to maintain flexibility
in the application and selection process, the Corporation has elected not to include them in the regulations.

(6) 

Educational award eligibility

. One commenter recommended including a provision for the K-12 Learn and Serve programs analogous to the higher
education provision in  2519.310 which states that, in general, participants are not eligible to receive educational
awards.

This recommendation has been adopted.

Change: a  2516.320 has been added to the regulations.

(7) 

Monitoring and evaluation

. Several commenters suggested additions to and requested clarification of the monitoring and evaluation   2516.800-850.

In response, the Corporation has made three changes: First, because monitoring activities go beyond those included
in the proposed sections on ``monitoring and Evaluation,'' the word monitoring has been removed from Subparts E and
H. The Corporation now refers to monitoring functions that fall within the purview of evaluation as internal evaluation.
Second, the Corporation has added the requirement for programs, States and grantmaking entities to cooperate fully
with all Corporation evaluation activities. Third, the Corporation has added the requirement for the Corporation
to ``study the extent to which national service models enable participants to afford post-secondary education with
fewer student loans'' when evaluating the overall success of AmeriCorps.

Change:   2516.800-850 have been revised.



Part 2519_Higher Education Learn and Serve Programs



(1) 

Application review.

 One commenter suggested that the review process in  2519.500 be more specific and include peer review, rankings
and reviewer comments, and that there be a written protocol for the CEO to cover situations where a highly ranked application
is not funded.

These are good ideas, and many of them may in fact be included in the review process. Specifically, in fiscal year 1994
programs will definitely be subject to peer review. However, since the Corporation may want to improve the review
process from year to year, these provisions are not incorporated into the regulations.

(2) 

Where can higher education programs operate?

 One 
commenter expressed concern that the neighboring communities 
language in 2519.100 would not allow a program to operate across 
State lines. 
The Corporation's intent was that higher education programs should address needs in the communities where 
the programs operate, regardless of where the institution of 
higher education is located. The regulations have been revised 
to make this clear. 
Change:  2519.100 has been revised. 


Parts 2520-2524_AmeriCorps 


(1) 

Living Allowance Match

. Under the proposed regulations, 
programs receiving educational awards only grants were exempt 
from the living allowance requirement. One commenter suggested 
that they should not be, arguing that it would make it more difficult for low-income individuals to participate. 
The Corporation has revised its regulations to not allow 
this exemption. 
Change:  2522.240 has been revised. 
Another commenter requested that grantees be able to provide 
their 15% match for living allowances on an in-kind basis. 
In general, the Corporation wants to ensure that every 
AmeriCorps participant receives a living allowance sufficient to 
meet reasonable expenses while participating. By definition, a 
living allowance match must be in cash. However, in certain instances where a program has 
received a waiver from providing the minimum living allowance, 
the Corporation will consider on a case-by-case basis waiving or 
reducing the matching requirement. For example, a program that 
houses its participants may not count that housing as an in-kind 
match, but it may be eligible to apply to have the 15% matching 
requirement waived or reduced. 
Change: A section (5)(iii), allowing for waivers of the 15% 
matching requirement, has been added to  2522.240(b). 
(2) 

Preselection of programs

. Commenters objected to the 
requirement that applicants for AmeriCorps preselect and 
specifically identify in their applications the subgrantees they 
will fund. Some commenters argued that because of the tightness of the timeline, the competitive process is likely
to be 
circumvented if preselection is required. 
Although the Corporation appreciates the difficulties 
preselection raises in light of the timeline, for both legal and 
policy reasons this requirement has not been changed. The statute requires a State applicant 
to describe the ``jobs or positions into which participants will 
be placed'' (section 130(c)(1)). It is the Corporation's view that such 
a description would be inadequate without a corresponding description of the programs in which those jobs or positions
would 
be located. Moreover, section 130(b)(2) of the statute requires 
``description of the process and criteria by which the programs 
were selected.'' From a policy standpoint, preselection is required in order to ensure that the Corporation funds
only 
high-quality programs. 
(3) 

Diversity

. Several commenters recommended modifications 
to the participant diversity provisions contained in  2522.100. 
One commenter stated that programs that are unable to achieve racial and gender diversity should not receive Federal

funds. Conversely, other commenters expressed concern that the 
racial diversity requirement may exclude eligibility minority 
agencies that would have predominantly minority participants. A number of commenters suggested that the Corporation
require 
diversity of program staff and include that as an evaluation 
criterion. One commenter suggested that the Corporation 
encourage programs to engage in joint activities with 
organizations involving participants of different backgrounds to enhance 
community-building. 
The Corporation declines to make the achievement of 
diversity a requirement or to establish regulatory exceptions to 
the mandate that every program seek diversity. The Corporation, 
in establishing the requirement that every program actively seek to 
be diverse in a number of important areas, attempted to strike a 
balance between competing concerns. On the one hand, diverse 
programs will help strengthen communities. On the other hand, there are some very good programs that, for legitimate
substantive 
reasons, will not to be able to achieve diversity in one or more 
ways. The requirement, as written, will lead to diverse programs 
except in cases where diversity does not make sense or is not attainable (e.g., a professional corps program requiring

specific skills or education should not be required to include as 
participants individuals who do not have such skills or 
education). 
The Corporation agrees with the suggestion that programs 
also should seek actively to establish a diverse staff. In many 
cases where a program's staff is very small, it may not always be 
possible to have a staff that is diverse in all ways. Within 
these constraints, however, programs should seek to establish a 
staff that is as diverse as possible. 
Finally, the Corporation agrees that_especially for 
programs that lack diversity in one or more ways_it is a good 
idea for programs to engage in joint activities with 
organizations involving participants of different backgrounds to help build communities; programs are encouraged

to do so where possible. 
Change:  2522.100(f) has been modified to include staff 
diversity. 
(4) 

50% rule

. One commenter recommended that the 
Corporation drop the waiver provision from the requirement that at least 50% of funds going to each State go to 
high-need areas. ( 2521.30(b)(3)(iii)) 
In principle, the Corporation believes strongly that each 
State should in fact do everything possible to comply with the 
50% requirement. Thus in order to attain a waiver from this provision, a State will have to 
demonstrate in an extremely compelling manner not only that there 
are not enough viable high-quality programs operating in areas of 
need within the State to meet the 50% requirement, but that it has made a good-faith effort to locate such programs.
Finally, 
no waivers will be granted to individual States if it would 
necessitate not complying with the 50% rule in the aggregate. 
The Corporation is statutorily required to ensure that a 
minimum of 50% of the total funds going to States go to high-need areas. 
And although the Corporation is committed to meeting this 
requirement in the aggregate, it may not always be possible to 
meet the requirement on a State-by-State basis. For example, the 
Corporation's review process may result in the selection in a given 
State of a high-quality program that does not operate in an area 
of need. If there were not other high-quality programs within 
that State that did operate in high-need areas, without the 
waiver provision the Corporation would be unable to fund the 
high-quality program. For this reason, the waiver provision has 
been retained. 
(5) 

Participant eligibility

. (2522.200(b)) One commenter 
stated that the regulations state that a participant must have a high-school diploma to participate, whereas in fact
a diploma 
is only required to receive the educational award. 
This section has not been changed. The regulations state 
that in order to participate an individual must either have a 
high school diploma or its equivalent, commit to obtaining one, or be deemed 
unable to obtain one. 
(6) 

National Leadership Pool and Recruitment

. 
(2522.210(b)(1)(c)) The Corporation received a number of comments 
on the national leadership pool and recruitment requirements. One commenter suggested that the regulations allow
anyone 
recruited to the national leadership pool to be placed back into 
his or her original program. The same commenter argued that 
programs should not be required to accept national leadership 
pool participants; instead, the Corporation should operate a pilot 
leadership program. Other commenters suggested that the 
 2522.100 requirement that AmeriCorps programs agree to select a 
certain percentage of participants from the national and state 
recruiting pools be eliminated. 
In order to maintain regulatory flexibility, these 
requirements have not been amended. To the extent that these 
comments are incorporated into Corporation policy it will not be 
done in regulations but rather in application materials and other guidelines. However, two items should be noted:
(a) 
Although programs must agree to accept a certain percentage of 
nationally recruited participants, the Corporation may not 
require every program to do so, and will likely consider 
exceptions on a case-by-case basis; and (b) programs will not be required to 
accept leadership pool participants. 
(7) 

Child Care

. (2522.250(a)) One commenter argued that 
child care benefits should go to prospective participants who 
have undependable child care as well as to participants who don't have child care at all.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940323-0-00041 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940323-0-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This regulation has not been changed; as written, it closely 
tracks the statute. Programs will provide child care assistance 
to participants who need it in order to participate; they will 
determine on a case-by-case basis whether individuals are eligible. A 
prospective participant with extremely undependable child care 
could certainly argue that he or she would not be able to 
participate without child care benefits. 

(8) 

Health Care. 

(2522.250(b)) One commenter stated that the regulations should clarify that 
AmeriCorps participants should not be asked to pay premiums or 
deductibles, that the health care plan should include preventive 
and pregnancy care, as well as eye and dental care and workers compensation, and that there should be a 1-2 month
delay in 
eligibility, since attrition is highest during this period. 

The Corporation will issue written guidelines setting forth 
the required specifications of the AmeriCorps health care 
package. These comments will be taken into consideration in the development of 
policies at that time. In addition, the health care section of 
the regulations has been rewritten to provide greater clarity. 

Change:  2522.250 has been revised. 

(9) 

State Priorities. 

(2522.410(b)(1)(i)) One commenter argued that States should be encouraged to adopt priorities that fit within the
national 
priorities. The commenter felt that this would facilitate a comprehensive, focused national service effort. 

The Corporation agrees that requiring States to adopt national priorities might create a more focused national effort,
but this change was not made 
because the Corporation strongly believes that it was Congress' intent to maintain a large degree of State autonomy
with formula funds. States are in the best position to judge which needs are most pressing within a State and thus what
the State priorities should be. 

(10) 

Program types. 

One commenter recommended for inclusion in the regulations additional provisions relating to the needs of inner
cities. Specifically, the commenter recommended adding an example to  2522.110(b)(1) of a community service
program in a high unemployment, high need urban area. 
The commenter also suggested that the provision describing a program for economically disadvantaged individuals
( 2522.110(b)(3)) be expanded to add a requirement that it meet the employment needs of low income people and
the business development needs of inner city neighborhoods. 

These changes have not been made. The program types included in the regulations are all taken directly from the statute.
More importantly, as discussed in the January 7 preamble, a program does not necessarily have to be listed as a program
type in  2522.110 in order to receive a grant. The 
Corporation has designated any program that meets the minimum program requirements listed in  2522.100 as
eligible to apply for a grant. 

(11) 

Higher education cap. 

Several commenters argued that the regulations should restrict to 10% the percentage of a State's educational award
formula allotment that institutions of higher education may receive. 

The Corporation declines to regulate on this issue. Which programs are proposed for funding in the State formula allotment,
and how any available educational awards are distributed among them, is up to the States. 

(12) 

Ineligible service activities. 

( 2520.30) A number of commenters suggested that the Corporation revise the treatment of provisions prohibiting
lobbying by participants in the course of their service. A number of commenters argued that the list of prohibited
activities was too large and went beyond the statute. Some commenters stated that the proposed regulations would
have an overly restrictive impact on programs and participants. 

The Corporation believes the service activity restrictions will not have a 
negative impact on programs or participants and that the list will keep programs focused on service that has direct
and demonstrable results. However, the Corporation does not intend to limit the right of individuals to engage in
any of the prohibited activities voluntarily and on their own time. Accordingly, the regulations have been amended.


Change:  2520.30 has been revised. 

(13) 

Selection criteria. 

One commenter suggested rewriting the AmeriCorps selection criteria so that replicability and sustainability
are more closely linked with innovation, rather than listing innovation, replicability and sustainability as separate
criteria. Another commenter suggested adding a selection criterion which would consider the extent to which programs
promote diversity, community-building and citizenship. 

The regulatory selection criteria have been drafted broadly to allow for flexibility from year to year and therefore
are not being changed. The fiscal year 1994 selection criteria contained in the applications will stress the extent
to which programs are likely to achieve the three desired impacts: ``getting things done,'' improving the lives of
participants, and strengthening the ties that bind communities together. 

(14) 

Federal agency eligibility. 

One commenter requested 
clarification in  2523.20 on whether ``cabinet-level department'' would include an executive agency. 

Executive agencies are eligible. The regulations have been revised, replacing ``cabinet-level department'' with
``Executive Branch Agency or 
Department.'' 

Change:  2523.20 has been amended. 

(15) 

Approved partnerships. 

One commenter asked for 
clarification of the term ``approved partnership or consortium'' as 
used in  2523.60. Specifically, the commenter asked for an explanation of how a partnership or consortium is
approved. 

Partnerships will be approved by the Corporation as part of the application process. 

Change:  2523.60 has been amended. 

(16) 

Program requirements addition. 

( 2522.100) One commenter suggested that the Corporation add a requirement that AmeriCorps programs provide
career counseling to participants. 

The Corporation did not add this as a program requirement 
because programs are already required under  2522.100(k)(1) to provide support services to participants
who are making the transition to careers. 

(17) 

National nonprofit eligibility. 

One commenter 
requested clarification of the eligibility of national nonprofit 
organizations to apply for funding through subgrants, as well as directly from the Corporation.

<TEXT>
 

Because national nonprofits are by definition nonprofit organizations, they are eligible to apply as subgrantees
to States, Federal agencies, and other grantmaking organizations. In addition, in fiscal year 1994 they are eligible
to apply for national direct funding. 

(18) 

Operating grant definition. 

One commenter noted that the description of operating grants in  2521.20 of the regulations refers only to new
or expanded programs. The commenter suggested adding on-going support for existing high-quality programs. 

The Corporation agrees that the statute authorizes on-going support to operate programs. 

Change:  2521.20 has been revised. 

(19) 

National direct coordination. 

Several commenters were concerned that the requirement that programs coordinate with the State commissions places
too much power in the State Commissions. One commenter suggested that the regulations be revised to require national
program applicants to meet and consult with State Commissions and to encourage, but not require, coordination of
their efforts. 

The Corporation did not intend the coordination requirement to require State Commission approval. The regulations
have been revised to clarify the extent of coordination that is required. 

Change:  2522.100 has been revised. 

(20) 

Dissemination of information. 

( 2522.210) The regulations list a number of entities through which the Corporation will disseminate information
regarding available AmeriCorps positions. Several commenters suggested adding community-based organizations
to this list. 

This change has been made. 

Change:  2522.210 has been revised. 

(21) 

Training investment. 

One commenter suggested that the 
Corporation require the grantees to spend between 5 and 10% of any grant on staff and participant training activities.


The Corporation agrees that adequate training_for both staff and participants_is a critical component of any high-quality
program. In order to receive a grant, a program will have to demonstrate the existence of an appropriate training program.
But because the training and capacity-building needs of the various other entities eligible to apply for AmeriCorps
grants vary widely, the Corporation is not setting regulatory guidelines on what percentage of those grants must
be spent on training and capacity building. However, the Corporation reserves the right to set such guidelines in
the applications.

(22) 

Disaster Grants.

  2524.50. One commenter suggested that we require disaster relief grants to go through the State Commissions.
The commenter argued that this would better ensure the coordination of activities. 

The Corporation wishes to maintain flexibility on this issue and thus is not changing the regulations. For a given
disaster, disaster grants may in fact flow through a State Commission. However, there also may be instances during
a disaster when the Corporation would wish to distribute disaster funds directly to programs. 

(23) 

Replication grants. 

One commenter wondered why the term ``replication'' does not occur in the regulations although it occurred in the
preamble. 

Replication grants are allowable and they have been added to the regulations. 

Change:  2521.20 has been amended. 

(24) 

Matching requirements. 

One commenter requested clarification as to whether the general 25% match was inclusive or exclusive of the 15% living
allowance and health care match. 

The corporation agrees that the matching guidelines require further clarification, and the regulations have been
amended to provide clarification. For the purposes of calculating matching requirements, there are two broad budget
categories: participant support costs and other costs. 

Participant support costs are comprised of living allowances, health care benefits, and child care costs, each of
which has a different matching requirement as specified below: 

Health Care: Corporation funds may be used to pay for no more than 85% of total health care costs. 

Child Care: Corporation funds may be used to pay for 100% of child care costs. 

Living Allowances: Corporation and other Federal funds may be used to pay for no more than 85% of living allowance costs.

<DOCNO> FR940323-0-00043 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940323-0-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

``Other Costs'' are comprised of all costs attributable to the program exclusive of the participant support costs
detailed above. Corporation funds may be used to pay for no more than 75% of the total of these other costs. In order to
avoid confusion, readers should note that the requirement that Corporation funds not exceed 75% of the total other
costs of a program is 

not 

synonymous with a 25% matching requirement on a grant. The 75% restriction applies to the total other costs of a program
(including non-Corporation funds). Thus, if a program's total other costs were $100,000, then the Corporation would
provide a grant of no more than $75,000 for those costs, and the program would have to provide for the remaining $25,000.

Changes:  2521.30 has been revised.

(25) 

Ineligibility. 

One commenter suggested that the Corporation further clarify that a person who committed a crime prior to a term of
service is not automatically ineligible for service. 

Individuals with criminal records are not, in fact, automatically ineligible to participate in programs. Programs
are responsible for determining who shall participate. In selecting participants, programs providing service
in particularly sensitive areas, such as working with young children, should consider whether the participation
of individuals with certain criminal backgrounds would have a significant negative impact on the physical or psychological
health of either other participants or individuals served.

(26) 

Federal Agency matching requirements.

 One commenter requested clarification of how Federal agencies are treated in terms of the matching requirements.
The regulations have been revised to clarify that Federal agencies do not have to meet matching requirements if they
operate programs directly, but that if they subgrant, the subgrantees do have to meet the matching requirements.

Change:  2523.90 has been revised.

(27) 

Education and Training.

 One commenter asked how much of a term of service could be spent on education and training. 

The proposed rule did not address this issue. Therefore, the terms of service section of the regulations has been revised
to indicate that the Corporation may set a minimum or maximum number of hours in a given term of service that may be spent
on training, education, or similar approved activities. Thus, the Corporation reserves the right to establish such
guidelines in the application materials.



Parts 2530-2533_Investment for Quality and Innovation





Clearinghouse eligibility.

 One commenter suggested that the regulations go too far in  2532.20(n) by requiring that to be eligible to apply
as a clearinghouse, an organization must have extensive experience in training, technical assistance, service
and/or volunteer development, management, and evaluation. The commenter argued that the law only lists these as
activities a clearinghouse could do, not as requirements for eligibility.

The regulations have been amended to conform to the statute.

Change:  2532.20(n) has been revised.



Part 2540_Administrative Provisions



(1) 

Nondisplacement 
( 2540.100(f)(4)(i)).

 Once commenter suggested that we include examples of what constitutes displacement as described in this section.
Several commenters urged that the proposed restriction not be interpreted too strictly. One commenter pointed out
that it seems to contradict  2522.110(3), which states that professional corps programs that recruit and place
qualified participants in positions as teachers and nurses qualify as AmeriCorps programs. The commenter suggested
that the regulations be revised to clarify that those programs qualify because the participants don't replace qualified
and certified people.

The Corporation declines to put examples or further clarifications of this issue in the regulations. However, it
will disseminate information clarifying these issues to all grantees.

(2) 

Supplantation rule.

 One commenter raised several concerns regarding the supplantation requirement in the AmeriCorps regulations.
The commenter pointed out that the preamble specifically included private sector funds in the requirement and that
the proposed regulations were unclear. The commenter suggested not extending the rule to the private sector. Not
allowing the supplantation of private funds could create a disincentive for programs to raise private funds because,
if they lose those funds in a subsequent year, they may not be able to maintain the same level of non-federal funds and
would thus be ineligible for AmeriCorps assistance. The commenter was also concerned that a program could have difficulty
meeting the requirement for maintaining aggregate non-federal funding if the size of the program is reduced. The
commenter recommended that the regulations be revised to add a sentence stating that the supplantation rule is satisfied
if funding from private sources continues to exceed the matching requirements. The commenter also recommended that
the required non-federal expenditures be measured per capita instead of on a lump-sum basis.

The statutory supplantation provision states that the level of State and local public funding for a given program
cannot drop below the level of the previous year. The regulations stated this incorrectly and have been revised to
indicate that the restriction applies only to public State and local funds. The Corporation does not have the regulatory
authority to measure the level of State and local support on a per participant basis.

Change:  2540.100 has been revised.



Part 2550_State Commission Regulations



One commenter suggested that the State Commission regulations (published in the November 17, 1993 

Federal Register

 as an interim final rule) be amended to add individuals with expertise in the field of mental retardation/cognitive
disabilities to the list of possible members of the State Commissions.

This addition will be incorporated into the final State Commission regulations when they are published.



Miscellaneous Requirements



Interested parties should be advised that because the assistance provided under the authority of this rule constitutes
Federal financial assistance for the purposes of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (which bars discrimination
based on race, color, or national origin), title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (which bars discrimination
on the basis of gender), the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (which bars discrimination on the basis of disability), and
the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (which bars discrimination on the basis of age), grantees will be required to comply
with the aforementioned provisions of Federal law.

Grant recipients will be expected to expend Corporation grants in a judicious and reasonable manner, consistent
with pertinent provisions of Federal law and regulations. Grantees must keep records according to Corporation guidelines,
including records that fully disclose the amount and disposition of the proceeds of a Corporation grant. The Inspector
General of the Corporation (or other authorized official) shall have access, for the purpose of audit and examination,
to the books and records of grantees that may be related or pertinent to the Corporation grant.

Grantees should further be advised that Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements
to State and Local Governments, and Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to other
than State and Local Governments, as well as regulations for the Privacy Act, Freedom of Information Act, Sunshine
Act, Government-wide Debarment and Suspension, and Government-wide Requirements for Drug-Free Workplace will
also be published.

As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is hereby certified that this rule will not have a significant impact
on small business entities.

As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Corporation will submit the information collection requirements
contained in this rule to the Office of Management and Budget for its review (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). The information collection
requirements are needed in order to provide assistance to parties affected by these regulations, in accordance with
statutory mandates.

Accordingly, the Corporation amends title 45, chapter XXV of the Code of Federal Regulations by adding parts 2510,
2513, 2515 through 2524, 2530 through 2533, and 2540 to read as follows: 



PART 2510_OVERALL PURPOSES AND DEFINITIONS 



Sec.

et seq. 



 2510.10 



What are the purposes of the programs and activities of the Corporation for National and Community Service? 



The National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 established the Corporation for National and Community Service
(the Corporation). The Corporation's mission is to engage Americans of all ages and backgrounds in community-based
service. This service will address the Nations educational, public safety, human, and environmental needs to achieve
direct and demonstrable results. In doing so, the Corporation will foster civic responsibility, strengthen the
ties that bind us together as a people, and provide educational opportunity for those who make a substantial commitment
to service. The Corporation will undertake activities and provide assistance to States and other eligible entities
to support national and community service programs and to achieve other purposes consistent with its mission. 



 2510.20 



Definitions.

with two or more cost objectives but not identified with a particular cost objective) as described in Office of Management
and Budget Circulars A-21 (Cost Principles for Educational Institutions), A-87 (Cost Principles for
State and local Governments), and A-122 (Cost Principles for Nonprofit Organizations) that provide guidance
on indirect costs to Federal agencies. Copies of Office of Management and Budget Circulars are available from the
Executive Office of the President Publications, 725 17th Street, NW., room 2200, New Executive Office Building,
Washington, DC 20503.

program costs include the following: (i) Costs for participants, including living allowances, insurance payments,
and expense for training and travel. 

(ii) Costs for staff who recruit, train, place, or supervise participants, including costs for staff salaries, benefits,
training, and travel, if the purpose is for a specific program or project objective. 

(iii) Costs for independent evaluations and internal evaluations_the latter to the extent that the evaluations
cover only the funded program or project and are specifically related to creative methods of quality improvement.
(Overall organizational management improvement costs are administrative costs.) (See  2516.810 and  2522.510
for definition of independent and internal evaluations.)

may be prorated between administrative and program costs if included in the budget and approved by the Corporation
grants officer.

requirements. 


 2516.810 

What types of evaluations are grantees and 
subgrantees required to perform? 


All grantees and subgrantees are required to perform 
internal evaluations which are ongoing efforts to assess 
performance and improve quality. Grantees and subgrantees may, 
but are not required to, arrange for independent evaluations 
which are assessments of program effectiveness by individuals who 
are not directly involved in the administration of the program. 
The cost of independent evaluations is allowable.

required of programs? 


Programs are required to: (a) Continuously assess management effectiveness, the 
quality of services provided, and the satisfaction of both 
participants and service recipients. Internal evaluations should 
seek frequent feedback and provide for quick correction of 
weakness. The Corporation encourages programs to use internal 
evaluation methods, such as community advisory councils, 
participant advisory councils, peer reviews, quality control 
inspections, and service recipient and participant surveys. 
(b) Track progress toward pre-established objectives. 
Objectives must be established by programs and approved by the 
Corporation. Programs must submit to the Corporation (or the 
Corporation grantee as applicable) periodic performance reports. 
(c) Collect and submit to the Corporation (through the 
Corporation grantee as applicable) the following data:

descriptive information required in  2516.820(c)(1). 
(d) Cooperate fully with all Corporation evaluation activities. 


 2516.840 

By what standards will the Corporation evaluate 
individual Learn and Serve America programs? 


The Corporation will evaluate programs based on the 
following:

established and agreed to by the grantee and the Corporation 
before the grant award. 
(b) The extent to which the program is cost-effective. 
(c) Other criteria as determined and published by the 
Corporation. 


 2516.850 

What will the Corporation do to evaluate the overall success of the service-learning program? 


(a) The Corporation will conduct independent evaluations. 
These evaluations will consider the opinions of participants and 
members of the communities where services are delivered. If 
appropriate, these evaluations will compare participants with 
individuals who have not participated in service-learning 
programs. These evaluations will_ 
(1) Study the extent to which service-learning programs as a 
whole affect the involved communities; 
(2) Determine the extent to which service-learning programs 
as a whole increase academic learning of participants, enhance 
civic education, and foster continued community involvement; and 
(3) Determine the effectiveness of different program 
models. 
(b) The Corporation will also determine by June 30, 1995, 
whether outcomes of service-learning programs are defined and 
measured appropriately, and the implications of the results from 
such a study for authorized funding levels. 


 2516.860 

Will information on individual participants be kept confidential? 


(a) Yes. The Corporation will maintain the confidentiality 
of information regarding individual participants that is acquired 
for the purpose of the evaluations described in  2516.840. The 
Corporation will disclose individual participant information only 
with the prior written consent of the participant. However, the 
Corporation may disclose aggregate participant information. 
(b) Grantees and subgrantees under this part must comply 
with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.

et seq. 


 2520.10


What is the purpose of the AmeriCorps program described in parts 2520 through 2524 of this chapter?


The purpose of the AmeriCorps grant program is to provide financial assistance to support AmeriCorps programs that
address educational, public safety, human, or environmental needs through national and community service to provide
AmeriCorps education awards to participants in such progams.



 2520.20



What types of service activities are allowable for programs supported under parts 2520 through 2524 of this chapter?

 

(a) The service must either provide a direct benefit to the community where it is performed, or involve the supervision
of participants or volunteers whose service provides a direct benefit to the community where it is performed. Moreover,
the approved AmeriCorps activities must result in a specific identifiable service or improvement that otherwise
would not be provided with existing funds or volunteers and that does not duplicate the routine functions of workers
or displace paid employees. Programs must develop service opportuntities that are appropriate to the skill levels
of participants and that provide a demonstrable, identifiable benefit that is valued by the community.

(b) In certain circumstances, some activities may not provide a direct benefit to the communities in which service
is performed. Such activities may include, but are not limited to, clerical work and research. However, a participant
may engage in such activities if the performance of the activity is incidental to the participant's provision of service
that does provide a direct benefit to the community in which the service is performed.

Are there any activities that are prohibited? 


Yes. Some activities are prohibited altogether. Although all prohibited activities may be performed voluntarily
by 
participants on their own time, they may not be performed by

program staff, or in a manner that would associate the activities 
with the AmeriCorps program or the Corporation. These activities 
include: 
(a) Any effort to influence legislation, as prohibited under 
section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C.

(d) Impairing existing contracts for services or collective 
bargaining agreements; 
(e) Engaging in partisan political activities, or other 
activities designed to influence the outcome of an election to any public office;

services, providing instruction as part of a program that 
includes mandatory religious instruction or worship, constructing 
or operating facilities devoted to religious instruction or worship, maintaining facilities primarily or 
inherently devoted to religious instruction or worship, or 
engaging in any form of religious proselytization; 
(g) Providing a direct benefit to_
(1) A business organized for profit; 
(2) A labor union; 
(3) A partisan political organization; 
(4) A nonprofit organization that fails to comply with the 
restrictions contained in section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986 except that nothing in this section shall be 
construed to prevent participants from engaging in advocacy activities undertaken at their own initiative; and

(5) An organization engaged in the religious activities 
described in paragraph (e) of this section, unless Corporation 
assistance is not used to support those religious activities; and 
(h) Such other activities as the Corporation may prohibit.

 2521.30 

How will AmeriCorps program grants be awarded? 


In any fiscal year, the Corporation will award AmeriCorps 
program grants as follows: 
(a) 

Grants to State Applicants. 

(1) For the purposes of this section, the term ``State'' means 
the fifty States, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. 
(2) One-third of the funds available under this part and a 
corresponding allotment of AmeriCorps educational awards, as 
specified by the Corporation, will be distributed according to a 
population-based formula to the 50 States, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia if they have applications 
approved by the Corporation. 
(3) At least one-third of funds available under this part 
and an appropriate number of AmeriCorps awards, as determined by 
the Corporation, will be awarded to States on a competitive basis. In order to receive these funds, 
a State must receive funds under paragraphs (a)(2) or (b)(1) of 
this section in the same fiscal year. 
(4) In making subgrants with funds awarded by formula or 
competition under paragraphs (a) (2) or (3) of this section, a State must: (i) Provide a description of the process
used to select 
programs for funding including a certification that the State or 
other entity used a competitive process and criteria that were 
consistent with the selection criteria in  2522.410 of this 
chapter. In making such competitive selections, the State must 
ensure the equitable allocation within the State of assistance 
and approved AmeriCorps positions provided under this subtitle to 
the State taking into consideration such factors as the location 
of the programs applying to the State, population density, and 
economic distress; 
(ii) Provide a written assurance that not less than 60 
percent of the assistance provided to the State will be used to 
make grants in support of AmeriCorps programs other than 
AmeriCorps programs carried out by the State or a State agency. 
The Corporation may permit a State to deviate from this 
percentage if the State demonstrates that it did not receive a 
sufficient number of acceptable applications; and 
(iii) Ensure that a minimum of 50 percent of funds going to 
States will be used for programs that operate in the areas of 
need or on Federal or other public lands, and that place a 
priority on recruiting participants who are residents in high 
need areas, or on Federal or other public lands. The Corporation 
may waive this requirement for an individual State if at least 50 
percent of the total amount of assistance to all States will be 
used for such programs. 
(b) 

Grants to Applicants other than States. 

(1) One percent of available funds will be distributed to 
the U.S. Territories
 that have applications approved by the 
Corporation according to a population-based formula.






(2) One percent of available funds will be reserved for 
distribution to Indian tribes on a competitive basis. 
(3) The Corporation will use any funds available under this 
part remaining after the award of the grants described in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) (1) and (2) of this section to make direct 
competitive grants to subdivisions of States, Indian tribes, public or private nonprofit 
organizations (including labor organizations), institutions of 
higher education, and Federal agencies. No more than one-third 
of the these remaining funds may be awarded to Federal agencies. 
(c) 

Allocation of AmeriCorps educational awards only. 

The Corporation 
will determine on an annual basis the appropriate number of 
educational awards to make available for eligible applicants who 
have not applied for program assistance. 


(d) Effect of States' or Territories' failure to apply. 

If a State or U.S. Territory 
does not apply for or fails to give adequate notice of its intent 
to apply for a formula-based grant as announced by the 
Corporation and published in applications and the Notice of Funds 
Availability, the Corporation will use the amount of that State's 
allotment to make grants to eligible entities to carry out 
AmeriCorps programs in that State or Territory. Any funds 
remaining from that State's allotment after making such grants 
will be reallocated to the States, Territories, and Indian tribes with approved 
AmeriCorps applications at the Corporation's discretion.

(e) 

Effect of rejection of State application. 

If a State's 
application for a formula-based grant is ultimately rejected by 
the Corporation pursuant to  2522.320 of this chapter, the State's 
allotment will be available for redistribution by the Corporation 
to the States, Territories, and Indian Tribes with approved 
AmeriCorps applications as the Corporation deems appropriate. 
(f) The Corporation will make grants for training, technical assistance 
and other special programs described in part 2524 of this chapter 
at the Corporation's discretion. 
(g) 

Matching funds._

(1) 

Requirements. 

(i) The matching requirements for participant benefits are 
specified in  2522.240(b)(5) of this chapter. 
(ii) The Corporation share of other AmeriCorps program costs 
 may not exceed 75 percent, whether the assistance is provided 
directly or as a subgrant from the original recipient of the 
assistance. 
(iii) These matching requirements apply only to programs receiving 
assistance under parts 2521 through 2524 of this chapter. 
(2) 

Calculation.

other AmeriCorps program costs, the program_
(i) Must provide for its share through a payment in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, 
including facilities, equipment, or services; and 
(ii) May provide for its share through State sources, local 
sources, or other Federal sources (other than funds made 
available by the Corporation). 
(3) 

Limitation on cost of health care. 

A program may not 
count more than 85 percent of a cash payment for the cost of 
providing a health care policy toward its 15 percent remaining 
share under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section. 
(4) 

Waiver. 

The Corporation reserves the right to waive, in whole or in part, the 
requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section if the 
Corporation determines that a waiver would be equitable due to a 
lack of available financial resources at the local level. 
(h) 

Administrative costs. 

(1) The recipient of a direct grant or transfer of funds 
from the Corporation may spend no more than five percent of the 
grant or transferred funds on administrative costs.

Subpart A_Minimum Requirements and Program Types 


 2522.100 

What are the minimum requirements that every AmeriCorps program, regardless of type, must 
meet? 


Although a wide range of programs may be eligible to apply 
for and receive support from the Corporation, all AmeriCorps 
programs must meet certain minimum program requirements. These 
requirements apply regardless of whether a program is supported 
directly by the Corporation or through a subgrant. All 
AmeriCorps programs must: 
(a) Address educational, public safety, human, or 
environmental needs, and provide a direct and demonstrable 
benefit that is valued by the community in which the service 
is performed; 
(b) Perform projects that are designed, implemented, and 
evaluated with extensive and broad-based local input, including 
consultation with representatives from the community served, 
participants (or potential participants) in the program, 
community-based agencies with a demonstrated record of experience 
in providing services, and local labor organizations representing 
employees of project sponsors (if such entities exist in the 
area to be served by the program); 
(c) Obtain, in the case of a program that also proposes to 
serve as the project sponsor, the written concurrence of any 
local labor organization representing employees of the project 
sponsor who are engaged in the same or substantially similar work 
as that proposed to be carried out by the AmeriCorps participant; 
(d) Establish and provide outcome objectives, including a 
strategy for achieving these objectives, upon which 
self-assessment and Corporation-assessment of progress can rest. 
Such assessment will be used to help determine the extent to 
which the program has had a positive impact: (1) On communities and persons served by the projects 
performed by the program; 
(2) On participants who take part in the projects; and 
(3) In such other areas as the program or Corporation may 
specify; 
(e) Strengthen communities and encourage mutual respect and 
cooperation among citizens of different races, ethnicities, 
socioeconomic backgrounds, educational levels, both men and women 
and individuals with disabilities; 
(f) Agree to seek actively to include participants and staff 
from the communities in which projects are conducted, and agree 
to seek program staff and participants of different races and 
ethnicities, socioeconomic backgrounds, educational levels, and 
genders as well as individuals with disabilities unless a program 
design requires emphasizing the recruitment of staff and 
participants who share a specific characteristic or background. 
In no case may a program violate the nondiscrimination, 
nonduplication and nondisplacement rules governing participant 
selection described in part 2540 of this chapter. In addition, 
programs are encouraged to establish, if consistent with the 
purposes of the program, an intergenerational component that 
combines students, out-of-school youths, and older adults as 
participants;

(g)(1) Determine the projects in which participants will 
serve and establish minimum qualifications that individuals must 
meet to be eligible to participate in the program; these 
qualifications may vary based on the specific tasks to be 
performed by participants. Regardless of the educational level 
or background of participants sought, programs are encouraged to 
select individuals who posses leadership potential and a 
commitment to the goals of the AmeriCorps program. In any case, 
programs must select participants in a non-partisan, 
non-political, non-discriminatory manner, ensuring fair access to 
participation. In addition, programs are required to ensure that 
they do not displace any existing paid employees as provided in 
part 2540 of this chapter. To this end, programs may not select 
any prospective participant who is or was previously employed by 
a prospective project sponsors within six months of the time of 
enrollment in the program; 

(2) In addition, all programs are required to comply with 
any pre-service orientation or training period requirements 
established by the Corporation to assist in the selection of 
motivated participants. Finally, all programs must agree to 
select a percentage (to be determined by the Corporation) of 
the participants for the program from among prospective 
participants recruited by the Corporation or State Commissions 
under part 2532 of this chapter. The Corporation may also specify 
a minimum percentage of participants to be selected from the 
national leadership pool established under  2522.210(c). The 
Corporation may vary either percentage for different types of 
AmeriCorps programs; 

(h) Provide reasonable accommodation, including auxiliary 
aids and services (as defined in section 3(1) of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102(1)) based on the 
individualized need of a participant who is a qualified 
individual with a disability (as defined in section 101(8) of 
such Act (42 U.S.C. 12111(8)). For the purpose of complying with 
this provision, AmeriCorps programs may apply for additional 
financial assistance from the Corporation pursuant to  2524.40 
of this chapter; 

(i) Use service experiences to help participants achieve the 
skills and education needed for productive, active citizenship, 
including the provision, if appropriate, of structured 
opportunities for participants to reflect on their service 
experiences. In addition, all programs must encourage every 
participant who is eligible to vote to register prior to 
completing a term of service; 

(j) Provide participants in the program with the training, 
skills, and knowledge necessary to perform the tasks required in 
their respective projects, including, if appropriate, specific training in a particular field and background information
on the community, including why the service projects are needed; 

(k) Provide support services_

(1) To participants who are completing a term of service and 
making the transition to other educational and career opportunities; and 

(2) To those participants who are school dropouts in order 
to assist them in earning the equivalent of a high school diploma; 

(l) Ensure that participants serving in approved AmeriCorps 
positions receive the living allowance and other benefits described in   2522.240 through 2522.250
of this chapter; 

(m) Describe the manner in which the AmeriCorps educational 
awards will be apportioned among individuals serving in the 
program. If a program proposes to provide such benefits to less 
than 100 percent of the participants in the program, the program 
must provide a compelling rationale for determining which 
participants will receive the benefits and which participants 
will not. AmeriCorps programs are strongly encouraged to offer 
alternative post-service benefits to participants who will not 
receive AmeriCorps educational awards, however AmeriCorps grant 
funds may not be used to provide such benefits; 

(n) Agree to identify the program, through the use of logos, 
common application materials, and other means (to be specified by 
the Corporation), as part of a larger national effort and to 
participate in other activities such as common opening ceremonies 
(including the administration of a national oath or affirmation), 
service days, and conferences designed to promote a national 
identity for all AmeriCorps programs and participants, including 
those participants not receiving AmeriCorps educational awards. 
This provision does not preclude an AmeriCorps program from 
continuing to use its own name as the primary identification, or 
from using its name, logo, or other identifying materials on 
uniforms or other items; 

(o) Agree to begin terms of service at such times as the 
Corporation may reasonably require and to comply with any 
restrictions the Corporation may establish as to when the 
program may take to fill an approved AmeriCorps position left 
vacant due to attrition; 

(p) Comply with all evaluation procedures specified by the 
Corporation, as explained in   2522.500 through 2522.560; 

(q) In the case of a program receiving funding directly from 
the Corporation, meet and consult with the State Commission for 
the State in which the program operates, if possible, and submit 
a copy of the program application to the State Commission; and 

(r) Address any other requirements as specified by the Corporation. 



 2522.110 

What types of programs are eligible to compete for 
AmeriCorps grants?

Subpart B_Participant Eligibility, Requirements, and Benefits



 2522.200 

What are the eligibility requirements for AmeriCorps participants? 



(a) An AmeriCorps participant must be 17 years of age or

How are AmeriCorps participants recruited and selected? 



(a) 

Local recruitment and selection.

 In general, AmeriCorps 
participants will be selected locally by an approved AmeriCorps 
program, and the selection criteria will vary widely among the 
different programs. Nevertheless, AmeriCorps programs must 
select their participants in a fair and non-discriminatory manner 
which complies with part 2540 of this chapter. In selecting 
participants, programs must also comply with the recruitment and 
selection requirements specified in this section. 

(b)(1) 

National and State recruitment and selection.

 The 
Corporation and each State Commission will establish a system to 
recruit individuals who desire to perform national service and to 
assist the placement of these individuals in approved AmeriCorps positions, which may include positions available
under titles I and II of the Domestic 
Volunteer Service Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. 4951 et seq.). The 
national and state recruitment and placement system will be

(2) 

Emphasis on certain individuals. 

In selecting 
individuals to receive leadership training under this provision, 
the Corporation will make special efforts to select individuals 
who have served_
(i) In the Peace Corps; 
(ii) As VISTA volunteers; 
(iii) As participants in AmeriCorps programs receiving

and Community Service; or 
(v) As members of the Armed Forces of the United States and 
who were honorably discharged from such service. 
(3)

At the request of a program that receives 
assistance, the Corporation may assign an individual who receives 
leadership training under paragraph (c)(1) of this section to 
work with the program in a leadership position and carry out 
assignments not otherwise performed by regular participants. An 
individual assigned to a program will be considered to be a 
participant of the program. 


 2522.220 

What are the required terms of service for AmeriCorps 
participants, and may they serve for more than one term? 


(a) 

Term of service. 

In order to be eligible for the 
educational award described in  2522.240(a), participants 
serving in approved AmeriCorps positions must complete a term of 
service as defined in this section: 
(1) 

Full-time service. 

1,700 hours of service during a 
period of not less than nine months and not more than one year. 
(2) 

Part-time service. 

900 hours of service during a period 
of not more than two years, or, if the individual is enrolled in 
an institution of higher education while performing all or a 
portion of the service, not more than three years. 
(3) 

Reduced part-time term of service. 

The Corporation may 
reduce the number of hours required to be served in order to 
receive an educational award for certain part-time participants 
serving in approved AmeriCorps positions. In such cases, the 
educational award will be reduced in direct proportion to the 
reduction in required hours of service. These reductions may be 
made for summer programs, for categories of participants in 
certain approved AmeriCorps programs and on a case-by-case, 
individual basis as determined by the Corporation. 
(4) 

Summer programs. 

A summer program, in which less than 
1700 hours of service are performed, are part-time programs. 
(b) 

Restriction on multiple terms. 

An AmeriCorps participant 
may only receive the benefits described in   2522.240 through 
2522.250 for the first two successfully-completed terms of 
service, regardless of whether those terms were served on a 
full-, part-, or reduced part-time basis. 
(c) 

Eligibility for second term. 

A participant will only be 
eligible to serve a second or additional term of service if that 
individual has received satisfactory performance review(s) for 
any previous term(s) of service in accordance with the 
requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. Mere eligibility 
for a second or further term of service in no way guarantees a 
participant selection or placement. 
(d) 

Participant performance review. 

For the purposes of 
determining a participant's eligibility for a second or additional term of service and/or 
for an AmeriCorps educational award, each AmeriCorps program will 
evaluate the performance of a participant mid-term and upon 
completion of a participant's term of service. The end-of-term 
performance evaluation will assess the following: 
(1) Whether the participant has completed the required 
number of hours described in paragraph (a) of this section; 
(2) Whether the participant has satisfactorily completed 
assignments, tasks or projects; and 

'

<TEXT>
 

(3) Whether the participant has met any other performance 
criteria which had been clearly communicated both orally and in 
writing at the beginning of the term of service. 
(e) 

Limitation. 

The Corporation may set a minimum or 
maximum percentage of hours of a full-time, part-time, or reduced 
term of service described in paragraphs (a)(1),(a)(2), and (a)(3) 
of this section that a participant may engage in training, 
education, or other similar approved activities 
(f) 

Grievance procedure. 

Any AmeriCorps participant wishing 
to contest a program's ruling of unsatisfactory performance may 
file a grievance according to the procedures set forth in part 
2540 of this chapter. If that grievance procedure or subsequent 
binding arbitration procedure finds that the participant did in 
fact satisfactorily complete a term of service, then that 
individual will be eligible to receive an educational award 
and/or be eligible to serve a second term of service. 



 2522.230 

Under what circumstances may AmeriCorps participants 
be released from completing a term of service, and what are the 
consequences? 


In general, AmeriCorps programs have the authority to 
release participants serving in approved AmeriCorps positions 
from completing a term of service for two reasons: for compelling 
personal circumstances as demonstrated by the participant or for 
cause. 
(a) 

Release for compelling personal circumstances. 

In 
general, AmeriCorps programs have the authority to define the 
circumstances by which a participant may be released for 
compelling personal circumstances. Programs wishing to release 
participants serving in approved AmeriCorps positions may elect 
either_
(1) To grant the release and provide a portion of the 
educational award equal to the portion of the term served; or 
(2) To permit the participant to temporarily suspend 
performance of the term of service for a period of up to two 
years (and such additional period as the Corporation may allow 
for extenuating circumstances) and, upon completion of such 
period, to allow the participant to return to the program with 
which he or she was serving or to a similar AmeriCorps program 
with the assistance of the Corporation, in order to complete the 
remainder of the term of service and obtain the entire AmeriCorps 
educational award. 
(b) 

Release for cause. 

AmeriCorps programs have the 
authority to define the circumstances by which a participant may 
be released for cause, except as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section. AmeriCorps programs must establish a written 
policy to be signed both by the participant and the program 
directors that clearly states the circumstances under which 
participants may be released for cause. Examples of conduct 
which programs may decide constitutes grounds for release for 
cause include chronic truancy, consistent failure to follow 
directions, and failure to adhere to program rules and 
guidelines. Under no circumstances may a participant
s 
disability constitute grounds for release for cause. 
(1) 

Circumstances requiring release for cause. 

AmeriCorps 
programs are required to release for cause any participant who is 
convicted of a felony during a term of service. Any participant 
who is officially charged with a violent felony (e.g., rape or 
homicide), or sale or distribution of a controlled substance, or 
any participant convicted of the possession of a controlled 
substance, will have his or her service suspended without a 
living allowance and without receiving credit for hours missed. 
Any individual whose service was suspended because of being 
charged with a violent felony or sale or distribution of a 
controlled substance may resume service if he or she is found not 
guilty or if such charge is dismissed. Any individual whose 
service was suspended because of being convicted of a first 
offense of the possession of a controlled substance may resume 
service by demonstrating that he or she has enrolled in an 
approved drug rehabilitation program. A person convicted of a 
second or third possession of a controlled substance may resume 
service by demonstrating successful completion of a 
rehabilitation program. Any person that drops out of an 
AmeriCorps program without obtaining a release for compelling 
personal circumstances is considered to have been released for 
cause. 
(2) 

Impact of release for cause. 

A participant released for 
cause may not receive any portion of the AmeriCorps educational 
award. In addition, any individual released for cause who wishes 
to reapply to the program from which he or she was released or to 
any other AmeriCorps program is required to disclose the release 
to that program. Failure to disclose to an AmeriCorps program 
any history of having been released for cause from another 
AmeriCorps program will render an individual ineligible to 
receive the AmeriCorps educational award, notwithstanding whether 
or not that individual successfully completes the term of 
service. 
(3) 

Grievance procedure. 

Any AmeriCorps participant 
wishing to contest a program decision to release that participant 
for cause may file a grievance according to the procedures set 
forth in part 2540 of this chapter. Pending the resolution of 
such grievance procedure, a program may suspend the service of 
that participant. If the initial grievance procedure or 
subsequent binding arbitration proceedings find that there was 
not cause for release, the AmeriCorps program must reinstate the 
participant; moreover, the program must credit the participant 
with any service hours missed and pay the participant the full 
amount of any living allowance the participant did not receive as 
a result of such suspension. The Corporation retains the 
discretion to determine whether Corporation funds may be used to 
pay the living allowance withheld during a participant's 
suspension. 


 2522.240 

What financial benefits do AmeriCorps participants 
serving in approved AmeriCorps positions receive? 


(a) 

AmeriCorps educational awards. 

An individual serving in 
an approved AmeriCorps position will receive an educational award 
from the National Service Trust upon successful completion of 
each of up to two terms of service as defined in  2522.220. 
(b) 

Living allowances_(1) Amount. 

Subject to the provisions of this part, any 
individual who participates on a full-time basis in an AmeriCorps 
program carried out using assistance provided pursuant to 
 2521.30 of this chapter, including an AmeriCorps program that 
receives educational awards only pursuant to  2521.30(c) of this 
chapter, will receive a living allowance in an amount equal to or 
greater than the average annual subsistence allowance provided to 
VISTA volunteers under  105 of the Domestic Volunteer Service 
Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. 4955). This requirement will not apply to 
any program that was in existence prior to September 21, 1993 
(the date of the enactment of the National and Community Service 
Trust Act of 1993).

(2) 

Maximum living allowance. 

With the exception of a 
professional corps described in  2522.110(a)(3), the AmeriCorps living allowances may not exceed 200 
percent of the average annual subsistence allowance provided to 
VISTA volunteers under section 105 of the Domestic Volunteer 
Service Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. 4955). A professional corps 
AmeriCorps program may provide a stipend in excess of the 
maximum, subject to the following conditions: (i) Corporation assistance may not be used to pay for any 
portion of the allowance; and 



(ii) The program must be operated directly by the applicant, 
selected on a competitive basis by submitting an application 
directly to the Corporation, and may not be included in a State's 
application for the AmeriCorps program funds distributed by 
formula, or competition described in   2521.30 (a)(2) and (a)(3) 
of this chapter. 



(3) 

Living allowances for part-time participants. 

Programs 
may, but are not required to, provide living allowances to 
individuals participating on a part-time basis (or a reduced term 
of part-time service authorized under  2522.220(a)(3). Such 
living allowances should be prorated to the living allowance 
authorized in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and will comply 
with such restrictions therein. 



(4) 

Waiver or reduction of living allowance. 

The Corporation 
may, at its discretion, waive or reduce the living allowance 
requirements if a program can demonstrate to the satisfaction of 
the Corporation that such requirements are inconsistent with the 
objectives of the program, and that participants will be able to 
meet the necessary and reasonable costs of living (including 
food, housing, and transportation) in the area in which the 
program is located. 



(5) 

Limitation on Federal share. 

The Federal share, including Corporation and other Federal funds, 
of the total amount provided to an AmeriCorps participant for a 
living allowance is limited as follows: (i) In no case may the Federal share exceed 85% of the 
minimum required living allowance enumerated in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section. 



(ii) For professional corps described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) 
of this section, Corporation and other Federal funds may be used 
to pay for no portion of the living allowance. 



(iii) If the minimum living allowance requirements has been 
waived or reduced pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section 
and the amount of the living allowance provided to a participant 
has been reduced correspondingly_



(A) In general, the Federal share may not exceed 85% of the 
reduced living allowance; however, 



(B) If a participant is serving in a program that provides 
room or board, the Corporation will consider on a case-by-case 
basis allowing the portion of that living allowance that may be 
paid using Corporation and other Federal funds to be between 85% 
and 100%. 


 2522.250

What other benefits do AmeriCorps participants 
serving in approved AmeriCorps positions receive? 





(a) 

Child Care. 

Grantees must provide child care through an 
eligible provider or a child care allowance in an amount 
determined by the Corporation to those full-time participants who 
need child care in order to participate. 



(1) 

Need. 

A participant is considered to need child care in 
order to participate in the program if he or she: (i) Is the parent or legal guardian of, or is acting in loco 
parentis for, a child under 13 who resides with the participant; 



(ii) Has a family income that does not exceed 75 percent of 
the State's median income for a family of the same size;

currently receiving child care assistance from another source, 
including a parent or guardian, which would continue to be 
provided while the participant serves in the program; and 



(iv) Certifies that he or she needs child care in order to 
participate in the program.

9858n(5)).



(3) 

Child care allowance. 

The amount of the child care 
allowance will be determined by the Corporation based on payment 
rates for the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 
(42 U.S.C. 9858c(4)(A)). 



(4) 

Corporation share. 

The Corporation will pay 100 percent 
of the child care allowance, or, if the program provides child 
care through an eligible provider, the actual cost of the care or 
the amount of the allowance, whichever is less.

eligible for health care benefits if he or she is not otherwise 
covered by a health benefits package providing minimum benefits 
established by the Corporation at the time he or she is accepted 
into a program. If, as a result of participation, or if, during 
the term of service, a participant demonstrates loss of coverage 
through no deliberate act of his or her own, such as parental or 
spousal job loss or disqualification from Medicaid, the 
participant will be eligible for health care benefits. 



(3) 

Corporation share. 

(i) Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii) of this section, the Corporation will pay up to 85% of 
the cost of health care coverage that includes the minimum or

Subpart D_Selection of AmeriCorps Programs 




 2522.400

How will the basic selection criteria be applied? 





From among the eligible programs that meet the minimum 
program requirements and that have submitted applications to the 
Corporation, the Corporation must select the best ones to receive 
funding. Although there is a wide range of factors that must be 
taken into account during the selection process, there are 
certain fundamental selection criteria that apply to all programs 
in each grant competition, regardless of whether they receive 
funding or educational awards directly or through subgrants. 
States and other subgranting applicants are required to use these 
criteria during the competitive selection of subgrantees. The 
Corporation may adjust the relative weight given to each 
criterion. (Additional and more specific criteria will be 
published in the applications). 




 2522.410

What are the basic selection criteria for AmeriCorps 
programs? 





The Corporation will consider how well the program will be 
able to achieve the three impacts mentioned in paragraph (a) of 
this section as demonstrated by the program design, the capacity 
of the organization to carry it out and other factors relating to 
need. The Corporation will also consider the extent to which the 
program promotes the Corporation's goals; and the extent to which 
the program contributes to the overall diversity of programs 
desired by the Corporation. These criteria are discussed in this 
section. Additional detail relating to these criteria may be 
published in any notice of availability of funding. 



(a) 

Program impacts. 

The Corporation will consider the 
extent to which the program: (1) Achieves direct and demonstrable results; 



(2) Strengthens communities; and 



(3) Promotes citizenship and increases educational 
opportunities for participants. 



(b) 

Program Criteria.

_(1) 

Program design.

factors relating to the program design: (i) The quality of the program proposed to be carried out 
directly by the applicant or supported by a grant from the 
applicant; 



(ii) The innovative aspects of the AmeriCorps program; 



(iii) The feasibility of replicating the program; and

(iv) The sustainability of the program, based on evidence 
such as the existence of strong and broad-based community support 
for the program and of multiple funding sources or private 
funding. 
(2)

 Organizational capacity.

 The Corporation will also 
consider an organization's capacity to carry out the program 
based on_
(i) The quality of the leadership of the AmeriCorps 
program; 
(ii) The past performance of the organization or program; 
and 
(iii) The extent to which the program builds on existing 
programs. 
(c)

 Need criteria.

 In selecting programs, the Corporation 
will take into consideration the extent to which projects address 
State-identified issue priorities (if the program will be funded 
out of formula funds) or national priorities (if the program will 
be funded out of competitive funds), and whether projects would 
be conducted in areas of need. 
(1)

 Issue priorities.

 In order to concentrate national 
efforts on meeting certain educational, public safety, human, or 
environmental needs, and to achieve the other purposes of this 
Act, the Corporation will establish, and after review of the 
strategic plan approved by the Board, periodically alter 
priorities regarding the AmeriCorps programs that will receive 
assistance (funding or approved AmeriCorps positions) and the 
purposes for which such assistance may be used. These priorities 
will be applied to assistance provided on a competitive basis as 
described in  2521.30 of this chapter, and to any assistance 
provided through a subgrant of such funds. 
(i) States must establish, and through the national service 
plan process described in part 2513 of this chapter, periodically 
alter priorities regarding the programs that will receive 
assistance (funding or approved AmeriCorps positions) provided on 
a formula basis as described in  2521.30(a)(2) of this chapter. 
The State priorities will be subject to Corporation review as 
part of the application process under part 2521 of this chapter. 
(ii) The Corporation will provide advance notice to 
potential applicants of any AmeriCorps priorities to be in effect 
for a fiscal year. The notice will describe any alternation made 
in the priorities since the previous notice. If a program 
receives multi-year funding based on conformance to national or 
state priorities and such priorities are altered after the first 
year of funding, the program will not be adversely affected due 
to the change in priorities until the term of the grant is 
ended. 
(2)

Areas of need.

 Areas of need are: (i) Communities designated by the Federal government or 
States as empowerment zones or redevelopment areas, targeted for 
special economic incentives, or otherwise identifiable as having 
high concentrations of low-income people; 
(ii) Areas that are environmentally distressed; 
(iii) Areas adversely affected by Federal actions related to 
the management of Federal lands that result in significant 
regional job losses and economic dislocation; 
(iv) Areas adversely affected by reductions in defense 
spending or the closure or realignment of military installations; 
and 
(v) Areas that have an unemployment rate greater than the 
national average unemployment rate for the most recent 12 months 
for which satisfactory data are available. 
(d)

 Contribution to overall diversity of programs funded by 
the Corporation.

 The Corporation will select programs that will 
help to achieve participant, program type, and geographic 
diversity across programs. 
(e)

 Additional considerations.

 The Corporation may publish 
in any notice of availability of funding additional factors that 
it may take into consideration in selecting programs, including 
any additional priorities applicable to any or all funds. 


 2522.420 

Can a State's application for formula funds be rejected? 


Yes. Formula funds are not an entitlement. 
(a)

 Notification.

 If the Corporation rejects an application 
submitted by a State Commission under part 2550 of this chapter 
for funds described in  2521.30 of this chapter, the 
Corporation will promptly notify the State Commission of the 
reasons for the rejection of the application.

(b)

 Revision.

 The Corporation will provide a State 
Commission notified under paragraph (a) of this section with a 
reasonable opportunity to revise and resubmit the application. At 
the request of the State Commission, the Corporation will provide 
technical assistance to the State Commission as part of the 
resubmission process. The Corporation will promptly reconsider an 
application resubmitted under this paragraph. 
(c)

 Redistribution.

 The amount of any State's allotment 
under  2521.30(a) of this chapter for a fiscal year that the 
Corporation determines will not be provided for that fiscal year 
will be available for redistribution by the Corporation to the States, Territories and Indian Tribes with 
approved AmeriCorps applications as the Corporation deems 
appropriate. 


Subpart E_Evaluation Requirements 


 2522.500 

What are the purposes of an evaluation? 


Every evaluation effort should serve to improve program 
quality, examine benefits of service, or fulfill legislative 
requirements. 


 2522.510 

What types of evaluations are States, grant-making 
entities, and programs required to perform? 


All grantees and subgrantees are required to perform internal evaluations which are ongoing efforts to assess 
performance and improve quality. Grantees and subgrantees may, 
but are not required to, arrange for independent evaluation which 
are assessments of program effectiveness by individuals who are 
not directly involved in the administration of the program. The 
cost of independent evaluations is allowable. 


 2522.520 

What types of internal evaluation activities are 
required of programs? 


Programs are required to: (a) Continuously assess management effectiveness, the 
quality of services provided, and the satisfaction of both 
participants and persons served. Internal evaluation activities 
should seek frequent feedback and provide for quick correction of 
weaknesses. The Corporation encourages programs to use internal 
evaluation methods such as community advisory councils, 
participant advisory councils, peer reviews, quality control 
inspections, and customer and participant surveys; 
(b) Track progress toward objectives. Objectives will be 
established by programs and approved by the Corporation. 
Programs must submit to the Corporation (or State or grantmaking 
entity as applicable) periodic performance reports and, as part 
of an annual report, an annual performance report; 
(c) Collect and submit to the Corporation (through the State 
or grantmaking entity as applicable) the following data: 
(1) Information on participants including the total number 
of participants in the program, and the number of participants by 
race, ethnicity, age, gender, economic background, education 
level, ethnic group, disability classification, geographic 
region, and marital status; 
(2) Information on services conducted in areas classified as 
empowerment zones (or redevelopment areas), in areas that are 
targeted for special economic incentives or otherwise 
identifiable as having high concentrations of low-income people, 
in areas that are environmentally distressed, in areas that are 
adversely affected by Federal actions related to the management 
of Federal lands, in areas that are adversely affected by 
reductions in defense spending, or in areas that have an 
unemployment rate greater than the national average unemployment 
rate; 
(3) Other information as required by the Corporation; and 
(d) Cooperate fully with all Corporation evaluation 
activities. 


 2522.530 

What types of activities are required of States or 
grantmaking entities to evaluate the effectiveness of their 
subgrantees? 


In cases where a State or grantmaking entity is the direct 
grantee they will be required to: 
(a) Ensure that subgrantees comply with the requirements of 
this subpart; 
(b) Track program performance in terms of progress towards 
pre-established objectives and ensure that corrective action is 
taken when necessary. Submit periodic performance reports and, 
as part of an annual report, an annual performance report to the 
Corporation for each subgrantee; 
(c) Collect from programs and submit to the Corporation the 
descriptive information required in this subpart; and 
(d) Cooperate fully with all Corporation evaluation activities.

 2522.540 


How will the Corporation evaluate individual AmeriCorps programs? 



The Corporation will evaluate programs based on the following: (a) The extent to which the program meets the objectives
established and agreed to by the grantee and the Corporation before the grant award; 

(b) The extent to which the program is cost-effective; and 

(c) The effectiveness of the program in meeting the following legislative objectives: (1) Providing direct and demonstrable
services and projects that benefit the community by addressing educational, public safety, human, or environmental
needs; 

(2) Recruiting and enrolling diverse participants consistent with the requirements of part 2540 of this chapter,
based on economic background, race, ethnicity, age, gender, marital status, education levels, and disability;


(3) Promoting the educational achievement of each participant based on earning a high school diploma or its equivalent
and future enrollment in and completion of increasingly higher levels of education; 

(4) Encouraging each participant to engage in public and community service after completion of the program based
on career choices and participation in other service programs; 

(5) Promoting an ethic of active and productive citizenship among participants; 

(6) Supplying additional volunteer assistance to community agencies without providing more volunteers than can
be effectively utilized; 

(7) Providing services and activities that could not otherwise be performed by employed workers and that will not
supplant the hiring of, or result in the displacement of, employed workers; and 

(8) Other criteria determined and published by the Corporation. 



 2522.550 


What will the Corporation do to evaluate the overall success of the AmeriCorps programs? 



(a) The Corporation will conduct independent evaluations of programs, including in-depth studies of selected programs.
These evaluations will consider the opinions of participants and members of the community where services are delivered.
Where appropriate these studies will compare participants with individuals who have not participated in service
programs. These evaluations will: (1) Study the extent to which the national service impacts involved communities;


(2) Study the extent to which national service increases positive attitudes among participants regarding the responsibilities
of citizens and their role in solving community problems; 

(3) Study the extent to which national service enables participants to afford post-secondary education with fewer
student loans; 

(4) Determine the costs and effectiveness of different program models in meeting program objectives including full-
and part-time programs, programs involving different types of national service, programs using different recruitment
methods, programs offering alternative non-federally funded vouchers or post-service benefits, and programs
utilizing individual 
placements and teams; 

(5) Determine the impact of programs in each State on the ability of VISTA and National Senior Volunteer Corps, each
regular and reserve component of the Armed Forces, and the Peace Corps to recruit individuals residing in that State;
and 

(6) Determine the levels of living allowances paid in all AmeriCorps programs and American Conservation and Youth
Corps, individually, by State, and by region and determine the effects that such living allowances have had on the
ability of individuals to participate in such programs. 

(b) The Corporation will also determine by June 30, 1995: (1) Whether the State and national priorities designed to
meet educational, public safety, human, or environmental needs are being addressed; 

(2) Whether the outcomes of both stipended and nonstipended service programs are defined and measured appropriately;


(3) Whether stipended service programs, and service programs providing educational benefits in return for service,
should focus on economically disadvantaged individuals or at risk youth, or whether such programs should include
a mix of individuals, including individuals from middle and upper income families; 

(4) The role and importance of stipends and educational benefits in achieving desired outcomes in the service programs;


(5) The income distribution of AmeriCorps participants, to determine the level of participation of economically
disadvantaged individuals. The total income of participants will be determined as of the date the participant was
first selected to participate in a program and will include family total income unless the evaluating entity determines
that the participant was 
independent at the time of selection. Definitions for ``independent'' and ``total income'' are those used in section
480(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965; 

(6) The amount of assistance provided under the AmeriCorps programs that has been expended for projects conducted
in areas classified as empowerment zones (or redevelopment areas), in areas that are targeted for special economic
incentives or are otherwise identifiable as having high concentrations of low-income people, in areas that are environmentally
distressed or adversely affected by Federal actions related to the management of Federal lands, in areas that are
adversely affected by reductions in defense spending, or in areas that have an unemployment rate greater than the
national average unemployment rate for the most recent 12 months for which satisfactory data are available; and 

(7) The implications of the results of these studies as appropriate for authorized funding levels. 



 2522.560 


Will information on individual participants be kept confidential? 



(a) Yes. The Corporation will maintain the confidentiality of information regarding individual participants that
is acquired for the purpose of the evaluations described in  2522.540. The Corporation will disclose individual
participant information only with the prior written consent of the participant. However, the Corporation may disclose
aggregate 
participant information. 

(b) Grantees and subgrantees that receive assistance under this chapter must comply with the provisions of paragraph
(a) of this section.

(a) An individual with responsibility for the operation of a 
project that receives Corporation assistance must not 
discriminate against a participant in, or member of the staff of, 
such project on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, 
age, or political affiliation of such participant or member, or 
on the basis of disability, if the participant or member is a 
qualified individual with a disability. 
(b) Any Corporation assistance constitutes Federal financial 
assistance for purposes of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.), title IX of the Education 
Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), section 504 of the

U.S.C. 1681 et seq.). 
(c) An individual with responsibility for the operation of a

project on the date the Corporation grant was awarded. 


 2540.220 

Under what circumstances and subject to what 
conditions are participants in Corporation-assisted programs 
eligible for family and medical leave? 


(a) 

Participants in State, local, or private nonprofits 
programs. 

A participant in a State, local, or private nonprofit 
program receiving support from the Corporation is considered an 
eligible employee of the program's project sponsor under the 
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 CFR part 825) if_ 
(1) The participant has served for at least 12 months and 
1,250 hours during the year preceding the start of the leave; and 
(2) The program's project sponsors engages in commerce or 
any industry or activity affecting commerce, and employs at least 
50 employees for each working day during 20 or more calendar 
workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year. 
(b) 

Participants in Federal programs.

 Participants in 
Federal programs operated by the Corporation or by another 
Federal agency will be considered Federal employees for the 
purposes of the Family and Medical Leave Act if the participants 
have completed 12 months of service and the project sponsor is 
an employing agency as defined in 5 U.S.C 6381 

et seq.

; such 
participants therefore will be eligible for the same family and 
medical leave benefits afforded to such Federal employees. 
(c) 

General terms and conditions. 

Participants that qualify 
as eligible employees under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section 
are entitled to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during a 12 
month period for any of the following reasons (in the cases of 
both paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section the entitlement to leave expires 
12 months after the birth or placement of such child): (1) The birth of a child to a participant; 
(2) The placement of a child with a participant for adoption 
or foster care; 
(3) The serious illness of a participant's spouse, child or 
parent; or 
(4) A participant
s serious health condition that makes that 
participant unable to perform his or her essential service duties 
(a serious health condition is an illness or condition that 
requires either inpatient care or continuing treatment by a 
health care provider). 
(d) 

Intermittent leave or reduced service. 

The program, 
serving as the project sponsor, may allow a participant to take 
intermittent leave or reduce his or her service hours due to the 
birth of or placement of a child for adoption or foster care. 
The participant may also take leave to care for a seriously ill 
immediate family member or may take leave due to his or her own 
serious illness whenever it is medically necessary. 
(e) 

Alternate placement. 

If a participant requests 
intermittent leave or a reduced service hours due to a serious 
illness or a family member's sickness, and the need for leave is 
foreseeable based on planned medical treatment, the program, or 
project sponsor may temporarily transfer the participant to an 
alternative service position if the participant: (1) Is qualified for the position; and 
(2) Receives the same benefits such as stipend or living 
allowance and the position better accommodates the participants 
recurring periods of leave. 
(f) 

Certification of cause. 

A program, or project sponsor 
may require that the participant support a leave request with a 
certification from the health care provider of the participant or 
the participant's family member. If a program sponsor requests a 
certification, the participant must provide it in a timely 
manner. 
(g) 

Continuance of coverage. 

(1) If a State, local or private program provides for 
health insurance for the full-time participant, the sponsor must 
continue to provide comparable health coverage at the same level 
and conditions that coverage would have been provided for the 
duration of the participant's leave. 
(2) If the Federal program provides health insurance 
coverage for the full-time participant, the sponsor must also 
continue to provide the same health care coverage for the 
duration of the participant's leave. 
(h) 

Failure to return. 

If the participant fails to return 
to the program at the end of leave for any reason other than 
continuation, recurrence or onset of a serious health condition 
or other circumstances beyond his or her control, the program 
may recover the premium that he or she paid during any period of 
unpaid leave. 
(i) 

Applicability to term of service. 

Any absence, due to 
family and medical leave, will not be counted towards the 
participant's term of service. 


 2540.230 

What grievance procedures must recipients of 
Corporation assistance establish? 


State and local applicants that receive assistance from the 
Corporation must establish and maintain a procedure for the 
filing and adjudication of grievances from participants, labor 
organizations, and other interested individuals concerning 
programs that receive assistance from the Corporation. A 
grievance procedure may include dispute resolution programs such 
as mediation, facilitation, assisted negotiation and neutral 
evaluation. If the grievance alleges fraud or criminal activity, 
it must immediately be brought to the attention of the 
Corporation's inspector general.

(a) 

Alternative dispute resolution. 

(1) The aggrieved party may seek resolution through alternative means of dispute resolution such as mediation or
facilitation. Dispute resolution proceedings must be initiated within 45 calendar days from the date of the alleged
occurrence. At the initial session of the dispute resolution proceedings, the party must be advised in writing of
his or her right to file a grievance and right to arbitration. If the matter is resolved, and a written agreement is reached,
the party will agree to forego filing a grievance in the matter under consideration. 
(2) If mediation, facilitation, or other dispute resolution processes are selected, the process must be aided by
a neutral party who, with respect to an issue in controversy, functions specifically to aid the parties in resolving
the matter through a mutually achieved and acceptable written agreement. The neutral party may not compel a resolution.
Proceedings before the neutral party must be informal, and the rules of evidence will not apply. With the exception
of a written and agreed upon dispute resolution agreement, the proceeding must be confidential. 
(b) 

Grievance procedure for unresolved complaints. 

If the matter is not resolved within 30 calendar days from the date the informal dispute resolution process began,
the neutral party must again inform the aggrieving party of his or her right to file a formal grievance. In the event
an aggrieving party files a grievance, the neutral may not participate in the formal complaint process. In addition,
no communication or proceedings of the informal dispute resolution process may be referred to or introduced into
evidence at the grievance and arbitration hearing. Any decision by the neutral party is advisory and is not binding
unless both parties agree. 
(c) 

Time limitations. 

Except for a grievance that alleges fraud or criminal activity, a grievance must be made no later than one year after
the date of the alleged occurrence. If a hearing is held on a grievance, it must be conducted no later than 30 calendar
days after the filing of such grievance. A decision on any such grievance must be made no later than 60 calendar days
after the filing of the grievance. 
(d) 

Arbitration_

(1) 

Arbitrator_

(i) 

Joint selection by parties. 

If there is an adverse decision against the party who filed the grievance, or 60 calendar days after the filing of a grievance
no decision has been reached, the filing party may submit the grievance to binding arbitration before a qualified
arbitrator who is jointly selected and independent of the interested parties. 
(ii) 

Appointment by Corporation. 

If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within 15 calendar days after receiving a request from one of the grievance
parties, the Corporations Chief Executive Officer will appoint an arbitrator from a list of qualified arbitrators.

SUMMARY:

 The Clean Water Act contains provisions which authorize EPA to treat Indian tribes in substantially the same manner
in which it treats states for purposes of various types of financial assistance. This action contains amendments
to the interim final regulations implementing that authority for financial assistance programs. The purpose of
these regulatory amendments is to make it easier for tribes to obtain EPA approval to assume the role Congress envisioned
for them under this statute.

I. Introduction: Statutory and Regulatory Background


Under its American Indian Policy, EPA works directly with tribal governments as ``sovereign entities with primary
authority and responsibility for the reservation populace.'' At the time the Policy was adopted in 1984, the environmental
statutes which EPA administers generally did not explicitly address the role of tribes in environmental management,
but provided for a joint state and federal role in environmental management. Subsequently, three EPA regulatory
statutes have been amended to address the tribal role specifically by authorizing EPA to treat tribes in a manner similar
to that in which it treats states: the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), and the Clean Air Act
(CAA).

1






EPA recognizes that tribes are sovereign nations with a unique legal status and a relationship to the federal government
that is significantly different than that of states. EPA believes that Congress did not intend to alter this when it
authorized treatment of tribes ``as States;'' rather, the purpose of the statutory amendments was to reflect an intent
that, insofar as possible, tribes should assume a role in implementing the environmental statutes on tribal land
comparable to the role states play on state land.
All three regulatory statutes specify that, in order to receive such treatment, a tribe must be federally recognized
and possess a governing body carrying out substantial duties and powers. 33 U.S.C. 1377 (e), (h) (CWA); 42 U.S.C. 300j-11
(SDWA); 42 U.S.C. 7601(d) (CAA). In addition, although there are some variations in language among the three statutes,
each requires that a tribe possess civil regulatory jurisdiction to carry out the functions it seeks to exercise.

2

 Finally, all three require that a tribe be reasonably expected to be capable of carrying out those functions.




The Agency initially chose to implement provisions of the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Acts regarding Indian
tribes by establishing a formal prequalification process under which tribes can seek eligibility under these statutes.
This prequalification process has in the past been referred to as approval for ``treatment as a state'' (``TAS'').
Tribes that obtain such approval then become eligible to apply for certain grants and program approvals available
to states.

II. Regulations Governing Eligibility of Indian Tribes


A. The Existing Process


The Agency has promulgated five regulations that utilize the ``TAS'' process to date: (1) Safe Drinking Water Act
National Drinking Water Regulations and Underground Injection Control Regulations for Indian Lands, 53 FR 37395
(September 26, 1988), codified at 40 CFR parts 35, 124, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, and 146; (2) Indian Tribes: Water Quality
Planning and Management, 54 FR 14353 (April 11, 1989), Comprehensive Construction Grant Regulation Revision, 55
FR 27092 (June 29, 1990) (governing grant programs under the CWA), codified at 40 CFR parts 35 and 130; (3) Amendments
to the Water Quality Standards Regulation that Pertain to Standards on Indian Reservations, 56 FR 64876 (December
12, 1991), codified at 40 CFR part 131; (4) Clean Water Act, section 404 Tribal Regulations, 58 FR 8171 (February 11,
1993), codified at 40 CFR parts 232 and 233; and (5) Treatment of Indian Tribes as States for Purposes of sections 308,
309, 401, 402, and 405 of the Clean Water Act (``NPDES'') Rule, 58 FR 67966 (December 22, 1993), codified at 40 CFR parts
122, 123, 124 and 501. 
Under all of these regulations, before a tribe can obtain financial assistance available to states or obtain approval
to operate a program which states are authorized to operate on state lands, the tribe must first formally qualify for
``treatment as a state.'' To qualify, a tribe must submit an application establishing that it is federally recognized,
has a governing body carrying out substantial duties and powers, and has adequate jurisdiction and capability to
carry out the proposed activities. Once a tribe obtains ``TAS'' approval, it is eligible to apply for financial assistance
and program approval.


1. Recognition and Government


A tribe typically establishes recognition by showing its inclusion on the list of federally recognized Tribes published
by the Secretary of the Interior in the 

Federal Register

. A tribe establishes that it meets the governmental duties and powers requirement with a narrative statement describing
the form of the tribal government and the types of functions it performs, and identifying the sources of the tribe's
governmental authority.


2. Jurisdiction and Capability


To establish jurisdiction under the CWA grant regulations, a tribe must submit a statement signed by a tribal legal
official explaining the legal basis for the Tribe's regulatory authority over its water resources. The CWA grant
regulations do not require that a tribe submit any specific materials to establish capability.
The other regulations specify that a tribe must submit various specific documents to establish jurisdiction, including:
a map or legal description of the area over which the tribe claims jurisdiction; a statement by a tribal legal official
describing the basis, nature, and subject matter of the tribe's jurisdiction; copies of all documents supporting
the jurisdictional assertions; and a description of the locations of the systems or sources the tribe proposes to
regulate. Similarly, to establish capability a tribe must submit a narrative statement describing tribal capability
to administer an effective program, and certain specific, listed materials in support of that statement.


3. Comment Process


Upon receiving a ``TAS'' application under these regulations, EPA notifies all ``appropriate governmental entities,''

4

 as to the substance of and basis for the jurisdictional assertions in the application, and invites comment on those
assertions. Where comments raise a competing or conflicting jurisdictional claim, the Agency must consult with
the Department of the Interior before making a final decision on the tribe's application.




In practice, this comment process has sometimes led to delays in the processing and approval of tribal applications.
Indeed, it has proven to be the single portion of ``TAS'' review most responsible for delays. The comment process also
has created a perception that states have an oversight role in EPA's treatment of Indian tribes, which some tribes
find objectionable, particularly since tribes have typically not been asked to offer their views on the scope and
extent of state jurisdiction.


4. Subsequent Tribal Applications


The regulations require a separate ``treatment as a state'' application for each program for which the tribe seeks
such treatment. However, after an initial approval, applications for each additional program need provide only
that additional information unique to the additional program.


B. Workgroup Examination of Process


The Agency's ``TAS'' prequalification process has proven to be burdensome, time-consuming and offensive to tribes.
Accordingly, in 1992 EPA established a working group to focus on ways of improving and simplifying that process. The
Agency formally adopted the Workgroup's recommendations as Agency policy by Memorandum dated November 10, 1992.
That Memorandum explicitly recognized that the policies it adopted would require amendments to existing regulations.
The purpose of this regulation is to amend existing financial assistance regulations under the Clean Water Act in
order to implement the new policy. To the extent possible, the Agency plans to use the same process in future regulations
regarding determinations of tribal eligibility.

III. Revisions to the Process in Light of Statutory Requirements



No statute compels the use of a formal ``TAS'' or other prequalification process separate from approval of the underlying
request for a grant or program approval. The only requirements imposed by statute are that, to be eligible for financial
assistance and/or program authorization, a tribe must be federally recognized, have a governing body carrying out
substantial duties and powers, and have adequate jurisdiction and capability to carry out the proposed activities.
Thus, EPA may authorize a tribal program or grant without formally designating the tribe as ``eligible for TAS,''
so long as the Agency establishes that the tribe meets applicable statutory requirements. In other words, the Agency
can ensure compliance with statutory mandates without requiring tribes to undergo a discrete, formal process of
seeking ``TAS'' approval.

Accordingly, EPA is amending its regulations to eliminate ``TAS'' review as a separate step in the processing of a
tribal application for a grant. Under the new, simplified process, the Agency will ensure compliance with statutory
requirements as an integral part of the process of reviewing grant applications. To the extent that this rule or preamble
conflicts with the language of previous rules and preambles, the language herein shall be controlling. EPA will also,
as far as possible, discontinue use of the term ``treatment as a state;'' however, since this phrase is included in
several statutes, its continued use may sometimes be necessary.



A. Simplified Determination as to Recognition and Government



As a general rule, the recognition and governmental requirements are essentially the same under the Clean Water and
Safe Drinking Water Acts. The new process will reflect this by establishing identical requirements for making this
showing under each statute. Moreover, the fact that a tribe has met the recognition or governmental functions requirement
under either of the Water Acts will establish that it meets those requirements under both statutes. To facilitate
review of tribal applications, EPA therefore requests that tribal applications inform EPA whether a tribe has been
approved for ``TAS'' (under the old process) or deemed eligible to receive funding or authorization (under the revised
process) for any other program.

A tribe that has not done so may establish that it has been federally recognized by simply stating in its grant or program
authorization application that it appears on the list of federally recognized tribes that the Secretary of the Interior
publishes periodically in the 

Federal Register

. If the tribe notifies EPA that it has been recognized but does not appear on this list because the list has not been updated,
EPA will seek to verify the fact of recognition with the Department of the Interior.

A tribe that has not yet made its initial governmental showing can do so by certifying that it has a government carrying
out substantial governmental functions. A tribe will be able to make the required certification if it is currently
performing governmental functions to promote the public health, safety, and welfare of its population. Examples
of such functions include, but are not limited to, levying taxes, acquiring land by exercise of the power of eminent
domain, and exercising police power. Such examples should be included in a narrative statement supporting the certification,
(1) Describing the form of tribal government and the types of essential governmental functions currently performed,
and (2) identifying the legal authorities for performing those functions (e.g., tribal constitutions or codes).
It should be relatively easy for tribes to meet this requirement without submitting copies of specific documents
unless requested to do so by the Agency.



B. Case by Case Review of Jurisdiction and Capability



A tribe may have jurisdiction over, and capability to carry out, certain activities (e.g., protection of the quality
of a particular lake for the Clean Lakes program under the Clean Water Act), but not others (e.g., waste management
on a portion of the reservation far removed from any lakes). For this reason, EPA believes that the Agency must make
a specific determination that a tribe has adequate jurisdictional authority and administrative and programmatic
capability before it approves each tribal program. This will ensure that tribes meet the statutory requirements
Congress has established as prerequisites to tribal eligibility for each particular program.

1. Simplified Jurisdictional Analysis



The portion of the jurisdictional determination under which governments comment on tribal jurisdiction will be
substantially altered under this Rule. These changes are outlined below.

Comments will no longer be sought from ``appropriate governmental entities'' with regard to tribal grant applications.
The Agency now has extensive experience awarding grants to tribes and is capable of evaluating tribal grant applications
to ensure that a tribe has adequate jurisdiction to receive grants.

A separate ``TAS'' jurisdictional review is not needed to verify that a tribe meets the statutory jurisdictional
requirement. This change will have the effect only of eliminating duplicative requirements.

Finally, the Agency notes that certain issues concerning tribal jurisdiction may be relevant to a tribe's authority
to conduct activities. For example, if a tribe and a state or another tribe disagree as to the boundary of a particular
tribe's reservation, each time the tribe seeks to assert authority over the disputed area, the dispute will recur.
The Agency recognizes that its determinations regarding tribal jurisdiction apply only to activities to be carried
out within the scope of the grant. However, it also believes that, once it makes a jurisdictional determination in
response to a tribal application regarding any EPA program, it will ordinarily make the same determination for other
programs unless a subsequent application raises different legal issues. Thus, for example, once the Agency has arrived
at a position concerning a boundary dispute, it will not alter that position in the absence of significant new factual
or legal information. 

Under the new approval process, as under the old, the Agency will continue to retain authority to limit its approval
of a tribal application to those land areas where the tribe has demonstrated jurisdiction. This would allow EPA to
approve the portion of a tribal application covering certain areas, while withholding approval of the portion of
an application addressing those land areas where tribal authority has not been satisfactorily established. See,
e.g., 53 FR 37395, 37402 (September 26, 1988) (SDWA); 54 FR 14353, 14355 (April 11, 1989) (Clean Water Act Grants);
54 FR 39097, 39102 (September 12, 1989) (Clean Water Act Water Quality Standards); 58 FR 8171, 8176 (February 11, 1993)
(Clean Water Act section 404); 58 FR 67966, 67972 (Clean Water Act NPDES) (December 22, 1993).



2. Capability



EPA must continue to make a separate determination of tribal capability for each program for which it approves a tribe.
However, the Safe Drinking Water Act, Water Quality Standards, and section 404 regulations would be amended to conform
to the CWA grant regulations, which do not specifically prescribe the material a tribe must submit to establish capability.
Ordinarily, the inquiry EPA will make into the capability of any applicant, tribal or state, for a grant or program
approval would be sufficient to enable the Agency to determine whether a tribe meets the statutory capability requirement.
See, e.g., 40 CFR part 31 (grant regulations applicable to states and tribes); 40 CFR 142.3 (Public Water System primary
enforcement responsibility requirements at parts 141, 142 apply to tribes); 145.1(h) (Underground Injection Control
requirements of parts 124, 144, 145, and 146 that apply to states generally apply to tribes).

Nevertheless, EPA may request that the tribe provide a narrative statement or other documents showing that the tribe
is capable of administering the program for which it is seeking approval. In evaluating tribal capability, EPA will
consider: (1) The tribe's previous management experience; (2) existing environmental or public health programs
administered by the tribe; (3) the mechanisms in place for carrying out the executive, legislative and judicial functions
of the tribal government; (4) the relationship between regulated entities and the administrative agency of the tribal
government which will be the regulator; and (5) the technical and administrative capabilities of the staff to administer
and manage the program.

EPA recognizes that certain tribes may not have substantial experience administering environmental programs;
a lack of such experience will not preclude a tribe from demonstrating capability, so long as it shows that it has the
necessary management and technical and related skills or submits a plan describing how it will acquire those skills.

IV. Summary of Revised Process 



Under the new process, tribes will continue to seek grants under the authority of statutes authorizing EPA to treat
eligible tribes in a manner similar to that in which it treats states. For instance, tribes seeking approval of an NPDES
or Wetlands permits program will comply with the applicable provisions of 40 CFR parts 123 or 233. However, tribes
will now generally be required to submit only a single application to demonstrate eligibility for the grant, without
the need for a separate application for ``TAS.'' EPA will verify that the tribe meets all statutory prerequisites
for eligibility in the process of reviewing the single tribal application. 

EPA believes that the changes outlined in this notice will simplify and streamline the process of assessing tribal
eligibility while still ensuring full compliance with all applicable statutes. The Agency expects that the new process
will reduce the burdens and barriers to tribes of participating in environmental management. 



V. Executive Order 12866 



OMB has reviewed this action under the terms of Executive Order 12886. 



VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



EPA did not develop a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for the amendments in this rule. This is because they are exempt
from notice and comment rulemaking under section 553(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2))
and therefore are not subject to the analytical requirements of sections 603 and 604 of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). 



VII. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The proposed regulations contain no new or additional information collection activities and, therefore, no information
collection request will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in compliance with the Paperwork
Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Reclassification of the Sacramento River Winter-Run Chinook Salmon
From Threatened to Endangered Status 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Service is reclassifying the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon (

Oncorhynchus tshawytscha

) from threatened to endangered status. This measure, required by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), reflects
a final determination of endangered status by the National Marine Fisheries Service, which has jurisdiction for
the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), and in accordance with Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970,
the National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of
Commerce, is responsible for the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon. Under section 4(a)(2)(A) of the Act,
NMFS must decide whether a species under its jurisdiction should be changed in status from a threatened species to
an endangered species. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is responsible for the actual addition of a species to the
List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in 50 CFR 17.11(h). 


NMFS published its determination of endangered status for the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon on January
4, 1994 (59 FR 440). Accordingly, the FWS is revising the status of the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon
from threatened to endangered on the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. Because this action of the FWS is
nondiscretionary, and in view of the public comment period provided by NMFS on the proposed reclassification (June
19, 1992; 57 FR 27416), the FWS finds that good cause exists to omit the notice and public comment procedures of 5 U.S.C.
553(b) and to make this action effective on March 23, 1994.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Determination of Endangered Status for the Plant Ipomopsis Sancti-Spiritus
(Holy Ghost Ipomopsis)


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines the plant 

Ipomopsis sancti-spiritus 

(Holy Ghost ipomopsis) is an endangered species, under the authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act),
as amended. This species occurs at a single location in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, San Miguel County, New Mexico.
Its survival is threatened by limited distribution, low plant numbers, the proximity of development, and intensity
of human activity in the area. Potential threats include road maintenance, chemical herbicide and pesticide use,
biological pest controls, and any natural or manmade factors that would reduce the already low numbers or significantly
alter the habitat. This action will implement Federal protection provided by the Act for Holy Ghost ipomopsis. Critical
habitat is not being designated.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background




Ipomopsis sancti-spiritus 

(Holy Ghost ipomopsis) is an erect, biennial to short-lived perennial plant, known only from the Sangre de Cristo
Mountains of San Miguel County, in north central New Mexico. It was first collected by Dr. Edward F. Castetter in 1929.
Mr. Reggie Fletcher, U.S.D.A. Forest Service, collected the species in 1977. Wilken and Fletcher (1988) later described
the plant as a species distinct from the closely related 

Ipomopsis aggregata.
The Holy Ghost ipomopsis is a member of the phlox family (Polemoniaceae). It is 30-80 centimeters (cm) (12-31
inches (in)) tall, with mostly solitary stems, occasionally branched from the base. The leaves are oval in outline,
3-6 cm (1-2.4 in) long, with 9-15 linear divisions. The basal leaves form a loose to compact rosette
that dies back at flowering. The leaves are gradually reduced in size up the length of the stem. The flowers are tubular,
pink, and about 2-2.5 cm (0.8-1 in) long. The stamens do not extend beyond the corolla tube.
The Holy Ghost ipomopsis occurs at an elevation of approximately 2,440 meters (m) (8,000 feet (ft)). The species is
found only in a 3.2-kilometer (km) (2-mile (mi)) segment of a canyon in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The plants are
restricted to steep, south- or southwest-facing slopes, primarily in openings under ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa

), Douglas fir (

Pseudotsuga menziesii

), Gambel oak (

Quercus gambellii

), and quaking aspen (

Populus tremuloides

). The substrate is a sandy to pebbly limestone conglomerate derived from the Terrero and Espritu Santo formations
(Wilken and Fletcher 1988).
The plant grows in small openings or clearings on the forested slopes, and it is likely that fire may have played a role
in the past in maintaining open habitat for this species. Plants have colonized the cut-and-fill slopes of a Forest
Service road, indicating some preference for open, disturbed areas. The entire population of the Holy Ghost ipomopsis
consists of approximately 1,200-2,500 plants, located on Forest Service and private lands within the boundaries
of the Santa Fe National Forest. Approximately 80 percent of the population occupies the cut-and-fill slopes along
a Forest Service road; the remaining 20 percent of the population occurs on the natural dry and open habitat higher
up on the canyon slopes.
Most of the occupied habitat is along a Forest Service road that provides access to summer homes and Forest Service
campgrounds. In this location, the plants and their habitat are vulnerable to harm from road maintenance, wildfire,
fire management, and possible pesticide spraying. Surveys conducted by Forest Service personnel and New Mexico
Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department botanists within a 24-km (15-mi) radius of the known population
have failed to locate any additional populations of the species (Sivinski and Lightfoot 1991).

The Holy Ghost ipomopsis was included as a Category 2 candidate species in a February 21, 1990, notice of plants under
review for classification as threatened or endangered species (55 FR 6184). Category 2 includes those taxa for which
available information indicates that proposing to list them as endangered or threatened may be appropriate, but
for which there are insufficient data to support listing proposals at this time. A status report was completed on the
Holy Ghost ipomopsis in 1991 (Sivinski and Lightfoot 1991). This report, along with other available data, provided
sufficient biological information to justify proposing to list the Holy Ghost ipomopsis as endangered. On September
22, 1992, the Service published in the 

Federal Register

 a proposed rule to list this species as endangered (57 FR 43682). A notice of public hearing and reopening of the comment
period was published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 4144) on January 13, 1993, and a public hearing was held on January 27, 1993.


Summary of Comments and Recommendations


In the September 22, 1992, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to
submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final action on this species.
Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested
parties were contacted and requested to comment. A newspaper notice inviting public comment was published in the
Santa Fe New Mexican on September 30, 1992. The public comment period was reopened and extended until February 23,
1993, in order to accommodate a request for a public hearing. Newspaper notices announcing the public hearing and
extending the comment period were published in the Las Vegas Daily Optic on December 23, 1992, and in the Santa Fe New
Mexican on January 1, 1993.
A total of 11 written comments were received within the proposed rule comment period. One Federal agency and one State
agency supported the proposal. Of the four individuals who commented on the proposal, three supported it and one opposed
it. Five private organizations commented on the proposal; three supported it, one opposed it, and one was neutral.
A public hearing was requested by Mr. Bert Turner, President of the Mora/San Juan County Farm and Livestock Bureau,
Wagon Mound, New Mexico. The hearing was held at the Public Employees Retirement Association Building, Santa Fe,
New Mexico, on January 27, 1993, with 21 people attending. Nine oral comments were presented at the hearing. One comment
was supportive, three were in opposition, and five were neutral.
Written comments received during the comment period and oral statements presented at the public hearing are covered
in the following summary. Comments of a similar nature or point are grouped into a number of general issues. These issues,
and the Service's response to each, are discussed below.


Issue 1: 

Why was the public hearing held in the middle of winter rather than in the summer, when more of the nonresident owners
of the summer homes could attend and people could see the plant?


Response: 

The Act requires that a public hearing be held promptly if requested within 45 days after the date of publication of
the proposed rule. The Service received a public hearing request on October 21, 1992, and scheduled the hearing for
January 27, 1993. A delay would have violated the requirement to hold the hearing promptly and would have made it difficult
to prepare a final action on the proposed rule within the 1-year deadline mandated by the Act.


Issue 2: 

Why wasn't the public hearing held in Pecos, New Mexico, instead of Santa Fe, New Mexico?


Response: 

Service policy dictates that, if requested, a public hearing will be held within the general area in which the species
occurs. Santa Fe was thought to be the most convenient location for the public hearing.


Issue 3: 

Why were the homeowners' association and adjacent landowners not notified about the upcoming public hearing?

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940323-0-00091 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940323-0-00023 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response: 

The Act requires notification of various parties at certain stages in the rulemaking process. The Service attempts
to notify all interested parties of all notices and rules and to solicit data and comments when appropriate. Notification
is provided and comments solicited by correspondence, public hearings (if requested), newspaper notices, press
releases, and 

Federal Register

 notices. Newspaper notices were published in the Las Vegas Daily Optic on December 23, 1992, and in the Santa Fe New
Mexican on January 1, 1993. Both are newspapers of general circulation within the vicinity of Pecos, New Mexico. A
notice of the upcoming hearing was also published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 13, 1993 (58 FR 4144). 


In cases where numerous landowners are involved, the Service attempts to contact the major owners. The Santa Fe National
Forest, which contains most of the known Holy Ghost ipomopsis plants, was notified of the public hearing. Several
individuals in the local area were notified in writing of the public hearing. The former president of the homeowners'
association was advised by telephone on November 30, 1992, and was later sent a letter (January 13, 1993), notifying
him of the proposed listing and upcoming hearing. 



Issue 4: 

Is Holy Ghost ipomopsis a distinct species? 



Response: 

The senior author of the paper describing Holy Ghost ipomopsis as a species is a leading authority on the phlox family
(Polemoniaceae), of which Holy Ghost ipomopsis is a member. The paper (Wilken and Fletcher 1988) was published in
a peer-reviewed journal and met the general professional requirements for naming new species. The paper has been
reviewed by Service botanists and others who find no reason to doubt Wilken and Fletcher's findings. Also, Wolf et
al. (1991), using electrophoretic enzyme analysis, confirmed that Holy Ghost ipomopsis is a distinct species. 



Issue 5: 

Does unique flower coloration make Holy Ghost ipomopsis a distinct species? 



Response: 

This species is unique among plants of the genus 

Ipomopsis 

in having pink-purple flowers, but even more significant are the anatomical differences. The flower's ovary and
stigma are shorter in Holy Ghost ipomopsis than in any other species in the genus. 



Issue 6: 

Were enough field surveys conducted to determine that Holy Ghost ipomopsis has a very restricted distribution? 



Response: 

Wilken and Fletcher (1988) surveyed within a 24-km (15-mi) radius of the known locality for this species in July 1986,
but failed to locate additional plants. Dr. Wilken visited the area and adjacent areas at least three times in 1987,
1989, and 1990, but failed to locate additional plants in similar habitats in either the Pecos River drainage or adjoining
drainages in eastern Santa Fe County, southeastern Taos County, or western San Miguel County (Dieter Wilken, Colorado
State University, 

in litt.

, 1992). He also conducted an exhaustive search of U.S. herbaria and failed to locate any additional collections of
this species. The State of New Mexico (Sivinski 1991) also surveyed for Holy Ghost ipomopsis but failed to find additional
plants. The Service believes sufficient searches have been made to confirm that Holy Ghost ipomopsis is a very rare
species. However, the Service also believes that other natural populations may be found and will likely recommend
additional searches as part of the recovery program for the species. 



Issue 7: 

Two other possible populations of Holy Ghost ipomopsis were mentioned at the public hearing, one between Glorieta
and Pecos, New Mexico, and one near the Grand Canyon in Arizona. 



Response: 

The Service relies on the best available biological information when determining to propose or list a species as endangered
or threatened. No reference to either of these populations was available in the literature or through contacts with
botanists who are familiar with the species. The State of New Mexico surveyed between Glorieta and Pecos during the
summer of 1993, but no Holy Ghost ipomopsis was found (Robert Sivinski, New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources
Department, pers. comm., 1993). There is no way to verify the location or the identity of the plant from the Grand Canyon.
However, Arizona has been botanically explored for at least 100 years, and if Holy Ghost ipomopsis did occur there,
it is likely that a specimen would have been collected, deposited in a herbarium, and then noted during Dr. Wilken's
examination of herbarium specimens. 



Issue 8: 

Is 

Bacillus thuringiensis 

(BT) a threat to Holy Ghost ipomopsis? 



Response: 

The biological pest control BT is commonly used for outbreaks of spruce budworm. Both the U.S. Forest Service and the
State of New Mexico (Forestry and Resources Conservation Division of the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources
Department) have used BT to control spruce budworm in New Mexico. Because of the anatomical characteristics of its
flowers, Holy Ghost ipomopsis is thought to be pollinated by various moths and butterflies, which are highly susceptible
to BT. Elimination of these pollinators could reduce seed production and seedling recruitment, and contribute to
a decline in the population and range of Holy Ghost ipomopsis.

<PARENT> FR940323-0-00023 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Issue 9: 

The Forest Service's use of BT, a biological pest control, was listed as a primary threat to Holy Ghost ipomopsis in
the proposed rule, yet no such activities have taken place on the Santa Fe National Forest for over 25 years. 



Response: 

One commenter stated that the area was sprayed with BT in the 1980's. Although the Forest Service has no current plans
to use BT, the potential to destroy the lepidopteran pollinators for Holy Ghost ipomopsis still exists. The State
of New Mexico has also been involved in spraying BT for control of spruce budworm infestation on private property in
New Mexico. 



Issue 10: 

How will the listing of Holy Ghost ipomopsis restrict recreation, wilderness and campground access, or existing
cabin leases in the area? 



Response: 

The Service believes that listing will have little, if any, impact on recreation, wilderness and campground access,
and cabin leases. The Service will work with the Forest Service to minimize possible adverse impacts to the species
from human activities in Holy Ghost ipomopsis habitat. 



Issue 11: 

Listing the Holy Ghost ipomopsis will not provide any more protection for this species than it already receives under
Forest Service management. 



Response: 

Holy Ghost ipomopsis is currently protected under the State of New Mexico Endangered Plant Species Act (75-6-1
NMSA) and is on the U.S. Forest Service's Sensitive Species List. Even so, it does not have the same degree of protection
and management as a federally listed species. Listing under the Endangered Species Act promotes recovery through
the development and implementation of a recovery plan, provides additional management opportunities by drawing
attention to the species and its habitat requirements, creates the requirement for interagency consultation through
the section 7 process, and makes it illegal, with possibly severe penalties, to maliciously damage, destroy, or remove
and possess plants from lands under Federal jurisdiction. 



Issue 12: 

A commercial nursery has Holy Ghost ipomopsis under cultivation. 



Response: 

Apparently, propagation material was obtained several years ago by a commercial grower of native plants. Nursery
propagation of this material could provide a commercial source for Holy Ghost ipomopsis plants, and thus help conserve
this species by discouraging the collection or digging of plants from wild populations. Propagation knowledge gained
by the commercial grower may be of considerable value in establishing a refugial population or in reestablishing
populations in natural habitat within the species' historic range. 



Issue 13: 

Critical habitat should be designated and an economic analysis should be done. Although critical habitat was not
proposed for Holy Ghost ipomopsis because of a perceived threat from overcollection that could be worsened by publication
of critical habitat locality maps, this species can be located from available information.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940323-0-00093 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940323-0-00023 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response: 

Overcollection of plants with unusual coloration or showy flowers is a real threat. Horticulturists and rare plant
enthusiasts are constantly looking for new plants for commercial use. Locality information for this species is available
in the scientific literature; however, the Service does not wish to attract additional or undue attention to the exact
location of Holy Ghost ipomopsis populations by publication of maps in the 

Federal Register

. An analysis of economic impacts is required for critical habitat designation, but cannot be considered for the species'
listing itself. Nor can a decision not to list a species be based on economic considerations. A decision not to list
a species or to delist a species can only be made if the Service determines, based on the best scientific and commercial
information available, that listing is not warranted. Because the Service has determined that critical habitat
designation is not prudent, no economic analysis is required. 


Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 


After a thorough review and consideration of all information available, the Service has determined that Holy Ghost
ipomopsis should be classified as an endangered species. Procedures found at section 4(a)(1) of the Act (16 U.S.C.
1531 

et seq.

) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species
may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section
4(a)(1). These factors and their application to 

Ipomopsis sancti-spiritus 

Wilken and Fletcher (Holy Ghost ipomopsis) are as follows: 
A. 

The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range. 

The Holy Ghost ipomopsis occurs in an area that has been heavily used for recreation for at least the last 50 years. This
use includes approximately 36 recreation cabins and a Forest Service campground. A nearby trout stream receives
significant use by anglers. These high-use recreational values have been protected by the almost complete exclusion
of timber harvests and forest fires. As the forest has become more mature and natural openings less numerous, the majority
of the known population of the Holy Ghost ipomopsis has become associated with the manmade disturbance associated
with the Forest Service road. 
Road maintenance poses a potential threat to the species. An example is a nearby Forest Service road that was graveled
using crushed waste rock from an abandoned mine. The sulfides in this mine waste created highly acid road runoff that
killed the surrounding vegetation. If this or other toxic materials were used for the Forest Service road occupied
by Holy Ghost ipomopsis, those portions of occupied habitat would no longer be suitable for the species. Although
Forest Service roads in the area are not presently sprayed with herbicides, this type of weed control could be a future
maintenance threat. The Forest Service road occupied by Holy Ghost ipomopsis was straightened and paved in 1989.
The 111 plants that would have been destroyed by the activity were moved in mid-June of that year to similar habitat
at Elk Mountain. None of the transplants survived. 
The control of spruce budworm is a potential threat to pollinators of Holy Ghost ipomopsis. The spruce budworm is a
moth larva that can defoliate large areas of spruce and Douglas fir. When infestations occur in residential areas,
the State of New Mexico receives numerous requests for large area aerial broadcast of 

Bacillus thuringiensis 

as a pesticide. This pesticide kills not only the spruce budworm moth, but all other lepidopterans including those
that serve as pollinators for the Holy Ghost ipomopsis. If this treatment were repeated for more than one year, it might
have a serious impact on seed production and population recruitment for this short-lived species. 
B. 

Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. 

No economic uses for the Holy Ghost ipomopsis are known. However, the low population numbers make the species vulnerable
to harm from both scientific and non-scientific collecting. The species produces a very attractive flower, which
may make the plants more likely to be picked by visitors to the canyon. If the plants become well known, there may be interest
in propagating the species for commercial purposes.

<TEXT>
 

C. 

Disease or predation. 

No significant disease or predation has been observed for this species. 
D. 

The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. 

There is no Federal law that protects the Holy Ghost ipomopsis. The plant is protected by the New Mexico Endangered
Plant Species Act. Any person wishing to collect a species listed under this Act for the purposes of scientific investigation,
documenting a new population, or transplanting must first obtain a permit from the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and
Natural Resources Department. The Forest Service has included the Holy Ghost ipomopsis on its Sensitive Plant Species
List. The species is considered in Forest Service environmental assessments and planning. The Endangered Species
Act would provide additional protection for this species through section 7 (interagency cooperation) requirements
and through section 9, which prohibits malicious damage, destruction, or removal and reduction to possession of
plants occurring on lands under Federal jurisdiction. 
E. 

Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. 

Low numbers and limited distribution make this species vulnerable to extinction from natural and manmade threats.
Reduction in plant numbers could reduce the reproductive capabilities and genetic potential of the species. 
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by this species in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,
the preferred action is to list Holy Ghost ipomopsis as endangered without critical habitat. This status is appropriate
because of the species' limited distribution, low population numbers, proximity of human development, and intensity
of human use of the area. Potential threats include road maintenance, habitat alteration, pesticide application,
and fire suppression. Critical habitat is not being designated for the reasons discussed below. 


Critical Habitat 


Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
designate critical habitat at the time a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that
designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent for this species. Pursuant to 50 CFR 424.12(a)(1), a designation
of critical habitat is not prudent when one or both of the following situations exist_(1) the species is threatened
by taking or other human activity, and identification of critical habitat can be expected to increase the degree of
such threat to the species, or (2) such designation of critical habitat would not be beneficial to the species. As discussed
under Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species,'' Holy Ghost ipomopsis is threatened by taking,
an activity that is difficult to prevent and only regulated by the Act with respect to plants in cases of (1) removal
and reduction to possession of listed plants from lands under Federal jurisdiction, or their malicious damage or
destruction on such lands; and (2) removal, cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroying in knowing violation of
any state law or regulation, including state criminal trespass law. Such provisions are difficult to enforce, and
publication of critical habitat descriptions and maps would make Holy Ghost ipomopsis more vulnerable and increase
enforcement problems. All involved parties and principal landowners have been notified of the location and importance
of protecting this species' habitat. Protection of this species' habitat will be addressed through the recovery
process and through section 7 consultation. Therefore, it would not now be prudent to determine critical habitat
for Holy Ghost ipomopsis. 


Available Conservation Measures 


Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Act include recognition,
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition
through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups,
and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that
recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions
against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below. 
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of a listed species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action
may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation
with the Service.

Possible future Federal actions that could affect Holy Ghost ipomopsis on the Santa Fe National Forest include road
construction and maintenance, aerial spraying of 

Bacillus thuringiensis 

to control spruce budworm infestations, and fire suppression within the habitat area. 

The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 set forth a series of general prohibitions
and exceptions that apply to all endangered plants. All trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented
by 50 CFR 17.61, apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the
United States to import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity,
sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce, or remove and reduce to possession the species from areas
under Federal jurisdiction. In addition, for endangered plants, the Act prohibits the malicious damage or destruction
on Federal lands and the removal, cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroying of such plants in knowing violation
of any State law or regulation, including State criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service
and State conservation agencies. 

The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities
involving endangered species under certain circumstances. Such permits are available for scientific purposes
and to enhance the propagation or survival of the species. It is anticipated that few trade permits would ever be sought
or issued because Holy Ghost ipomopsis is not common in cultivation or in the wild. However, because of its beautiful
and uniquely colored flowers, local demands for garden cultivation may increase as the species becomes better known.
Requests for copies of the regulations on listed species and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits may be
addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, room 420C, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive,
Arlington, Virginia 22203 (703/541-2104; FAX 703/358-2281). 



National Environmental Policy Act 



The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that Environmental Assessments and Environmental Impact Statements,
as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection
with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining
the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations to increase certain cost-of-living allowance
(COLA) rates paid to General Schedule, U.S. Postal Service, and certain other Federal employees in Guam and the Commonwealth
of the Northern Mariana Islands; the City and County of Honolulu, Hawaii; and St. Thomas and St. John, Virgin Islands.
The increases are based on living cost surveys conducted by Runzheimer International, under contract with OPM, during
the summer of 1992 and winter of 1993.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under section 5941 of title 5, United States Code, certain Federal employees in nonforeign areas outside the 48 contiguous
States are eligible for cost-of-living allowances (COLAs) when local living costs are substantially higher than
those in Washington, DC. Currently, nonforeign area COLAs are paid in the following locations: Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto
Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. 



OPM contracted with Runzheimer International to conduct living cost surveys in the allowance areas in 1992 and 1993.
All allowance areas, except those in Alaska, were surveyed in the summer of 1992. Alaska was surveyed during the winter
of 1993. 

The surveys showed that adjustments in various COLA rates were warranted. This included increases of three COLA rates
in three allowance areas and reductions of eight COLA rates in six allowance areas. However, a provision in the Treasury,
Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-141) bars OPM from reducing
any COLA rate through December 31, 1995. Therefore, only the COLA rate increases will be implemented. 

The increases implemented by this rulemaking are summarized in the following table:

On August 30, 1993, OPM published proposed regulations 
(58 FR 45556) that would effect the above increases in COLA rates. On the same day, OPM published a notice (58 FR 45558)
that included Runzheimer's ``Report to OPM on Living Costs in Selected Nonforeign Areas and in the Washington, DC
Area, May 1993.'' In response to the proposed regulations and notice, OPM received comments from nearly 250 persons.
An analysis of the comments follows. 



General Comments 



One commenter stated that OPM did not comply with provisions of the Treasury, Postal, and General Government Appropriations
Act 1992 (Pub. L. 102-141) as these provisions apply to COLA. This law requires that OPM study living cost issues
and submit to Congress a report on possible changes in the COLA methodology. The report is due March 1, 1995. The commenter
believes that the law directs OPM to make changes in the COLA model before 1995. 

OPM's General Counsel carefully reviewed Pub. L. 102-141 and the related Senate Appropriations Committee
report. The General Counsel determined that the law has two requirements: (1) COLA rates may not be reduced through
December 31, 1995, and (2) OPM must submit a report to Congress on possible changes to the COLA methodology. The law
does not direct OPM to implement methodological changes at this time.

The Senate Committee, however, requested that OPM research specific methodological issues. This OPM is doing, and
OPM plans to include the results of this research in its report to Congress. Although the law does not require OPM to
implement changes, OPM will continue to make improvements in the COLA methodology as appropriate. 

Another commenter said that OPM regulations should describe in greater detail the COLA model and survey. The commenter
also stated that all of the data collected should be made public. 

OPM believes that its COLA regulations are adequately detailed and that any attempt to subject the COLA survey process
to a set of overly detailed and inflexible rules would impair rather than improve the COLA program. The flexibility
results in a more accurate COLA model because improvements can be made from one year to the next. Such changes are made
public because, before COLA rates are adjusted, OPM publishes in the Federal Register

 a detailed report on the survey methodology and results. Therefore, employees have the opportunity to comment on
any changes.

OPM does not publish all of the raw data collected in the survey because of the tremendous volume of data. As Runzheimer
stated in its report, over 16,000 price quotes were collected. The report, however, provides detailed information
on the results of the survey. In addition, OPM provides to those who request it additional data to the extent authorized
under the Freedom of Information Act. 

One commenter referred to the confidentiality statement on the information collection materials that was included
in Appendix 5 of the report. The confidentiality statement says that the Government will hold all micro or ``raw''
data in confidence. The commenter stated that OPM should not keep secret the survey data that it collects. 

Runzheimer inadvertently included an obsolete version of the information collection materials in Appendix 5. This
version was not used in the surveys. OPM's policy is to release ``raw'' or micro data to the extent authorized under
the Freedom of Information Act. In conducting OPM's surveys, Runzheimer does 

not 

pledge to hold confidential the survey data unless such data are covered by the provisions of the Freedom of Information
Act that allow certain data to be held in confidence. 

One commenter stated that the model was inappropriate and said that OPM should measure differences in levels of living
rather than differences in prices. 

Comparison of levels of living implies comparing lifestyles and that involves comparing differences in needs and
preferences. This is a highly subjective area because one person's ``need'' might be another person's luxury. OPM
is examining this complex issue and plans to include a discussion of it in its report to Congress. 

One commenter stated that OPM should include a component to compensate employees for the allowance area's remoteness
and isolation. He suggested that 5 percentage points be added to all COLA rates to reflect intangible living costs
caused by remoteness and isolation. The commenter did not provide an example of an intangible living cost. 

OPM does not know what the commenter meant by the term ``intangible living costs.'' The commenter may have been referring
to monetary costs that are difficult to measure, or he may have been referring to nonmonetary factors, such as hardship
and inconvenience. 

OPM believes that the COLA model adequately measures differences in monetary costs, although improvements and refinements
in the model may be possible. For example, OPM is researching certain additional items, particularly those that might
be purchased more frequently in remote areas. These items include air transportation, out-of-area college and university
education, and extraordinary medical expenses. OPM is looking at ways the tangible cost of these items might be included
in the COLA model and plans to address this issue in its report to Congress. 

OPM believes, however, that nonmonetary factors, such as hardship and inconvenience, should not be part of the COLA
program. There are other programs that compensate Federal employees for such circumstances. 

One commenter maintained that an item needed in an allowance area, but not needed in Washington, DC, should be priced
only in the allowance area. The commenter said that the frequency of need also should be a factor. 

Generally, the model compares the cost of an item in an allowance area with the cost for the same item in the DC area. OPM
believes that this is consistent with the settlement of 

Hector Arana, et al. 

v. 

United States, 

in which the plaintiffs asked that OPM adopt a methodology that compared specified brands, models, and sizes whenever
possible. 

Nevertheless, the COLA model does reflect some differences between areas. For example, the model assumes that cars
in Alaska have certain accessories, such as engine block heaters, that are not common in the DC area. Also, differences
in home construction (e.g., triple pane windows and greater wall insulation common in Alaska) are included in the
model to the extent that these differences are reflected in real estate prices. OPM is researching related issues
and plans to address them in its report to Congress. 

A few commenters objected to the use of national consumer expenditure patterns in the living cost model. The commenters
believed that local consumption patterns should be used. More than one commenter noted that the spending pattern
data were old. 

To compare living costs between areas, Runzheimer assigned a common set of weights to each item, category, and component.
These weights reflect how consumers spend their money and were used to derive comparative indices measuring overall
living costs. Runzheimer used Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) nationwide Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) data
for these weights. 

As discussed in the report, the COLA model uses an indexing methodology similar to the Laspeyres index. As the report
also notes, it would be preferable to use Washington, DC, consumer expenditure data with the Laspeyres approach.
Washington, DC, CES data, however, are not available by income level, and OPM regulations require measurement of
living costs at multiple income levels. On the other hand, nationwide CES data are arrayed by income level. Therefore,
Runzheimer used these data in the COLA model. 

CES data are also available for Honolulu and Anchorage; but as with the Washington, DC, data, the Honolulu and Anchorage
data are not available by income level. BLS CES data are not available for any other nonforeign area (outside the 48
contiguous States), and OPM knows of no other source of comprehensive consumer expenditure information by income
level suitable for use in the COLA model. Therefore, the use of local weights is not practical. 

Both OPM and Runzheimer recognize that the CES data are old. OPM is developing a methodology to introduce gradually
more recent CES data into the model. OPM plans to use this approach beginning with the surveys to be conducted in the
summer of 1994. 

One commenter suggested that the COLA model be simplified to use only one income level. The commenter believed that
using only one income level would reduce survey costs and the number of subjective assumptions required. 

As noted earlier, OPM's regulations require the measurement of living costs at multiple income levels. This approach
recognizes that relative living costs may vary by income level and that the distribution of employees by income level
may vary among areas. Therefore, the multiple income approach yields a more accurate measure of overall living cost
differences than a single income approach. 

Nevertheless, to the extent that multiple income levels require additional subjective assumptions, the overall
integrity of the model might not be impaired by using a single income level. OPM is examining this issue and plans to
include its findings in the report to Congress. 

One commenter objected to Runzheimer's recommendation that OPM include income taxes in the COLA model. The commenter
believed that this would unduly complicate the model and argued that it would also be necessary to compare the level
of government services available in each area. Another commenter, however, stated that income taxes were high in
Hawaii and recommended that income taxes be included in the model.

OPM is studying Runzheimer's recommendation and issues relating to Federal, State, and local income taxes and plans
to include the results of this study in its report to Congress. 

A few commenters seemed to have confused the annual living cost surveys with the special Federal Employee Housing
and Living Patterns Survey, which OPM conducted in the winter of 1992/1993. The commenters said they could not see
how Runzheimer had incorporated the results of the employee survey in calculating living cost indices. 

As OPM stated in the preface to the employee survey, the purpose of the survey was to collect information that would
be used to improve the COLA model. The preface made it clear that the results of the survey would not be used directly
to set COLA rates. 

OPM is now in the process of analyzing the results of the employee survey. It is expected that these analyses will allow
OPM to identify the subdivisions and communities in which Federal employees live, the types of housing expenses they
incur, the kinds of stores they frequent, their transportation needs, and so on. OPM plans to use this information
in the design of future COLA surveys to reflect more closely Federal employee living costs. The information will also
aid OPM as it studies the COLA methodology and prepares its report to Congress. 



Comments on the Goods and Services Component 



A commenter from Hawaii said that Federal employees on Oahu did not make many catalog purchases. In contrast, an employee
from Maui stated that she made many catalog purchases. Likewise, a St. Croix resident wrote that Virgin Island employees
made frequent catalog purchases. 

OPM asked Runzheimer to include a limited number of catalog items in the survey because catalogs are a common source
of retail goods and are used by many persons in all areas, including the Washington, DC, area. Of course, all catalog
prices surveyed included shipping costs and any applicable local sales and excise taxes. Catalog pricing also allows
better comparisons of items that would otherwise be difficult to compare. For example, some furniture items were
priced in catalogs because finding comparable styles, brands, and models in earlier surveys proved difficult. 

In the employee survey, OPM asked Federal employees about their purchasing patterns including whether they typically
purchased various types of items by catalog. OPM plans to use this information in designing future surveys and in its
report to Congress on possible changes in the COLA methodology. 

One commenter believed that catalog pricing understated price differences between the allowance area and the Washington,
DC, area. The commenter said that in the DC area consumers could buy an item locally if catalog prices were relatively
high but that in the allowance areas consumers frequently did not have that choice. 

Many of the items that Runzheimer priced by catalog are not sold locally unless the catalog retailer also has a local
retail outlet and that outlet carries the same item. If the item is sold locally by the retailer, it is usually sold at
a price comparable to the catalog price, unless the item is on sale in either the catalog or in the retail store. Since
Runzheimer does not survey sale prices, the use of catalog pricing probably does not cause bias. 

Another commenter questioned whether representative types of stores were surveyed in the allowance areas. He believed
that stores frequented in the allowance areas could be significantly different from those frequented in the Washington,
DC, area. He also stated that there was only one ``warehouse-type'' grocery store on Oahu and that, because this outlet
was less accessible than others, it was inappropriate to include it in the survey. 

Runzheimer surveyed prices at the largest, most popular stores in each area. These stores included major grocery
stores, department stores, discount stores, and specialty stores. OPM believes that this process is objective and
leads to an equitable comparison of typical prices between areas. 

In addition, Runzheimer selects outlets that are apt to be frequented by residents of the living communities in which
housing is surveyed. At times, a balance between the types of outlets and their proximity to certain living communities
is difficult to achieve. During the 1992 survey on Oahu, the grocery store in question was included in the survey. Subsequently,
it was determined that this store was probably located outside the area normally frequented by residents of the living
communities covered by the survey. Therefore, for the 1993 survey a different outlet was selected to replace the one
in question. Since there were no other ``warehouse-type'' outlets on Oahu, the new outlet was a conventional, large
supermarket. 

In the employee survey, OPM asked Federal employees where they lived, where they shopped, what they purchased, and
so on. The survey included specific questions on the kinds of stores employees frequented. OPM plans to use the results
of the employee survey to review outlet selection and make changes as appropriate. 

One commenter criticized Runzheimer for not considering the cost of college and university education in the living
cost surveys. The commenter stated that due to limited post-high school educational opportunities in the allowance
areas, Federal employees must send their children to out-of-area schools. 

Runzheimer noted in the report that post-high school educational opportunities vary significantly among the allowance
areas. Most of the allowance areas, however, have colleges or universities in the major population areas, and many
of these institutions offer a wide range of degree programs. Nevertheless, Federal employees may send their children
to out-of-area schools.

Without additional information about the frequency of use of within-area and out-of-area schools, it is not appropriate
to include post-high school education expense in the COLA model. In the employee survey, OPM asked employees several
questions about college and university usage. OPM plans to use the results of the employee survey to review the issue
of post-high school education. OPM is also researching the cost of within-area and out-of-area tuition, books, room
and board, transportation, and related expenses. OPM plans to include the results of this research and the employee
survey in its report to Congress.

Several commenters questioned whether Runzheimer's survey adequately covered childcare expenses. An employee
from Alaska stated that her childcare costs were high and accounted for a large percentage of her total budget.

Two kinds of childcare are included in the survey_day care and babysitting. Runzheimer prices the monthly cost of
professional day care services (eight hours a day, five days a week). Runzheimer also obtains the price of casual babysitting
services. Both are assigned appropriate weights based on the CES and are used in the COLA model.



Comments on the Housing Component



Some commenters objected to trimming the high and low values in the housing component. The commenters believed that
housing market price anomalies should be tolerated or that another approach should be used to reduce these anomalies.

As was stated in the report, the purpose of trimming was to stabilize the housing data from one year to the next. Trimming
is essentially a nonparametric technique, similar to using the median rather than the average. OPM and Runzheimer
considered using the median but rejected it because the limited number of observations obtained in some smaller allowance
areas could cause the median to be erratic from one year to the next. Runzheimer recommended trimming as an alternative
to the median, and OPM agreed. Trimming provides stability; and because equal numbers of high and low values are trimmed,
no bias is introduced.

Another commenter objected to the comparison of new and older home prices combined. He felt that the survey should
compare the prices of homes of a similar age as well as a similar size and room count.

Numerous factors influence rents and selling prices. Information on some of these factors is readily available,
but much of it is not. Runzheimer uses home size and room count as the major criteria in housing comparisons because
these factors generally have the most influence on housing costs. Age is not used because it frequently is not available
and probably has less influence.

One commenter from Alaska noted the high cost of her new home in Alaska. She also said that the cost of drilling a deep
well significantly increased the cost of her new home.

Runzheimer surveys the selling price of homes that sold during the 6 month period prior to the survey. The selling price
generally reflects the cost of construction, including the cost of appurtenances such as water wells.

One commenter stated that the residential areas surveyed on Oahu did not properly reflect where Federal employees
live nor the income levels that Runzheimer associated with the communities.

OPM recognizes that community selection is an important part of the COLA survey. The communities surveyed in Hawaii
were changed in response to comments OPM received on earlier surveys. Additional changes may be warranted. OPM plans
to use the results of the employee survey to review community selection and make appropriate changes.

A commenter from Alaska stated that the cost of utilities was high and provided examples of her utility costs. She also
stated that utility costs vary with the size of the home.

Runzheimer included in the COLA surveys the cost of utilities. The average costs for Owners and Renters for each area
were shown in Appendix 7 of the report and were part of the 

Federal Register

 notice. As shown in the appendix, the cost of utilities is the second highest cost of housing, exceeded only by the cost
of mortgage payments or rent.

The COLA model takes into account that utility costs vary with home size. Section 4.2.4.1 of the report described the
process used and the factors that were applied.

One commenter stated that the survey failed to take into consideration the use of solar water heaters in Hawaii and
Guam. The commenter believed that the model did not account for the capital cost of such heaters nor the possible reduction
in overall utility consumption.

As noted above, significant home features and improvements generally are reflected in the selling price of the home.

Therefore, OPM's living cost surveys will reflect the cost of solar water heaters to the extent that such items influence
home market values and are commonly found on homes in any area, including Hawaii and Guam. If the use of solar water heaters
is so common that it generally reduces the consumption of utilities, this too will be reflected in the survey results.

<TEXT>
 

This is as it should be. The COLA model compares overall living costs in the allowance area with overall living costs
in the DC area. If housing is more expensive because solar heaters are common in an allowance area but not the DC area
and if overall utility costs are lower in the allowance area because solar heaters are used extensively but are not
used in the DC area, the final comparison of overall housing costs will be equitable. No special consideration of capital
improvement costs or reduced utility consumption is appropriate.

Several commenters noted that employees in the allowance areas face extreme weather disturbances, particularly
typhoons or hurricanes. The commenters stated that these weather disturbances create higher costs in home maintenance
and insurance.

Runzheimer surveys the cost of home insurance. If insurance costs increase after a major natural disaster, the COLA
surveys will reflect these higher costs. Other issues, such as the cost of repairing storm damage, are more difficult
to address in the surveys. Although it may be possible to price the cost of repairing or replacing an item such as a window
or a roof, it is difficult to know how often this must be done in each allowance area compared with the Washington, DC,
area. In the employee survey, OPM asked about storm damage, home maintenance, and frequency of repairs. OPM plans
to review this issue carefully in light of the results of the employee survey.

One commenter asserted that Federal employees frequently purchase disaster insurance (e.g., home insurance covering
damage caused by floods, storms, or earthquakes) and criticized Runzheimer for not including the cost of these additional
insurance riders.

Runzheimer interviews local insurance agents to obtain the cost of insurance in each area. In these interviews, Runzheimer
asked agents about disaster insurance and whether it was typically purchased by homeowners in the allowance area.
Runzheimer concluded from these interviews that such insurance is not typically purchased and, therefore, recommended
against including it in the COLA model. OPM agreed. However, questions regarding disaster insurance were included
in the employee survey. OPM plans to reevaluate this issue in light of the results of the employee survey and address
this issue in its report to Congress.

The same commenter noted that Runzheimer was unable to obtain the price of home insurance on Guam because insurance
companies had issued a temporary ``moratorium'' on the sales of new policies after Typhoon Omar. The commenter criticized
Runzheimer for using 1991 survey data in place of the missing data.

Runzheimer discussed the Guam insurance issue with OPM as soon as the issue arose. Because there was no indication
of the amount of any forthcoming rate increase or that rates would increase at all, Runzheimer and OPM believed that
it was inappropriate to adjust artificially the 1991 insurance rates. To the extent insurance companies adjusted
their rates after the moratorium, such rate changes were obtained in the following Guam survey and will be appropriately
reflected in the results of that survey.

One commenter questioned how Runzheimer obtained survey data in Kauai after Hurricane Iniki because the Runzheimer
researcher from the central office had not been allowed to visit the island.

Most of the living cost data are obtained by either: (1) Local data collectors who are residents of the area or (2) by
telephone research conducted from Runzheimer's central office. Senior personnel from Runzheimer's central office
visit the allowance areas to monitor and review the survey process. These visits are conducted after the on-site data
collection is complete.

In the case of the Kauai survey, all on-site data collection had been completed prior to the arrival of Iniki. The fact
that Runzheimer officials from the central office were unable to visit the island is not significant because the data
collector had done an excellent job, and the quality of the data collected was quite good. Because the prices surveyed
were pre-Iniki, they were not influenced by any short-term perturbations caused by the hurricane. Runzheimer officials
were able to visit Kauai as part of the summer 1993 survey, and a great deal of attention was given to collecting and analyzing
data from that later survey.

The commenter also stated that because some utilities were not widely available for an extended period after Hurricane
Iniki, the living cost surveys might show that utility usage was low. He said that this could bias the survey results.

The utility usage factors that Runzheimer obtained on Kauai were based on a period prior to Iniki. Therefore, the hurricane
did not distort the survey data. In the conduct of the most recent survey, Runzheimer paid close attention to utility
usage rates to ensure that the survey results were not unduly influenced by the effects of Iniki.

Several commenters said that climate conditions (such as high humidity, high rainfall, sunlight intensity, airborne
salt, snow, and cold weather) resulted in higher home maintenance costs in the allowance areas than in the Washington,
DC, area. One commenter believed that some home maintenance expenses were incurred more frequently in the allowance
areas but that Runzheimer considered only annual maintenance costs.

In the employee survey, OPM asked several questions concerning home maintenance, such as painting and roof replacement.
OPM is also studying these issues in a closely related, special research project. OPM plans to integrate the results
of the employee survey with the special research and include this in its report to Congress.

One commenter from Hawaii stated that leasehold to fee-simple ownership conversions contributed to higher housing
costs in Hawaii. 

Runzheimer surveys only fee-simple home sales in Hawaii. Leasehold properties are excluded. OPM believes that the
fair market value of fee-simple property adequately reflects the market as a whole_both the leasehold market (in
which the homeowner may have to purchase the land or renegotiate a land lease) and the fee-simple market. 

Another commenter expressed concern whether the survey of fee-simple home sales only resulted in the survey of typical
housing. The commenter suggested that Runzheimer also survey leasehold properties and include the annual cost of
the land lease. 

When OPM published previous Runzheimer reports in the 

Federal Register

, numerous commenters expressed the view that leasehold sales in Hawaii should not be included in OPM's living cost
surveys. For the reasons discussed above, OPM agrees with this position and has directed Runzheimer to continue its
practice of surveying only fee-simple sales. 



Comments on the Transportation Component 



A number of commenters stated that private transportation costs were greater in the allowance areas because of the
high cost of automobiles and increased auto maintenance due to poor roads, rough terrain, salt air, and harsh weather.
Many also felt that their automobile insurance premiums were quite high. One commenter suggested that OPM price the
cost of tinting car windows. 

The COLA model takes into consideration automobile purchase price, maintenance, insurance, and depreciation.
Purchase costs and insurance are based on price data obtained in each area. Maintenance is also based on local price
data, and the model assumes that certain types of maintenance occur more frequently in the allowance areas than in
the DC area. For example, the model assumes that tires wear out faster in the allowance areas than in the Washington,
DC, area, and that tires have to be purchased more frequently in the allowance areas. 

Depreciation is based on used car values, and Runzheimer found that used cars generally depreciate at the same rate
in nearly all areas. The exceptions are Nome and Fairbanks where cars depreciate at a faster rate, perhaps because
of the severe climate. Runzheimer used special factors for these two areas to reflect greater depreciation. 

In the employee survey, OPM asked employees about their car purchases, accessories, maintenance, road conditions,
terrain, and several other issues. OPM plans to review transportation costs in light of the results of the employee
survey. OPM plans to address items, such as window tinting, at that time. 

Some commenters were confused about the composition of the Public Transportation Category. Some commenters from
the Virgin Islands stated that the lack of an effective mass transportation system compelled them to purchase cars
or to use taxis.

As explained in the report, Runzheimer surveys airline fares to determine the cost of Public Transportation. Runzheimer
does not survey municipal mass transportation. The cost of bus, subway, or taxi service is not part of the surveys because
the service available in many allowance areas is not comparable to the service available in the DC area. Instead of
public mass transportation, Runzheimer compares the cost of round-trip airfare from the allowance area to Los Angeles,
California, with the cost of round-trip airfare from Washington, DC, to Los Angeles. 

Two commenters objected to the selection of Los Angeles as the common destination point for comparing airfares. They
stated that the Los Angeles routes were highly competitive and resulted in lower fares compared with other destinations.


As stated in the report, Los Angeles was selected because it is a common point within the continental United States
that is roughly equidistant from each of the allowance areas and the Washington, DC, area. The route may be highly competitive,
but that does not invalidate cost comparisons because it is the relative cost of air travel that is being measured.
If competition reduces fares, the reductions will be reflected in the Washington, DC, to Los Angeles fares as well
as the allowance area to Los Angeles fares. Therefore, OPM believes the comparisons are appropriate. 

Some commenters stated that the model did not measure true air transportation costs. The commenters stated that inter-island
travel, travel within Alaska, and travel to the contiguous 48 States required more frequent use of air transportation.


OPM included in the employee survey several questions regarding travel. OPM plans to review the transportation component
of the COLA model in light of the results of the employee survey. 



Comments on the Miscellaneous Component 



One commenter objected to the assumption in the model that the cost of certain Miscellaneous Component items is the
same in the allowance area as in the Washington, DC, area. The commenter said that cultural differences might lead
to larger expenditures for gifts. The commenter also noted that the Senate Committee asked OPM to review the Miscellaneous
Component to ensure that the results reflect actual living costs and do not assume equal costs between areas. 

The relative costs of the majority of the items in the Miscellaneous Component are based on surveyed prices. Therefore,
the Miscellaneous Component index reflects ``actual'' living cost differences. The cost of only two items does not
differ among areas_(1) Life insurance and pensions and (2) cash contributions and gifts. 

For Federal employees, the cost of life insurance and required contributions to a Federal retirement system do not
vary by area. Any additional insurance or contributions to retirement systems are a matter of personal preference.
Gifts and cash contributions for church, charity, or other purposes are a matter of personal preference and/or reflect
lifestyle differences that are beyond the scope of the COLA program. As noted earlier, OPM is studying the issue of
lifestyle differences and plans to discuss it in its report to Congress. 

One commenter proposed using the Goods and Services Component index to adjust the cash contributions/gifts category
to reflect the cost of gift items purchased locally. 

OPM is researching this issue along with the general composition of and assumptions used in the Miscellaneous Component.
OPM plans to include the results of this review in its report to Congress. 

One commenter said that the medical expense portion of the Miscellaneous Component failed to reflect the higher out-of-pocket
expenses that Federal employees in the allowance areas frequently incurred. The commenter cited several possible
causes for such higher costs including higher costs not covered by insurance carriers, the absence of Health Maintenance
Organizations (HMOs) in several allowance areas, and the need to travel outside the area to obtain some medical services.


In the employee survey, OPM asked several questions regarding medical expenses, and in addition, OPM is researching
related health cost issues. OPM plans to include the results of its research and the employee survey in its report to
Congress. 

One commenter stated that employees in the allowance areas have to save at a higher rate to afford the down payment for
a house or car or to pay for college/university education. The commenter said that OPM should take this into consideration
and use the Goods and Services Component index to adjust the amount of money saved relative to Washington, DC. 

As noted in the report, Runzheimer believes that savings and investments made for the purpose of future purchases
of housing, durable goods, education, and similar items are best accounted for in the category or component associated
with the item. OPM agrees with this approach and notes that this approach is consistent with the methodology the Bureau
of Labor Statistics uses in the CES. 

The commenter also stated that the COLA model should take into consideration the fact that COLAs do not count toward
retirement. The commenter believed that Federal employees had to invest at a higher rate in pensions and other savings
vehicles to afford to retire in the allowance areas.

Under sections 8331(3) and 8401(4) of title 5, United States Code, allowances (which includes COLAs) are excluded
from basic pay in the computation of Federal annuities under the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employees'
Retirement System. It would be inappropriate to adjust COLA to take into consideration that which the law has specifically
excluded. Therefore, OPM believes that no adjustments to the pensions and investments portion of the model are in
order.



Comments About the Virgin Islands Surveys 



A number of employees from the Virgin Islands felt that the COLA surveys did not accurately reflect living costs, particularly
in St. Croix. The employees said that the COLA rates were too low. One commenter questioned the validity of the price
data collected in St. Croix. 

OPM closely monitors Runzheimer's work and believes that the surveys and analyses are accurate. OPM specifically
reviewed in great detail all survey data from the Virgin Islands. We are satisfied that Runzheimer followed appropriate
procedures in collecting data, analyzing, and reporting data. 

Some commenters from St. Croix referred to a Virgin Island Department of Labor survey that indicated that food costs
in St. Croix were 25 percent higher than food costs in the Washington, DC, area. The employees cited this as evidence
that the St. Croix COLA rate should be higher. 

Runzheimer priced a wide variety of food items in each allowance area, including St. Croix. The results of the food
portion of the survey were provided in Appendix 4 of the report and were part of the 

Federal Register

 notice. These results showed that food consumed at home was approximately 28 percent more expensive in St. Croix than
in the DC area. 

COLA rates, however, are based on more than just the relative cost of food; and in St. Croix, the relative costs of other
items were generally lower than the relative cost of food. Therefore, the St. Croix COLA rate is lower than the food
index. 

Over 200 employees from St. Croix, stated that their COLA rate should be the same as the rate for St. Thomas and St. John.


The COLA surveys for the two areas showed that some prices were higher in St. Croix than in St. Thomas and that some were
lower. Overall, St. Croix prices were about 4 percentage points lower than St. Thomas prices. The difference in the
final COLA rates for the two areas generally reflects this overall price difference. 

OPM notes that the American Chamber of Commerce Research Association (ACCRA) surveyed living costs in the Virgin
Islands in 1992. The results of the ACCRA survey also showed that living costs in St. Thomas were higher than living
costs in St. Croix. 

One commenter stated that the Virgin Island COLA surveys should not be conducted during the summer. He maintained
that pricing in the summer reflected lower, off-season prices. 

OPM recognizes that survey timing is an important consideration, and COLA surveys are scheduled to collect prices
in a ``typical'' month. OPM believes that the current surveys are conducted at a reasonable time of year but will consider
timing changes. Survey timing will be part of OPM's report to Congress. 

Several commenters from the Virgin Islands stated that certain medical services were not available in their area
and that they had to fly to other areas to obtain these services. One commenter from Alaska also noted this problem.
In addition, many commenters in St. Croix stated that the local hospital was not accredited. They said they had to fly
to Puerto Rico or to the U.S. mainland for hospital services. 

OPM is studying the availability and cost of medical services in the allowance areas. In addition, OPM's employee
survey included questions regarding where Federal employees obtain medical services. OPM plans to include the results
of its research and the employee survey in its report to Congress. 

Many employees in St. Croix cited the high cost of air travel for medical treatment. They also noted the cost of air ambulance
service. 

As part of its research, OPM is studying the cost of obtaining medical services in the appropriate area if such services
are not available locally. OPM is also researching the issue of air ambulance insurance. OPM plans to include the results
of this research in its report to Congress. 

Many commenters from St. Croix criticized the quality of public schools in their area and said that a high percentage
of Federal employees sent their children to private schools. The commenters believed that OPM should consider the
cost of private education in the survey. 

OPM is studying private education issues. In addition, OPM asked employees in the employee survey whether they sent
their children to public or private schools. OPM plans to include the results of this research in its report to Congress.


Some employees in St. Croix want OPM to take into account the cost of sending children to out-of-area colleges and universities.
They noted the high cost of travel, campus housing, and out-of-state tuition. 

OPM is studying the cost of college and university education, and the employee survey included questions concerning
college and university education. OPM plans to include the results of its research and the employee survey in its report
to Congress.

Accordingly, OPM is amending 5 CFR part 591 as follows:



PART 591_ALLOWANCES AND DIFFERENTIALS



Subpart B_Cost-of-Living Allowance and Post Differential_Nonforeign Areas



1. The authority citation for subpart B of part 591 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 5 U.S.C. 5941; E.O. 10000, 3 CFR, 1943-1948 Comp., p. 792; E.O. 12510, 3 CFR, 1985 Comp., p. 338.




2. Appendix A of subpart B is revised to read as follows:



Appendix A of Subpart B_Places and Rates at Which Allowances Shall Be Paid



This appendix lists the places where a cost-of-living allowance has been approved and shows the allowance rate to
be paid to employees along with any special eligibility requirements for the allowance payment. The allowance percentage
rate shown is paid as a percentage of an employee's rate of basic pay. 







Definitions of Allowance Categories



The following definitions of the allowance categories identified in the tables in this appendix shall be used to determine
employee eligibility for the appropriate allowance rate:









Note:

 Eligibility for access to military commissary and exchange facilities is determined by the appropriate military
department. If an employee is furnished with these privileges for reasons associated with his or her Federal civilian
employment, he or she will have an identification card that authorizes access to such facilities. Possession of such
an identification card_i.e., one issued by reason of his or her Federal civilian employment_is sufficient evidence
that the employee uses the facilities.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is revising its rule on Research in order to conform to Departmental regulations
on the Protection of Human Subjects requiring, among other provisions, the establishment of an institutional review
board. Additional procedural changes have also been made in order to simplify the application process or to clarify
policy.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Bureau of Prisons is amending its regulations on Research. A final rule on this subject was published in the 

Federal Register

 October 1, 1981 (46 FR 48577).



Department of Justice regulations pertaining to the Protection of Human Subjects are contained in 28 CFR part 46.
The Bureau's regulations on the conduct of research are consequently being revised in order to conform to Departmental
requirements. In compliance with Departmental regulations, the Bureau Research Review Board (BRRB) is identified
as the Bureau's institutional review board. Processing procedures are revised in order to stipulate the duties of
the BRRB and supporting staff at institutions in its oversight of research projects. As a clarification, the Bureau
notes that implementation of programmatic or operational initiatives made through pilot projects are not considered
to be research.

In addition to these conforming amendments, the Bureau is also making other procedural changes intended to simplify
the research application process. For example, procedures on the submission of research proposals are revised to
remove reference to distinctions between routine and non-routine requests. Revised procedures in  512.14
instead direct that requests be submitted either to the institution, if only one institution is involved, or to the
Office of Research if more than one institution is involved.

Section 512.15 restates provisions contained in former  512.17 on access to Bureau of Prisons records. As revised,
this section now includes reference to disclosure provisions of the Privacy Act.

In addition, provisions on incentives in newly revised  512.11(e) have been clarified to allow for reasonable
recompense for time and effort to be offered to research subjects no longer in Bureau custody. The intent of restrictions
on incentives within the institution is to ensure that participation of current inmates is voluntary. The Bureau
believes that there is no compelling need to extend such precautionary restriction to subjects who are not in the Bureau's
custody.

As revised, the regulations no longer contain a separate section on definitions. The terms contained in former  512.11
are now either defined in 28 CFR 46.102 or are explained in the regulations where necessary.

Because these amendments are either administrative or conforming in nature and pose no additional restraints on
inmates, the Bureau finds good cause for exempting the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553)
requiring notice of proposed rulemaking and delay in effective date. While the Bureau believes it is necessary to
implement these changes immediately, the Bureau is publishing the procedures as an interim rule in order to invite
public comment. Members of the public may submit comments concerning this rule by writing to the previously cited
address. These comments will be considered before the rule is finalized.

The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866,
and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to E.O. 12866. After review
of the law and regulations, the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Subpart B_Research 


 512.10 

Purpose and scope. 



General provisions for the protection of human subjects during the conduct of research are contained in 28 CFR part
46. The provisions of this subpart B specify additional requirements for prospective researchers (both employees
and non-employees) to obtain approval to conduct research within the Bureau of Prisons (Bureau) and responsibilities
of Bureau staff in processing proposals and monitoring research projects. Although some research may be exempt from
28 CFR part 46 under  46.101(b)(5), as determined by the Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE) of the Bureau,
no research is exempt from 28 CFR part 512. For the purpose of this rule, implementation of Bureau programmatic or operational
initiatives made through pilot projects is not considered to be research. 



 512.11 

Requirements for research projects and researchers. 


The Bureau requires the following: 
(a) In all research projects the rights, health, and human dignity of individuals involved must be respected. 
(b) The project must have an adequate research design and contribute to the advancement of knowledge about corrections.

(c) The project must not involve medical experimentation, cosmetic research, or pharmaceutical testing. 
(d) The project must minimize risk to subjects; risks to subjects must be reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
The selection of subjects within any one institution must be equitable. When applicable, informed consent must be
sought and documented (see   512.15 and 512.16). 
(e) Incentives may not be offered to help persuade inmate subjects to participate. However, soft drinks and snacks
to be consumed at the test setting may be offered. Reasonable accommodations such as nominal monetary recompense
for time and effort may be offered to non-confined research subjects who are both: 
(1) No longer in Bureau of Prisons custody, and 
(2) Participating in authorized research being conducted by Bureau employees or contractors. 
(f) The researcher must have academic preparation or experience in the area of study of the proposed research. 
(g) The researcher must assume responsibility for actions of any person engaged to participate in the research project
as an associate, assistant, or subcontractor to the researcher. 
(h) Except as noted in the informed consent statement to the subject, the researcher must not provide research information
which identifies a subject to any person without that subject's prior written consent to release the information.
For example, research information identifiable to a particular individual cannot be admitted as evidence or used
for any purpose in any action, suit or other judicial, administrative, or legislative proceeding without the written
consent of the individual to whom the data pertains. 
(i) The researcher must adhere to applicable provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 and regulations pursuant to this
Act. 
(j) The research design must be compatible with both the operation of prison facilities and protection of human subjects.
The researcher must observe the rules of the institution or office in which the research is conducted. 
(k) Any researcher who is a non-employee of the Bureau must sign a statement in which the researcher agrees to adhere
to the provisions of this rule. 
(l) Except for computerized data records maintained at an official Department of Justice site, records which contain
nondisclosable information directly traceable to a specific person may not be stored in, or introduced into, an electronic
retrieval system.

(m) If the researcher is conducting a study of special interest to the Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE), but
the study is not a joint project involving ORE, the researcher may be asked to provide ORE with the computerized research
data, not identifiable to individual subjects, accompanied by detailed documentation. These arrangements must
be negotiated prior to the beginning of the data collection phase of the project. 

(n) The researcher must submit planned methodological changes in a research project to the IRB for approval, and may
be required to revise study procedures in accordance with the new methodology. 



 512.12 

Content of research proposal. 



When submitting a research proposal, the applicant shall provide the following information: 

(a) A summary statement which includes: 
(1) Name(s) and current affiliation(s) of the researcher(s); 
(2) Title of the study; 
(3) Purpose of the project; 
(4) Location of the project; 
(5) Methods to be employed; 
(6) Anticipated results; 
(7) Duration of the study; 
(8) Number of subjects (staff/inmates) required and amount of time required from each; and 
(9) Indication of risk or discomfort involved as a result of participation. 
(b) A comprehensive statement which includes:
