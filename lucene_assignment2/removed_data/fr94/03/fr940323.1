Proposed Amendment to Class D Airspace; Aurora, CO



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposed rule would amend the Aurora, Buckley ANGB Airport, Colorado, Class D airspace. This action would amend
the Aurora, Buckley ANGB, Colorado, Class D airspace from full-time to part-time. Airspace reclassification, in
effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the terms ``control zone'' for airports with operating control
towers, and ``air traffic area,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' This amendment would
bring publications up to date, giving continuous information to the aviation public.

Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation
Administration, System Management Branch, ANM-530, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056.
Communications must identify the notice number of this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list
for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11-2A, which describes the application
procedure.



The Proposal



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend Class D airspace
at Aurora, Colorado, to correct an error in the Class D airspace description. During the airspace reclassification
process (57 FR 38962; August 27, 1992) the language designating the Class D airspace as part-time was inadvertently
omitted. This action would correct that error. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has
discontinued the use of the term ``control zone,'' and airspace extending upward from the surface of the earth is now
``Class D airspace.'' The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace
is published in Paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is
incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this
document would be published subsequently in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_ (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Fees Assessed for Defaulted Payments 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Customs Service, Department of the Treasury.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to amend the Customs Regulations to authorize the assessment of a $30 fee for any defaulted
payment resulting from a check or other monetary instrument returned unpaid by a financial institution, including
Automated Clearinghouse defaulted payments, which were presented for duties, taxes and other charges incurred
in connection with any commercial or noncommercial importation or other Customs transaction whether or not backed
by a Customs bond. At present, Customs authority to assess the $30 fee is limited to returned checks presented with
respect to noncommercial importations for which no formal entry was required, and other Customs transactions not
backed by a Customs bond. The purpose of the proposed change is to enable Customs to recoup the administrative costs
incurred in processing all returned checks and other defaulted payments.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


By a document published in the 

Federal Register

 as T.D. 92-73 on August 10, 1992 (57 FR 35458), Customs amended its regulations to establish a $30 charge for each
check that is returned by a financial institution to Customs unpaid, if that check was presented either for payment
of duties or other charges incurred on noncommercial importations for which a formal entry was not required or for
payment in connection with any other transaction not backed by a Customs bond ( 24.1(e), Customs Regulations;
19 CFR 24.1(e)). 

However, Customs has not been entirely successful at charging the $30 fee in part because Customs cannot differentiate
in a cost effective manner between returned checks made by individuals on noncommercial importations, and those
made by commercial entities, which are usually backed by a Customs bond. Moreover, because Customs is only authorized
at present to charge the fee in connection with noncommercial importations or other transactions not backed by a Customs
bond, Customs is unable to recoup the administrative costs incurred for processing all returned checks and other
defaulted payments. In particular,  24.1(e) does not authorize charging the fee for processing defaulted
payments made through the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) (see  24.25, Customs Regulations; 19 CFR 24.25).

Section 24.1(e) was made applicable only to noncommercial importations and other transactions not backed by a Customs
bond, primarily because of the availability of liquidated damages in cases where checks were returned unpaid in connection
with commercial importations and other transactions which were supported by a bond. 
However, the assessment of liquidated damages does not recoup the administrative costs connected with processing
defaulted payments. All liquidated damages collected by Customs are credited to one of the Treasury Department's
miscellaneous receipt accounts which cannot be used to defray the expense of processing defaulted payments. The
$30 fee provided for in 
 24.1(e), on the other hand, is credited to a Customs account whose purpose is specifically to recoup the administrative
costs associated with processing defaulted payments. Thus, because the $30 fee is money usable by Customs in this
regard while liquidated damages are not, the two assessments may not properly be considered a duplicate assessment
for a single defaulted payment. 
Accordingly, against this backdrop, Customs proposes to amend  24.1(e) so as to permit the application of the
$30 fee 
for all returned checks, other monetary instruments, and ACH defaulted payments, regardless of whether the maker
is commercial and/or bonded.

Comments


Before adopting this proposal, consideration will be given to any written comments (preferably in triplicate) that
are timely submitted to Customs. All such comments received from the public pursuant to this notice of proposed rulemaking
will be available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552),  1.4,
Treasury Department Regulations (31 CFR 1.4), and  103.11(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 103.11(b)), during
regular business days between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. at the Regulations Branch, 1099 14th Street, NW.,
Suite 4000, Washington, DC.


Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866


Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), for the reasons stated in the preamble, it is certified that the proposed amendment would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, it is not subject to the regulatory analysis
or other requirements of 5 U.S.C. 603 or 604. Nor would the proposed amendment result in a ``significant regulatory
action'' under E.O. 12866.

Medicaid Program; Low-Income Eligibility Groups and Coverage of Services; Legislative Changes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would amend the Medicaid regulations to: incorporate categorically needy eligibility groups
of pregnant women, infants, and children and aged and disabled individuals with incomes related to the Federal poverty
income guidelines; expand the deemed eligibility group of newborn children; expand the eligibility group of qualified
children; clarify eligibility of homeless individuals; provide for the continuous eligibility of pregnant women
without regard to changes in income; provide for ambulatory prenatal care for certain pregnant women during a limited
period of presumptive eligibility, based on income eligibility only; and tie the medical assistance program to the
Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) payment levels in the State.



The amendments would conform the regulations to provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Acts of 1990 and
1989, the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, the Family Support Act of 1988, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Acts of 1987 and 1986, and the Homeless Eligibility Clarification Act of 1986.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



I. Background



Under title XIX of the Social Security Act (the Act), generally States with Medicaid programs are required to provide
Medicaid eligibility to individuals, children, and families who are receiving, or are deemed to be receiving, cash
assistance under the aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) program, the supplemental security income (SSI)
program, and the mandatory State supplement program; and to certain other needy pregnant women and children (referred
to as the mandatory categorically needy eligibility groups). At State option, States may provide Medicaid to individuals
who meet the categorical and financial requirements for the cash assistance programs but, for various reasons, are
not receiving such assistance_for example, individuals who are in institutions or have not applied for cash assistance
benefits_and to certain other specified needy groups (referred to as the optional categorically needy eligibility
groups).

In addition to categorically needy groups, States, at their option, may provide Medicaid to individuals who would
be eligible for the cash assistance programs except that they have income or resources above allowable levels (referred
to as the medically needy eligibility group). The medically needy are permitted to reduce their income to the allowed
level by deducting (spending down) incurred medical expenses to become eligible for Medicaid.

In recent years, a number of statutes have been enacted that established new eligibility groups, revised existing
eligibility groups, or expanded services to certain low-income individuals. On October 21, 1986, Congress passed
provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA '86), Public Law 99-509, that amended the
Social Security Act to expand the Medicaid eligibility groups. States were given the option of providing Medicaid
to certain needy individuals who had incomes up to a certain specified percentage of Federal poverty income guidelines
and who previously were not eligible for Medicaid as categorically needy. These individuals included pregnant women,
infants, and children (section 9401) and aged and disabled individuals (section 9402). In addition, section 9407
allowed States to provide ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women during a presumptive eligibility period on
the basis of income eligibility only.

OBRA '86 also clarified Medicaid eligibility of homeless individuals who are residents of a State, regardless of
whether or not they maintain a home at a fixed address or maintain it permanently (section 9405). In addition, section
11005 of the Homeless Eligibility Clarification Act (title XI of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Public Law 99-570),
enacted on October 27, 1986, requires that a State Medicaid plan provide for a method of making medical services eligibility
cards available to Medicaid-eligible individuals who do not reside in a permanent dwelling or at a fixed address.

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA '87), Public Law 100-203, enacted on December 22, 1987,
made further changes in the Social Security Act to expand the optional eligibility groups of low-income pregnant
women, infants, and children and the mandatory eligibility group of qualified children under a certain age. OBRA
'87 also allowed a State to impose a monthly premium on optional categorically needy pregnant women and infants with
incomes between 150 and 185 percent of the Federal poverty level. In addition, section 4105 of OBRA '87 clarified Medicaid
coverage of clinic services furnished outside of clinic facilities to homeless individuals.

The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA), Public Law 100-360, enacted on July 1, 1988, also further
amended provisions relating to the eligibility groups of individuals with incomes related to the Federal poverty
income level. MCCA made some of the low-income pregnant women and infants mandatory Medicaid eligibility groups
(those at or below 75 percent of the poverty level and then, a year later, 100 percent of the poverty level) and amended
the eligibility criteria for others.

The Family Support Act of 1988 (FSA), Public Law 100-485, enacted on October 13, 1988, made several technical
corrections to the Medicaid provisions of the Social Security Act. These corrections related to the description
of the eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children.

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA '89), Public Law 101-239, enacted on December 19, 1989,
changed the mandatory eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women and infants by increasing the income criteria
to at or below 133 percent (instead of at or below 100 percent) of the Federal poverty income level; and added a new mandatory
group of low-income children who are age one but have not attained age 6 who have incomes at or below 133 percent of the
Federal poverty level. OBRA '89 mandated a percentage greater than 133 percent of the Federal poverty level for the
pregnant women and infants groups if the State had such a greater percentage in its State plan (whether approved or
not) as of the date of enactment of OBRA '89, or established under State authorizing legislation or State appropriations
as of December 19, 1989, when it covered these pregnant women or infants, or both, as optional categorically needy
groups. Low-income children who are age 6 but have not attained age 7, or at State option, age 8 with incomes at or below
100 percent of the Federal poverty level remained an optional categorically needy group. These provisions were effective
on April 1, 1990.

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), Public Law 101-508, enacted on November 5, 1990, made
additional changes to both the mandatory and optional groups of pregnant women, infants, and children. OBRA '90 created
a new group of mandatory categorically needy children who are at least age 6 but have not yet reached age 19. These are
children born after September 30, 1983 with family income at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty level. OBRA
'90 made corresponding changes to the mandatory eligibility group of qualified children to include children born
after September 30, 1983 who have not attained age 19 and to allow States to use an earlier date of birth in order to include
older children sooner than is mandated. 

In addition, OBRA '90 mandated that a State provide continuous eligibility to pregnant women throughout the pregnancy
and postpartum period without regard to changes in income. (This had been a State option.) OBRA '90 also 
changed the requirement for newborns who are deemed to be eligible as a result of their mothers' eligibility status.
Previously, a newborn was considered eligible at birth if the newborn's mother was eligible for and receiving 
Medicaid. The newborn could remain eligible for as long as a year if the mother remained eligible and the infant was
a member of the mother's household. With the OBRA '90 change, a newborn may still remain eligible for as long as a year
if the mother loses eligibility but would remain eligible if 
she were pregnant. 

Finally, OBRA '90 made several changes to presumptive eligibility for pregnant women by eliminating the existing
time limit on the presumptive period and allowing a pregnant woman to remain presumptively eligible until the State
makes a determination on her regular application for Medicaid or, 
if she does not file a regular application, the last day of the month following the month in which she was determined
presumptively eligible. OBRA '90 also provided that the application given to a presumptively eligible pregnant
woman could be the application used by the State to determine the 
regular Medicaid eligibility of low-income pregnant women under section 1902(1)(1)(A). 

This document proposes to incorporate provisions of OBRA '86, '87, '89, and '90, the Homeless Eligibility Clarification
Act, MCCA, and FSA in the Medicaid regulations, as outlined and discussed in the following section of this document.
(Additional related provisions in these laws are being addressed in separate rulemaking documents.) 



II. Discussion of Legislative Provisions and Proposed Amendments to Regulations
 


A. Low-Income Pregnant Women, Infants, and Children 



Section 9401 of OBRA '86 amended the Social Security Act by adding new sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) and 1902(1)
to establish optional categorically needy groups of pregnant women and women during the 60-day period beginning
on the last day of pregnancy, infants, and children up to 
age 5 whose income does not exceed a State-established standard that is a specified percentage of the Federal nonfarm
poverty income guidelines. Under OBRA '86, a State could establish this income standard at a level at or below 
100 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines. A State had to cover both pregnant women and infants (it could not cover
either group separately) and it had to cover both of these groups in order to cover children. 

OBRA '86 also amended section 1902(e) to provide that States that have chosen to cover infants and children under section
1902(1) must continue to cover those infants and children under certain circumstances. Under section 
1902(e)(7), if the infants and children are receiving covered inpatient services at the time they reach the age limits
under the State plan, the State must cover them until the end of their inpatient stay if they remain otherwise 
eligible. Also, OBRA '86 specifically exempted the group of individuals described in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX)
from the limits on family income which affect a State's Federal financial participation (FFP) under section 1903(f)(4)
of the Act. 

Later legislation changed the age limit for children and the percentage of the poverty level for the income standard.
Specifically, section 4101(c) of OBRA '87 raised the maximum age for low-income children from age 5 up to age 
8. Section 4101(a)(1) of OBRA '87 increased the percentage of the poverty guidelines at which the income standard
could be set to 185 percent for pregnant women and infants under age 1, effective July 1, 1988. However, for children
age 1 up to age 8, section 4101 retained the percentage level at 
no more than 100 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines (or, if the State had chosen to cover pregnant women and infants
with a percentage of income below 100 percent, the percentage for children had to equal the percentage used for the
pregnant women and infants). Section 4118 of OBRA '87 also removed the reference to ``nonfarm'' in the description
of the Federal poverty income guidelines to be used. In addition, section 4101(d) of OBRA '87 amended section 1916
of the Act to allow States to charge a premium to optional 
groups of low-income pregnant women and infants who have family incomes above a specified level.

Section 302 of MCCA added section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) to the Social Security Act, which required States to provide
mandatory eligibility to groups of pregnant women and infants up to one year of age with incomes at or below 75 percent
of the Federal poverty income guidelines, effective July 1, 1989. Those States that, as of enactment of MCCA, offered
eligibility to pregnant women and infants with incomes at 100 percent of the poverty level (or at some 
lower income threshold between 75 percent and 100 percent) were required to continue eligibility at this level. A
State had to provide an income level that reflected at least the percentage of poverty specified in an amendment to
its State plan to cover these groups (whether the amendment had been approved or not). Even if there was no percentage
specified in the State plan, the maintenance of eligibility requirement also applied to percentages established
under a State's authorizing legislation or provided for under the State's appropriations in order to provide Medicaid
to these individuals before July 1, 1989. MCCA also provided that, effective July 1, 1990, mandatory eligibility
was required for groups of pregnant women and infants under age one with incomes at or below 100 percent of the Federal
poverty income guidelines. In addition to creating mandatory groups of pregnant women and infants, the MCCA eliminated
the requirement in section 1902(1)(4) that States cover both pregnant women and infants in order to cover either group
and to cover both groups in order to cover children. We have interpreted this MCCA amendment to allow States to cover
optional groups of pregnant women and infants separately and with different income levels. Coverage of groups of
pregnant women or infants, or both, with incomes above the mandatory percentages (75 percent, effective July 1, 1989,
and 100 percent, effective July 1, 1990) but at or below 185 percent of the poverty level and children age 1 year to age
8 years with incomes at or below 100 percent of the poverty level remained optional under the MCCA provisions. 

The MCCA also amended section 1902(e)(7) to provide continued coverage to all of the revised groups of children under
section 1902(1) until the end of their inpatient stays. It also amended section 1903(f)(4) to exempt from the FFP income
limits all of the redefined mandatory and optional groups in section 1902(1) and specifically made the use of less
restrictive income and resource methodologies under section 1902(r)(2) apply to several groups, including the
mandatory groups of women and infants in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), and to all optional categorically needy
groups, including the optional group of women, infants, and children in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX). 

The changes made by section 302 of MCCA applied to payments for medical assistance for calendar quarters beginning
on or after July 1, 1989, with respect to eligibility on or after that date. The effective date applied whether or not
we had promulgated final rules to interpret the provisions by that date. However, a State could, under certain circumstances,
request a delayed implementation date in order to enact State legislation.

Section 6401 of OBRA '89 revised the provisions under MCCA by further amending the eligibility groups of low-income
pregnant women, infants, and children up to age 8. First, section 6401 changed the income criteria for the 
mandatory eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women and infants up to age 1 under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV)
of the Act by increasing the income level criteria from no less than 100 percent of the Federal poverty income level
to no less than 133 percent of the Federal poverty income level, effective April 1, 1990. The law mandates that a State
use a percentage greater than 133 percent (but no greater than 185 percent) of the Federal poverty income level if the
State had such a higher percentage for optional 
categorically needy groups of pregnant women and infants as of the date of enactment of OBRA '89 in its State plan (whether
approved or not) or established by State authorizing legislation or State appropriations. Second, OBRA '89 established
under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI) of the Act a new mandatory eligibility group of low-income children age 1 up
to age 6. The State was required to establish an income level for this group that equaled 133 percent of the Federal poverty
income level. States could continue to cover as optional categorically needy other low-income children age 6 up to
age 7 or, at State option, up to age 8 who are born after September 30, 1983. The income level for this group of children
age 6 up to age 8 would continue to be established at a level not to exceed 100 percent of the Federal poverty income level.

Section 6401 of OBRA '89 also made conforming changes to section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) (excluding the mandatory
group of children in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI) from the group of optional categorically needy), other parts
of section 1902(1) (changed the descriptions of low-income groups of pregnant women, infants, and children), section
1902(e)(7) (added the new group of mandatory children to the continuation of inpatient hospital services for infants
and children who have reached the maximum age for eligibility), section 1902(r)(2) (made the use of less restrictive
income and resource methodologies than cash assistance methodologies apply to the new group of mandatory children),
and section 1903(f)(4) (exempted the new group of mandatory children from the limitations on Medicaid payments).
In addition, section 6411(i)(3) of OBRA '89 amended section 1925 (a)(3)(C) and (b)(3)(C)(i) to require States to
determine if children who would cease to receive extended Medicaid under section 1925 may be eligible for Medicaid
under sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(i) (IV) or (VI) or 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) before terminating eligibility based
on section 1925. 

The changes made by section 6401 applied to payments for medical assistance for calendar quarters beginning on or
after April 1, 1990, with respect to eligibility on or after that date. The effective date applied whether or not we
had promulgated final rules to interpret the provisions by that date. However, a State could, under certain circumstances,
request a delayed implementation date in order to enact State legislation. Section 6411(i)(3) was effective as if
enacted as part of the Family Support Act of 1988. 

Section 4601 of OBRA '90 established a new mandatory group of low-income children under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII)
of the Act. This group described in 1902(l)(1)(D) of the Act includes children born after September 30, 1983 who have
attained age 6 but have not attained age 19. The State must establish an income standard for this group of children which
equals 100 percent of the Federal poverty level. Section 4601 made conforming changes to section 1905(n)(2) of the
Act which defines qualified children. Children born after September 30, 1983 who have not attained age 19 are now included
in the mandatory group of qualified children. In addition, States have the option to choose an earlier date of birth
if they wish to phase in this group more quickly. Section 4601 made additional conforming changes to (1) section 1902(r)(2)
to allow States to use less restrictive income and resource methodologies than those used under the cash assistance
programs in determining financial eligibility of the new group under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII); (2) section
1903(f)(4) of the Act to exempt the new group of mandatory children from the limitations on Medicaid payments; and
(3) section 1925 of the Act to require that States determine whether a child is eligible under this new mandatory group
before terminating eligibility based on section 1925. 

The changes made by section 4601 applied to payments for medical assistance for calendar quarters beginning on or
after July 1, 1991. The effective date applied whether or not we had promulgated final rules to interpret the provisions
by that date. However, a State could, under certain circumstances, request a delayed implementation date in order
to enact State legislation. 

Section 1902(l) of the Act, as added by section 9401 of OBRA '86 and amended by section 4101 of OBRA '87, section 302 of
MCCA, section 608(d)(15) of FSA, section 6401 of OBRA '89, and section 4601 of OBRA '90, specifies the eligibility
conditions for the mandatory groups of pregnant women and infants under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), the mandatory
group of children age 1 up to age 6 under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI), the mandatory group of children age 6 up to
age 19 under section 1902 (a)(10)(A)(i)(VII), and the optional categorically needy groups of pregnant women and
infants under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX). 



1. Income Standard 



Eligibility of individuals who fall into one of the mandatory and optional groups of low-income pregnant women, infants,
and children is based on these individuals meeting State-established income standards. States must establish their
income standards at a level that does not exceed the specified percentage of the Federal poverty income guidelines
for a family equal to the size of the family, including the woman, infant, or child. Because the official poverty guidelines
are revised annually to adjust for inflation, States will be automatically increasing the income standards established
to keep pace with inflation as a result of the changes in the poverty guidelines. (HHS determines official Federal
poverty income guidelines and issues them in the 

Federal Register

 annually, usually during the month of February. See, for example, 58 FR 8287, February 12, 1993.) For optional groups
of pregnant women and infants, the agency may establish separate income standards or use a single standard.

Under section 1902(l)(3)(E), as added by OBRA '86 and amended by section 4101(e)(3) of OBRA '87, in determining whether
the income of members of the low-income groups of pregnant women, infants, and children meets the established income
standards, States must use the same methodologies as applied in determining financial eligibility for AFDC, or for
title IV-E as appropriate, except to the extent that the methodologies are inconsistent with section 1902(a)(17)(D)
of the Act. Section 4101(e)(3) of OBRA '87 clarified that, in determining family income, States must not use any AFDC
methodologies (such as stepparent, grandparent, or sibling deeming) that are inconsistent with the deeming policies
specific to Medicaid under section 1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act (H. Rep. 391, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 446 (1987)). Section
1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act provides, in part, that in determining financial responsibility of relatives, only the
income of spouses may be considered as available to spouses, and only the income of parents may be considered as available
to a child until the child is 21, unless the child is blind or disabled. The methodologies include, but are not limited
to, those used for disregarding income. States also are not permitted to allow individuals whose eligibility is determined
based on membership in these low-income groups to spend down; that is, the State may not deduct the costs of incurred
medical expenses or any other type of remedial care from income, in determining whether an individual's income meets
the income standard established by the State. 

The requirements for determining financial eligibility of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children were
also affected by section 303(e) of MCCA. Section 303(e) established a new section 1902(r)(2) to permit States, at
their option, to use less restrictive income and resource methodologies than those used under the cash assistance
programs (e.g., AFDC or SSI), in determining financial eligibility for a number of groups, including the mandatory
groups of pregnant women and infants in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) and the optional groups of pregnant women,
infants, and children in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX). Section 6401 of OBRA '89 specifically made section 1902(r)(2)
applicable to the mandatory group of low-income children age 1 up to age 6 in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI). Section
4601 of OBRA '90 specifically made section 1902(r)(2) applicable to the mandatory group of low-income children age
6 up to age 19 in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII). 

We believe that the specific preclusion of a spenddown in section 1902(l) was not modified by section 1902(r)(2).
However, States may use other more liberal methodologies to the extent that they are consistent with section 1902(r)(2).


Section 1902(l)(1) of the Act specifically states that the income standards established by the State must correlate
to a family size that includes the woman, infant, or child. The statute does not specifically address whether the pregnant
woman's unborn child must be counted in determining family size. However, the legislative history supports counting
the pregnant woman as if her child were born and living with her. The language of the 1986 House Committee Report that
addressed the section 1902(l)(1) provision states that ``in determining a pregnant woman's family income level,
the Committee intends that a State would treat the woman as if her child were born and living with her at the time she applied
for assistance. Thus, a single woman would be treated as a family of two, a pregnant woman living with a spouse or child
as a family of three, and so forth * * *'' (H. Rep. No. 727, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 100 (1986)). The House
bill that accompanied this report states that the family size should be equal to ``the family including the woman or
child.'' Even though the language is not specific in section 1902(l)(1), we believe the legislative history reveals
that Congress intended that the unborn child be included under this provision. 

We proposed to specify in these proposed regulations that the family size includes the ``unborn child and other members
of the Medicaid budgetary unit.'' Policies relating to the Medicaid budgetary unit were addressed in a final rule
with comment period published in the 

Federal Register

 
on January 19, 1993 (58 FR 4908), and are, therefore, not being addressed in this preamble. The effective date of the
January 1993 rule has been delayed (58 FR 9120, February 19, 1993; 58 FR 44457, August 23, 1993; and 59 FR 8138, February
18, 1994). We will conform the policies on the Medicaid budgetary unit contained in these proposed regulations with
whatever policy is in effect at the time that we issue these proposed regulations as final.

2. Resource Standard 



The statute allows States, at their option, to apply a 
resource standard to the low-income eligibility groups of 
pregnant women, infants, and children under section 1902(1) 
of the Act. Section 9401 of OBRA '86 establishes a floor 
for the resource standard that is a specific and objective 
standard. If a State chooses to apply a resource standard, 
the standard may be no more restrictive than that applied 
under SSI for pregnant women, and than that applied under 
AFDC, for infants and children. (If Guam, Puerto Rico, and 
the Virgin Islands elect to apply a resource standard, that 
standard for pregnant women may be no more restrictive than 
that applied under SSI under section 1613 of the Act. This 
is because the reference to the resource standard for 
pregnant women in the statute is to the standard that is 
applied under title XVI (that is, SSI) and not to the 
standard that is applied under the State plan program under 
title XVI.) 

The amendments regarding the different treatment of 
income and resources for the mandatory and optional groups 
of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children do not 
require or permit this different treatment to be applied to 
other Medicaid eligibility groups under the comparability 
provisions of section 1902(a)(17) of the Act. 



3. Applicability for States With Section 1115 Waivers and 
for Territories 



Section 302(c) of MCCA struck the original section 
1902(1)(4)(A) of the Act and section 302(d) of MCCA added a 
new section 1902(1)(4)(A). Under the new section 
1902(1)(4)(A), as amended by section 6401 of OBRA '89 and 
section 4601 of OBRA '90, States that are providing Medicaid 
under a waiver granted under section 1115 of the Act must 
provide mandatory categorically needy eligibility to 
pregnant women and infants under age 1 with incomes at or 
below 133 percent of the poverty level under section 
1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), children age 1 but under age 6 with 
incomes at or below 133 percent of the poverty level under 
section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI) and children who have attained 
age 6 but are under age 19 with incomes at or below 100 
percent of the poverty level under section 
1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII) in the same manner as other States. 
States operating under a waiver granted under section 1115 
of the Act must (as all other States must) cover the 
mandatory groups at higher levels if they have already 
chosen to use those higher levels. However, Guam, Puerto 
Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern 
Mariana Islands retain the option of providing Medicaid to 
the otherwise mandatory groups of low-income pregnant women, 
infants, and children. The Territories may establish 
separate or identical income standards for pregnant women 
and infants at any percentage of the poverty level at or 
below 185 percent. However, if a Territory chooses to cover 
children from age 1 up to age 6, it must cover all such 
children with incomes at or below 133 percent of the poverty 
level. Also, if a Territory chooses to cover children born 
after September 30, 1983 who have attained age 6 but are 
under age 19, it must cover all such children with incomes 
at or below 100 percent of the poverty level. 



4. Comparability of Services 



Section 1902(a)(10) of the Act, as amended by section 
9401 of OBRA '86, section 4101 of OBRA '87, and section 
302(a)(1)(C) of MCCA, contains an exemption to the 
comparability of services requirements at section 
1902(a)(10)(B) for services furnished to pregnant women 
described in section 1902(l)(1)(A) of the Act who are 
eligible as mandatory or optional categorically needy under 
the provisions of sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) and 
1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX). The amended provision (under clause 
(VII) following what is currently paragraph (F) of section 
1902(a)(10)) provides that the services that are available 
to pregnant women under the section 1902(l) low-income 
eligibility groups are limited to services relating to 
pregnancy (including prenatal, delivery, family planning, 
and postpartum services) and to other conditions that may 
complicate pregnancy. (Section 4101(e)(1) of OBRA '87 
expanded services related to pregnancy to include ``family 
planning.'') 

The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act 
(COBRA), Public Law 99-272, enacted an earlier comparability 
of services requirement for all pregnant women covered under 
the State plan. This requirement appears under clause (V) 
following what is currently paragraph (F) of section 
1902(a)(10). This provision states that if a State makes 
available ``services relating to pregnancy (including 
prenatal, delivery, and postpartum services) or to any other 
condition which may complicate pregnancy,'' the State is not 
required to provide these services to any other individual, 
except pregnant women, covered under the plan. The State 
must provide its pregnancy-related services and services for 
any other condition that may complicate pregnancy, in the 
same amount, duration, and scope, to all pregnant women 
covered under the State plan, including pregnant women whose 
pregnancy is not the basis for their Medicaid eligibility 
(e.g., those receiving AFDC or SSI). (See   440.210 and 
440.220).

<TEXT>
 

We issued a separate document to interpret this and 
other provisions of COBRA. In it, we left to the States the 
responsibility for defining these services listed in the 
statute within the bounds of broad policy guidelines (54 FR 
7798, February 23, 1989 and 55 FR 48601, November 21, 1990). 
We believe that the same principles apply for the pregnancy-related services and services which may complicate pregnancy

which are specific to the section 1902(1) group of women. 
(See  440.250(q).) 

Generally, the State plan includes services identified 
in section 1905(a) (1) through (24) of the Act (mandatory and 
optional services that are considered as medical assistance 
to Medicaid recipients). Many of these services can qualify 
as appropriate components of the areas of care required by 
the statute; that is, prenatal services, delivery services, 
postpartum services, and family planning services, and 
services related to conditions that may complicate 
pregnancy. For example, physicians' services in section 
1905(a)(5) can qualify as prenatal services, since 
examinations by a physician are part of prenatal care, and 
as delivery services, since a physician may also deliver the 
woman's baby. Therefore, a State plan must provide pregnant 
women with what the State has decided are enough services 
identified in section 1905(a) to sufficiently cover each of 
the required areas of care. In addition, a State, at its 
option, may provide services under section 1905(a) of the 
Act (for example, rehabilitative services or nutritional 
supplements) only to pregnant women and not to any other 
categorically needy eligible Medicaid recipient, as long as 
such services qualify as either services related to 
pregnancy or to other conditions that may complicate 
pregnancy. A State would not be required to specifically 
identify which services it provides to pregnant women. 
However, the State would be required to specify in its plan 
that it covers each of the required areas of care. 

We interpret ``pregnancy-related services'' to mean those 
services which are needed because the woman is or was 
pregnant, either because they are necessary for the health 
of the pregnant woman or fetus or because the services 
became necessary as a result of the woman having been 
pregnant. These include, but are not limited to, prenatal 
care, delivery, family planning, and postpartum services. 

On the other hand, ``services relating to any other 
condition which may complicate pregnancy'' are not ``pregnancy 
related'' because they do not arise because of the pregnancy. 
These services include those for diagnosis or treatment of 
illnesses or medical conditions which might threaten the 
carrying of the fetus to full term or the safe delivery of 
the fetus. Because these services are for conditions ``which 
may complicate the pregnancy,'' the services can be provided 
only while the woman is pregnant. 

It is important to note that, unlike the other 
eligibility groups of pregnant women who are entitled to at 
least the full range of services available under a 
particular State's Medicaid plan to recipients of the same 
eligibility group, these low-income categorically needy 
pregnant women are only entitled to pregnancy-related 
services (including family planning services) and services 
for the treatment of conditions that may complicate 
pregnancy. 

Infants and children in these eligibility groups are 
eligible for all appropriate Medicaid services included in 
the approved State plan. 



5. Premiums for Pregnant Women and Infants 



Section 4101(d) of OBRA '87 redesignated section 
1916(c) as 1916(d) and created a new section 1916(c) which 
permits States to impose a monthly premium on optional 
categorically needy low-income pregnant women and infants 
eligible under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) of the Act. 
States may impose the premium on these individuals if their 
income equals or exceeds 150 percent, but is not more than 
185 percent, of the poverty level for a family of the size 
involved. The amount of the premium imposed may not exceed 
10 percent of the amount by which the family's income 
exceeds 150 percent of the poverty income guidelines. Costs 
for the care of a dependent child must be deducted in 
determining the family's income under this provision. 
States are prohibited from requiring the prepayment of the 
premium. Eligibility may not be terminated for failure to 
pay this premium unless the premium has been unpaid for at 
least 60 days. In cases of undue hardship, as defined by 
the State, the State may waive the payment of the premium. 
In addition, a State may use State or local funds from other 
programs to pay the premium. Under section 1916(c)(4) of 
the Act, if these funds are used, they may not be counted as 
income to the individual for whom payment is made. 

Although Congress did not specifically address the 
meaning of the term ``costs of care for a dependent child'' 
(the Conference Report refers to these costs as ``child care'' 
expenses (H. Rep. No. 495, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 731 
(1987)), we believe that there was no Congressional intent 
to use a broader concept of child care costs for this 
provision than that traditionally used under the AFDC 
program. Therefore, we propose to define child care costs 
for purposes of this provision as costs related to the care 
of a child necessary to enable a member of the family whose 
income was included in the eligibility determination to work 
or participate in training.

6. Payment Levels Under AFDC 

OBRA '86 added section 1902(1)(4)(A) to the Act, which provided that a State plan may not elect to cover the optional
groups of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children up to age 5 described in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX)
unless the State had in effect AFDC payment levels that were not less than those in effect on April 17, 1986. This provision
became effective on April 1, 1987. OBRA '87 amended this provision, changing the date upon which AFDC levels would
be measured from April 1 to July 1, 1987. The OBRA '87 amendment was effective on December 22, 1987. 
Section 302(c) of MCCA eliminated section 1902(1)(4), but placed a comparable provision in a new section 1903(i)(9).
This provision states that payment will not be made to a State with respect to amounts for medical assistance for section
1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) optional groups if the State has in effect AFDC payment levels that are less than those in
effect on July 1, 1987. In addition, section 302(c) established a new, more general maintenance of effort provision
in section 1902(c)(1), which states that the Secretary will not approve any Medicaid State plan if the State has in
effect AFDC payment levels which are less than those in effect on May 1, 1988. Because section 1116(b) of the Act distinguishes
between plans and plan amendments, we interpret this provision literally as prohibiting approval of new State plans
but not prohibiting approval of amendments to a State plan. The MCCA provisions were effective on July 1, 1989. There
have been some questions raised about how we would determine if the AFDC payment level has been maintained by a State
as specified in the law. ``Payment level'' is not an existing term used under AFDC. However, for the purposes of sections
1902(c) and 1903(i)(9), payment levels are the amounts of the payments for basic needs (according to family size)
which would be made to families with no income under the approved State AFDC plan. Special needs are not included, as
we have concluded, based on a review of statutory history, that Congress intended to include only basic needs. Thus,
we propose to find a State has not reduced its payment level if it has not reduced the amount of the AFDC payment for basic
needs made to a family with no other income. 




7. Application for AFDC 

Section 4104(e) of OBRA '87 amended section 1902(1)(4) of the Act by adding a new paragraph (C) to specify that a State
Medicaid plan may not provide that any of the low-income pregnant women, infants, and children under section 1902(1)
must apply for AFDC as a condition of applying for or receiving Medicaid. Section 302(c) of MCCA made further amendments
by removing section 1902(1)(4) and adding a comparable provision to section 1902(c)(2) of the Act. Section 1902(c)(2)
provides that the Secretary must not approve any State plan for Medicaid if the State requires low-income pregnant
women, infants, and children under section 1902(1)(1) to apply for AFDC benefits as a condition of applying for or
receiving Medicaid. 




8. Need for Regulations 

The statutory amendments discussed above are effective without regard to whether final regulations to carry them
out have been published by the applicable effective dates. However, changes in the Medicaid regulations are necessary
to bring the regulations up to date with current statutory requirements. 





9. Proposed Regulations 


We propose to amend the Medicaid regulations under 42 CFR parts 435, 436, 440, and 447 as follows: 


 Add a new  435.118 to specify the mandatory eligibility groups of pregnant women, infants under age 1,
children age 1 up to age 6 with incomes at or below 133 percent of the Federal poverty income guidelines, and children
age 6 up to age 19 with incomes at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty income guidelines. 


 Add  435.228 to specify the optional eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women and infants (and
low-income children in American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands) and  436.226 to specify the optional
eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children and the conditions under which they may establish
eligibility.

 Add   435.612 and 436.612 to incorporate the 
requirements for a State to establish income standards, and 
at State option, resource standards for these low-income 
groups and for applying methodologies to determine financial 
eligibility. 
 Revise   435.608 and 436.608 to specify that the 
State agency must not require low-income pregnant women, 
infants, and children to apply for AFDC benefits as a 
condition of applying for or receiving Medicaid. 
 Add a new  431.60 to specify the maintenance of 
specified AFDC payment levels as a condition of State plan 
approval. Revise   435.1002 and 436.1002 to specify that 
FFP is not available for expenditures for Medicaid for 
optional groups of low-income pregnant women and infants 
covered under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) if the State 
has in effect AFDC payment levels that are less than the 
payment levels in effect under the plan on July 1, 1987. 
 Revise  440.250 on limits on comparability of 
services to provide that services to pregnant women in the 
mandatory and optional categorically needy low-income 
eligibility groups are limited to services related to 
pregnancy (including prenatal, delivery, family planning, 
and postpartum services) and to other conditions which may 
complicate pregnancy that are included under the approved 
State plan. 
 Add a new  447.60 to specify the requirements and 
conditions for imposing a monthly premium on the optional 
eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women and infants 
with family incomes between 150 and 185 percent of the 
poverty level and make conforming changes to   447.50 and 
447.51. 
 
Section 303(e) of MCCA added section 1902(r)(2) of the 
Act, which allows States to elect to use less restrictive 
income and resource methodologies than the cash assistance 
methodologies for a number of eligibility groups, including 
the mandatory and optional categorically needy pregnant 
women, infants, and children in section 1902(l). On 
January 19, 1993, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 
FR 4908) regulations at   435.601, 435.602, 436.601, and 
436.602 to interpret section 1902(r)(2). The eligibility 
groups of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children 
described in this preamble are subject to the provisions of 
  435.601, 435.602, 436.601, and 436.602.





[

Note:

 On 
February 19, 1993, August 23, 1993, and February 18, 1994, 
we published notices in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 9120; 58 
FR 44457; and 59 FR 8138) to delay the effective dates for 
the January 19, 1993 final rule. If, at the time we issue 
the final rule for these proposed regulations, the January 
19, 1993 final regulations have been revised or are not in 
effect, we will make appropriate revisions.]





We propose to add new   435.612 and 436.612 to specify the requirements 
for establishing the income and resource standards for these 
groups and to cross-refer to   435.601, 435.602, 436.601, 
and 436.602 for the methodologies to be used for determining 
financial eligibility. The group of low-income aged and 
disabled individuals discussed in section I.F. of this 
document also is subject to   435.601, 435.602, 436.601 and 
436.602. 



B. Continuous Eligibility of Pregnant Women 




Under section 1902(e)(6) of the Act, as added by 
section 9401(d) of OBRA '86 and amended by section 
4101(e)(2) of OBRA '87, section 302(e) of MCCA, and 
section 4603 of OBRA '90, States must treat any pregnant 
women who are eligible under section 1902(a)(10) as 
continuously eligible throughout the pregnancy and the 
postpartum period without regard to changes in income. 


Section 9401(d) of OBRA '86 added section 1902(e)(6) to 
the Act. Section 1902(e)(6) allowed States to treat any 
women who were described in sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) 
and 1902(1) as continuously eligible during the pregnancy 
and through a 60-day postpartum period, without regard to 
any changes in family income. Women covered under this 
provision consisted of two groups: low-income pregnant 
women and low-income women during the 60-day period after 
the pregnancy ends. Therefore, this provision covered women 
who applied for and became Medicaid eligible under section 
1902(l) either before or after giving birth. Section 
4101(e)(2) of OBRA '87 redefined the section 1902(e)(6) 
postpartum period to specify that the period of continued 
coverage extends for 60 days after the pregnancy ends, 
beginning on the last day of pregnancy, plus any remaining 
days in the month in which the 60th day occurs. The 
remaining days in the month provision was added by OBRA '87 
for Federal matching payment and quality control purposes 
because, in some States, Medicaid eligibility is not 
terminated at any time other than the end of the month. 


Section 302(e) of MCCA amended section 1902(e)(6) of 
the Act to provide States with the option of treating any 
pregnant woman who has established eligibility under any 
eligibility group listed in section 1902(a)(10) and who, 
because of a change in income, would cease to be eligible, 
as a mandatory eligible low-income pregnant woman throughout 
the pregnancy and for the specified postpartum period, 
without regard to changes in family income. Section 
1902(e)(6) now refers to ``pregnant women'' rather than ``women 
described in section 1902(l)(1).'' As a result, we believe 
it still covers the pregnant women described in section 
1902(l)(1)(A) but no longer includes those women in section 
1902(l)(1)(A) who first become eligible only in the 60-day 
postpartum period after they have ceased to be ``pregnant 
women.''

Section 4603(a)(2) of OBRA '90 further amended section 
1902(e)(6) to require States to provide continuous coverage 
to any pregnant woman eligible under section 1902(a)(10) of 
the Act who would otherwise lose her eligibility due to a 
change in income. The pregnant woman must be ``deemed to 
continue to be'' a mandatory categorically needy individual 
described under sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) and 
1902(1)(1)(A) through the end of the postpartum period. The 
OBRA '90 amendment also stated that this mandatory coverage 
would not apply in the case of a woman who has received 
ambulatory prenatal care under section 1920 of the Act 
during a presumptive eligibility period and is then 
determined to be ineligible for regular Medicaid. 
Although section 1902(e)(6) purports to cover all 
pregnant women who, because of a change in family income, 
would not otherwise continue to be eligible for Medicaid, we 
believe that it does not automatically cover all pregnant 
women who must meet a spenddown. Most pregnant women 
seeking to meet a spenddown would be attempting to establish 
eligibility as medically needy. Section 1902(e)(6) now 
requires that a State deem a pregnant woman (who has 
established eligibility under any eligibility group) to 
continue to be a pregnant woman under sections 
1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) and 1902(1)(1)(A) if that woman would 
otherwise cease to be eligible due to a change in income. 
A medically needy woman can establish her eligibility 
during a given budget period by spending down her excess 
income. However, if she has the excess income in the 
following budget period and is ineligible because she cannot 
spend it down, we do not believe that her ineligibility has 
resulted from a ``change'' in income. In fact, her income is 
unchanged for eligibility purposes if it remains in excess 
of the medically needy income level by the same amount as in 
the previous budget period; she has simply not been able to 
spend down to the medically needy income level. We believe 
that under the statute, a medically needy pregnant woman 
whose family income does not change and who cannot meet her 
spenddown does not qualify as having the ``change'' in income 
contemplated by section 1902(e)(6). 
We are uncertain how to apply section 1902(e)(6) in the 
context of pregnant women who have a spenddown, and whose 
family incomes increase, causing this spenddown amount to 
increase. We propose to cover under this provision any 
pregnant woman who was eligible (either as categorically 
needy, medically needy without a spenddown, or medically 
needy after meeting a spenddown) at any time during her 
pregnancy, who then experiences a change in family income 
which either would cause her to lose categorically needy 
Medicaid, medically needy Medicaid without a spenddown, or 
to lose eligibility (be unable to meet the increased 
spenddown although she would have met the earlier spenddown) 
by virtue of an increased spenddown amount. 
We would interpret section 1902(e)(6) so that it will 
not relieve pregnant women who qualify under section 
1902(e)(6) of their obligation to satisfy their original 
spenddown amount in each budget period while in section 
1902(e)(6) status. 
If a pregnant woman who has in the previous budget 
period met a spenddown has an increase in income and 
qualifies under section 1902(e)(6), she must be ``deemed to 
continue to be'' a pregnant woman under sections 
1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) and 1902(1)(1)(A). These provisions 
describe categorically needy eligibility groups with respect 
to whom the limited Medicaid benefit is available. We 
believe that the phrase ``deemed to continue to be'' is 
ambiguous. The phrase can mean that the woman is to be 
regarded for all purposes as if she were actually 
categorically needy, or only that she is to be considered as 
categorically needy for the purpose of receiving the 
restricted service package that applies to pregnant women 
described in section 1902(1) without regard to the change in 
her family's income. If we were to regard the woman as 
though she were actually categorically needy, she would no 
longer have to meet any spenddown, and any subsequent 
changes of income would not affect her eligibility. This 
would place the medically needy pregnant woman whose income 
has increased in a better position than any other medically 
needy pregnant woman with a spenddown who has had no 
increase in income. 
In order to avoid the anomalous result of only pregnant 
women with higher incomes being relieved of their total 
spenddown obligations, we propose not to interpret section 
1902(e)(6) as requiring that a medically needy woman be 
considered as though she were categorically needy for all 
purposes. We propose instead to interpret the phrase 
``deemed to continue to be'' in section 1902(e)(6) to require 
only that a woman who meets her original spenddown amount, 
but cannot meet the increased amount, be deemed to be 
eligible for the limited service package provided to the 
section 1902(1) pregnant women. The woman can maintain this 
deemed status without having to pay any increased spenddown 
amounts which result from increases in family income. She 
will, however, be required to continue to meet her original 
spenddown while in section 1902(e)(6) status. 
We propose to revise redesignated  435.918 relating to 
redetermination of eligibility, to provide that the agency 
must consider a pregnant woman eligible under any Medicaid 
eligibility group as an individual who is eligible to 
receive the services available to the mandatory 
categorically needy low-income group throughout the 
pregnancy and for the specific postpartum period after the 
pregnancy ends without regard to changes in the family 
income. 


C. Qualified Children 


Section 4601(a)(2) of OBRA '90 amended the definition 
of a qualified child in section 1905(n)(2) of the Act, 
effective July 1, 1991. Under section 
1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(III) of the Act, a State must provide 
Medicaid coverage to the mandatory group of qualified 
children. Effective July 1, 1991, under the new definition 
of qualified child added by OBRA '90, a State must provide 
Medicaid coverage to children under the age of 19 who were 
born after September 30, 1983, and who meet the income and 
resource requirements of the State plan under title IV-A. 
The option in section 1905(n)(2) for a State to include as 
qualified children those children born after an earlier date 
than September 30, 1983 (as chosen by the State) was 
retained. As a result, effective July 1, 1991, States have 
the option to provide Medicaid coverage to children under 
the age of 19 who were born after any date prior to 
September 30, 1983 (as chosen by the State) who meet the 
income and resource requirements of title IV-A.

We propose to amend  435.116(c) to raise the maximum age of a qualified child to under age 19. 



D. Deemed Newborn Eligibility 



1. OBRA '90 Changes 



Section 4603(a) of OBRA '90 changed the requirements in section 1902(e)(4) of the Act under which a newborn child remains
eligible for Medicaid, effective January 1, 1991. Prior to this change, States were only required to continue the
eligibility of an infant deemed eligible at birth for so long as the infant remained a member of the mother's household
and the mother remained eligible for Medicaid. States must now also continue the eligibility of an infant deemed eligible
at birth if the infant remains a member of the mother's household and the mother loses Medicaid eligibility but would
remain eligible if pregnant. 

We considered whether the language ``remain eligible if pregnant'' meant that the mother should be considered as
newly pregnant in each month after the postpartum period. Under this interpretation, if the mother was regarded as
reapplying for Medicaid after the postpartum period as though she were newly pregnant, her income might be too high
for her to be eligible, even under the pregnancy-related eligibility categories. (For example, the mother's income
may have increased above the applicable standard during the pregnancy but she remained eligible through the postpartum
period by virtue of section 1902(e)(6) of the Act.) If she is regarded as newly pregnant, she would not receive the continued
coverage under section 1902(e)(6) for women whose incomes increase after they are already eligible and pregnant.
As a result, the mother would not be ``eligible'' even if she were considered to be pregnant and the infant would lose
eligibility under section 1902(e)(4). 

We decided that a better reading of the provision would be to consider a mother as if she had not yet given birth; that
is, as if she had remained continuously pregnant. A discussion of this provision in the House Report of the Committee
on Budget to accompany H.R. 5835 (H. Rep. No. 881, 101st Cong., 2d. Sess. 103 (1990)) refers to the woman remaining eligible
for Medicaid or one who ``would be eligible for Medicaid were she still pregnant,'' which implies she should be treated
as if she had not given birth. Therefore, we propose to require States to continue the eligibility of an infant deemed
eligible at birth who is in his or her mother's household and whose mother would still be eligible for Medicaid if the
infant had not yet been born. Under this interpretation, changes in the mother's income will have no impact on the infant's
eligibility because were the mother still pregnant, she would remain eligible without regard to changes in income
by virtue of section 1902(e)(6) of the Act. A redetermination of the mother's eligibility is not required at the end
of the postpartum period unless information is received that there has been a change in the mother's circumstances
which might have affected her eligibility even if she were still pregnant and the infant had not yet been born. 



2. Member of the Mother's Household 



An infant must continue to be a member of his/her mother's household to maintain deemed newborn eligibility. We are
codifying existing policy related to determinations of whether an infant is a member of his or her mother's household.
An infant is considered a member of his or her mother's household as long as he or she is continuously hospitalized after
birth, unless the mother has legally relinquished control of the child or the State has established that she has abandoned
the child. After the infant's release from the hospital, or in situations not involving hospitalization, States
must apply the AFDC rules for determining whether a child is living with a specified relative to determine if an infant
(who is not an SSI recipient) is a member of his or her mother's household. 



E. Inpatient Services to Infants and Children 



Under section 1902(e)(7) of the Act, as added by OBRA '86 and amended by section 4101(b) of OBRA '87, section 302(e)(2)
of MCCA, and section 6401 of OBRA '89, States must extend Medicaid eligibility to a low-income infant or child described
in section 1902(l) of the Act or a qualified child described in section 1905(n)(2) of the Act who is receiving covered
inpatient services in a hospital or a long-term care facility on the date he or she attains the maximum age for Medicaid
eligibility under the State plan until the end of the inpatient stay if the child or infant remains eligible, except
that he or she has attained that maximum age. This provision applies to the mandatory and optional categorically needy
eligibility groups of low-income infants and children described under section 1902(l) of the Act. Section 6401 of
OBRA '89 extended this provision to the new mandatory categorically needy group of low-income children age 1 up to
age 6 under section 1902(l)(1)(C) and section 4601 of OBRA '90 (by changes to section 1902(l)(1)(D)) to the new mandatory
categorically needy group of children born after September 30, 1983 who have not attained age 19 also. (In addition,
section 302(b) of MCCA further clarified this provision by adding in the matter after paragraph (F) of section 1902(a)(10)
a new paragraph (X) to provide that States that impose durational limits on payments for inpatient hospital services
must establish exceptions to these limits for medically necessary inpatient services received by an infant up to
age 1 in a hospital designated as a disproportionate share hospital under the State's Medicaid plan. Regulations
to interpret section 302(b) of MCCA are included in a separate document that is under development.)

We propose to amend   435.520 and 436.520 to require State agencies to extend Medicaid eligibility to
a low- income infant or child described in section 1902(1) of the Act and a qualified child described in section 1905(n)(2)
of the Act who are receiving covered inpatient services on the date they attain the maximum age for Medicaid eligibility
under the State plan until the end of the inpatient stay if the infant or child remains eligible except for attainment
of the maximum age; and make conforming changes to   435.500 and 436.500.



F. Low-Income Aged and Disabled Individuals



Section 9402 of OBRA '86 amended the Social Security Act by adding new sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(X) and 1902(m)
to establish an optional categorically needy eligibility group of aged and disabled individuals with incomes at
or below the Federal poverty income level. Section 1902(m) of the Act, as added by OBRA '86 and amended by section 4118(p)(8)
of OBRA '87 and section 301(e) of MCCA, describes individuals in this group as those who are 65 years of age or older or
are disabled as determined under SSI, whose income does not exceed a standard established by the State that is set at
a percentage (at or below 100 percent) of the Federal poverty income level, and whose resources do not exceed the maximum
amount of resources allowed under SSI. If a State has a medically needy program with a more generous resource level,
section 1902(m)(2)(B) allows a State to elect to use the medically needy resource level instead of the SSI resource
level.

Between July 1, 1987 and June 30, 1989, States were permitted to provide eligibility to this optional group of low-income
aged and disabled individuals only if they also provided Medicaid eligibility to the low-income group of pregnant
women and infants under the provisions of section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) as added by section 9401 of OBRA '86 discussed
earlier. Section 301(e)(2)(D) of MCCA removed the condition for providing eligibility to both groups, effective
July 1, 1989.

Income eligibility for this optional group of aged and disabled individuals is based on a standard established at
a level that is at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty income guidelines for a family of the size involved. The
term ``family of the size involved,'' as used in section 1902(m)(2)(A), is not specifically defined in the statute.
However, for this optional group of aged and disabled we believe that it would be appropriate to adopt for individuals
and couples who seek eligibility under section 1902(m) of the Act the SSI program's distinction between eligible
individuals and eligible couples, depending on whether the individual alone is eligible or both members of the couple
are eligible under section 1902(m). Since the statute requires that income be determined using the principles of
section 1612, which are SSI program rules, using SSI's individual and couple distinction as well as SSI's deeming
rules enables States to have a clear understanding of the baseline for determining eligibility for members of this
poverty level-related group. It also avoids potential conflicts with section 1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act, which could
result if eligibility for this group were determined by pooling family income (if the family included individuals
other than a husband and wife).

The SSI program determines eligibility for couples, or for individuals. If the SSI definition of a couple (i.e., the
couple is married and they qualify for SSI benefits as an eligible couple) is not met, eligibility is determined on
an individual basis. We propose to apply this principle to determine eligibility for the optional Medicaid aged and
disabled group. If two individuals are married and are both eligible under section 1902(m), both spouses will be considered
a couple even if only one spouse applied for medical assistance and their income will be compared to the Federal poverty
level for a family of two. If both individuals in a family are not eligible as a couple under section 1902(m), their eligibility
will be determined as individuals, with their incomes being compared to the poverty level for an individual, and deeming
of income and resources from responsible family members using SSI deeming methodologies.

Section 1902(m) of the Act has always specified that resources of individuals under the low-income optional categorically
needy group of aged and disabled individuals may not exceed the SSI limits, and that SSI methodologies must be used
to determine countable income and resources. However, section 1902(r)(2) of the Act, as added by section 303(e) of
MCCA, does permit States, at their option, to use less restrictive requirements than SSI for optional categorically
needy groups. However, in spite of section 1902(r)(2), we do not believe that States are authorized to allow individuals
to deduct (spend down) the costs incurred for medical care or any other type of remedial care from income in order to
meet the income standard established, except as they are permitted to do so under SSI if the individual is a severely
disabled person who works. This is because section 1902(m)(3)(B) of the Act specifically prohibits the use of an income
spenddown, except in the case of individuals covered by section 1612(b)(4)(B)(ii) of the Act. Under this exception,
a severely disabled individual who works is allowed to deduct from income the reasonable costs for attendant care
services, medical devices, equipment, prostheses, and similar items and services (generally not including routine
drugs or routine medical services) that are necessary in order for the individual to work.

Section 6411(a) of OBRA '89 amended section 1902(f) of the Act to eliminate the option to use more restrictive eligibility
criteria than are used by the SSI program for certain eligibility groups. One of those groups is the optional low-income
aged and disabled group. Therefore, section 1902(f) States that elect to cover the section 1902(m) group must use
SSI eligibility methodologies, and the statutorily mandated income and resource standards, in determining eligibility
for individuals under this group. The only exception is that section 1902(f) States can use more liberal criteria
under section 1902(r)(2). (Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands would use the SSI disability definition under
section 1614 of the Act and the methodologies for determining income and resource eligibility applied under sections
1612 and 1613, or less restrictive income and resource methodologies under section 1902(r)(2), as appropriate.
This is because the reference in section 1902(m) relating to disability and financial methodologies is to those of
title XVI (that is, SSI) and not to those of the State plan program under title XVI.)

Section 4501(e)(1) of OBRA '90 amended section 1905(p)(2) of the Act by adding paragraph (D) to provide that, in determining
income eligibility for qualified Medicare beneficiaries (QMBs) who are entitled to monthly title II insurance benefits,
any cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in these title II benefits received beginning in December of the preceding
year must be disregarded. We will issue a separate regulation incorporating this provision for QMBs. Section 4501(e)(2)
of OBRA '90 made this rule also apply to the income eligibility determinations of the aged and disabled individuals
covered by section 1902(m).

The disregard applies to all the months from the month the COLA increase is effective through the month after the month
the revised poverty levels are published each year. Since the new poverty levels are usually published in February,
the disregard normally will be effective through March of each year. 

However, for Medicaid purposes, the new poverty levels are effective upon publication. This means that, for the period
between publication of the poverty levels (usually mid-February) and the end of the disregard period (usually March),
the disregard of the COLA increase and the poverty level increase would overlap. As a result of this overlap, some individuals
would meet the income level for this group because the COLA disregard would lower their countable income at the same
time that the revised poverty level would allow for higher income. As soon as the COLA disregard expired, these individuals
would lose eligibility again. 

We believe that this approach would create an unreasonable administrative burden for States. They would have to add
these individuals to the Medicaid rolls, only to have to remove them again a few weeks later. We also believe that the
intent of the statutory provision is to protect individuals who would lose that status for a few weeks because of the
COLA increase (but only until the increase in the poverty level took effect), and not to permit other individuals to
achieve eligibility status for a few weeks. 

For these reasons, we are proposing to make the revised poverty levels effective for title II recipients with the month
after the last month in which the COLA disregard is effective. Since the COLA disregard normally expires at the end
of March, in most years, the new poverty levels would be effective for these individuals on April 1. By delaying the
effective date of the increased poverty level so that it coincides with the date on which the COLA increase is first
counted, we would eliminate the problem discussed above. 

Section 9402 of OBRA '86 does not require or permit the different treatment of income and resources allowed for this
low-income aged and disabled eligibility group to be applied to other Medicaid eligibility groups because of the
comparability provisions of section 1902(a)(17) of the Act. In addition, we propose to require that if a State elects
to provide Medicaid eligibility to this low-income group, it must cover both the aged and disabled and must apply the
same income and resource standards to both groups and to all family sizes involved. This requirement is consistent
with the intent of Congress, as expressed in the language of the House Committee Report accompanying OBRA '86 (H. Rep.
727, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 103 (1986)). 

Medicaid services provided to the optional group of low-income aged and disabled individuals must be the same in amount,
duration, and scope as the Medicaid services provided to other categorically needy individuals under the approved
State Medicaid plan. 

The amendments made by section 9402 of OBRA '86 apply to payments to States for services for calendar quarters beginning
on or after July 1, 1987, without regard to whether or not final regulations to carry them out have been published by
that date. 

We propose to incorporate the provisions of sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(X) and 1902(m) of the Act and section 9402
of OBRA '86 in the Medicaid regulations by adding  435.238 ( 436.235 for the Territories) to specify the
optional categorically needy eligibility group of aged and disabled individuals with incomes at or below Federal
poverty income guidelines and the conditions under which they may establish eligibility. We also propose to add a
new   435.615 and 436.615 to specify the requirements for establishing the income and resource standards
and methodologies for this group and for determining financial eligibility.

G. Presumptive Eligibility for Pregnant Women 



Section 9407 of OBRA '86 added a new section 1902(a)(47) to the Act, redesignated section 1920 as section 1921, and
added a new section 1920 to allow States to provide ambulatory prenatal care to certain needy pregnant women to help
ensure that these women receive health care early in pregnancy. Section 411(k)(16)(B) of the MCCA and section 4605
of OBRA '90 amended section 1920. Under section 1920, ambulatory prenatal care is available during a presumptive
eligibility period on the basis of income eligibility only before a woman is formally determined to be eligible or
ineligible for Medicaid and for a specified number of days while a woman is waiting for a Medicaid eligibility determination.
Under the statutory provisions, a qualified provider, who is defined in section 1920(b)(2), determines whether
a pregnant woman is presumptively eligible for Medicaid. These qualified providers make the presumptive eligibility
determination on the basis of preliminary information about the pregnant woman's family income. The qualified provider
determines whether the pregnant woman's family income appears to meet the income criteria applied to any of the eligibility
groups specified in the approved State Medicaid plan under which the pregnant woman might be eligible. At the time
of the determination, a qualified provider must refer a pregnant woman to the Medicaid agency. The qualified provider
must also assist a pregnant woman in completing and filing an application for full Medicaid services if she wishes
to apply for Medicaid at that time. The Medicaid agency then would establish whether or not she is eligible for regular
Medicaid. 

Any provider that is eligible for payment under the State plan for services which the State considers to be ambulatory
prenatal care can furnish these services to presumptively eligible pregnant women during the presumptive period.
(We note that the purpose of presumptive eligibility is to provide temporary, limited coverage to pregnant women
who are likely to be eligible for Medicaid. Under section 1905(a) of the Act, individuals who are inmates in public
institutions are ineligible for Medicaid. Therefore, because she is not ``likely to be eligible for Medicaid,''
any pregnant woman who is an inmate in a public institution could not be determined presumptively eligible for Medicaid
and receive ambulatory prenatal care under section 1920 of the Act.)

In accordance with section 1920(b)(1), as added by OBRA '86 and amended by section 4605 of OBRA '90, the presumptive
period of eligibility for ambulatory prenatal care begins on the day a qualified provider makes a presumptive eligibility
determination. The pregnant woman then has until the last calendar day of the month following the month in which the
presumptive eligibility determination was made to file a regular Medicaid application with the Medicaid agency.
If she does not file a regular Medicaid application by that last day, presumptive eligibility ends on that last day.
If she files a regular Medicaid application, presumptive eligibility under section 1920 ends on the date a decision
is made on the regular Medicaid application. 

We are proposing to allow only one presumptive eligibility period for any one pregnancy. We believe that this limitation
is consistent with the intent of Congress as evidenced in the language of the Senate Committee Report on OBRA '86 (S.
Rep. 348, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 153 (1986)). In explaining the provision, the Committee stated that under the presumptive
eligibility program, States may ``for 

any one pregnancy, 

grant presumptive eligibility for 

a period 

not to exceed * * *'' (emphasis added). Congress' use of the underscored phrases leads to the conclusion
that only one presumptive period was intended. We solicit comments on the proposed policy to allow only one presumptive
eligibility period per pregnancy. 

The new section 1920 specifies that a presumptive eligibility determination is to be made if the pregnant woman appears
to the qualified provider, on the basis of preliminary information supplied by her on family income, to meet the applicable
income level of eligibility only. Resources and other Medicaid eligibility requirements that would be considered
under the approved State plan if the woman were to apply for regular Medicaid benefits are not considered in making
the presumptive eligibility determination. In addition, section 1920 provides that a determination of presumptive
eligibility be based on ``preliminary information'' about family income. Therefore, a qualified provider may only
request information that is correct based upon a pregnant woman's best information and belief and may not require
exact information under a penalty of perjury. A State may require that women reveal what their incomes are or only that
their incomes are below the applicable level.

In implementing the provisions of section 1920 that 
specify that presumptive eligibility determinations must be 
based on family income, we would require the qualified 
provider in all cases to apply to the woman's gross family 
income the highest, most advantageous income criteria 
applicable to the pregnant woman under the approved plan. 
The ``applicable'' level would usually be the higher of either 
the poverty level standard or the medically needy income 
level (without spenddown). This means that income 
disregards are not considered, and in the case of blind or 
disabled individuals in section 1902(f) States, or in States 
that have a medically needy program, the cost of incurred 
medical expenses could not be deducted in order to reduce 
income to the allowed income level (spending down). 
Consideration of disregards and incurred medical expenses 
would allow some women to have income above the ``applicable 
level'' specified in section 1920(b)(1)(A). We believe 
Congress intended by the use of the term ``applicable level'' 
to require qualified providers only to make simple 
calculations and not complicated adjustments of income such 
as those involved in applying spenddown rules or in 
disregarding certain types of income. To impose detailed 
calculations and complicated adjustments on providers would 
be administratively burdensome and contrary to efficient 
administration because of the short-term nature of the 
presumptive eligibility status and because no other 
eligibility requirements (not even resources) are 
considered. We believe that we are not imposing an undue 
hardship on a pregnant woman by not allowing spenddown or 
not disregarding certain income. If the provider makes a 
decision that the woman does not ``appear'' to meet the income 
criteria, the pregnant woman still has the right to apply 
for regular Medicaid within a reasonable period of time and 
have a formal eligibility determination made. Under a 
formal eligibility determination, the agency may find that 
the pregnant woman is retroactively eligible for regular 
Medicaid during the presumptive period under the authority 
of section 1902(a)(34) of the Act. 

Section 1920(b)(2) of the Act, as added by OBRA '86 and 
amended by section 411(k)(16) of MCCA, specifies the 
qualifications that a provider must meet in order to be 
allowed to make presumptive eligibility determinations. The 
provider must_ 

(1) Be eligible to receive payments under Medicaid; 
(2) Be an entity that provides services of the 
following type: outpatient hospital services as specified 
in section 1905(a)(2)(A) of the Act or rural health clinic 
services and any other ambulatory services offered by a 
rural health clinic and otherwise included in the plan as 
described in section 1905(a)(2)(B); or be an entity that 
provides clinic services by or under the direction of a 
physician described in section 1905(a)(9) of the Act;

(3) Be determined by the State agency to be capable of 
making presumptive eligibility determinations on the basis 
of preliminary information on family income; and 

(4) Meet one of the following conditions:




_Be receiving funding from the migrant health centers 
or community health centers programs under sections 329, 
330, or 340 of the Public Health Service Act; funding from 
the maternal and child health services block grant program 
under title V of the Social Security Act; or funding under 
title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. 

_Be participating in the Special Supplemental Food 
Program for Women, Infants, and Children established under 
section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, or in the 
Commodity Supplemental Food Program established under 
section 4(a) of the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act 
of 1973. 

_Be participating in a State perinatal program. 
_Be the Indian Health Service or a health program or 
facility operated by a tribe or tribal organization under 
the Indian Self-Determination Act (Pub. L. 93-638).




All providers who meet the criteria listed above must 
be considered qualified providers. Therefore, if a State 
determines that a provider is not capable of making 
presumptive eligibility determinations for pregnant women, 
that provider would not be considered ``qualified'' to make 
these determinations. We would permit States to exclude a 
provider that is qualified only under very narrow 
circumstances; that is, if a State can demonstrate that 
there is good cause to exclude the provider. In addition, 
we wish to give States maximum flexibility in meeting the 
needs of pregnant women and, therefore, propose to allow 
States to determine whether a program is a ``State perinatal 
program.'' 

In interpreting the provisions of section 1920(b), we 
would require States to provide qualified providers with 
proper screening forms for pregnant women to request a 
decision of presumptive eligibility. We also would require 
the States to provide instructions to qualified providers on 
how to apply the gross income criteria under the various 
eligibility groups under the State's approved Medicaid plan 
and how to determine the highest income criteria group under 
which the pregnant woman is most likely to be eligible if 
she applies for regular Medicaid. We are not prescribing 
the specific content and format of the screening forms or 
instructions. However, we expect State instructions to be 
in enough detail to allow a qualified provider (based on 
preliminary information provided by a pregnant woman) to 
make reasonably accurate income eligibility determinations. 

In accordance with section 1920(c)(1), we would require 
State agencies to furnish qualified providers with regular 
Medicaid application forms and train them to assist pregnant 
women who wish to apply in completing and filing these 
forms. As provided by section 1920(c)(3) of the Act as 
amended by section 4605 of OBRA '90, the application 
provided may be an application developed by the State for 
use by pregnant women who wish to apply as low-income 
pregnant women described in section 1902(l)(1)(A) of the 
Act. 

Section 1920(c)(3) of the Act seems to contemplate an 
application for regular Medicaid that is separate from the 
screening form for presumptive eligibility for ambulatory 
prenatal care. We believe the presumptive eligibility 
screening form and the regular Medicaid application can be 
combined. However, pregnant women cannot be required to 
provide all of the information necessary for a full-scale 
Medicaid application when applying for only presumptive 
eligibility. If the forms are combined, a State agency can 
offer the pregnant woman the option to complete the entire 
application but cannot require that she do so in order to 
establish presumptive eligibility. A qualified provider 
must make a presumptive eligibility determination once a 
pregnant woman has provided information about her family 
income and cannot require additional information. 

A presumptive eligibility screening form alone cannot 
be used to establish a filing date for a regular Medicaid 
application. If a combined presumptive eligibility 
screening form and Medicaid application is used and the 
woman chooses to complete the entire application, the 
completed application form must be forwarded promptly to the 
appropriate State agency for a decision on regular Medicaid 
eligibility under the plan once the qualified provider makes 
a decision on presumptive eligibility. In this situation, 
the date the completed form is received by the State agency 
is the Medicaid filing date for Medicaid eligibility. If 
the woman is determined to be eligible, this date will 
determine the beginning of the period in which she qualifies 
for the more extensive services under the plan and will 
establish the month used to determine the dates of the 3 
months of retroactive eligibility, if the woman would have 
been eligible during the retroactive period. Under this 
latter approach, pregnant women would not be required to 
file another application. However, they would not be exempt 
from meeting with State agency staff as appropriate or from 
providing additional information necessary to determine 
eligibility under the plan.

A modified approach under this option would be to have 
State agency staff on site at qualified provider locations 
to supervise or actually assist pregnant women in completing 
the application form. In these cases, the application date 
for regular Medicaid plan services would be the date the 
onsite State agency staff person receives the completed 
form. This would result in an earlier Medicaid filing date. 
However, even though State agency staff who are working at 
qualified provider locations can receive and process 
applications for regular Medicaid, they cannot make 
presumptive eligibility determinations unless they 
themselves meet the definition of ``qualified provider'' under 
section 1920(b)(2). 

Since we are considering pregnant women who apply only 
for presumptive eligibility for ambulatory prenatal care as 
requesting to receive services under a special status (that 
is, not regular Medicaid eligibility), we propose not to 
apply to a decision on presumptive eligibility the 
notification requirements that a State must meet when it 
makes a decision on a regular Medicaid application. 
Existing regulations under   435.911 and 435.912 and part 
431, subpart E, require Medicaid agencies to notify Medicaid 
applicants within a specified period of time of the agency's 
decision on a regular Medicaid application, the reasons for 
the decision, and an explanation of rights to a hearing if 
the application is denied. Although we propose not to apply 
the requirements of   435.911 and 435.912 and part 431, 
subpart E, to presumptive eligibility decisions, we are 
proposing to require that the qualified provider inform a 
pregnant woman in writing of the presumptive eligibility 
decision at the time of the determination. In the case of a 
denial of presumptive eligibility, the qualified provider 
would be required to inform the woman in writing of the 
reason for the denial of this special status and of her 
right to apply to the State agency for an eligibility 
decision for regular Medicaid. 

In accordance with section 1920 of the Act, we propose 
to require the qualified provider to inform, in writing, a 
pregnant woman who is determined presumptively eligible that 
she is required to file a regular Medicaid application by 
the last day of the month following the month in which the 
presumptive determination is made if she wishes to continue 
to receive ambulatory prenatal care after that date. The 
qualified provider must inform the pregnant woman in writing 
that if she does not file her application for regular 
Medicaid by the last day of the month following the month in 
which she was determined presumptively eligible, her 
presumptive eligibility will end on that date. However, if 
she files within the deadline, she will remain presumptively 
eligible until she has a regular Medicaid determination. 
Under the provisions of section 1920(c)(2), the qualified 
provider also must notify the State agency within 5 working 
days after the date on which the provider determines that 
the pregnant woman is presumptively eligible.

While the procedures under   435.911 and 435.912 for 
notifying individuals of actions on applications would not 
apply to presumptive eligibility decisions for ambulatory 
prenatal care, they would apply to regular Medicaid 
applications filed after the presumptive eligibility 
determination is made. Because we do not consider 
presumptive eligibility for ambulatory prenatal care to be 
eligibility for Medicaid per se, and because termination of 
ambulatory prenatal care benefits occurs automatically after 
specified time periods under section 1920 of the Act, we 
also propose not to apply the existing provisions of the 
regulations that require Medicaid agencies to provide timely 
written notice of reduction or termination of Medicaid 
benefits and rights to appeal of an adverse action (part 
431, subpart E and  435.919). As indicated earlier, we 
propose to require a qualified provider to provide written 
notice of the date a pregnant woman can expect presumptive 
eligibility for ambulatory prenatal care to end. However, 
we propose not to grant rights to appeal a denial or 
termination of ambulatory prenatal care services under a 
presumptive eligibility decision. A presumptively eligible 
pregnant woman who subsequently files a regular Medicaid 
application that is denied would have the right to appeal 
the denial of her regular Medicaid application. 

We do not believe that we are imposing an undue burden 
on qualified providers by requiring that notification by a 
qualified provider be in writing. We do not foresee that 
this written notice will be individual personal letters. We 
considered requiring States to supply qualified providers 
with preprinted notices. However, we decided to allow 
States the flexibility to determine how to best arrange for 
this notification within each State program. We 
particularly solicit comments on whether the requirement 
that notification by a qualified provider be in writing 
imposes an undue hardship on qualified providers. 

Existing regulations at  435.914 permit States to 
provide Medicaid for an entire month when an individual is 
eligible for Medicaid under the plan at any time during the 
month. We propose not to permit States to provide full 
month eligibility for presumptive eligibility periods 
because by definition a presumptive determination is not a 
determination of Medicaid eligibility but eligibility for a 
special status. Therefore, special status eligibility 
begins on the exact date a presumptive eligibility decision 
is made and ends on the last day of the month following the 
month in which the presumptive decision is made when a 
Medicaid application has not been filed, or on the date a 
formal decision of Medicaid eligibility is made if an 
application has been filed. However, full month regular 
Medicaid eligibility is available during the approval month 
of a regular Medicaid application in States that have 
elected full month coverage in their approved State Medicaid 
plan. 

Section 9407 of OBRA '86, as amended by section 
411(k)(16) of MCCA, provides that, for purposes of Federal 
financial participation, ambulatory prenatal care services 
that are covered under the plan, are furnished by a provider 
that is eligible for payment under the State plan, and are 
furnished to pregnant women during a presumptive period of 
eligibility, will be treated as expenditures for medical 
assistance under the State plan and thus are regarded as 
Medicaid plan services. If the State makes any payments for 
ambulatory prenatal care furnished by an eligible provider 
during the presumptive period for women who are later 
determined to be ineligible for Medicaid, these payments 
will not be counted in determining a State's excess 
erroneous payments for purposes of disallowing Federal 
financial participation. In general, Medicaid quality 
control will not review the accuracy of presumptive 
eligibility determinations in terms of predicting a pregnant 
woman's eligibility for Medicaid, and any erroneous payments 
made cannot be counted in determining the State's erroneous 
payments for purposes of quality control eligibility errors. 
However, quality control will review claims for services 
furnished to presumptively eligible pregnant women to 
determine whether these claims were, in fact, made for women 
who were pregnant and were for ambulatory prenatal services 
covered under the State plan, were furnished by a provider 
that is eligible to receive payment under the State plan, 
and were furnished during a period of presumptive 
eligibility. There will be situations in which the services 
furnished by a qualified provider will include verification 
of a woman's pregnancy. The services that are furnished for 
verification will be covered as presumptive eligibility 
services for FFP purposes only if the woman is actually 
pregnant. Section 1920 covers only ambulatory prenatal care 
made available to a pregnant woman during a specified 
period. Services furnished to deliver or remove an 
embryo/fetus from the mother or furnished following that 
delivery or removal will not be covered as presumptive 
eligibility services for FFP purposes. That is because, if 
the embryo/fetus is no longer viable, the woman is no longer 
considered to be a pregnant woman. Also, we do not believe 
that the services involved in delivering either a viable or 
nonviable fetus constitute prenatal services. In addition, 
any services furnished following removal or delivery would 
not be furnished to a pregnant woman nor would they 
constitute prenatal care.

We also expect States to monitor decisions made by specific qualified providers to assure the accuracy and integrity
of the determinations and to take any corrective actions that may be necessary. Therefore, we are proposing to require
States to monitor presumptive eligibility decisions.

We propose to amend the Medicaid regulations to incorporate the provisions of section 9407 of OBRA '86, section 411(k)(16)
of MCCA, and section 4605 of OBRA '90 as follows:

 Revise   431.864 and 431.865 to specify that excess erroneous payments for purposes of disallowance
of Federal financial participation do not include erroneous payments for ambulatory prenatal care covered under
the State plan, and provided to pregnant women during a presumptive eligibility period by a provider eligible for
Medicaid payments.

 Add   435.250 and 436.250 to specify optional coverage of pregnant women during a presumptive
eligibility period.

 Amend  435.907 to clarify what constitutes a formal Medicaid application.

 Add a new  435.911 to specify the screening and application requirements and procedures for making presumptive
eligibility determinations. Existing   435.911 through 435.914 would be redesignated as   435.914
through 435.917, respectively, to allow the incorporation of the new  435.911.

 Add a new  435.912 to specify the application requirements for pregnant women following the presumptive
eligibility determination.

 Amend   435.1001 and 436.1001 to clarify that FFP is available in the necessary administrative
costs the State incurs in determining presumptive eligibility for pregnant women and in providing ambulatory prenatal
care to presumptively eligible women.

 Revise  440.1 to add the statutory basis for providing ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women during
a presumptive eligibility period.

 Add  440.172 to define ambulatory prenatal care and qualified provider.

 Add  447.85 to specify the availability of Federal financial participation for payments for ambulatory
prenatal care.



H. Enhancement of Pregnancy Outcomes



As we have discussed earlier in two sections of this document, Congress has expanded mandatory and optional Medicaid
eligibility for pregnant women as part of an overall effort to combat the problem of infant mortality and incidences
of low-birth weight through provision of needed health services to low-income pregnant women. In addition, we believe
that we must focus State attention on the need for special vigilance in cases of high-risk pregnancy in order to maximize
the cost effectiveness of the increased Medicaid investments. Examples of high-risk pregnancies include those
in which the women have a complicating medical condition, complications that may result from genetic factors, or
a history of adverse pregnancy outcomes. There is much evidence that many adverse birth outcomes are preventible
through timely and appropriate intervention by health and social services agencies, with the potential for reducing
infant mortality, the use of high-cost neonatal intensive care services, and the incidence of long-term care services
associated with extended or lifelong disabilities.

We propose to add  435.935 to the Medicaid regulations to require States to define a high-risk pregnancy, to
describe the methods they will apply to identify high-risk pregnant women, and to specify steps that individuals,
groups, and organizations involved in the service delivery system will take to ensure that these women will receive
services designed to enhance pregnancy outcomes for both the mother and the child. The purpose of defining these terms
is to assist States in their efforts to see that pregnant Medicaid recipients receive the full range of medical and
related services appropriate to their risk status.

We are proposing to impose these requirements on States under the authority of sections 1902(a) (4) and (19) of the
Act. These provisions, respectively, require that the Medicaid State plan provide for such methods of administration
as are found necessary by the Secretary for the proper and efficient operation of the plan, and provide such safeguards
as may be necessary to assure that eligibility for care and services under the plan will be determined, and the care
and services will be provided in a manner consistent with simplicity of administration and the best interests of recipients.

We specially solicit comment on the proposal to require States to target potentially high risk pregnant women. Moreover,
we are interested in comments on the effectiveness of a State plan amendment to achieve this goal.



I. Clarification of Medicaid to Homeless Individuals



Section 9405 of OBRA '86 revised section 1902(b)(2) of the Act to prohibit States from imposing any residence requirement
that excludes from Medicaid an otherwise eligible individual who resides in the State, but does not maintain a residence
permanently or at a fixed address. Before this provision was enacted, some States were requiring applicants for Medicaid
to furnish a fixed address or evidence of a permanent residence in order to qualify for Medicaid, even though this was
not a Federal requirement. In addition, section 11005 of the Homeless Eligibility Clarification Act added section
1902(a)(48) to the Act to require, as a State plan requirement, that States establish a method for making Medicaid
eligibility cards available to an eligible individual who does not reside in a permanent dwelling or at a fixed address.
This provision was effective on January 1, 1987.

In the interest of affording States maximum flexibility in the administration of their Medicaid programs, we are
not proposing to impose a specific method to be used to issue Medicaid eligibility cards to homeless individuals.
However, the State would be required to describe the method in its State plan. The method, as part of the State plan,
would be subject to approval by HCFA. HCFA will approve any reasonable method that ensures the timely issuance of cards
and receipt of Medicaid and that does not impose an undue hardship on the homeless individual.

We propose to_

 Amend   435.403 and 436.403 to add the prohibition against requiring otherwise eligible homeless
individuals to have a fixed address or reside in a permanent dwelling.

 Add a new  435.932 to specify the State plan requirement that a State must establish and specify a method
for issuing Medicaid eligibility cards to homeless individuals.

III. Response to Public Comments 



Because of the large volume of public comments that we usually receive on notices of proposed rulemaking, we cannot
acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, we will address all public comments received on this document
in the preamble to the document in which these proposed regulations are issued in final form.



IV. Paperwork Burden



Sections 435.612(f), 435.615(e), 435.907, 435.911, 435.918, 435.932, 435.935, 436.612(e), 436.615(e), 447.51,
and 447.60 contain information collection and reporting requirements that are subject to review by the Office of
Management and Budget under the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). We have submitted
these proposed regulations to OMB for review. The reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated
to be 6 hours per response. A notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

 when approval is obtained. Comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of information collection
must be addressed to the specified office indicated under the ``

ADDRESSES

'' section of this preamble.



V. Regulatory Analysis



We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed regulation would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of RFA, we consider all providers and suppliers
of health care as small entities. Individuals and States are not included in the definition of a small entity. We are
not preparing a RFA because we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed regulation would
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of providers and suppliers.

Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a proposed rule
may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis
must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small
rural hospital as a hospital which is located outside a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. We
are not preparing a rural hospital impact statement because we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that
this proposed regulation would not have a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial number of
small rural hospitals.

Although this proposed rule is not an ``economically significant'' rule under Executive Order 12866, the statutory
changes which are the basis of this proposed rule, are substantial. We present below a voluntary anaylsis of these
effects.

This proposed rule would incorporate in regulations, and in some cases interpret, statutory changes that are already
in effect. In cases where it was necessary to provide interpretation, we have relied on the legislative history of
the statutory provisions, when available, for the best reading of the provision. The statutory provisions are effective
on the statutorily established date, regardless of whether or not we have issued final regulations. The statutory
changes that expand eligibility groups and coverage of services will increase Medicaid program expenditures independently
of the promulgation of this rule. Costs associated with these proposed regulations are the result of legislation
or due to the interpretation of statutory changes already in effect. Therefore, these costs have been included in
the Medicaid budget estimates.

It is difficult to predict what the fiscal impact will be since several provisions provide Medicaid coverage to certain
groups at the option of States. Another unknown factor is the additional number of pregnant women, infants, and children
and disabled, elderly, and homeless individuals who will be offered services that previously were not covered by
the States and the type and cost of these specific services. We know costs for States will rise as they begin to furnish
the additional services that will be required if medically necessary. The following data reflects our estimate of
medical costs attributable to expansion of services under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, Public
Law 100-203; the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, Public Law 100-360; the Family Support Act
of 1988, Public Law 100-485; the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, Public Law 101-239; and the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Public Law 101-508. The following estimates are based on data from
the census, current population survey, and average cost using Medicaid data:

Several alternatives were considered in the development of these proposed regulations and are discussed in detail
earlier in the preamble: Two of the more significant ones involve continuous eligibility of pregnant women and deemed
newborn eligibility under sections II. B and II. D, respectively, of the preamble. Our proposed interpretation of
the statutory provisions relating to these two areas would have minimal cost effects and will probably save money
through better management of high risk pregnancies. At most, the proposed interpretation of the provision relating
to continuous eligibility of newborn children would cost $10 million, a very small addition to the statutory costs
included in the above tables. However, we believe that most States have already adopted our proposed interpretation
as practice. 

In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this proposed regulation was reviewed by the Office of
Management and Budget.

18. A new  435.612 is added under subpart G to read as follows:

19. A new  435.615 is added to subpart G to read as follows: 



 435.615 

Income and resource standards and methodologies: Aged and disabled individuals with incomes at or below Federal
poverty income guidelines. 



(a) 

General rule.

 If the agency provides Medicaid to aged and disabled individuals under  435.238, it must determine financial
eligibility in accordance with the requirements of this section. 

(b) 

Establishing the income standard.

 (1) The agency must establish and apply an income standard at a level that does not exceed 100 percent of the Federal
poverty income guidelines applicable to a family of the size involved. 

(2) For purposes of this section, ``family of the size involved'' is based on the SSI concept of eligibility for an individual
as an individual or as part of a couple. If two individuals in a family are married and eligible under section 1902(m),
their income will be compared to the Federal poverty income level for a family of two. In all other situations, eligibility
will be determined on an individual basis, using the poverty level for one, with deeming of income as appropriate (under
SSI deeming rules that do not conflict with title XIX of the Act). 

(c) 

Establishing the resource standard.

 The agency must establish and apply a resource standard that is either_

(1) The SSI resource standard; or 

(2) If the State has a medically needy program that uses a higher resource standard, at State option, the resource standard
applied to the medically needy. 

(d) 

Methodologies for determining income and resources.

 (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) (2) through (4) of this section, in determining financial eligibility,
the agency must use the income and resource 
methodologies applied under SSI, or it may instead use any less restrictive income and resource methodologies than
SSI as specified in the approved State plan in accordance with  435.601. 

(2) The agency may not deduct from income the costs incurred for medical care or any other type of remedial care in order
to reduce the individual's income to the established income standard, except as specified in paragraph (d)(3) of
this section. 

(3) For severely disabled individuals who work, the agency may deduct the reasonable costs for attendant care services,
medical devices, equipment, prostheses, and similar items and services (generally not including routine drugs
or routine medical services) that are necessary in order for the individual to work. 

(4) In determining the financial responsibility of relatives, the State must use the requirements of  435.602.


(5) In determining eligibility under this section for an individual entitled to monthly social security cash benefits,
Title II COLA increases must be disregarded from December of each year through the month after the month in which the
Federal poverty guideline for the next year is published. During that period, the poverty level for the previous year
will be used for these individuals. 

(e) 

State plan requirement.

 The State plan must specify the income standard and the resource standard by the family size involved. 

20. The heading of subpart J and  435.907 are revised to read as follows: 



Subpart J_Eligibility in the States, the District of Columbia, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa

(b) A pregnant woman may be determined eligible for only one presumptive eligibility period during any one pregnancy.


(c) The presumptive eligibility determination must be made by a qualified provider who meets the requirements of
 440.172(c) of this subchapter. 

(d) The agency must provide qualified providers with_

(1) Screening forms and guidelines for determining presumptive eligibility under the plan and the eligibility group
under which a pregnant woman is most likely to be eligible under regular Medicaid if she applies. 

(2) Information on how to assist a pregnant woman in completing and filing the screening form for presumptive eligibility
for ambulatory prenatal care services available to eligible pregnant women. 

(3) Application forms for Medicaid under the plan, which forms may be those developed for use by women described in
section 1902(l)(1)(A) of the Act, and instructions on how to help women complete and file these forms. 

(e) The agency must establish procedures to ensure that qualified providers_

(1) Notify the agency in writing that a pregnant woman is presumptively eligible within 5 working days after the date
the determination is made; 

(2) Inform the woman in writing at the time the determination is made that she has until the last day of the month following

eligibility beyond that date. Providers also must inform the woman that if she files a Medicaid application by that
date, her presumptive eligibility will end on the day a decision is made on her Medicaid application. 

(3) In writing, inform any pregnant woman who is determined not presumptively eligible of the reason why she was determined
ineligible and that she may file a Medicaid application with the agency if she wishes to have a determination made on
a regular Medicaid application. A determination of ineligibility for ambulatory prenatal care is not subject to
appeal under part 431 of this subchapter. 

(f) The agency must establish methods for monitoring the presumptive eligibility determinations made by qualified
providers to ensure the integrity of the determinations and to take any corrective action that may be necessary.



 435.912 

Application for Medicaid by pregnant women following a presumptive eligibility determination. 



A pregnant woman who is determined by a qualified provider to be presumptively eligible for ambulatory prenatal care
services must file an application for Medicaid with the agency by the last day of the month following the month in which

(1) Except as provided for in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section_

(i) The agency must promptly redetermine eligibility 
when it receives information about changes in a recipient's 
circumstances that may affect his or her eligibility. 

(ii) If the agency has information about anticipated 
changes in a recipient's circumstances, it must redetermine 
eligibility at the appropriate time based on those changes. 

(2) Effective January 1, 1991, the agency must 
consider any pregnant woman who has established eligibility 
for Medicaid under this part and who, because of a change in 
family income, would no longer be eligible, to be eligible 
to receive services as mandatory categorically needy under 
 435.118 throughout the pregnancy and the 60-day period 
after pregnancy ends and for any remaining days in the month 
in which the 60th day falls, without regard to any changes 
in income that may occur during this period. 

(i) This provision does not apply to women who are 
determined to be presumptively eligible under  435.250 but 
are subsequently determined to be ineligible for regular 
Medicaid. 

(ii) A woman who is eligible for continued coverage 
under this section retains her existing status as a 
mandatory categorically needy, optional categorically needy, 
or medically needy recipient, even though she is entitled to 
the services that are available to a mandatory categorically 
needy pregnant woman described in  435.118. As a result, 
she must continue to meet eligibility requirements 
associated with her status (for example, she may have to 
meet a spenddown if she is medically needy), except that any 
increase in income will have no effect on her eligibility. 

23. New   435.932 and 435.935 are added under

designed to enhance the probability of a healthy, full-term 
pregnancy, uncomplicated delivery, and a healthy outcome for 
both mother and child.

(a) to read as follows: 



 435.1001 

FFP for administration.

(c) FFP is available in expenditures for ambulatory

eligible for payment under the State plan, regardless of 
whether or not the women are determined eligible for regular 
Medicaid following the presumptive eligibility period. 

(d) FFP is not available in expenditures for services 
provided to low-income pregnant women and infants covered as 
optional categorically needy under  435.228 if the State 
has in effect under its AFDC plan payment levels (that is, 
the amount of the AFDC payment for basic needs made to a 
family with no other income) that are less than those in 
effect under its AFDC plan on July 1, 1987.

(2) For purposes of this section, family size includes 
the unborn child and other members of the Medicaid budgetary 
unit. 
(b) Establishing the income standard. 
(1) For optional groups of pregnant women and infants 
under  436.226(a)(1) and (2), the agency may establish 
separate income standards or use a single income standard. 
(2) For the optional groups of children under 
 436.226(a) (3) and (4), the agency must establish separate 
income standards. 
(3) The standards must be based on family size_
(i) For pregnant women, at a level that covers family 
incomes that are at or below 185 percent (or at or below 
some lesser percent that the agency chooses) of the Federal 
poverty income guidelines for a family of the size involved; 
(ii) For infants under 1 year of age, at a level that 
covers family incomes that are at or below 185 percent (or 
at or below some lesser percent that the agency chooses) of 
the Federal poverty income guidelines for a family of the 
size involved; 
(iii) For children age 1 up to age 6, at a level that 
covers family incomes that are at or below 133 percent of 
the Federal poverty income guidelines for a family of the 
size involved; 
(iv) For children born after September 30, 1983 who 
are 6 years of age up to age 19 years of age, at a level 
that covers family incomes that are at or below 100 percent 
of the Federal poverty income guidelines for a family of the 
size involved. 
(c) Establishing the resource standard. 

At State 
option, the agency may apply resource standards in 
determining financial eligibility that are no more 
restrictive than the SSI standard for pregnant women and no 
more restrictive than the AFDC standard for infants and 
children. 
(d) 

Methodologies for determining income and 
resources. 

(1) Except as specified in paragraph (d) (2) 
through (4) of this section, in determining family income 
and resources, the agency must use the methodologies 
established in accordance with  436.601. 
(2) In determining family income, the agency must use 
the income methodologies of the approved AFDC plan or the 
State's title IV-E adoption assistance and foster care plan 
as appropriate, or it may use any less restrictive 
methodologies specified in the State plan which conform with 
 436.601(d). Methodologies include, but are not limited 
to, those used for disregarding income. 
(3) In determining countable income, the agency may 
not deduct costs incurred for medical care or any other type 
of remedial care to reduce income to the level of the 
standard established. 
(4) The resource methodologies used in determining 
financial eligibility of pregnant women must not be more 
restrictive than the methodologies applied under SSI. The 
resource methodologies used in determining financial 
eligibility of infants and children must not be more 
restrictive than the methodologies applied under the State's 
approved AFDC plan. 
(5) In determining the financial responsibility of 
relatives, the State must use the requirements of  436.602. 
(e) 

State plan requirements. 

The State plan must_
(1) Specify the income standards; and 
(2) If the State elects to apply resource standards, 
specify those resource standards. 
16. A new  436.615 is added to subpart G to read as 
follows: 


 436.615 

Income and resource standards and methodologies: 
Aged and disabled individuals with incomes at or below 
Federal poverty income guidelines. 


(a) 

General rule. 

If the agency provides Medicaid to 
aged and disabled individuals under  436.235, it must 
determine financial eligibility in accordance with the 
requirements of this section.

(b) 

Establishing the income standard.

 (1) The agency must establish and apply an income standard at a level that does not exceed 100 percent of the Federal
poverty income guidelines applicable to a family of the size involved. 

(2) For purposes of this section, family of the size involved is based on the SSI concept of eligibility for an individual
as an individual or as part of a couple. If two individuals are married and eligible under section 1902(m), their income
will be compared to the Federal poverty income level for a family of two. In all other situations, eligibility will
be determined on an individual basis, using the poverty level for one, with deeming of income as appropriate (under
SSI deeming rules that do not conflict with title XIX of the Act). 

(c) 

Establishing the resource standard.

 The agency must apply a resource standard that is either_



(1) The SSI resource standard; or 

(2) If the State has a medically needy program that uses a higher resource standard, at State option, the resource standard
applied to the medically needy. 

(d) 

Methodologies for determining income and resources.

 (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) (2) through (4) of this section, the agency must use the methodologies
applied under sections 1612 and 1613 of the Act in determining countable income and resources or may instead use any
less restrictive income and resource methodologies specified in the State plan in accordance with  436.601.
Methodologies include, but are not limited to, those used in disregarding income. 

(2) The agency may not deduct from income the costs incurred for medical care or any other type of remedial care to reduce
the individual's income to the established income standard, except as specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.


(3) For severely disabled individuals who work, the agency may deduct the reasonable costs for attendant care services,
medical devices, equipment, prostheses, and similar items and services (generally not including routine drugs
or routine medical services) that are necessary in order for the individual to work. 

(4) In determining the financial responsibilities of relatives, the agency must apply the requirements of  436.602.


(5) In determining eligibility under this section for an individual entitled to monthly social security cash benefits,
Title II COLA increases must be disregarded from December of each year through the month after the month in which the
Federal poverty guideline for the next year is published. During that period, the poverty level for the previous year
will be used for these individuals. 

(e) 

State plan requirement.

 The State plan must specify the income standard and the resource standard by the family size involved. 



17. Section 436.1001 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: 



 436.1001 

FFP for administration. 



(a) FFP is available in the necessary administrative costs the State incurs in_



(1) Determining and redetermining Medicaid eligibility and in providing Medicaid to eligible individuals; and


(2) Determining presumptive eligibility for pregnant women and in providing ambulatory prenatal care to presumptively
eligible women. 



* * * * * 



18. Section 436.1002 is amended by revising paragraph (a) and adding new paragraphs (c) and (d) to read as follows:




 436.1002

furnished during a presumptive eligibility period by a provider that is eligible for payment under the State plan,
regardless of whether or not the women are determined eligible for Medicaid following the presumptive eligibility
period. 

(d) FFP is not available in expenditures for services provided to low-income pregnant women and infants covered under
 436.226(a) (1) and (2) if the State has in effect under its AFDC plan payment levels (that is, the amount of the
AFDC payment for basic needs made to a family with no other income) that are less than those in effect under its AFDC plan
on July 1, 1987.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposal to List the 
San Xavier Talussnail as Endangered 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to 
list the San Xavier talussnail (

Sonorella eremita

) as an endangered 
species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). 
The San Xavier talussnail is found only in an area of 15 by 30 
meters (m) (50 by 100 feet (ft)) on private land in Pima County, 
Arizona. The primary threat to the species results from its 
vulnerability to habitat disturbances that would remove talus, 
increase interstitial soil, or alter moisture accumulation and 
retention. This proposal, if made final, would implement Federal 
protection provided by the Act for the San Xavier talussnail. The 
Service seeks data and comments from the public on this proposal.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 



The San Xavier talussnail (

Sonorella eremita

) is a land snail, 
first described in 1910 by H.A. Pilsbry and L.E. Daniels (Pilsbry 
and Ferriss 1915). The species has a globose shell with as many as 
4.5 whorls, a white to pinkish tint, and a chestnut-brown shoulder 
band. It is approximately 19 millimeters (0.7 inches) in diameter. 
This is the only land snail fitting this description in the Mineral 
Hills area, but its shell is very typical of desert 

Sonorella 


(Pilsbry and Ferriss 1915). 

The San Xavier talussnail lives in a deep, 
northwestward-facing, limestone rockslide in Pima County, Arizona. 
Its habitat is protected from drying effects of the sun by outcrops 
of limestone and decomposed granite to the northeast and southwest, 
and by the hill itself to the southeast (Pilsbry and Ferriss 1915, 
Hoffman 1990). The vegetation, slope of the hillside, and depth of 
the slide provide necessary moisture conditions. This talussnail is 
similar to other 

Sonorella 

species in that it feeds on fungus or 
decaying plant material (Hoffman 1990). The San Xavier talussnail 
is hermaphroditic (Morton 1968, Hoffman 1990). After a rain, the 
snail will lay eggs, feed, and mate. Fertilization and production 
of eggs takes several days. If the rains are short-lived, the eggs 
are held until the next rain. The species requires three or four 
years to mature, depending on rainfall frequency, and has a 
reproductive life of four to six years, depending on the total 
number of days it remains active (Hoffman 1990).

Talussnails are extremely sensitive to desiccation and 
sedimentation resulting from disturbance of the talus and associated 
vegetation. In general, desert snails are known to protect 
themselves from drying out by crawling into deep, cool rockslides 
that are not filled with soil. The limestone rock or other talus 
that contains calcium carbonate is crucial to the species, as it 
aids in shell deposition and neutralizes carbonic acid that is 
produced during estivation (Hoffman 1990). The San Xavier 
talussnail is known to estivate for up to three years and in most 
years is only active for three or four days (Hoffman 1990). 

The San Xavier talussnail was included as a Category 2 species 
in the Service's May 22, 1984, notice of review of candidate 
invertebrates (49 FR 21664) and in the January 6, 1989, animal 
candidate notice of review (54 FR 554). Category 2 species are 
those for which the Service has some evidence of vulnerability, but 
for which there is insufficient scientific and commercial 
information to support proposed rules at the time. The San Xavier 
talussnail was included as a Category 1 species in the November 21, 
1991, animal candidate notice of review (56 FR 58804). Category 1 
species are those for which the Service has sufficient biological 
data to support proposals for listing. 



Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 



Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et 
seq.

) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the 
listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding 
species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an 
endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five 
factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their 
application to the San Xavier talussnail (

Sonorella eremita

) are as 
follows: 

A. 

The present or threatened destruction, modification, or 
curtailment of its habitat or range. 

The San Xavier talussnail is a 
very restricted endemic and is extremely vulnerable to any 
disturbance that would remove talus, increase interstitial 
sedimentation, or otherwise alter moisture conditions in its habitat 
(e.g., road or trail expansion or alteration, mining exploration) 
(Hoffman 1990). Within the species' habitat are inactive mining 
prospects and mines, mining stakes, a powerline across the east 
ridge, and a road leading to a microwave site on the hilltop. A 
large copper mine is located nearby. There are housing developments 
of small acreage to the north and to the southwest of the hill. The 
habitat is too steep (30 to 40 percent slope) to permit house 
construction, but possible future threats include additional road 
construction, expansion of the copper mine and/or tailings, and 
small-scale prospecting and mining.

B. 

Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes.

 The extremely restricted habitat of this species makes it vulnerable to excessive collecting during periods when
the snails are active. 
C. 

Disease or predation.

 No diseases are known. Rodent predation is random and sporadic on the San Xavier talussnail (Hoffman 1990). 
D. 

The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.

 The State of Arizona offers no protection to this species. The Act would provide protection and encourage active management
through ``Available Conservation Measures'' discussed below. 
E. 

Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.

 The very restricted range of the San Xavier talussnail makes it vulnerable to extinction from relatively small-scale
human actions. The only known habitat for the species is on a single rockslide near Tucson, Arizona, in an area of limestone
talus about 15 by 30 m (50 by 100 ft) near a dirt road. The habitat is located downslope from a dirt road, making it vulnerable
to infiltration of rocks and soil or other material. The species is so restricted in range that it is threatened by even
limited removal of cover through vandalism or by individuals curious about the presence of a rare species. Removal
of cover, including both rocks and vegetation, harms snails by exposing them to the drying effects of the sun and periods
of low ambient humidity. 

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by this species in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the
preferred action is to list the San Xavier talussnail as endangered. The species has a highly restricted range, is
located in an area of growing urban development and active mining, and is easily accessible by road. Although the San
Xavier talussnail is on private land, Federal actions may occur as the area continues to develop. Endangered status
is most appropriate because the single known population could be destroyed by one action. Because of the vulnerability
of the population, threatened status does not appear appropriate for the San Xavier talussnail. A decision to take
no action would exclude this species from needed protection available under the Act, and the species would likely
decline. The decision not to propose critical habitat for the San Xavier talussnail is explained in the following
section. 


Critical Habitat 



Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
propose critical habitat at the time a species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation
of critical habitat is not prudent for the San Xavier talussnail at this time. 

The extremely restricted habitat of the species makes it vulnerable to collection and isolated acts of vandalism.
Although there are relatively few amateur collectors of land snails, a single collection effort under advantageous
conditions could severely deplete the species' population. The population could, however, withstand some limited,
regulated scientific collection. Of greater concern than collection is the potential for acts of vandalism that
directly kill the snails by crushing or by habitat disturbances that cause desiccation of the snails. These acts may
sometimes be purposeful, but may also be caused by well-intentioned persons who are curious about the presence of
an endangered species. The likelihood of these potential threats occurring would be greatly increased by designation
of critical habitat, because the publication of critical habitat maps and descriptions would allow unauthorized
persons to precisely identify the locality of this species. Identification of critical habitat would therefore
increase the degree of threat to this species. 

Critical habitat designation would also not provide additional benefit to the species. The range and major ecological
requirements of this species are sufficiently known to provide adequate protection through the Act's take prohibitions
and application of the section 7 jeopardy standard. The Service will continue to communicate the conservation needs
of the species to the involved landowner, as well as inform the landowner of the status of legal protection and conservation
planning for the species. 



Available Conservation Measures 



Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Act include recognition,
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition
through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups,
and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that
recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions
against taking and harm are discussed, in part, below.

Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(4) requires Federal agencies to confer with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued
existence of a species proposed for listing or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical
habitat. If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities
they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy
or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat,
the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. Potential Federal activities
that may require consultation under section 7 include permits for road and transmission facilities near the locality
of the San Xavier talussnail. 

The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions
that apply to all endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States to take (includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect;
or to attempt any of these), import or export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of commercial activity, or
sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver,
carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the
Service and State conservation agencies. 

Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered wildlife species under
certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are codified at 50 CFR 17.22. Such permits are available for
scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental take in the course
of otherwise lawful activities. 

Requests for copies of the regulations regarding listed wildlife and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits
may be addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, room 420C, 4401 N. Fairfax
Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203 (703/358-2104; FAX 703/358-2281). 



Public Comments Solicited 



The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible.
Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community,
industry, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularly
are sought concerning: 

(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning any threat (or lack thereof) to the San Xavier
talussnail; 

(2) The location of any additional populations of this species and the reasons why any habitat should or should not
be determined to be critical habitat as provided by section 4 of the Act; 

(3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and population size of this species; and 

(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possible impacts on this species. 

Final promulgation of the regulation on this species will take into consideration the comments and any additional
information received by the Service, and such communications may lead to a final regulation that differs from this
proposal. 

The Endangered Species Act provides for one or more public hearings on this proposal, if requested. Requests must
be received within 45 days of the date of publication of the proposal in the 

Federal Register

. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to Arizona Ecological Services Office (see 

ADDRESSES

 section).

SUMMARY:

 The Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Acts contain provisions which authorize EPA to treat Indian tribes in substantially
the same manner in which it treats states for purposes of various types of financial assistance and program authorization.
This action proposes amendments to regulations addressing the role of Indian tribes under both Acts. The purpose
of these proposed amendments is to make it easier for tribes to obtain EPA approval to assume the role Congress envisioned
for them under these statutes.

I. Introduction: Statutory and Regulatory Background 



Under its American Indian Policy, EPA works directly with tribal governments as ``sovereign entities with primary
authority and responsibility for the reservation populace.'' At the time the Policy was adopted in 1984, the environmental
statutes which EPA administers generally did not explicitly address the role of tribes in environmental management,
but provided for a joint state and federal role in environmental management. Subsequently, three EPA regulatory
statutes have been amended to address the tribal role specifically by authorizing EPA to treat tribes in a manner similar
to that in which it treats states: the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), and the Clean Air Act
(CAA).

1

 





EPA recognizes that tribes are sovereign nations with a unique legal status and a relationship to the federal government
that is significantly different than that of states. EPA believes that Congress did not intend to alter this when it
authorized treatment of tribes ``as States;'' rather, the purpose of the statutory amendments was to reflect an intent
that, insofar as possible, tribes should assume a role in implementing the environmental statutes on tribal land
comparable to the role states play on state land. 

All three regulatory statutes specify that, in order to receive such treatment, a tribe must be federally recognized
and possess a governing body carrying out substantial duties and powers. 33 U.S.C. 1377 (e), (h) (CWA); 42 U.S.C. 300j-11
(SDWA); 42 U.S.C. 7601(d) (CAA). In addition, although there are some variations in language among the three statutes,
each requires that a tribe possess civil regulatory jurisdiction to carry out the functions it seeks to exercise.

2

 Finally, all three require that a tribe be reasonably expected to be capable of carrying out those functions. 





The Agency initially chose to implement provisions of the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Acts regarding Indian
tribes by establishing a formal prequalification process under which tribes can seek eligibility under these statutes.
This prequalification process has in the past been referred to as approval for ``treatment as a state'' (``TAS'').
Tribes that obtain such approval then become eligible to apply for certain grants and program approvals available
to states.

II. Regulations Governing Eligibility of Indian Tribes 



A. The Existing Process 



The Agency has promulgated five regulations that utilize the ``TAS'' process to date: (1) Safe Drinking Water Act,
National Drinking Water Regulations and Underground Injection Control Regulations for Indian Lands, 53 FR 37395
(September 26, 1988), codified at 40 CFR parts 35, 124, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, and 146; (2) Indian Tribes: Water Quality
Planning and Management, 54 FR 14353 (April 11, 1989), Comprehensive Construction Grant Regulation Revision, 55
FR 27092 (June 29, 1990) (governing grant programs under the CWA), codified at 40 CFR parts 35 and 130; (3) Amendments
to the Water Quality Standards Regulation that Pertain to Standards on Indian Reservations, 56 FR 64876 (December
12, 1991), codified at 40 CFR part 131; (4) Clean Water Act, section 404 Tribal Regulations, 58 FR 8171 (February 11,
1993), codified at 40 CFR parts 232 and 233; and (5) Treatment of Indian Tribes as States for Purposes of sections 308,
309, 401, 402, and 405 of the Clean Water Act (``NPDES'') rule, 58 FR 67966 (December 22, 1993), codified at 40 CFR parts
122, 123, 124 and 501. 

Under all of these regulations, before a tribe can obtain financial assistance available to states or obtain approval
to operate a program which states are authorized to operate on state lands, the tribe must first formally qualify for
``treatment as a state.'' To qualify, a tribe must submit an application establishing that it is federally recognized,
has a governing body carrying out substantial duties and powers, and has adequate jurisdiction and capability to
carry out the proposed activities. Once a tribe obtains ``TAS'' approval, it is eligible to apply for financial assistance
and program approval. 



1. Recognition and Government 



A tribe typically establishes recognition by showing its inclusion on the list of federally recognized Tribes published
by the Secretary of the Interior in the 

Federal Register

. A tribe establishes that it meets the governmental duties and powers requirement with a narrative statement describing
the form of the tribal government and the types of functions it performs, and identifying the sources of the tribe's
governmental authority. 



2. Jurisdiction and Capability 



To establish jurisdiction under the CWA grant regulations, a tribe must submit a statement signed by a tribal legal
official explaining the legal basis for the Tribe's regulatory authority over its water resources. The CWA grant
regulations do not require that a tribe submit any specific materials to establish capability. 

The other regulations specify that a tribe must submit various specific documents to establish jurisdiction, including:
a map or legal description of the area over which the tribe claims jurisdiction; a statement by a tribal legal official
describing the basis, nature, and subject matter of the tribe's jurisdiction; copies of all documents supporting
the jurisdictional assertions; and a description of the locations of the systems or sources the tribe proposes to
regulate. Similarly, to establish capability a tribe must submit a narrative statement describing tribal capability
to administer an effective program, and certain specific, listed materials in support of that statement. 



3. Comment Process 



Upon receiving a ``TAS'' application under these regulations, EPA notifies all ``appropriate governmental entities,''

4

 as to the substance of and basis for the jurisdictional assertions in the application, and invites comment on those
assertions. Where comments raise a competing or conflicting jurisdictional claim, the Agency must consult with
the Department of the Interior before making a final decision on the tribe's application. 





In practice, this comment process has sometimes led to delays in the processing and approval of tribal applications.
Indeed, it has proven to be the single portion of ``TAS'' review most responsible for delays. The comment process also
has created a perception that states have an oversight role in EPA's treatment of Indian tribes, which some tribes
find objectionable, particularly since tribes have typically not been asked to offer their views on the scope and
extent of state jurisdiction. 



4. Subsequent Tribal Applications 



The regulations require a separate ``treatment as a state'' application for each program for which the tribe seeks
such treatment. However, after an initial approval, applications for each additional program need provide only
that additional information unique to the additional program. 



B. Workgroup Examination of Process 



The Agency's ``TAS'' prequalification process has proven to be burdensome, time-consuming and offensive to tribes.
Accordingly, in 1992 EPA established a working group to focus on ways of improving and simplifying that process. The
Agency formally adopted the Workgroup's recommendations as Agency policy by Memorandum dated November 10, 1992.
That Memorandum explicitly recognized that the policies it adopted would require amendments to existing regulations.
The purpose of this regulation is to propose amendments to existing regulations under the Safe Drinking Water and
Clean Water Acts in order to implement the new policy. To the extent possible, the Agency plans to use the same process
in future regulations regarding determinations of tribal eligibility.

III. Revisions to the Process in Light of Statutory Requirements 



No statute compels the use of a formal ``TAS'' or other prequalification process separate from approval of the underlying
request for a grant or program approval. The only requirements imposed by statute are that, to be eligible for financial
assistance and/or program authorization, a tribe must be federally recognized, have a governing body carrying out
substantial duties and powers, and have adequate jurisdiction and capability to carry out the proposed activities.
Thus, EPA may authorize a tribal program or grant without formally designating the tribe as ``eligible for TAS,''
so long as the Agency establishes that the tribe meets applicable statutory requirements. In other words, the Agency
can ensure compliance with statutory mandates without requiring tribes to undergo a discrete, formal process of
seeking ``TAS'' approval. 

Accordingly, EPA is amending its regulations to eliminate ``TAS'' review as a separate step in the processing of a
tribal application for a grant or for program approval. Under the new, simplified process, the Agency will ensure
compliance with statutory requirements as an integral part of the process of reviewing grant or program approval
applications. To the extent that this rule or preamble conflicts with the language of previous rules and preambles,
the language herein shall be controlling. EPA will also, as far as possible, discontinue use of the term ``treatment
as a state;'' however, since this phrase is included in several statutes, its continued use may sometimes be necessary.




A. Simplified Determination as to Recognition and Government 



As a general rule, the recognition and governmental requirements are essentially the same under the Clean Water and
Safe Drinking Water Acts. The new process will reflect this by establishing identical requirements for making this
showing under each statute. Moreover, the fact that a tribe has met the recognition or governmental functions requirement
under either of the Water Acts will establish that it meets those requirements under both statutes. To facilitate
review of tribal applications, EPA therefore requests that tribal applications inform EPA whether a tribe has been
approved for ``TAS'' (under the old process) or deemed eligible to receive funding or authorization (under the revised
process) for any other program. 

A tribe that has not done so may establish that it has been federally recognized by simply stating in its grant or program
authorization application that it appears on the list of federally recognized tribes that the Secretary of the Interior
publishes periodically in the 

Federal Register

. If the tribe notifies EPA that it has been recognized but does not appear on this list because the list has not been updated,
EPA will seek to verify the fact of recognition with the Department of the Interior. 

A tribe that has not yet made its initial governmental showing can do so by certifying that it has a government carrying
out substantial governmental functions. A tribe will be able to make the required certification if it is currently
performing governmental functions to promote the public health, safety, and welfare of its population. Examples
of such functions include, but are not limited to, levying taxes, acquiring land by exercise of the power of eminent
domain, and exercising police power. Such examples should be included in a narrative statement supporting the certification,
(1) Describing the form of tribal government and the types of essential governmental functions currently performed,
and (2) identifying the legal authorities for performing those functions (

e.g., 

tribal constitutions or codes). It should be relatively easy for tribes to meet this requirement without submitting
copies of specific documents unless requested to do so by the Agency. 



B. Case-by-Case Review of Jurisdiction and Capability 



A tribe may have jurisdiction over, and capability to carry out, certain activities (

e.g.

, protection of the quality of a particular lake for the Clean Lakes program under the Clean Water Act), but not others
(

e.g.

, waste management on a portion of the reservation far removed from any lakes). For this reason, EPA believes that the
Agency must make a specific determination that a tribe has adequate jurisdictional authority and administrative
and programmatic capability before it approves each tribal program. This will ensure that tribes meet the statutory
requirements Congress has established as prerequisites to tribal eligibility for each particular program.

1. Simplified Jurisdictional Analysis 



The portion of the jurisdictional determination under which governments comment on tribal jurisdiction will be
substantially altered under this rule. These changes are outlined below. 

For approvals of all Drinking Water regulatory programs and most Clean Water programs under existing regulations,
EPA will not authorize a state to operate a program without determining that the state has adequate authority to carry
out those actions required to run the program. See 

e.g.

 40 CFR 142.10 (PWS), 145.24 (UIC). This applies also to a tribe seeking program approval, and ensures that a close analysis
of the legal basis of a tribe's jurisdiction will occur before program authorization. 

Accordingly, a separate ``TAS'' jurisdictional review is not needed to verify that a tribe meets the statutory jurisdictional
requirement, and is therefore proposed to be eliminated for all programs under the Safe Drinking Water Act, and for
the Clean Water Act's 404 and NPDES programs. This change would have the effect only of eliminating duplicative requirements.
In no case can a tribe receive program approval until the Agency has received full and adequate input concerning the
scope and extent of the tribe's jurisdiction. Moreover, EPA would expect each tribe seeking program approval to provide
a precise description of the physical extent and boundaries of the area for which it seeks regulatory authority. This
description should ordinarily include a map and should identify the sources or systems to be regulated by the tribe.


However, for the Water Quality Standards program, there is no review of tribal civil regulatory authority as part
of the standards approval process under section 303(c) of the Clean Water Act. Accordingly, for that program, a comment
process would be retained. However, the Agency wishes to clarify the operation of that process by reiterating that
comments must be offered in a timely manner, and, further, by specifying that where no timely comments are offered,
the Agency will conclude that there is no objection to the tribal applicant's jurisdictional assertion. Moreover,
to raise a competing or conflicting claim a comment must clearly explain the substance, basis, and extent of its objections.
Finally, when questions are raised concerning a tribe's jurisdiction, EPA may, in its discretion, seek additional
information from the tribe or the commenting party, and may consult as it sees fit with other federal agencies prior
to making a determination as to tribal jurisdictional authority, but is not required to do so. Henceforth, EPA would/will
no longer be required, by regulation, to consult with the Department of the Interior. 

Finally, the Agency notes that certain disputes concerning tribal jurisdiction may be relevant to a tribe's authority
to conduct activities and obtain program approval under several environmental statutes. For example, if a tribe
and a state or another tribe disagree as to the boundary of a particular tribe's reservation, each time the tribe seeks
to assert authority over the disputed area, the dispute will recur. The Agency recognizes that its determinations
regarding tribal jurisdiction apply only to activities within the scope of EPA programs. However, it also believes
that, once it makes a jurisdictional determination in response to a tribal application regarding any EPA program,
it will ordinarily make the same determination for other programs unless a subsequent application raises different
legal issues. Thus, for example, once the Agency has arrived at a position concerning a boundary dispute, it will not
alter that position in the absence of significant new factual or legal information. By contrast, however, a determination
that a tribe has inherent jurisdiction to regulate activities in one medium might not conclusively establish its
jurisdiction over activities in another medium. See generally Discussion of inherent tribal authority in Water
Quality Standards Regulation, 56 FR 64877-64879. 

Under the new approval process, as under the old, the Agency will continue to retain authority to limit its approval
of a tribal application to those land areas where the tribe has demonstrated jurisdiction. This would allow EPA to
approve the portion of a tribal application covering certain areas, while withholding approval of the portion of
an application addressing those land areas where tribal authority has not been satisfactorily established. See,


e.g.

, 53 FR 37395, 37402 (September 26, 1988) (SDWA); 54 FR 14353, 14355 (April 11, 1989) (Clean Water Act Grants); 54 FR
39097, 39102 (September 12, 1989) (Clean Water Act Water Quality Standards); 58 FR 8171, 8176 (February 11, 1993)
(Clean Water Act section 404); 58 FR 67966, 67972 (Clean Water Act NPDES) (December 22, 1993). 




2. Capability 



EPA must continue to make a separate determination of tribal capability for each program for which it approves a tribe.
However, the Safe Drinking Water Act, Water Quality Standards, section 404, and NPDES regulations would be amended
to conform to the CWA grant regulations, which do not specifically prescribe the material a tribe must submit to establish
capability. Ordinarily, the inquiry EPA will make into the capability of any applicant, tribal or state, for a grant
or program approval would be sufficient to enable the Agency to determine whether a tribe meets the statutory capability
requirement. See, 

e.g.

, 40 CFR part 31 (grant regulations applicable to states and tribes); 40 CFR 142.3 (Public Water System primary enforcement
responsibility requirements at parts 141, 142 apply to tribes); 145.1(h) (Underground Injection Control requirements
of parts 124, 144, 145, and 146 that apply to states generally apply to tribes). 

Nevertheless, EPA may request that the tribe provide a narrative statement or other documents showing that the tribe
is capable of administering the program for which it is seeking approval. In evaluating tribal capability, EPA will
consider: (1) The tribe's previous management experience; (2) existing environmental or public health programs
administered by the tribe; (3) the mechanisms in place for carrying out the executive, legislative and judicial functions
of the tribal government; (4) the relationship between regulated entities and the administrative agency of the tribal
government which will be the regulator; and (5) the technical and administrative capabilities of the staff to administer
and manage the program. 

EPA recognizes that certain tribes may not have substantial experience administering environmental programs;
a lack of such experience will not preclude a tribe from demonstrating capability, so long as it shows that it has the
necessary management and technical and related skills or submits a plan describing how it will acquire those skills.




IV. Summary of Revised Process 



Under the new process, tribes will continue to seek program approvals under the authority of statutes authorizing
EPA to treat eligible tribes in a manner similar to that in which it treats states. For instance, tribes seeking approval
of an NPDES or Wetlands permits program will comply with the applicable provisions of 40 CFR parts 123 or 233. However,
tribes will now generally be required to submit only a single application to demonstrate eligibility for the program
approval, without the need for a separate application for ``TAS.'' EPA will verify that the tribe meets all statutory
prerequisites for eligibility in the process of reviewing the single tribal application.

EPA believes that the changes outlined in this notice will simplify and streamline the process of assessing tribal
eligibility while still ensuring full compliance with all applicable statutes. The Agency expects that the new process
will reduce the burdens and barriers to tribes of participating in environmental management. 



V. Executive Order 12866 



OMB has reviewed this action under the terms of Executive Order 12866. 



VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), EPA certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities because it merely revises existing procedural requirements for
Indian tribes by making them simpler and less burdensome; Indian tribes are not considered small entities under this
rulemaking for RFA purposes. 



VII. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The proposed regulations contain no new or additional information collection activities and, therefore, no information
collection request will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in compliance with the Paperwork
Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

Medical Devices; Reports of Corrections and Removals



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to require that manufacturers, importers, and distributors
report promptly to FDA any corrections or removals of a device undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device
or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) caused by the device which may present
a risk to health. Manufacturers, distributors, and importers would not have to report actions taken to improve the
performance or quality of a device which are not intended to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or remedy a violation
of the act caused by the device. Nor would manufacturers, distributors, and importers have to report actions defined
as routine servicing. FDA believes that the proposed reporting requirements are necessary to protect the public
health by assuring that the agency has current and complete information regarding those actions taken to eliminate
risk to health caused by devices. Reports of such actions will improve the agency's ability to evaluate device-related
problems and to take prompt action against potentially dangerous devices.



FDA is directed to implement this new authority by regulation under certain provisions of the Safe Medical Devices
Act of 1990 (the SMDA).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



I. Statutory Authority and Legislative History



The current regulatory framework for medical devices is the result of four statutes: (1) The act (21 U.S.C. 321-394),
(2) the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (Pub. L. 94-295) (the 1976 amendments), (3) the SMDA (Pub. L. 101-629),
and (4) the Medical Device Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-300) (the 1992 amendments).

The act prohibited the marketing of adulterated or misbranded devices. The 1976 amendments amended the act with new
authority expressly designed to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical devices.

The 1976 amendments gave FDA, for the first time, premarket controls over medical devices (e.g., classification,
premarket notification, and premarket approval). Additionally, the 1976 amendments strengthened the act's postmarket
controls relating to medical devices, giving FDA the authority to require patient notification; repair, replacement,
or refund; reporting and recordkeeping; current good manufacturing practices (CGMP's); and restrictions on the
distribution of certain devices.

The SMDA, by streamlining in some places and augmenting authority in others, refines the premarket and postmarket
controls relating to medical devices added to the act by the 1976 amendments. Among the provisions of the SMDA that
augment postmarket controls is the reports and records of corrections and removals requirement of section 519(f)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 360i(f)).

Section 519(f) of the act directs FDA to promulgate regulations requiring reporting and recordkeeping of correction
and removal actions taken by device manufacturers, distributors, and importers. Under section 519(f)(1) of the
act, device manufacturers, distributors, and importers are to report promptly to FDA any correction or removal of
a device undertaken: (1) To reduce a risk to health posed by the device; or (2) to remedy a violation of the act caused
by a device which may present a risk to health. Section 519(f)(1) of the act also requires manufacturers, distributors,
and importers to keep records of those corrections and removals that are not required to be reported to FDA. Section
519(f)(2) of the act provides that no report of a correction or removal action under section 519(f)(1) of the act may
be required if a report of the correction or removal action is required and has been submitted to FDA under section 519(a)
of the act. Section 519(f)(3) of the act states that the terms ``correction'' and ``removal'' do not include routine
servicing.

Section 519(f) of the act was enacted because Congress was concerned that device manufacturers, distributors, and
importers were carrying out product corrections or removals without notifying FDA, or not notifying the agency in
a timely fashion. (H. Rept. 808, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 29 (1990); S. Rept. 513, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 23 (1990)). Industry's
failure to report corrections and removals, particularly those undertaken to reduce risks associated with the use
of a device, Congress explained, ``denies the agency the opportunity to fulfill its public health responsibilities
by evaluating device-related problems and the adequacy of corrective actions,'' (S. Rept. 513, 101st Cong., 2d sess.
23 (1990)), and ``has seriously interfered with the FDA's ability to take prompt action against potentially dangerous
devices,'' (H. Rept. 808, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 29 (1990)).

At the same time, Congress did not want to overburden industry or FDA with overreporting requirements. The reporting
requirements thus apply only to the ``more important postmarket actions, excluding those events already reported
to the [agency].'' However, to ensure that FDA has access to all relevant information on corrections or removals,
for those corrections and removals that need not be reported, Congress provided that records be maintained. (S. Rept.
513, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 23 (1990)). 

Section 701(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 371(a)) authorizes FDA to promulgate substantive binding regulations for the
efficient enforcement of the act.

Section 704(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 374(a)) provides that for purposes of enforcement of the act, any duly designated
FDA employee is authorized, among other things: (1) To enter, at reasonable times, any factory, warehouse, or establishment
in which devices are manufactured, processed, packed, or held, or to enter any vehicle being used to transport or hold
devices, and (2) to inspect, at reasonable times and within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, such factory,
warehouse, establishments, or containers, and labeling therein. Section 704(e) of the act requires that any person
required under section 519 of the act to maintain records and every person who is in charge or custody of such records
must, upon request of an officer or employee designated by FDA, permit such officer or employee at all reasonable times
to have access to, and copy and verify, such record. 



II. Scope of the Proposed Regulations 



The proposed regulations implementing the provisions of section 519(f) of the act will be set out in new 21 CFR part
806. Proposed  806.1(a) provides generally that device manufacturers, distributors, and importers are required
to report promptly to FDA certain actions concerning device corrections and removals, and to maintain records of
all corrections and removals regardless of whether such corrections and removals are required to be reported to FDA.


Proposed  806.1(b) describes the actions that are not subject to the reporting and recordkeeping requirements
of the regulation (set out at proposed  806.10). Those actions are: 

1. Actions undertaken by device manufacturers, distributors, and importers to improve the performance or quality
of a device which are not intended to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or remedy a violation of the act caused
by the device. 

2. Routine servicing as defined in proposed  806.2(i). 

3. Actions similar to item 1, undertaken by manufacturers of general purpose articles, such as chemical reagents
or laboratory equipment, whose uses are generally known by persons trained in their use and which are not labeled or
promoted or otherwise intended for medical uses. 



III. Reports of Corrections and Removals 



A. Who Must Report and When 



Proposed  806.10(a) requires device manufacturers, distributors, and importers to submit a written report
to FDA of any correction or removal of a device undertaken: (1) To reduce a risk to health posed by the device; or (2) to
remedy a violation of the act caused by the device which may present a risk to health. Only one report is required for
each reportable event. The person initiating the action to correct or remove a device is required to report. In the
case of a foreign manufacturer or distributor, the U.S. designated agent is required to report. If the distributor
or importer corrects or removes a product on its own, then the distributor or importer is required to report the action.
Regardless of who submits the report or to which FDA district office the report is submitted, the name and location
of the manufacturer must be reported. 



B. Time and Place for Submission of Reports 



Under proposed  806.10(b), device manufacturers, distributors, and importers must submit required correction
or removal reports within 10 calendar days of initiating a device correction or removal to the appropriate FDA district
office listed in  5.115 (21 CFR 5.115) for their location and region. If the device is manufactured at multiple
manufacturing sites, the report must be submitted to the FDA district office where the device is finally assembled
and/or packaged. A foreign manufacturer or distributor that ships devices to the United States shall submit its own
reports of corrective or removal actions through the U.S. designated agent on its behalf. The U.S. designated agent
shall submit such reports to the FDA district office in which the agent's office is located. 



C. What to Report 



Under proposed  806.10(c), device manufacturers, distributors, and importers must include the following
information in the report: 

1. The name, address, and telephone number of the manufacturer or distributor, (including foreign manufacturer),
and the name, title, address, and telephone number of the individual responsible for conducting the device correction
or removal.

<TEXT>
 

2. The brand name, common or usual name, classification name and product name if known, and the intended use of the device.


3. Marketing status of the device, i.e., any applicable premarket notification number, premarket approval number,
or indicate if a preamendments device, and the device listing number. (A manufacturer or distributor that does not
have an FDA establishment registration number must indicate in the report whether it has ever registered with FDA).


4. The correction or removal report number. 

5. The model, catalog, or code number of the device and the manufacturing lot or serial number of the device or other
identification number. 

6. The manufacturer's name, address, telephone number, and contact person if different from that of the person submitting
the report. 

7. A complete description of the event(s) giving rise to the information reported and the corrective or removal actions
that have been, and are expected to be taken. 

8. Any illnesses or injuries that have occurred with use of the device. If applicable, include the medical device report
numbers. 

9. The total number of devices manufactured or distributed and the number in the same batch, lot, or equivalent unit
of production subject to the correction or removal. 

10. The date of manufacture or distribution and the device's expiration date if applicable. 

11. The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all domestic and foreign consignees of the device and the dates
and number of devices distributed to each such consignee. 

12. A copy of all communications regarding the correction or removal, and the names and addresses of all recipients
of the communications if the number of recipients of the communications is different than number 11 above. 

The agency is using the opportunity under this proposed rule to solicit comments regarding whether it would be desirable
to develop a form to collect reports of removal and correction data. Interested persons should submit written comments
to the Dockets Management Branch (address above). FDA will consider any comments received and will address the development
and use of a form to collect reports of correction and removal data in any final rule that is published. 



D. FDA Review of Reports 



FDA will review any correction or removal report submitted under proposed  806.10 and where the correction
or removal involves: 

1. Some, but not all, of the devices of a particular lot, model, code, etc., FDA will determine whether the action should
be extended to other units of the same device, other products of the same manufacturer or distributor, or to similar
products of other manufacturers or distributors. 

2. All of the devices of a particular lot, model, code, etc., FDA will classify the action as either one of the following:
(a) Recall, if the action was undertaken to remedy a violation of the act caused by the device which may present a risk
to health; or (b) safety alert, if the action was undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device and not to remedy
a violation of the act caused by the device. 



IV. Records of Corrections and Removals Not Required To Be Reported 



Proposed  806.20(a) would require manufacturers, distributors, and importers who undertake a correction
or removal of a device that is not required to be reported to FDA under proposed  806.10 to keep a record of such
correction or removal. 

Under proposed  806.20(b), records of corrections and removals not required to be reported to FDA under proposed

 806.10 must contain the following information: 

1. The brand name, common or usual name, classification name and product code if known, and the intended use of the device.


2. The model, catalog, or code number of the device and the manufacturing lot or serial number of the device or other
identification number. 

3. A complete description of the event giving rise to the information reported and the corrective or removal action
that has been, and is expected to be, taken. 

4. Justification for not reporting the correction or removal action to FDA shall contain conclusions, any followups,
and be reviewed and evaluated by a designated person. 

5. A copy of all communications regarding the correction or removal. 

Under proposed  806.20(c), manufacturers, distributors, and importers must retain all records required
under proposed 
 806.20 for a period of 2 years beyond the expected life of the device, even if the manufacturer or distributor
has ceased to manufacture or distribute the device. Records required to be maintained under  806.20(c) must
be transferred to the new owner of the device and maintained for the required period of time. 



V. FDA Access to Records and Reports 



Under proposed  806.30, manufacturers, distributors, and importers required to maintain records concerning
corrections or removals and every person who is in charge or custody of such records must, upon request of an officer
or employee designated by FDA and pursuant to section 704(e) of the act, permit such officer or employee at all reasonable
times to have access to, and to copy and verify, such records and reports. 



VI. Public Availability of Reports 



Proposed  806.40 makes clear that any device correction or removal report submitted to FDA is available for
public disclosure in accordance with the agency's public information regulations at part 20 (21 CFR part 20). 

Before public disclosure of a report, FDA will delete the following from the report in accordance with part 20: 
(1) Any information that constitutes trade secret or confidential commercial or financial information under  20.61;
and (2) any personnel, medical, and similar information, including the serial numbers of implanted devices, which
would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under  20.63; provided, that except for
the information under  20.61, FDA will disclose to a patient who requests a report all the information in the
report concerning that patient. 



VII. Enforcement 



Section 301 of the act (21 U.S.C. 331) sets forth prohibited acts. Persons who violate section 301 of the act may be restrained,
under section 302 of the act (21 U.S.C. 332), or may be imprisoned or fined under section 303 of the act (21 U.S.C. 333).


Violations of any final rule based on this proposed rule, which is issued under the authority of sections 502, 510,
519, 520, 701, and 704 of the act (21 U.S.C. 352, 360, 360i, 360j, 371, and 374), will result in committing one or more
of the following violations of section 301 of the act: 

1. Section 301(e) of the act, which prohibits, among other things, the failure to establish or maintain any record,
or make any report, required under section 519 of the act or the refusal to permit officers or employees designated
by FDA to have access to or verification or copying of any such required record.

<TEXT>
 

2. Section 301(f) of the act prohibits the refusal to permit entry or inspection as authorized by section 704 of the
act. Section 704(e) of the act requires every person required under section 519 of the act to maintain records and every
person who is in charge or custody of such records, upon request of an officer or employee designated by FDA, to permit
such officer or employee to have access to, and copy and verify, such records. 
3. Section 301(q) of the act prohibits, among other things, the failure or refusal to furnish any material or information
required by or under section 519 of the act. 
In addition, section 502(t)(2) of the act deems a device to be misbranded if there is a failure or refusal to furnish
any material or information required by or under section 519 of the act respecting the device. Sections 301 (a), (b),
(c), (g), and (k) of the act prohibit several actions with respect to interstate commerce in misbranded devices. FDA
may also seize misbranded devices under section 304 of the act (21 U.S.C. 334) as well as restrain or prosecute violations
of section 301 of the act relating to misbranded devices. 
In addition to the criminal and civil enforcement mechanisms described above, the SMDA added section 303(f) to the
act, which provides for the first time that any person who fails to demonstrate substantial compliance with section
519(f) of the act may be subject to civil penalties. These penalties do not apply to any person who commits minor violations
of section 519(f) (only with respect to correction reports) if such person demonstrates substantial compliance
with section 519(f). A civil penalty may not exceed $15,000 for a single violation, and may not exceed $1,000,000 for
all such violations adjudicated in a single proceeding. 


VIII. Environmental Impact 


The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required. 


IX. Economic Impact 


FDA has carefully examined the costs and benefits of this proposed rule in accordance with the requirements of Executive
Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354). The agency concludes that this proposed rule
is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Further, the agency certifies that the
proposed rule, if implemented, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined
in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The agency estimates that it will receive no more than 800 reports per year from
device manufacturers regarding removals and corrections. For the estimated 800 reports the total cost would be $240,000.
In addition, the agency expects that there will be other instances of corrections and removals that will not have to
be reported to the agency, but will have to be maintained in files at the manufacturer's site. These records are to be
made available to FDA inspectors upon request. The cost of preparing these records would be $120,000 per year. An assessment
of the economic impact of any final rule based on this proposal has been placed on file in the Dockets Management Branch
(address above) and may be seen by interested persons between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 


X. Paperwork Reduction Act 


This proposed rule contains information collections which are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). The title, description, and respondent description
of the information collection are shown below with an estimate of the annual reporting and recordkeeping burden.
Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and
maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. 


Title:

 ``Reports of Corrections and Removals'' for manufacturers, importers, and distributors of medical devices under
Public Law 101-629_General Requirements. 


Description:

 FDA is proposing to implement provisions of the SMDA that require a manufacturer, importer, or distributor of a device
to report promptly to FDA any correction or removal of a device undertaken by a manufacturer, importer, or distributor
of a device if the correction or removal was undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation
of the act caused by the device which may present a risk to health. The purpose of the proposed changes is to improve the
protection of the public health by assuring that FDA has current and complete information regarding those actions
taken to eliminate any risk to health caused by the device. 





As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, FDA has submitted a copy of this proposed rule
to OMB for its review of these information collection requirements. Other organizations and individuals desiring
to submit comments regarding this burden estimate or any aspects of these information collection requirements,
including suggestions for reducing the burden, should direct them to FDA's Dockets Management Branch (address above)
and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, rm. 3208, New Executive Office Bldg., Washington, DC
20503, Attn: Desk Officer for FDA.

XI. Request for Comments 


Interested persons may, on or before June 21, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this proposal. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of
