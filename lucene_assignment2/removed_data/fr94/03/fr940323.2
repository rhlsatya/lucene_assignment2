Foreign-Trade Zone 121_Albany, NY Application for Subzone, BASF Corporation Plant (Chemical Pigments/Dyes) Rensselaer,
NY



An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Capital District Regional Planning
Commission, grantee of FTZ 121, requesting special-purpose subzone status for the chemical pigment/dye manufacturing
facility of BASF Corporation located in Rensselaer, New York. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions
of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400).
It was formally filed on March 11, 1994.

The BASF Rensselaer plant (3.84 mil.sq.ft/88 acres) is located at 36 Riverside Avenue, Rensselaer (Rensselaer County),
New York, one mile east of the city of Albany across the Hudson River. The plant (440 employees) is used to produce certain
chemical dyes and pigments, such as powdered and liquid dyestuffs, uvinuls, sicotans, and other pigments for the
plastics and coatings industries (duty rates_free to 20%, some currently under duty suspension). Approximately
40 to 60 percent of material inputs are sourced from abroad, including: Rosa chloride CF/BRF, diaminoimid, uvinul,
dimethylaminobenaldehyde, inorganic acids, chlorides, hydroxides, sulfites, acyclic hydrocarbons, acyclic
acids, phenols, benzaldehyde, aldehyde-function compounds, ketones, quinones, oxalic/carbolic acids, polyamines,
aminos, sulfurs, heterocyclic compounds, colorants, organic active agents, lubricating preparations, carbon
finishing and antioxidizing agents, acrylic polymers, urea/thiourea resins (duty rates_free to 20%, some currently
under duty suspension).

Zone procedures would exempt BASF from Customs duty payments on the foreign materials used in export production.
On domestic sales, the company is seeking to eliminate duty payments on foreign materials which under Customs procedures
would be subject to accountable loss in the manufacturing process. Also, the plant would pay duties on a deferred basis.
The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures would help improve the facility's international
competitiveness.

In accordance with the Board's regulations (as revised, 56 FR 50790-50808, 10-8-91), a member of
the FTZ Staff has been appointed examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board.

Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall
be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is May 23,
1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the
subsequent 15-day period June 6, 1994.

A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following
locations:




Office of the Port Director, U.S. Customs Service, James T. Foley, Courthouse Bldg., Rm. 216, 445 Broadway Albany,
NY 12207.

Brass Sheet and Strip From Sweden; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty 
Administrative Review 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 International Trade Administration/Import Administration Department of Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of preliminary results of antidumping duty administrative review.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Commerce (the Department) has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping duty order
on brass sheet and strip from Sweden. The review covers exports of this merchandise to the United States by one manufacturer/exporter
during the period March 1, 1991 through February 29, 1992. The review indicates the existence of dumping margins for
this period. 



As a result of this review, the Department has preliminarily determined to assess antidumping duties equal to the
difference between United States price (USP) and foreign market value (FMV). 

We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On March 6, 1987, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (52 FR 6998) the antidumping duty order on brass sheet and strip from Sweden. On April 13, 1992, in accordance with 19
CFR 353.22(c), we initiated an administrative review of Outokumpu Copper Rolled Products AB (OAB) for the period
March 1, 1991 through February 29, 1992 (57 FR 12797). The Department is now conducting this administrative review
in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). In addition, from December 6,
1993 to December 10, 1993 we verified OAB's responses for this administrative review and found that, in general, OAB's
records supported the information which OAB submitted to the Department. 



Scope of Review 



Imports covered by this review are sales or entries of brass sheet and strip, other than leaded and tinned brass sheet
and strip, from Sweden. The chemical composition of the products under review is currently defined in the Copper Development
Association (C.D.A.) 200 Series or the Unified Numbering System (U.N.S.) C20000 series. This review does not cover
products the chemical compositions of which are defined by other C.D.A. or U.N.S. series. The merchandise is currently
classified under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers 7409.21.00 and 7409.29.20. The HTS item numbers
are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. This review covers
one manufacturer/exporter, OAB. 



United States Price 



We based USP on purchase price (PP), in accordance with section 772(b) of the Tariff Act, because the subject merchandise
was sold to unrelated purchasers in the United States prior to importation into the United States. We calculated PP
based on C.I.F., duty paid prices, delivered either to independent U.S. warehouses or to the customers' premises.
In accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Tariff Act we made deductions, where appropriate, for U.S. point-to-point
freight, point-to-point insurance, brokerage and handling, customs duty, and cash discounts.

<DOCNO> FR940323-2-00014 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

We also adjusted USP for imputed consumption tax in accordance with the decision made by the Court of International
Trade (CIT) in 

Federal-Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company

 v. 

United States,

 Slip Op. 93-194 (CIT, October 7, 1993) (Federal-Mogul). In Federal-Mogul, the CIT rejected the Department's
methodology for calculating an addition to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act to account for taxes that
the exporting country would have assessed on the merchandise had it been sold in the home market. The CIT held that the
addition to USP under section 772(d)(1)(c) of the Tariff Act should be the result of applying the foreign market tax
rate to the price of the U.S. merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied
to the foreign market sales (Federal-Mogul at 12). 

In accordance with the Court's decision, the Department has added to USP the result of multiplying the foreign market
tax rate by the price of the U.S. merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was
applied to foreign market sales. The Department has also adjusted the USP tax adjustments and the amount of tax included
in FMV. These adjustments deduct the portions of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment that are the result
of expenses that are included in the foreign market price used to calculate foreign market tax and are included in the
U.S. merchandise price used to calculate the USP tax adjustment. These adjustments to the amount of the foreign market
tax and the USP tax adjustment are necessary to prevent our methodology for calculating the USP tax adjustment from
creating antidumping duty margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied upon foreign market sales.


This margin creation effect is due to the fact that the basis for calculating both the amount of tax included in the price
of the foreign market merchandise and the amount of the USP tax adjustment includes many expenses that are later deducted
when calculating USP and FMV. After these deductions are made, the amount of tax included in FMV and the USP tax adjustment
still reflects the amounts of these expenses. Thus, a margin may be created that is not dependent upon a difference
between USP and FMV, but is the result of the price of the U.S. merchandise containing more expenses than the price of
the foreign market merchandise. The Department's policy to avoid the margin creation effect is in accordance with
the United States Court of Appeals' holding that the application of the USP tax adjustment under section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Tariff Act should not create an antidumping duty margin if pre-tax FMV does not exceed USP (

Zenith Electronics Corp.

 v. 

United States,

 988 F.2d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1993)). In addition, the CIT has specifically held that an adjustment should be made
to mitigate the impact of expenses that are deducted from FMV and USP upon the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax
included in FMV (

Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd.

 v. 

United States,

 760 F. Supp. 200, 208 (CIT, 1991) (Daewoo)). However, the mechanics of the Department's adjustments to the USP tax
adjustment and the foreign market tax amount as described above are not identical to those suggested in Daewoo. 

No other adjustments were claimed or allowed. 



Foreign Market Value 



The Department used home market price, as defined in section 773 of the Tariff Act, to calculate FMV. Because the home
market was viable, we compared U.S. sales with sales of such or similar merchandise in the home market. Home market
prices were based on the monthly weighted-average, packed, F.O.B., ex-factory, or delivered prices to unrelated
purchasers in the home market. Where applicable, we made adjustments for home market warranty expenses, home market
rebates, packing expenses incurred in Sweden, home market credit, and home market inland freight. We further adjusted
FMV by adding U.S. direct selling expenses (credit, warranties, and post-sale warehousing and commission expenses).
However, since commissions were paid only in the U.S. market, we offset the U.S. commission expenses by deducting
home market indirect selling expenses from FMV in an amount not exceeding the amount of U.S. commissions. 

We also adjusted FMV for imputed consumption tax in accordance with the Federal-Mogul decision as described above,
and for differences in physical characteristics. However, because we did not receive the information necessary
to support OAB's reported difference-in-merchandise (difmer) amounts, for all U.S. sales to which we matched home
market sales of most similar merchandise, we used the largest positive gauge and alloy difmer amounts reported by
OAB (

i.e., 

the most adverse difmer amounts) as the best information available. See analysis memorandum of February 24, 1994
for further explanation. 

OAB also claimed a tool-setting expense as a circumstance-of-sale (COS) adjustment. Based on information obtained
at verification, we determined that because this expense was a manufacturing cost and not a selling expense, it did
not warrant a COS adjustment. As a result, we did not adjust for this expense in these preliminary results. See analysis
memorandum of February 24, 1994 for further explanation. No other adjustments were claimed or allowed.

Preliminary Results of Review 



As a result of our comparison of USP to FMV, we preliminarily determine that the following margin exists for the period
March 1, 1991 through February 29, 1992: 







Interested parties may request disclosure within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice and may request a
hearing within 10 days of publication. Any hearing, if requested, will be held 44 days after the date of publication
or the first business day thereafter. Case briefs and/or written comments from interested parties may be submitted
no later than 30 days after the date of publication. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttals to written comments, limited to
issues raised in those comments, may be filed no later than 37 days after the date of publication of this notice. The
Department will publish the final results of this administrative review including the results of its analysis of
issues raised in any such written comments or at the hearing. 

The Department will determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
Individual differences between USP and FMV may vary from the percentage stated above. The Department will issue appraisement
instructions directly to the Customs Service. 

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective 
for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the
publication date of the final results of this administrative review, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff
Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed company will be that rate established in the final results of this review;
(2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be
the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review,
a prior review, or the original less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit
rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) if neither
the exporter nor the manufacturer is a firm covered in this review, the cash deposit rate will be the ``all others''
rate established in the LTFV investigation. 

On May 25, 1993, the CIT, in 

Floral Trade Council 

v. 

United States

, Slip. Op. 93-79, and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation 

v. 

United States

, Slip. Op. 93-83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed
through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is
appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for
correction for clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders.
Therefore, the ``all others'' rate for this proceeding is 9.49 percent. 

This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file
a certificate regarding the 
reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure
to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties
occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with 
section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 
19 CFR 353.22.

ACTION: 

Notice of Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On October 7, 1993, the Department of Commerce published in the 

Federal Register

 the preliminary results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on color television receivers
from the Republic of Korea (58 FR 52262). The period of review covers seven manufacturers/exporters and the period
April 1, 1991, through March 31, 1992.



We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on our preliminary results. We did not hold a public hearing on
these results, as the result for a public hearing was withdrawn.

Based on our analysis of the comments received and the correction of certain clerical errors, we have revised the preliminary
results. The final dumping margins range from zero to 16.57 percent.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



On October 7, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 the preliminary results (58 FR 52262) of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on color television
receivers (CTVs) from the Republic of Korea (ROK) (49 FR 18336, April 30, 1984). The Department has now completed this
administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act), and 19
CFR 353.22 (1993).



Scope of the Review



The products covered by this review include color television receivers, complete and incomplete, from the ROK. The
order covers all CTVs regardless of tariff classification. During the period of review (POR), the subject merchandise
was classified under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers 8528.10.60, 85.29.90.15, 8529.90.20 and 8540.11.00.
The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes only. The written description remains dispositive
as to the scope of the product coverage.

The review covers seven manufacturers/exporters and the POR April 1, 1991, through March 31, 1992.



Analysis of Comments Received



We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received case briefs and rebuttal
briefs from the Independent Radionic Workers of America, the United Electrical Workers of America, the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture
Workers, AFL-CIO, and Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO (the Unions), the petitioners in this proceeding,
and three respondents, Goldstar Co., Ltd. (Goldstar), Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd. (Daewoo), and Samwon Electronics,
Inc. (Samwon).

Two companies, Tongkook General Electronics, Inc., and Cosmos Electronics Manufacturing Korea, Ltd., did not respond
to our requests for information. When a company fails to provide the information requested in a timely manner, the
Department considers the company uncooperative and generally assigns to that company the higher of (a) the highest
rate assigned to any company in any previous review, including the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation,
or (b) the highest rate for a responding company with shipments during the POR. Therefore, we have used the highest
rate from the LTFV investigation as the best information available (BIA) in determining the margins for these two
companies for this review, because this rate is higher than the highest rate in the current review. 

See Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. 

v. 

United States, 

Appeal No. 93-1049 (Fed. Cir. June 22, 1993). 

See also Krupp Stahl AG et al 

v. 

United States, 

822 F. Supp 789 (CIT May 26, 1993). Two other companies, Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., and Quantronics Manufacturing
Korea, Ltd., responded to the Department that they had no sales during the POR.



Petitioners' Comments





Comment 1: 

Petitioners argue that in the preliminary results of this review, the Department failed to measure the home market
tax incidence in Korea. Although petitioners admit that the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(CAFC) has recently held that no measurement of tax incidence is required under the statute, petitioners argue that
the Department should not implement that approach in light of a petition for ``rehearing and suggestion for rehearing
in banc that has been submitted by petitioners and is yet pending.''

Respondents argue that the recent CAFC decision (

Daewoo Elec. Corp. 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 92-1558-1562 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 30, 1993) (

Daewoo

)), clearly affirmed the Department's longstanding interpretation of the governing statute, 

i.e., 

no requirement to measure the amount of the pass-through taxes to the Korean consumers. Consequently, respondents
request that the Department retain the same methodology in the final results of the review.



Department's Position: 

We disagree with petitioners. The question of whether the Department was required to measure the Korean home market
tax incidence or ``pass-through'' tax was conclusively resolved by the CAFC in the 

Daewoo

 decision. In that decision, the CAFC rules that ``the statute does not speak to tax incidence, shifting burdens, or
pass-through, nor does it contain any hint that an econometric analysis must be performed'' (

Daewoo

, Slip Op. at 12). Consequently, the Department has retained its policy of not measuring the pass-through tax in this
review.



Comment 2: 

Petitioners object to the Department's methodology of making a circumstance-of-sale (COS) adjustment for differences
between home market and hypothetical U.S. taxes by adding the full amount of the Korean home market tax to United States
price (USP). Citing the recent Court of International Trade (CIT) decision, 

Federal-Mogul Corp. 

v. 

United States, 

17 CIT_, Slip Op. 93-194 (Oct. 7, 1993) (

Federal-Mogul

), petitioners request the Department to recalculate the commodity tax adjustment to USP.

Goldstar urges the Department to continue to adhere to the CAFC's decision in 

Zenith Elec. Corp. 

v. 

United States, 

988 F. 2d 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Zenith), 

i.e., 

by adding to USP the absolute amount of home market taxes, Goldstar claims that the recent Federal-Mogul decision
failed to recognize the critical distinction between the Zenith holding that the Department may not adjust the foreign
market value (FMV) to neutralize tax amounts, and the separate issue of how the adjustment to USP for commodity taxes
shall be performed. Goldstar further claims that in the 

Zenith

 decision, the Department used an 

ad valorem 

methodology to calculate the adjustment to USP. This methodology, according to Goldstar, resulted in a multiplier
effect on the underlying dumping margin, a result that the Department had argued justified making a tax-neutralizing
adjustment to FMV. Goldstar notes that the CAFC held that the express terms of the statute preclude such an adjustment
to FMV. However, Goldstar argues that in footnote four of that decision, the CAFC indicated that the Department may
lawfully avoid the multiplier effect by performing the adjustment to USP on an absolute basis rather than on an 

ad valorem 

basis.

Daewoo concurs with Goldstar and adds that the Department should not implement the Federal-Mogul decision unless
and until it is sustained by the CAFC.



Department's Position: 

We agree with petitioners. The CIT in 

Federal-Mogul

 rejected the practice of making COS adjustments for differences in tax amounts in USP and FMV. Consequently, we have
revised our methodology and adjusted USP for tax by multiplying the USP by the home market tax rate at the point in the
chain of commerce of the U.S. merchandise that is analogous to the point in the home market chain of commerce at which
the foreign government applies the home market consumption tax. In this case we multiplied the U.S. tax base (gross
unit price less discounts) by the Korean VAT rate. This product, the U.S. tax adjustment, was then added to the net USP.

With regard to the tax treatment in the home market, we included in the FMV the amount of Korean consumption tax collected
in the home market by multipling the tax base (home market gross unit price) by the Korean VAT rate.

We also calculated the amount of the tax that was due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax
base (

i.e., 

multiplying VAT rate by the sum of total deductions and additions). The total amount of U.S. movement and selling expenses
was multiplied by the Korean VAT rate and subtracted from the net USP to determine the final USP. Similarly, a total
amount of all adjustments in the home market was multiplied by the Korean VAT and deducted from FMV after all other adjustments
had been made.

<DOCNO> FR940323-2-00019 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940323-2-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

These adjustments are necessary to prevent our new methodology for calculating the USP tax adjustment from crating
antidumping duty margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied upon foreign market sales.



Comment 3: 

Petitioners argue that since Goldstar, in the preliminary results, a zero margin, it may suggest that no dumping margin
will be found in the final results of review. In that event, petitioners request that the Department should not count
this POR for the purposes of an antidumping order revocation because the quantity of the CTVs shipped by Goldstar to
the United States during this review was ``

de minimis

.'' Petitioners further state that ``a 

de minimis

 volume of shipments is also no indication of the absence of price discrimination, because any producer seeking to
dump its product would find it advantageous and a simple task to sell a 

de minimis

 volume of a product fair at fair value in the short-term so as to obtain revocation and then be freed to dump its product
in the future.''

Goldstar rebuts this allegation by claiming that: (1) There is no request for revocation in this review, therefore,
the issue is irrelevant; and (2) the Department should not grant ``advisory opinions'' on issues not relevant to this
review.



Department's Position: 

We agree with respondent. No request for revocation has been made and, therefore, this issue is not revelant.



Comment 4: 

Petitioners allege that respondents under-reported their U.S. sales during the POR and claim a discrepancy between
the reported U.S. sales and entries of the subject merchandise made during the POR.

Daewoo rejects petitioners' allegations, pointing out the Department's extensive verification of its sales and
the cost of production (COP) data. Respondents maintain that such a thorough verification would have revealed any
discrepancies.



Department's Position: 

We disagree with petitioners. The factual information alleging unreported entries was submitted to the Department
after more than 180 days from the initiation of the review. As such, it is untimely and cannot be used during the current
POR. 

See 

19 CFR 353.31(a)(1). Finally, all sales information and their respective entries pertaining to the current POR have
been verified. We found no discrepancies between the reported sales volume and the source documents.



Comment 5: 

Petitioners submitted comments concerning three computer programming/clerical errors in the Department's preliminary
results analysis of Daewoo's response.



Department's Position: 

We agree with the petitioners and have made the following corrections to the appropriate programs in our final results
calculations for Daewoo: (1) We replaced the gross commission expense with the net commission expense in the exporter's
sales price (ESP) cap; (2) we did not adjust USP for home market tax when we compared USP to a constructed value (CV) in
both the purchase price (PP) and ESP sales; and (3) we corrected the cost of manufacturer value in model DTB-1404PW
when it is used in the CV application.



Daewoo's Comment





Comment 6: 

Daewoo asserts that the Department incorrectly used CV for a home market model DTB-1404PW when the ``90/60''
day matching procedure revealed that there were not enough matching sales in every month of the POR. Instead, Daewoo
requests the use of another model in the home market which, allegedly, can be qualified as similar merchandise and
has sales in every month of the POR.

Petitioners object to the use of another model in the matching procedure because it does not meet the physical criteria
necessary to qualify as similar merchandise.



Department's Position: 

We disagree with Daewoo. Prior to determining FMV under section 773(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, the department must first
select the most similar merchandise. Section 771(16) of the Tariff Act defines such or similar merchandise and provides
a hierarchy of preferences for determining which merchandise sold in the foreign market is most similar to the merchandise
sold in the United States. Section 771(16) also expresses a preference for the use 

identical over similar 

merchandise. The cost test is not conducted until after the most similar model match is found under section 771(16).

Moreover, section 771(16) directs us only to ``the first of the following categories * * *'' and not
to the next category when the first match is below the COP. If this were not the case, the COP test would inappropriately
become part of the basis for determining what constitutes such or similar merchandise, which is clearly not the purpose
of the COP test. Consequently, it appears that the statute directs us to the use of CV when the most similar model is sold
below the cost.

<TEXT>
 

In this case, as a result of the COP test, we discarded sales of the most similar home market model. In conducting the
90/60 day contemporaneity test, we found no remaining sales of the most similar model. Therefore, we relied on CV as
the basis of FMV (

see

 Tubeless Steel Disc Wheels from Brazil, 52 FR 6947 (March 20, 1987), 

see, also,

 Import Administration Policy Bulletin, Dec. 15, 1993).



Comment 7:

 Citing 

AOC International 

v.

 United States,

 721 F. Supp. 314, 316 (CIT 1989) (

AOC

), Daewoo claims that the Department erroneously excluded from direct warranty costs in the home market the salaries
and benefits of employees in the aftersale service centers. According to the respondent, the Department's approach
is distortive because it treats all U.S. warranty expenses, incurred in the form of payments to unrelated parties,
as direct selling expenses, while classifying similar expenses in the home market as indirect selling expenses simply
because the warranty services are provided by the respondent's own service departments. Because the expenses incurred
in both markets are identical in nature, respondent contends that the Department should treat such expenses in the
same manner in both markets.



Department's Position:

 We disagree with Daewoo. According to our established practice, we consider the home market warranty expenses at
issue to be fixed costs that do not qualify as direct selling expenses. This is because the respondent would have incurred
such costs regardless of whether they made any sales of the subject merchandise. In the U.S. market, however, Daewoo's
warranty repairs are performed by the independent service firms which are paid on a per unit basis, as expense clearly
linked to units sold. Consequently, the U.S. warranty expenses are correctly treated as direct selling expenses.
Further, we note that the decision in 

AOC

 is not final, and may yet be reversed. Therefore, we have continued to treat the home market fixed warranty expenses
as indirect selling expenses for these final results (

see

 Color Television Receivers from the Republic of Korea, 58 FR 50,333 (Sept. 27, 1993), Comment 16 (Eighth Review),
and Color Television Receivers from the Republic of Korea, 56 FR 12,701 (March 27, 1991), Comment 20 (Fifth Review)).



Goldstar's Comments





Comment 8:

 Goldstar submitted comments concerning three computer programming/clerical errors in the Department's preliminary
results analysis of Goldstar's response.

Petitioners objected to one of the clerical error allegations, 

i.e.,

 the inclusion of the U.S. commissions in the ESP ``cap,'' on the grounds that there are no commissions, for comparable
sales, in the home market.



Department's Position:

 We agree with Goldstar and have made the following corrections to the appropriate program in our final results calculations
for Goldstar: (1) We included the warranty, technical expenses, royalties and promotional fees directly related
to the CTV sales in the home market pool of direct selling expenses; (2) we included the U.S. indirect warranty, U.S.
indirect advertising and U.S. commission expenses in the ESP cap; and (3) we corrected the amount of commodity taxes
in the home market, however, the correction was made according to the new methodology explained above (see Comment
2).

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940323-2-00021 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940323-2-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

With regard to petitioners' concerns regarding the inclusion of the U.S. commissions in the ESP cap, our regulations
state that where there is a commission paid in one market and none in the other market, we offset the commission with
indirect selling expenses incurred in the other market to the extent of the lesser of the commission or the selling
expenses (

see

 19 CFR 353.56(b), 

see, also, 

Antidumping Manual, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Chapter 8, p. 31).



Comment 9:

 Goldstar requests that the Department conform its COS adjustments in the ESP price comparisons to the methodology
ordered by the CIT in 

Timken Co. 

v. 

United States,

 673 F. Supp. 495 (CIT 1987) (

Timken

) and in a number of other cases. In 

Timken,

 the CIT held that, in ESP situations, the COS adjustments for U.S. direct selling expenses should be added to FMV rather
than deducted from USP.



Department's Position:

 We disagree with Goldstar. Section 772(e)(2) of the Tariff Act states that ESP sales shall be adjusted by being reduced
by the amount of ``expenses generally incurred by or for the account of the exporter in the United States in selling
identical or substantially identical merchandise'' (emphasis added). Therefore, we make COS adjustments in ESP
comparisons by deducting all selling expenses from ESP, rather than retaining them in ESP and adding the relevant
amounts to FMV. The litigation in 

Timken

 was withdrawn and there was no conclusive decision in the case. Further, because the issue of deducting direct selling
expenses from USP or adding them to FMV is currently on appeal before the CAFC, we have followed our longstanding practice
of making COS adjustments in ESP comparisons by deducting all selling expenses from the ESP for these final results.


See

 our positions in the Fifth Review, Comment 33, and Eighth Review, Comment 17.



Samwon's Comments





Comment 10:

 Samwon argues that the Department erred by excluding two U.S. sales which occurred outside the POR. Although Samwon
acknowledges that, traditionally, the Department uses the sales date as a basis for a review, Samwon notes that the
products covered by these sales entered the United States within the POR. Additionally, Samwon points out that it
did not participate in the prior (eighth review); thus there is no risk of analyzing certain transactions twice.

Petitioners object to the inclusion of sales that fall outside the POR. They point out the Samwon could have participated
in the prior review but decided against it. Additionally, petitioners urge the Department to continue its traditional
policy of including sales within the POR using the date of sale and not the date of entry.



Department's Position:

 We disagree with Samwon. Samwon voluntarily chose 

not

 to participate in the eighth administrative review and, therefore, forfeited the opportunity to have those sales
reviewed. Because the use of date of sale, rather than date of entry, as a basis for inclusion in a POR has been the Department's
longstanding policy in this case, we have retained this methodology in these final results (

see

 Color Picture Tubes from Republic of Korea, 52 FR 44186 (Nov. 18, 1987)).



Final Results of Review



Based on our analysis of comments received, and the correction of certain clerical errors, we have revised our preliminary
results. We determine the final margins for the period April 1, 1991, through March 31, 1992, to be:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940323-2-00022 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940323-2-00013 </PARENT>

The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
Individual differences between USP and FMV may vary from the percentages stated above. The Department will issue
appropriate appraisement instructions directly to Customs Service. 

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this
administrative review, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed
companies will be as outlined above except for Samsung, which will have a cash deposit of zero percent, since its rate
is 

de minimis

; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be
the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review,
a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate
established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise. 

On March 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade (CIT), in 

Floral Trade Council

 v. 

United States

, Slip Op. 93-79, and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation

 v. 

United States

, Slip Op. 93-83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed
through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is
appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for
correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders. 

Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping duty order, the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of this
review will be 13.90 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the LTFV investigation (49 FR 7620, March 1, 1984).


These deposit requirements shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative
review. 

This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 

This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective orders (APOs) of their responsibility
concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34.(d).
Timely written notification of the return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order
is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation. 

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act and 19 CFR 353.22.

Background 



On December 15, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 65577) (

Prelim

), the notice of preliminary results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain red raspberries
from Canada (50 FR 26019; June 24, 1985) for the period June 1, 1991 through May 31, 1992. We gave interested parties
an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received no comments. The Department has now completed this
administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). 

The review initially covered four processors/exporters. We terminated the review of Universal Packers Inc. and
Mukhtiar & Sons Packers Ltd. because the companies withdrew their requests for review on a timely basis in accordance
with  353.22(a)(5) of the Commerce regulations. For the remaining two companies, we found zero margins.

Scope of the Review 



Imports covered by this review are shipments of fresh and frozen red raspberries packed in bulk containers and suitable
for further processing. These products are classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers
0810.20.90, 0810.20.10, and 0811.20.20. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and customs purposes.
The written description remains dispositive. 



Final Results of the Review 



As a result of our comparison of United States price to foreign market value (FMV), as discussed in the preliminary
results of our review, we determine that the following margins exist for the review period: 







Based on information submitted by Clearbrook during this and two previous reviews (see, Final Results of Administrative
Reviews at 57 FR 49686; November 3, 1992, and 56 FR 37527; August 7, 1991), we further determine that Clearbrook has
met the requirements for revocation set forth in sections 353.25(a)(2) and 353.25(b) of the Department regulations.
Clearbrook has demonstrated three consecutive years of sales at not less than foreign market value and has submitted
the certifications required under 19 CFR 353.25(b)(1). The Department conducted a verification of Clearbrook as
required under 19 CFR 353.25(c)(2)(ii). 

On the basis of no sales at less than foreign market value for a period of three consecutive years, and the lack of any
indication that such sales are likely, the Department concludes that Clearbrook is not likely to sell subject merchandise
at less than foreign market value in the future. Therefore, the Department is revoking the order with respect to Clearbrook.


The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. With respect
to Clearbrook's entries, the Department will instruct Customs to terminate suspension of liquidation, to liquidate
the entries without regard to antidumping duties, and to cease collecting cash deposits. 

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of this notice of final results
of administrative review for all shipments of the subject merchandise, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for
consumption on or after the publication date, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) The cash deposit
rate for the reviewed company other than Clearbrook, will be as outlined above; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated
companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the
most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original less-than-fair-value
(LTFV) investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent
period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters
will be 2.41 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the LTFV investigation (50 FR 26019; June 24, 1985), in
accordance with the decisions of the Court of International Trade in 

Floral Trade Council

 v. 

United States

, Slip Op. 93-79, and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation

 v. 

United States

, Slip Op. 93-83 (

see Prelim

, 58 FR at 65578). 

These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review. 

This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1)(B) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)(B))
and 19 CFR 353.22 and 353.25.

 Import Administration/International Trade Administration Department of Commerce. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final results of antidumping duty administrative review.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On December 30, 1993, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its administrative review
of the antidumping duty order on 3.5 inch microdisks and coated media thereof (microdisks) from Japan. The review
covers one manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to the United States, Hitachi Maxell, Ltd. (HML), and the period
April 1, 1992 through March 31, 1993. 



We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. Based on our analysis of comments
received, we have changed the final results from those presented in our preliminary results of review.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 



On December 30, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 69339) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on microdisks (54
FR 13406, April 3, 1989). The Department has now completed that administrative review in accordance with section
751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act), and 19 CFR 353.22. 



Scope of the Review 



Imports covered by the review are shipments of 3.5 inch microdisks and coated media thereof from Japan, currently
classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item number 8523.20.0000. The HTS item number is provided for
convenience and for Customs purposes only. The written descriptions remain dispositive. 

A 3.5 inch microdisk is a tested or untested magnetically coated polyester disk with a steel hub enclosed in a hard plastic
jacket. These microdisks are used to record and store encoded digital computer information for access by a 3.5 inch
floppy disk drive. The 3.5 inch microdisk includes single-sided, double-sided, or high-density formats. The 3.5
inch microdisk is intended for use specifically in a 3.5 inch floppy disk drive. 

Coated media is the flexible recording material used in the finished microdisk. Media consists of a polyester base
film to which a coating of magnetically charged particles is bonded. 

This review covers one Japanese manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to the United States, HML, and the period
April 1, 1992 through March 31, 1993. 



Analysis of Comments Received 



The Department gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results of this administrative
review as provided by section 353.38 of the Commerce Regulations. We received comments from the respondent, HML.
We have corrected the clerical errors noted by the respondents, and have addressed them specifically in this notice.

Comment 1: 

HML commented that rebates and discounts should not be included in constructed value because they are price adjustments
and not expenses. It cites Antifriction Bearings (Other than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from The
Federal Republic of Germany, Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review (55 FR 31692, 31732, July 11,
1991), as an example of the Department's practice. 


Department's Position: 

We agree. Our preliminary analysis memorandum may have made it seem as if we included rebates and discounts in constructed
value. However, we did not include rebates and discounts in our preliminary constructed value calculation because
it is not our policy to do so. Therefore, no change in our calculations was necessary. 


Comment 2: 

HML commented that in comparing U.S. sales to constructed value, the Department made an error regarding home market
inventory carrying costs of coated media. HML asserts that the Department should include these costs when determining
the total amount of home market indirect expenses to deduct from constructed value just as it did in calculating the
deduction from home market prices. 


Department's Position: 

We agree. It was our intention as we stated in our preliminary notice that inventory carrying costs be included in the
pool of indirect home market selling expenses. 
Therefore, we have corrected our calculations. In accordance with our practice, we have limited the adjustment to
constructed value of home market indirect expenses to the amount of indirect expenses HML incurred on its exporter's
sales price transactions. 


Comment 3: 

HML pointed out two clerical errors in the model match table used in the computer program which caused no matching FMV
sales to be found for two of the models sold in the United States. 


Department's Position: 

We agree and have corrected the our calculations accordingly. 


Final Results of the Review 


As a result of this administrative review, the Department determines that the following margin exists for the period
April 1, 1992, through March 31, 1993: 




The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. The
Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service. 
Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of these final results of this
administrative 
review for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after
the publication date, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) For subject merchandise exported by
HML, a cash deposit of 0.96 percent; (2) For subject merchandise exported by manufacturers or exporters not covered
in this review, but covered in previous reviews or the original less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation, a cash
deposit based on the most recently published rate in a final result or determination for which the manufacturer or
exporter received a company-specific rate; (3) If the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review,
or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for
the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) If neither the exporter nor the manufacturer
is a firm covered in these or any previous review reviews conducted by the Department, the cash deposit rate will be
42.85 percent, the ``all other'' rate established in the LTFV investigation, as discussed below. 
On March 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade (CIT), in 

Floral Trade Council 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-79, and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation 

v. 

United States,

 Slip Op. 93-83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed through
an administrative review.

The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate to reinstate the original
``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result
of litigation) in a proceeding governed by an antidumping duty order. 
This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate

regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. 
Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the 
Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties 
occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 
This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective orders (APOs) of their responsibility
concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d).
Timely written notification of return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order
is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of APO is a sanctionable violation. 

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 
19 CFR 353.22.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting
competitive applications under its Minority Business Development Center (MBDC) program. The total cost of performance
for the first budget period (12 months) from September 1, 1994 to August 31, 1995 is estimated at $198,971. The application
must include a minimum cost-share of 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. Cost-sharing
contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, client fees, in-kind contributions or combinations thereof.
The MBDC will operate in the Indianapolis, Indiana geographic service area. The award number of this MBDC will be 05-10-94007-01.



The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.

The MBDC program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and
maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and
private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of management and technical
assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority
business.

Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses,
individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development
services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included
in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). An application
must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically
acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated
by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the demonstrated responsibility
of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit
findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an applicant
not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily receive the award.

MBDCs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To
assist in this effort, the MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, the MBDC will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross
sales of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000.

Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of the MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.

DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY


<DOCTITLE>Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Proposed Disposal and Reuse of Naval Hospital Philadelphia,
PA</DOCTITLE>



 Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as implemented by the Council on Environmental
Quality regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), the Department of Navy announces its intent to prepare an Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate the potential environmental effects of the disposal and reuse of the Naval Hospital
(NAVHOSP) Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

In accordance with recommendations of the Department of Defense Secretary's 1988 Commission on Base Realignment
and Closure, the Navy has disestablished NAVHOSP Philadelphia. The proposed action to be analyzed in the EIS involves
the disposal of land, buildings, and infrastructure of NAVHOSP Philadelphia for subsequent reuse. NAVHOSP Philadelphia
consists of approximately 49 acres and a total of 56 buildings, and structures, including 47 permanent, eight semi-permanent,
and one temporary facility. NAVHOSP Philadelphia is located in the southern portion of the City of Philadelphia,
north of the Philadelphia Naval Base, in the County of Philadelphia.

The reuse of NAVHOSP Philadelphia has been studied by the Mayor of Philadelphia's Commission on Defense Conversion.
The redevelopment/reuse plan developed by the Commission will be the basis for the EIS. The reuse plan proposes a 15
acre area for market rate housing, a five acre nursing home/assisted living facility, and a 30 acre addition to Philadelphia's
Fairmount Park. The Park area would include 13 acres of passive recreation, four acres of active recreation, and 13
acres for parking. The ``no action'' alternative, Navy retention of NAVHOSP Philadelphia land and infrastructure
in caretaker status, will be addressed in the EIS. However, because of the process mandated by the Base Closure and
Realignment Act, selection of the ``no action'' alternative would be considered outside the jurisdiction of the
Navy.


The EIS to be prepared by the Navy will address the following known areas of concern: effects of new development at the
Hospital on the natural and socioeconomic environments, effects of future growth on area schools, recreations facilities
and transportation systems, and the effects of reuse on any historic properties on-site. Preliminary studies indicate
the most of NAVHOSP Philadelphia is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic
district, with many of the buildings and structures contributing to the district's significance. Major environmental
issues that will be addressed in the EIS included, but are not limited to, air quality, water quality, wetlands, endangered
species, transportation, and socioeconomic impacts.

The Navy will initiate a scoping process for the purposes of determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for
identifying the significant issues related to the proposed reuse alternatives. A pubic scoping meeting is scheduled
for Wednesday, April 6, 1994, beginning at 7:30 p.m., at the Holy Spirit Church, in the Church Hall, 1835 Hartranft
Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This meeting will be announced in the local papers.

A brief presentation will precede request for public comment. Navy representatives will be available at this meeting
to receive comments from the public regarding issues of concern to the public. It is important that federal, state,
and local agencies and interested individuals take this opportunity to identify environmental concerns that should
be addressed during the preparation of the EIS. In the interest of available time, each speaker will be asked to limit
their oral comments to five minutes.

Agencies and the public are also invited and encouraged to provide written comment in addition to, or in lieu of, oral
comments at the public meeting. To be most helpful, scoping comments should clearly describe specific issues or topics
which the commentor believes the EIS should address. Written statements and or questions regarding the scoping process
should be mailed no later than April 29, 1994, to: Commanding Officer, Northern Division, Naval Facilities Engineering
Command, 10 Industrial Highway, Lester, Pennsylvania 19113 (Attn: Mr. Robert Ostermueller, Code 202), telephone
(610) 595-0759.

Proposed Subsequent Arrangement



Pursuant to section 131 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2160), notice is hereby given of a proposed
``subsequent arrangement'', under the Agreement for Cooperation between the Government of the United States of
America and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) concerning Peaceful Application of Atomic Energy, as
amended.

The subsequent arrangement to be carried out under the above-mentioned agreement involves approval of the following
sale: Contract Number S-IA-165, for the sale of 75 grams of uranium containing 70 grams of the isotope uranium-235
(93.3 percent enrichment) and 5 grams of uranium containing approximately 1 gram of the isotope uranium-235 to the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) laboratory, Siebersdorff, Austria for use in the calibration of analytical
instruments and certification of analytical method reliability.

In accordance with section 131 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, it has been determined that this subsequent
arrangement will not be inimical to the common defense and security.

This subsequent arrangement will take effect no sooner than fifteen days after the date of publication of this notice.

<DOCTITLE>Issuance of Decisions and Orders by the Office of Hearings and Appeals; Week of January 31 Through February 4, 1994</DOCTITLE>



During the week of January 31 through February 4, 1994 the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with respect
to applications for exception or other relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy.
The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.



Applications for Exception





Bollmann Oil Inc., 02/03/94; LEE-0061 




Bollmann Oil Inc. (Bollmann) filed an Application for Exception from the provisions of the Energy Information Administration
(EIA) reporting requirements in which the firm sought relief from filing Form EIA-782B, entitled ``Resellers'/Retailers'
Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' In considering the request, the DOE found that Bollmann was not adversely
affected by the reporting burden in a way that is significantly different from the burden borne by similar reporting
firms. Therefore, it could not be granted relief from filing. Accordingly, exception relief was denied.




Van Dyke Gas Co., 02/03/94; LEE-0058




Van Dyke Gas Company (Van Dyke) filed an Application for Exception from the provisions of the Energy Information Administration
(EIA) reporting requirements in which the firm sought relief from filing Form EIA-782B, entitled ``Resellers'/Retailers'
Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' The DOE determined that Van Dyke did not meet the standards for exception
relief because it was not experiencing a serious hardship or gross inequity as a result of the reporting requirements.
Accordingly, exception relief was denied.




Walker Sims Oil Co., Inc., 02/03/94; LEE-0057




Walker Sims Oil Co., Inc. (Walker Sims), filed an Application for Exception from the provisions of the Energy Information
Administration (EIA) reporting requirements in which the firm sought relief from filing Form EIA-782B, entitled
``Resellers'/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' In considering the request, the DOE found that
the firm was not adversely affected by the reporting burden in a way that is significantly different from the burden
borne by similar reporting firms. Therefore, it could not be granted relief from filing. Accordingly, exception
relief was denied.

Refund Applications 
 


Acme Steel Co., 02/01/94; RF272-45165; RD272-45165

 

The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refund filed by Acme Steel Company (Acme), a producer
of steel and steel products, in the Subpart V crude oil refund proceeding. A group of States and Territories (States)
objected to the application on the grounds that the applicant was able to pass through increased petroleum costs to
its customers. In support of their objection, the States cited increases in Acme's sales and earnings from 1973 to
1974. In addition, the States submitted an affidavit of an economist stating that, in general, the steel industry
was able to pass through increased petroleum costs. The DOE determined that the evidence offered by the States was
insufficient to rebut the presumption of end-user injury and the applicant should receive a refund. The DOE also denied
the States' Motion for Discovery, finding that discovery was not warranted where the States had not presented evidence
sufficient to rebut the applicant's presumption of injury. In addition, the DOE found that the petroleum coke purchased
by Acme originated in a crude oil refinery and was purchased from a reseller who did not substantially change its form.
Therefore these purchases were found to be eligible for a crude oil refund. The refund granted to the applicant in this
Decision was $75,035.

 

Lou-Jak Trucking Service, 02/03/94; RC272-226

 

The DOE issued a Supplemental Order concerning an Application for Refund filed by Wilson, Keller and Associates (WKA)
on behalf of Lou-Jak Trucking Service (Lou-Jak) (Case No. RF272-91757). Lou-Jak was granted a refund in Linston
Inc., Case Nos. RF272-91500 et al.

 (January 3, 1994). After that decision was issued, WKA informed the DOE that a substantial portion of Lou-Jak's gallonage
claim was based upon purchases made by the owner-operators of vehicles whose services were rented by Lou-Jak. WKA
stated that the owner-operators, not Lou-Jak, purchased this fuel. Accordingly, the DOE rescinded the portion of
Lou-Jak's refund that was based on the purchases made by the owner-operators.

 



Texaco Inc./Burlington Northern Railroad; Dairymen, Inc. 02/04/94; RF321-8232; RF321-8353 




The DOE issued a Decision and Order in the Texaco Inc. refund proceeding concerning Applications for Refund filed
by Burlington Northern Railroad and Dairymen, Inc. Both of these applicants had purchased some of their Texaco products
through retail outlets at locations nationwide. The applicants attempted to estimate the amount of product purchased
through retail outlets using their total cost as reflected in Texaco credit card payments. The DOE found that the applicants
were entitled to refunds based upon their retail purchases, but that their estimates were flawed because they used
inappropriate per gallon costs in converting purchase costs to purchase volumes. The DOE calculated, for each year
of the refund period, a nationwide average retail price for branded motor gasoline, and used those selling prices
to calculate the applicants' purchase volumes. The applicants were granted refunds based upon both their direct
Texaco purchases and their purchases through retail outlets. The refunds granted in this Decision and Order total
$401,962 ($291,340 in principal plus $110,622 in interest).

 

Texaco Inc./Fairwood Texaco, 02/03/94; RF321-20044

 

The DOE issued a Supplemental Order concerning an Application for Refund filed by Robert West on behalf of Fairwood
Texaco (Case No. RF321-9165). Fairwood Texaco was granted a refund in Texaco Inc./Gaeta Brothers Oil, Inc.
Case Nos. RF321-6560 et al.

 (September 28, 1993). The DOE received another application on behalf of Fairwood Texaco filed by Robert Brisendine
(Case No. RF321-16546). Mr. Brisendine claimed and documented ownership dates that overlapped with those
claimed by Mr. West. In response to a request for documentation of his ownership dates, Mr. West informed the DOE that
Mr. Brisendine's dates of ownership were correct. Accordingly, the DOE rescinded a portion of Mr. West's refund.

<DOCTITLE>Carnegie Natural Gas Co.; Petition for Cancellation of Technical Conference</DOCTITLE>



March 17, 1994.



Take notice that on March 14, 1994, Carnegie Natural Gas Company (Carnegie) filed with the Commission a motion to cancel
a technical conference previously ordered.

On January 28, 1994, the Commission issued an order in response to Carnegie's filing to direct bill Account No. 858
costs, and established a technical conference to address the concerns of Carnegie's customers. Carnegie states
that it believes that the concerns expressed by New Jersey Natural Gas Company (New Jersey) and the Columbia Distribution
Companies have already been decided by the Commission in other proceedings. Carnegie argues that the issues identified
by the parties have either been resolved by the Commission or mooted as a result of the tariff sheets filed by Carnegie
in Docket No. RS92-30-000, and this supports the cancellation of the technical conference in this proceeding.
Carnegie also seeks an order summarily approving its tariff filing.

Carnegie states that copies of the filing has been served upon each person designated on the official service list
compiled by the Secretary in this proceeding.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure 18 CFR 385.211. All such protests should be filed on or before March 24, 1994. Protests will be considered
by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties
to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>Equitrans, Inc.; Application</DOCTITLE>



March 17, 1994.



Take notice that on March 16, 1994, Equitrans, Inc. (Equitrans) 3500 Park Lane, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15275,
filed in Docket No. CP94-289-000 an application pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate
of public convenience and necessity authorizing the immediate sale for resale in interstate commerce of up to 600,000
dekatherms (dt) of natural gas under Equitrans, Inc. Rate Schedule MSS (Unbundled Merchant Service) from a certificated
storage reservoir for a limited term expiring either (1) 90 days from the date of issuance of the certificate or (2)
upon termination of the underlying sales contracts if such contracts extend for a period in excess of 90 days, all as
more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

Equitrans states that sales would be made by Equitrans' merchant division, Equitrans Marketing Services Company
(EMSC), at market-clearing rates negotiated with individual customers on an open access non-discriminatory basis
under Rate Schedule MSS.

In light of the crucial winter heating requirements being experienced throughout much of the United States, Equitrans
requests that the Commission grant whatever waivers of its Regulations that may be necessary to permit the proposed
sales to commence no later than March 31, 1994. Equitrans further requests pregranted abandonment authorization
at the expiration of the underlying contracts for the sales of the working gas.

It is stated that the proposed sales would be made from the Hunters Cave storage reservoir from gas that was injected
under Equitrans' blanket certificate for testing and development.
 Equitrans states that these newly injected volumes need to be withdrawn for testing purposes and, due to increased
demand, should be made available for immediate sale to help meet this winter's heating needs.





Equitrans states that at the time the additional volumes were injected into storage as test gas at Hunters Cave, the
gas was reflected in Equitrans' rate base in the amount of $2.33 per dt. Upon sale of the gas under Rate Schedule MSS at
individually negotiated, market-based rates, Equitrans proposes to credit its Account No. 164 by the amount that
the gas is currently reflected in the rate case. If the sale is at a price lower than the rate base amount, Equitrans states
that it will absorb the difference. Equitrans submits that this passthrough of revenues to its jurisdictional customers
will provide them with rate relief while maintaining the same high level of service. Equitrans contends that this
is the approach recently approved by the Commission for the sale of excess storage gas in, among other cases, Panhandle
Eastern Pipe Line Company, 61 FERC  61,357 at 62,433 (1992), reh'g denied on this issue, 62 FERC  61,288
at 62,883-84 (1993).

Although this and other cases involve sales-in-place, Equitrans states that the new gas at Hunters Cave must be withdrawn
for operational/testing reasons and cannot be allowed to remain in storage. Equitrans contends that, nonetheless,
the ratemaking determinations for sales of excess storage gas should be the same whether or not the gas remains in storage.

Equitrans states that, as in Panhandle, it will bear the full revenue risk if the market does not allow the gas to be sold
above the $2.33 level reflected in the rate base. It is stated that only the revenue, if any, above the rate base level
will be retained by Equitrans, through its merchant division, EMSC.

Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before April 1,
1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.

Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and
procedure, a hearing will be held with further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if
no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds
that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene
is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of
such hearing will be duly given.

Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Equitrans to appear
or be represented at the hearing.

<DOCTITLE>Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.; Complaint</DOCTITLE>



March 17, 1994. 



Take notice that on March 14, 1994, Selkirk Cogen Partners, L.P., (Selkirk) tendered for filing a complaint regarding
Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company's (Tennessee) gas supply realignment (GSR) cost surcharge. Selkirk states that
Tennessee's GSR mechanism, because it is not mileage-based, contravenes Commission policy, as enunciated in Order
No. 636-B.

Selkirk states that Tennessee's GSR recovery mechanism is unjust, unreasonable and unduly discriminatory because
Selkirk is required to contribute the same amount to Tennessee's GSR costs for its short 25-mile haul as long-haul
shippers utilizing Tennessee's entire system. 

Selkirk states that copies of the filing have been served upon each person designated on the official service list
compiled by the Secretary in Tennessee's GSR proceeding, Docket No. RP93-151-000.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said complaint should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with rules 214
and 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure 18 CFR 385.214, 385.211. All such motions or protests should
be filed on or before April 18, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate
action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a
party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public
inspection. Answers to this complaint shall be due on or before April 18, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; Adequacy Determination of State Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Tentative Determination on Application of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for Full Program Adequacy Determination,
Public Hearing and Public Comment Period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste
Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal solid
waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will comply
with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA Section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate
issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribe Implementation
Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill
permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are
submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of STIR,
adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes
may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have
an important benefit. Approved State/Tribe permit programs provide for interaction between State/Tribe and the
owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes
with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal
permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the
permit status of any facility, the federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities.



The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed Puerto
Rico's MSWLF application and certain revisions thereto, and made a tentative determination that all portions of
Puerto Rico's MSWLF permit program are adequate to assure compliance with the revised Federal Criteria. Puerto Rico's
application for program adequacy determination and its revisions are available for public review and comment.

Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a hearing on any determination to approve a State/Tribe's MSWLF program,
the Region has scheduled four public hearings on this tentative determination. Details appear below in the 

DATES

 section.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



A. Background



On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure
that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine
that State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs are adequate to comply with the revised Federal Criteria.
To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation
Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate.

EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements
for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several
minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that
are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue
a permit or other notice or prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also
must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA.
Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement
authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.

EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``Adequate'' program based on the interpretation
outlined above. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirement for all elements of a MSWLF program before
it gives full approval to a MSWLF program.



B. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico



On October 8, 1993, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico submitted an application for adequacy determination. On February
17, 1994, Puerto Rico made a revised submission. EPA reviewed Puerto Rico's application and the revised submission,
and tentatively determined that all portions of Puerto Rico's Subtitle D program are adequate to provide compliance
with the revised Federal Criteria.

On October 4, 1993, Puerto Rico, acting through its Environmental Quality Board, adopted comprehensive, revised
regulations governing solid waste disposal. These regulations are closely patterned after the 40 CFR part 258 Federal
Criteria. Certain technical and clarifying amendments have subsequently been considered by the Board and are expected
to be adopted within the next several months. The purpose of the revised solid waste regulation and the amendments
thereto are to bring Puerto Rico regulations into full conformity with 40 CFR part 258 Federal Criteria. EPA has reviewed
Puerto Rico's revised regulation and the technical and clarifying amendments thereto, described above, and has
made a preliminary determination that their provisions are adequate to meet part 258 criteria.

The Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board has responsibility for implementing and enforcing solid waste management
regulations, including a permit program, inspection authority and enforcement activities. In its application,
Puerto Rico states that adequate technical, support, and legal personnel will be assigned to implement its permit
program. In addition to identifying the individuals and offices that will be assigned to this effort, Puerto Rico
has specifically assigned a complement of attorneys from the Environmental Quality Board to assist in the regulatory
enforcement process. Puerto Rico has determined that at present there are 61 landfills throughout the Commonwealth,
of which 31 will have stopped receiving waste by April 9, 1994 and will close in direct response to part 258 requirements.
Thirty landfills will remain open after April 9, 1994, of which 19 will be closed over the next 5 to 7 years, and 11 regional
landfills will thereafter remain open. In recognition of the need to revise existing landfill permits to reflect
the revised regulation and part 258 criteria, Puerto Rico plans to modify existing operating permits within the next
two years for the 30 landfills that will remain open after April 9, 1994. Each modified operating permit will contain
compliance provisions that will bring full compliance with the revised regulation and part 258 within a year's time.

The EPA will hold four public hearings on its tentative decision. Two hearings will be held on May 11, 1994 at the Solid
Waste Management Authority in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico. Two additional hearings will be held on May 12, 1994 at the Mayag&uuml;ez
City Hall in Mayag&uuml;ez, Puerto Rico. On each of these dates, the first hearing will begin at 1 p.m. and the second
hearing will begin at 7 p.m. Comments can be submitted orally at the hearing or in writing at the time of the hearing.
The public may also submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination to the location indicated in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this notice until May 12, 1994. Copies of Puerto Rico's application are available for inspection and copying
at the locations indicated in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this notice.

EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period and
during each public hearing. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy for
Puerto Rico's program. EPA expects to make a final decision on whether or not to approve Puerto Rico's program by June
24, 1994 and will give notice of it in the 

Federal Register

. The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and responses to all major comments.

Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of Section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained
in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal
program approved by EPA will be considered to be in compliance with Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October
9, 1991).

<DOCTITLE>TSCA Section 21 Petition; Response to Citizens' Petition </DOCTITLE>

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Response to citizens' petition.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On December 16, 1993, the Board of Supervisors of the County of Imperial, California, petitioned EPA under section
21 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), to issue a test rule under section 4 of TSCA to require monitoring of the
New River for chemical pollutants and subsequent health and environmental effects testing of the identified chemicals,
in addition to other requested actions. This Notice announces EPA's response to Imperial County's petition. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Summary of Petition and Response 


On December 16, 1993, EPA received a petition under section 21 of TSCA from the Board of Supervisors of the County of
Imperial, California. The petitioner has requested that EPA take the following actions: Require monitoring of the
New River to determine the presence and level of contaminants under section 4 of TSCA; require health and environmental
effects testing of detected chemicals under section 4 of TSCA; and take appropriate action under TSCA or other Federal
laws to protect human health and the environment, based on the results of the testing. The petitioner requests the
actions because the Board believes there are insufficient monitoring data on the chemicals in the River as well as
insufficient health and environmental effects data on those chemicals. 
The petitioner alleges that there may be a serious health risk to the citizens of Imperial County, California resulting
from toxic chemicals and pathogens present in the New River. The petitioner also alleges that the presence of these
chemicals and pathogens results from discharges by facilities located in Mexico in the vicinity of the City of Mexicali.
The petitioner argues that discharges of a chemical into the New River in Mexico, where the river-borne chemical subsequently
crosses the U.S. border, constitute ``import'' into the U.S. under TSCA. The petitioner also argues that manufacturers
and processors of the pollutants in Mexico should bear the burden of conducting the testing. 
In addition to the request for action under section 21 of TSCA, the petitioner states that the poor and predominantly
Hispanic citizens of Imperial County who live and work along the New River, as a matter of environmental equity, are
entitled to the same rigorous enforcement of environmental laws regarding water quality as citizens in other areas
of the United States. Imperial County also requested that EPA raise the need for a solution to the New River problem
with Mexican officials through mechanisms under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 
The County Board has simultaneously petitioned the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) for
a health assessment of the New River under section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. section 9601, 

et. seq.

 
EPA believes that additional monitoring of the New River is necessary to adequately characterize the chemical contamination
in the River, and that obtaining such information is an important step in addressing New River pollution. To expedite
EPA's review of the New River situation, EPA will fund work with the California Regional Water Quality Control Board
(CRWQCB) to develop the monitoring data that, along with other currently available information, will allow EPA to
determine with a reasonable level of confidence the identities and amounts of chemical pollutants in the New River
and whether additional testing is necessary. A more detailed discussion of the proposed monitoring activities is
located in Unit IV.A. of this Notice. 
In light of its decision to fund the CRWQCB monitoring, EPA has determined that the imposition of a test rule to require
monitoring of the River is unnecessary. The Agency will obtain the data requested by the petition by more expeditious
means. Promulgating a test rule could require several years due to the notice-and-comment procedures required for
agency rulemaking and the complexity of the New River situation. 
With regard to the petitioner's request to impose testing to evaluate the ecological and health risks of the River
pollutants, the Agency has decided that it is not currently in a position to conclude that the requisite section 4 criteria
have been met. This is true even for the pollutants identified in the petition or in existing monitoring data. EPA believes
it will be better able to evaluate whether it is necessary and appropriate to promulgate a section 4 test rule for ecological
and health effects testing after the Agency has received and evaluated up-to-date monitoring information on the
identities, levels and environmental partitioning of pollutants in the River. A more detailed discussion of this
issue is contained in Unit III. of this Notice. 
EPA is also continuing and/or taking a number of additional initiatives as described in Unit IV. of this Notice. These
activities are aimed at addressing the pollution problems in the New River that appear to result from both international
pollution coming from Mexico and pollution contributions from Imperial County. 


II. Background 


A. Statutory Requirements 


Section 21 of TSCA provides that any person may petition EPA to initiate proceedings for the issuance of rules under
sections 4, 6, and 8 of TSCA. 
A section 21 petition must set forth the facts which the petitioner believes establish the need for the rules requested.
EPA is required to grant or deny the petition within 90 days. If EPA grants the petition, the Agency must promptly commence
an appropriate proceeding. If EPA denies the petition, the Agency must publish its reasons in the 

Federal Register

. 
Within 60 days of denial, the petitioner may commence a civil action in a U.S. district court to compel the initiation
of the rulemaking requested in its petition. The court must, for a petition for a new rule, provide the opportunity
for the petition to be considered de novo. 
After hearing the evidence, the court can order EPA to initiate the action requested if the petitioner has demonstrated,
by a preponderance of the evidence, support for particular conclusions described in section 21. 
In a challenge to an EPA denial of a section 21 petition requesting a section 4 rule, the petitioner would have to demonstrate
by a preponderance of the evidence that information available to the Agency is insufficient to permit a reasoned evaluation
of the effects of a chemical, that the chemical either may present an unreasonable risk or will be produced in substantial
amounts and may result in significant or substantial human exposure or substantial environmental release, and that
testing is necessary to characterize the risks. 
Section 21 does not provide specific direction as to how the Agency should evaluate a citizen's petition, but merely
states that EPA must grant or deny within 90 days. However, there are standards under section 4 for issuing regulations,
and in determining whether to grant or deny, EPA must consider whether the requirements for section 4 rulemaking can
be met. 
Under section 4 of TSCA, EPA may issue rules to require chemical manufacturers and processors to test the chemical
substances and mixtures that they produce. To issue a section 4 rule on a chemical, EPA must find either that activities
involving the chemical may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, or that the chemical
is or will be produced in substantial quantities and that there is or will be significant or substantial human exposure
to the chemical or that the chemical is or will be released to the environment in substantial quantities. In addition,
EPA must find that existing data are insufficient to determine or predict the effects of the chemical and that testing
is necessary to develop that data. EPA must be able to make all of the above findings to issue a test rule; if EPA believes
on the basis of the information obtained from the petition, and from its investigation during the 90-day review
period, that it cannot make all of the necessary findings, EPA will deny the section 21 petition. 
One of the criteria most relevant to this petition is whether testing is necessary. Section 4 expands the concept of
sufficiency provided in the section 21 standards established for the purposes of district court review, requiring
that EPA find that testing is necessary to develop the data needed to evaluate a chemical before it may issue a test rule.
In making this finding, EPA considers whether there are other means of obtaining data without resorting to a test rule.

The relief available under section 21 is limited to the initiation of a proceeding to issue, amend, or appeal a rule
under either section 4, 6, or 8, or an order under section 5(e) or 6(b)(2). Consequently, some of the remedies requested
in the petition are not within the scope of actions available through a section 21 petition. 


B. Description of the New River Problem 


The population of Mexicali, Mexico, and Calexico, U.S., like other major sister cities in the border area has grown
rapidly in the last 50 years, and has paralleled the expansion of the industrial base of Mexicali. The rapid population
growth in Mexicali and all along the border, coupled with rapid urban growth and unanticipated land use, has resulted
in serious problems. One of these problems has been severe pressures on the urban infrastructure (e.g., wastewater
treatment and collection systems). 
Mexicali's existing wastewater treatment systems are inadequate for the existing volume of wastewater being generated.
Since the existing treatment systems are overloaded, it is likely that the influent to the systems is not receiving
sufficient treatment. In addition, Mexicali's rapid growth has resulted in communities which are not yet connected
to the treatment system. In 1990, this uncollected sewage averaged about 13 million gallons per day (mgd) and, after
recent improvements to the Mexicali system by the Mexican government, the uncollected flow is about 8 mgd. These flows
also end up in the New River. Once the New River crosses the international boundary, it flows through Imperial County,
where it is augmented by more agricultural drainage, to the Salton Sea which is also located in Imperial County. 
In addition to agricultural drainage and domestic sewage, industrial wastewater reaches the New River in Mexico,
either via discharge to the sewer system or direct discharge to the River. Mexican law requires that industries treat
their waste, prior to discharge, to minimize impacts to the sewer system and to receiving waters. However, monitoring
data from both the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), the binational commission responsible for
border sanitation issues, and the CRWQCB have indicated the significant presence of industrial waste in the River.
Studies by CRWQCB, throughout the 1980's consistently found trace organics and trace metals in fish, water, and sediment
samples. Reports describe the River as very discolored, often with a foam layer, and not swimmable or fishable. CRWQCB
continued to monitor the River from 1990-1993. These monitoring data and visual observations show the flow
crossing the international boundary has generally been less than in the previous decade, observations of foam are
less frequent, but trace organics and metals are still detected, and the River at the international boundary is still
not considered fishable or swimmable. 
Pesticide runoff from Mexico into the New River is not well documented, although the petition implies that this is
a problem. CRWCQB monitoring data indicate that although some DDT, DDT breakdown products, and toxaphene are emanating
via the New River flow from Mexico, the primary contribution originates from normal agricultural practices within
the Imperial Valley. Although no longer used in Imperial Valley, DDT, toxaphene, and possibly other pesticide residues
remain on cropland from former years of usage and enter drainageways, including the New River, via tailwater runoff
during cropland irrigation. Due to historical use of DDT and toxaphene, this phenomenon is common throughout the
southwestern U.S. 
Both the U.S. and Mexican governments have recognized the seriousness of the contamination problem of the New River,
as evidenced by the Integrated Environmental Plan for the Mexican-U.S. Border Area which was released in 1992. The
IBWC, with assistance from EPA, the California State Water Resource Control Board, and the CRWQCB, have negotiated
binational agreements to address the New River problem. Although some steps have been taken, the problem of partially
treated and untreated wastewater in the New River continues to exist. 
All references for the information contained in this Unit (II.B.) can be found in the administrative record under
the following heading, ``Memorandum on References for the Description of the New River Problem.'' 


III. EPA Analysis of Approaches to Obtaining Information on Condition of the New River 


EPA acknowledges that the New River appears to have serious pollution problems that have resulted from pollution
coming across the border from Mexico and from within Imperial County, California. EPA recognizes that it is important
to continue to work with Mexico to try to resolve border pollution problems as well as continuing to work with the State
of California and Imperial County to resolve pollution problems on the U.S. side of the border. As demonstrated in
the EPA activities described below, EPA considers clean-up of the New River a high priority and is pursuing solutions
to the problem domestically as well as internationally. 
EPA believes that additional monitoring of the New River is necessary to adequately characterize the chemical contamination
in the River, and that obtaining such information is an important step in addressing New River pollution. EPA does
not believe that initiating a section 4 test rule under TSCA is the best or most expeditious way to obtain the information
necessary to characterize the chemical contamination in the River. First, it could take EPA several years to initiate
and complete a test rule, and the complex legal and policy issues involved in this rulemaking could further delay the
process. Consequently EPA would not receive the monitoring information for several years which would result in a
large gap in the monitoring data available to the Agency on the condition of the New River. Second, if monitoring is
delayed because it must occur through implementation of a test rule, EPA would not be able to track the planned improvements
in the Mexicali treatment facilities or identify possible currently unknown risks that immediate monitoring would
enable the Agency to identify. Finally, a test rule may not cover all of the parameters of concern to the petitioner
because of the limited scope of TSCA. For instance, EPA may not be able to require testing for E. coli, where it may be
difficult to identify manufacturers, importers, and/or processors who would be subject to a rule. 
Consequently, EPA will fund work with the CRWQCB to develop the monitoring data that, along with other currently available
information, will allow the Agency to determine with a reasonable level of confidence the identities and amounts
of chemical pollutants in the New River and whether additional testing is necessary. The petitioner submitted a monitoring
proposal developed by the CRWQCB, similar to monitoring being considered by EPA. EPA will work with the CRWQCB to ensure
that the monitoring proposal covers the parameters of concern to EPA, the CRWQCB, and the petitioner. Once the monitoring
information is available, EPA, in conjunction with ATSDR, will determine what further steps are necessary and appropriate
to address the concerns about the New River raised by the petitioner. 
Because the additional monitoring sought by the petitioner is available more expeditiously through other mechanisms,
the Agency has concluded that it is unnecessary at this time to initiate a section 4 test rule as requested by Imperial
County. The potential risks that might be posed by the pollution in the New River merit a more expeditious response
than would be possible by initiating a regulatory proceeding as requested by the petitioner. 
With regard to the petitioner's request to impose testing to evaluate the ecological and health risks of the River
pollutants, the Agency has decided that it is not currently in a position to conclude that the requisite section 4 criteria
have been met. This is true even for the pollutants identified in the petition or in existing monitoring data. Much
of the available information is several years old, and may not reflect a current profile of the River and its pollutants.
In addition, much of the previous sampling was conducted throughout the length of the River, and as a result, the Agency
cannot definitively determine the identity and extent of any pollutants entering the River from Mexico. Also, certain
kinds of information that would be valuable to the Agency's assessment (e.g., sediment contamination levels) are
either missing or very limited. EPA believes it will be better able to evaluate whether it is necessary and appropriate
to promulgate a section 4 test rule for ecological and health effects testing after the Agency has received and evaluated
up-to-date monitoring information on the identities, levels, and environmental partitioning of pollutants in
the River. Moreover, EPA will be better able to coordinate with ATSDR on data needs for any health assessment it conducts
once the Agency has a clearer picture of the condition of the New River--a picture that will be greatly enhanced by the
additional monitoring data from the EPA-initiated tests. In the meantime, EPA will work with ATSDR to evaluate available
health and ecological effects data to determine whether there are data gaps which need to be filled. 
In summary, the Agency recognizes that the New River may be a significant source of human exposure to an unquantified
mixture of industrial and chemical pollutants. Moreover, EPA shares Imperial County's concerns and agrees that
efforts to better characterize the pollutants in the River, and their potential health effects should be continued
and expanded. EPA believes it is prudent to minimize human exposure to these chemicals where reasonable, and has initiated
or will initiate in the near future, actions that will significantly further this goal. Finally, as a matter of policy,
the Agency believes that efforts on the part of domestic and foreign manufacturers to reduce and pretreat their industrial
discharge should be strongly encouraged. 

IV. Specific Actions to Address the New River Problem 


The actions that follow listed under Units A., B., and C. are not actions contemplated as a result of EPA receiving the
petition. They are specific actions planned by EPA through the 1983 La Paz binational workgroup structure and by EPA
unilaterally through its program offices. 


A. Monitoring and Other Testing 


EPA will provide financial assistance to the CRWQCB, by the fall of 1994, to implement their monitoring proposal for
the New River watershed. This monitoring proposal was submitted to EPA as part of the petition, and was submitted to
EPA's Region 9 office by CRWQCB prior to receipt of the petition. The petitioner has indicated that the CRWQCB monitoring
proposal is along the lines contemplated by the petitioner. Prior to funding, EPA and the CRWQCB will verify that the
comprehensive monitoring study incorporates the parameters of concern mentioned in the petition, including pesticides.

The U.S. and Mexico will discuss a proposed program for monitoring contaminants of domestic, industrial, and agricultural
origin in the Colorado River for implementation in 1994. 
EPA will provide financial assistance for a study of the New River that addresses organic chemical contamination
of the New River as it flows to the Salton Sea using monitoring data and water quality modelling to determine the fate
of organic pollutants in the River. 
EPA will coordinate with ATSDR as they conduct any activities to assess the New River. EPA will work to provide, collect,
or develop additional necessary information, such as exposure or hazard information, to determine the health and
environmental risks from the New River. In the event ATSDR decides not to undertake any action in response to the CERCLA
104 petition it has received, EPA will continue to independently assess the hazards and risks associated with the
New River. 


B. Wastewater Treatment 


EPA is pursuing specific authorization for Border-area projects from the ``Hardship Communities'' funds set aside
in EPA's FY 94 appropriation, which will include funding for the U.S. share of costs to start the New River project described
in the IBWC's Minute 288. EPA will also explore additional funding mechanisms, such as the Border Environment Cooperation
Commission (BECC) and the North American Development Bank (NADBank), which are currently under development in both
the U.S. and Mexican financial communities. 
The U.S. section of the IBWC has responded to Mexico's submittal of the proposed wastewater treatment facilities
it plans to construct. The U.S. section has requested that Mexico submit a more detailed facility plan on projects
that include funding by the U.S. 
The U.S. and Mexico, in accordance with IBWC Minute 288, will undertake the following actions: Review and approve
the specific projects; complete final design of the Mexicali II wastewater treatment plant; define the terms of financial
participation for the U.S.; and agree on arrangements for the IBWC to design, construct, operate, and maintain the
system. 
EPA and the State of California have offered and provided technical assistance to IBWC and to Mexico in planning and
designing the wastewater collection and treatment facilities for Mexicali. EPA will continue to offer similar assistance.

EPA is designing an industrial wastewater pretreatment training course for Mexican officials. This pilot training
course will be taught in the Nogales, Sonora, area. Efforts will be made to subsequently target the training in Mexicali.
EPA will also encourage those Mexican officials who attend the course in Nogales to share their knowledge with State
of Baja California and City of Mexicali officials. 


C. Pesticides 


EPA has been informed that the CRWQCB has requested that the Imperial Irrigation District (IID) put together a list
of Best Management Practices (BMP) for the control of agricultural pollutants. The IID has responded with a letter
which describes their plan for developing BMP and a Drain Water Quality Improvement Plan by January 1996. CRWQCB will
work with the County to implement these plans. 
EPA will provide bilingual training and outreach programs on border pesticide-related issues. This training will
be designed to promote the safe and appropriate use of pesticides in order to prevent future pesticide contamination
in these areas. Funds will be provided to and utilized by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation and the
Texas Department of Agriculture to develop and conduct bilingual pesticide training for pesticide applicators
and outreach to the affected border communities along the Imperial Valley-Mexicali and the Lower Rio Grande Valley
(Texas-Tamaulipas) border areas. 


D. Information Collection 


EPA has taken three interim actions to collect information on the nature of the pollutants: Sending a letter to the
U.S. section of the IBWC on January 18, 1994, to ask them to request information from the Mexican section of the IBWC;
sending a letter to Mexico's Secretariat for Social Development (SEDESOL) on January 25, 1994; and issuing a 

Federal Register

 Notice on January 26, 1994 (59 FR 3687). The U.S. section of the IBWC has requested information from the Mexican section
of the IBWC. 
In the letters and the 

Federal Register

 Notice, EPA requested any information Mexican authorities and the public may have regarding New River pollution.
In the letters to the IBWC and SEDESOL, EPA also proposed contacting U.S. parent companies of maquiladoras operating
in Mexicali and requesting information on releases to the New River. A maquiladora is a foreign owned industry operating
in Mexico which can import raw materials into Mexico without tariffs and must export all products, including hazardous
waste generated, back to the country of origin. If Mexico agrees that this action is appropriate, EPA will contact
the companies and provide any information received to ATSDR or other appropriate parties. EPA will do the same with
any information received from the IBWC or in response to the 

Federal Register

 Notice. 


E. California Action 


EPA has been informed that the State of California has requested that California-based parent companies of maquiladoras
located along the California/Mexico border voluntarily provide Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) reports for those
facilities. The California Environmental Protection Agency has agreed to provide EPA with copies of those reports
and EPA will use those data, to the extent they can be verified, to determine possible pollutants entering the New River.



F. Additional Action 


Notwithstanding the Agency's response to this petition, EPA may decide additional action is necessary, under TSCA
or other Federal laws, to address the apparent pollution problems in the New River. EPA will make this decision by evaluating
the results of any ATSDR activities, through review of the monitoring data or any other data gathered through EPA activities,
and through review of the issues raised in a second TSCA section 21 petition on the New River that EPA received on February
23, 1994. This petition was submitted by the Environmental Health Coalition, the Comite Ciudadano Pro Restauracion
del Canon del Padre y Servicios Comunitarios, and the Southwest Network for Environmental and Economic Justice.
This new petition builds upon the Imperial County petition and requests additional actions by EPA. See Unit VIII of
this Notice for more information on this second petition. 


V. Environmental Justice 


To the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, EPA will ensure that environmental justice concerns are
considered in any decision to take additional action under TSCA or other Federal laws, to address the apparent pollution
problems in the New River. EPA will also ensure that any action taken with respect to the New River is consistent with
the directives embodied in President Clinton's February 11, 1994 Environmental Justice Executive Order. 


VI. North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation 


The petitioner requested EPA to pursue available remedies under the NAFTA to address the issue of pollution entering
Imperial County from Mexico via the New River. The NAFTA-related approaches available to Mexico and the United States
for dealing with transboundary pollution are provided by the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation
and the U.S.-Mexico agreement establishing the BECC and the NADBank, rather than the NAFTA itself. 
EPA and other agencies of the U.S. Government have just begun the process of implementing the North American Agreement
on Environmental Cooperation. Many provisions of the Agreement under which the U.S. Government could potentially
take action in an effort to improve the water quality of the New River as it enters the United States from Mexico are of
limited utility at the present time because they require the participation of institutions that are not yet fully
established, such as the Secretariate and the Council of Ministers acting within the North American Commission on
Environmental Cooperation. 
In addition, several of the provisions of the Agreement relating to transboundary pollution are linked to the date
on which the Agreement entered into force _ January 1, 1994. In particular, action under Articles 22 through 36 of the
Agreement relating to allegations by one Party of another Party's ``persistent pattern of non-enforcement'' of
environmental law, is limited at the present time because the term ``persistent pattern'' is defined by Article 45
of the Agreement as ``a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction beginning after the date of entry into force
of [the] Agreement.'' Therefore, it would be extremely difficult if not impossible for the U.S. Government to demonstrate
a persistent pattern of nonenforcement under the Agreement with respect to pollution of the New River in Mexico because
any allegations would be limited to events since January 1, 1994. 
Given the current limitations on action under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation, other
cooperative environmental agreements between the U.S. and Mexico may be more useful to address expeditiously pollution
of the New River. Accordingly, EPA, as the U.S. National Coordinator under the 1983 U.S.-Mexico Agreement of Cooperation
for the Protection and Improvement of the Environment in the Border Area (the ``La Paz Agreement''), has requested
from the Mexican Government any information that it may have relating to pollution of the New River in Mexico from chemical
substances or mixtures. A similar request has been made of the Mexican section of the IBWC by the U.S. section of the
IBWC. EPA has also determined that the La Paz Agreement, in conjunction with domestic statutes, would provide sufficient
legal authority to undertake testing of the New River for chemical and other pollutants on both sides of the border,
in cooperation with the Government of Mexico. 
However, a remedy may be available to the petitioner (as opposed to the U.S. Government acting in behalf of the petitioner)
under Article 6 of the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation. Under that Article, the petitioner
can request Mexico to investigate possible violations of Mexico's environmental law that may be resulting in contamination
of the New River. Mexico, as the requested Party, must give such requests ``due consideration in accordance with law.''


VII. Public Record 


EPA has established a public record of those documents the Agency considered in reviewing this petition. The record
consists of documents located in the file designated by Docket Number OPPTS-211035A and Administrative Record
Number 2194001, located at the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC). This Docket is available for inspection
from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays, in TSCA NCIC, Rm. E-G102, 401 M St., SW.,
Washington, DC 20460. The public record consists of all documents in the OPPTS-211035A file and all documents cited
in the documents in that file. 


VIII. New TSCA Section 21 Petition 


On February 23, 1994, EPA received a second TSCA section 21 petition on the New River. This petition was submitted by
the Environmental Health Coalition, the Comite Ciudadano Pro Restauracion del Canon del Padre y Servicios Comunitarios,
and the Southwest Network for Environmental and Economic Justice. This second petition reasserts and incorporates
by reference the facts alleged in the Imperial County Board of Supervisors petition, particularly the introduction,
and sections III and IV. EPA will address all of the issues raised in the new petition by May 24, 1994. EPA will consider
the actions described in this petition response, as well as the need for expanded action by EPA, in the response to the
second petition.

<DOCTITLE>Certain Chemicals; Approval of a Test Marketing Exemption</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces EPA's approval of an application for test marketing exemption (TME) under section 5(h)(1)
of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and 40 CFR 720.38. EPA has designated this application as TME-94-7.
The test marketing conditions are described below.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 5(h)(1) of TSCA authorizes EPA to exempt persons from premanufacture notification (PMN) requirements and
permit them to manufacture or import new chemical substances for test marketing purposes if the Agency finds that
the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of the substances for test marketing purposes
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. EPA may impose restrictions on
test marketing activities and may modify or revoke a test marketing exemption upon receipt of new information which
casts significant doubt on its finding that the test marketing activity will not present an unreasonable risk of injury.


EPA hereby approves TME-94-7. EPA has determined that test marketing of the new chemical substance described
below, under the conditions set out in the TME application, and for the time period and restrictions specified below,
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. Production volume, use, and the
number of customers must not exceed that specified in the application. All other conditions and restrictions described
in the application and in this notice must be met.
Inadvertently the notice of receipt of the application was not published. Therefore, an opportunity to submit comments
is being offered at this time. The complete nonconfidential document is available in the TSCA nonconfidential information
center (NCIC), Rm. ETG-102 at the above address between 12:00 noon and 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding
legal holidays. EPA may modify or revoke the test marketing exemption if comments are received which cast significant
doubt on its finding that the test marketing activities will not present an unreasonable risk of injury.
The following additional restrictions apply to TME-94-7. A bill of lading accompanying each shipment
must state that the use of the substance is restricted to that approved in the TME. In addition, the applicant shall
maintain the following records until 5 years after the date they are created, and shall make them available for inspection
or copying in accordance with section 11 of TSCA:
1.  Records of the quantity of the TME substance produced and the date of manufacture.
2.  Records of dates of the shipments to each customer and the quantities supplied in each shipment.
3.  Copies of the bill of lading that accompanies each shipment of the TME substance.



TME-94-7

Interested persons may express their views in writing on the question whether consummation of the proposal can ``reasonably
be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency,
that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,
conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' Any request for a hearing on this question must be accompanied
by a statement of the reasons a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Assessment of Medical Technology </DOCTITLE>


The Agency for Heath Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), through the Office of Health Technology Assessment (OHTA),
announces that it is initiating an assessment of the safety and effectiveness of isolated pancreas transplants in
the treatment of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. This assessment will also be concerned with the specific criteria
for the selection of patients for pancreas transplantation and the cost effectiveness of the technology. 
The assessment consists of a synthesis of information found in the published literature and obtained from appropriate
organizations in the private sector and from Public Health Service (PHS) agencies and others in the Federal Government.
AHCPR assessments are conducted in accordance with sections 904(b) and (d) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 299a-2(b)
and (d)). Based on the assessment, a recommendation will be formulated to assist the Office of Civilian Health and
Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (OCHAMPUS) in establishing CHAMPUS coverage policy. The information
being sought by this notice is a review and evaluation of past, current, and planned research related to this technology,
as well as a bibliography of published, controlled clinical trials and other well-designed clinical studies. Information
related to the characteristics of the patient population most likely to benefit from pancreas transplantation,
as well as information on the clinical acceptability, effectiveness, and the extent of use of this technology is also
being sought. 
The AHCPR is interested in receiving information which would help in the evaluation or review of the technology as
described above. To enable the interested scientific community to evaluate the information included in the assessment,
AHCPR will discuss in the assessment only those data and analyses for which a source(s) can be cited. Respondents are
therefore encouraged to include with their submissions a written consent permitting AHCPR to cite the sources of
the data and comments provided. Otherwise, in accordance with the confidentiality statute governing information
collected by AHCPR, 42 U.S.C. 299a-1(c), no information received will be published or disclosed which could
identify an individual or entity described in the information, or could identify an entity or individual supplying
the information. 
Any person or group wishing to provide AHCPR with information relevant to this assessment should do so in writing no
later than June 21, 1994 to the Office of Health Technology Assessment at the address below.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability of funds. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) 
announces the availability of fiscal year 1994 funds for an open 
competition for Healthy Start Initiative_Special Projects grants 
(HSI-SP). The purpose of the HSI-SP is to expand the Healthy 
Start Initiative to include community-based programs that will 
significantly reduce infant mortality through the development and 
implementation of special targeted interventions. Competition is 
open to rural and urban community-based programs that are 
developing and implementing innovative strategies for the purpose 
of reducing infant mortality. Awards will be made by the Maternal 
and Child Health Bureau under the program authority of Section 301 
of the Public Health Service Act. Funds for the HSI-SP Grants 
were appropriated under Public Law 103-112. Up to $4,000,000 is 
available for four projects at up to $1,000,000 per year, 
renewable for a second year, subject to funds availability.



The PHS is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease 
prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS led national 
activity for setting priority areas. The HSI-SP grant program will 
directly address the Healthy People 2000 objectives related to 
maternal and infant health, and especially health status objective 
14.1, to reduce the infant mortality rate to no more than 7 per 
1000 live births. Potential applicants may obtain a copy of 
Healthy People 2000 (Full Report: Stock No. 017-001-00474-0) or 
Healthy People 2000 (Summary Report: Stock No. 017-001-00473-1) 
through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing 
Office, Washington, DC 20402-9325 (telephone 202 783-3238). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Program Background and Objectives 



The specific goal of the Healthy Start Initiative_Special Projects 
is to significantly reduce in two years high infant mortality 
rates in rural or urban designated project areas through 
accelerated implemention of innovative strategies. Therefore, it 
is expected that the programs will incorporate the principles of 
innovation, community commitment, and personal responsibility and, 
in doing so, improve access to care. To accomplish this goal, 
prospective applicants must have an established consortium which 
has a minimum of two years experience with planning and 
implementation of infant mortality strategies, including an 
extensive public information campaign. In addition, applicants 
must have the capacity and willingness to develop a management 
information system to track project interventions and to 
participate in an extensive national evaluation with currently 
funded Healthy Start projects. 

Finally, Federal Healthy Start Initiative_Special Projects grant 
funds may only be used to supplement, and not to supplant or 
replace, either existing State or local funds, or State or local 
funds that would otherwise be made available to the project. 



Eligible Project Areas 



Areas targeted under the Healthy Start Initiative_Special 
Projects are those in which infant mortality problems are most 
severe, resources can be concentrated, implementation is 
manageable, and progress can be measured. A project area is 
defined as one which is composed of one or more contiguous 
geographic areas or neighborhoods for which improvements have been 
planned and are being implemented with the principles of: 
Innovation, community commitment and involvement, increased 
access, service integration, and personal responsibility. Project 
areas must represent a reasonable and logical catchment area in 
which a consortium for delivering services is already operational, 
and for which infant mortality reduction strategies are already 
designed.

<PARENT> FR940323-2-00066 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

To be eligible for funding under the HSI-SP, a project area must 
have at least 50 but no more than 200 infant deaths per year, and 
must have an average infant mortality rate of at least 14.5 deaths 
per 1000 live births, from vital statistics data, for the 3-year 
period 1988-1990. The minimum of fifty infant deaths per year is 
meant to assure selection of communities with a sufficient 
magnitude of the problem to justify concentrating resources to 
reduce infant mortality. The upper limit of 200 infant deaths per 
year is meant to assure projects of a manageable size. The 
eligibility thresholds are identical for urban and rural areas. 



Eligible Applicants 



Eligible applicants are public or nonprofit private organizations, 
and tribal organizations, applying on behalf of an existing 
community-based consortium. Applications must be approved by the 
chief elected official of the city or county in which the project 
area is located (or, if there is more than one such entity, the 
chief elected officials acting in concert), or by the tribal 
leadership of the tribe or tribal organization which has 
jurisdiction over the project area. No more than one application 
may be made for a given project area. 

The 15 entities that are currently receiving Healthy Start 
Initiative funds are not eligible for Special Project grants. 



Review Criteria 



Applications for grants will be reviewed and evaluated according 
to the following criteria: 

1. Existence of an operational consortium that includes 
appropriate representation of project area providers and 
consumers. 

2. The effectiveness of the consortium's activities over the 
previous two years, as demonstrated by implemented strategies to 
reduce infant mortality. 

3. The extent to which the applicant's proposed activities 
appear feasible and likely to achieve the project's goals and 
objectives within the two year project period. 

4. Demonstrated ability to maximize and coordinate existing 
resources and acquire additional resources.

Preference and Priorities



Funding preference will be given to an approved applicant who: (1) Has an operational infant mortality initiative
of at least two years duration; (2) has a strong established community-based consortium that has identified and begun
to address local needs and priorities; and (3) has demonstrated the ability to generate private sector funding. Within
any group of preferred applicants, priority will be given to applicants from States that do not already have a funded
Healthy Start Initiative grant. Because of time constraints, public comments on the funding preference and the funding
priority are not being solicited.



Allowable Costs



The Health Resources and Services Administration will support reasonable and necessary costs of Healthy Start Initiative
Special Project grants within the scope of approved activities. Allowable costs may include salaries, equipment
and supplies, travel, contractual, consultants, and others, as well as indirect costs. HRSA adheres to administrative
standards reflected in the Code of Federal Regulations 45 CFR part 92 and 45 CFR part 74. All other sources of funding
to support this project must be accurately reflected in the applicant's budget.



Reporting Requirement



A successful applicant under this notice will submit reports in accordance with the provisions of the general regulations
which apply under 45 CFR part 74, subpart J, Monitoring and Reporting of Program Performance, with the exception of
State and local governments, to which 45 CFR part 92, subpart C reporting requirements will apply. Financial reporting
will be required in accordance with 45 CFR part 74, subpart H, with the exception of State and local governments, to
which 45 CFR 92.20 will apply.



Public Health System Reporting Requirements



This program is subject to the Public Health System Reporting Requirements (approved under OMB No. 0937-0195).
Under these requirements, community-based nongovernmental applicants must prepare and submit a Public Health
System Impact Statement (PHSIS). The PHSIS is intended to provide information to State and local health officials
to keep them apprised of proposed health services grant applications submitted by community-based nongovernmental
organizations within their jurisdictions. Community-based non-governmental applicants are required to submit
the following information to the head of the appropriate State and local health agencies in the area(s) to be impacted
no later than the Federal application receipt due date: (a) A copy of the face page of the application (SF 424).

(b) A summary of the project (PHSIS), not to exceed one page, which provides: (1) A description of the population to
be served.

(2) A summary of the services to be provided.

(3) A description of the coordination planned with the appropriate State or local health agencies.



Executive Order 12372



This program has been determined to be a program which is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 concerning
intergovernmental review of Federal programs by appropriate health planning agencies, as implemented by 45 CFR
part 100. Executive Order 12372 allows States the option of setting up a system for reviewing applications from within
their States for assistance under certain Federal programs. The application packages to be made available under
this notice will contain a listing of States which have chosen to set up such a review system and will provide a single
point of contact (SPOC) in the States for review. Applicants (other than federally-recognized Indian tribal governments)
should contact their State SPOCs as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any
necessary instructions on the State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant is
advised to contact the SPOC of each affected State. The due date for State process recommendations is 60 days after
the application deadline for new and competing awards. The granting agency does not guarantee to ``accommodate or
explain'' for State process recommendations it receives after that date.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB), HRSA, announces that fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds are available for grants
and cooperative agreements for the following activities: Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Special Projects of Regional
and National Significance (SPRANS), including special MCH improvement projects which contribute to the health
of mothers, children, and children with special health care needs (CSHCN); MCH research and training; and genetic
disease testing, counseling and information services. Awards will be made under the program authority of section
502(a) of the Social Security Act, the MCH Federal Set-Aside Program.



Of the approximately $101.4 million available for SPRANS activities in FY 1994, about $29.6 million will be available
to support approximately 146 new and competing renewal projects at an average of $202,700 per award for one year under
the MCH SPRANS Federal Set-Aside Program. The remaining funds will be used to support continuation of existing SPRANS
activities. The actual amounts available for awards and their allocation may vary, depending on unanticipated program
requirements and the volume and quality of applications. Awards are made for grant periods which generally run from
1 up to 5 years in duration. Funds for the MCH Federal Set-Aside Program are appropriated by Public Law 103-112.
The regulation implementing the Federal Set-Aside Program was published in the March 5, 1986, issue of the 

Federal Register

1. Program Background and Objectives 



Under Section 502 of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1989, 12.75
percent of amounts appropriated for the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant in excess of $600 million are
set aside by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) for special Community Integrated Service Systems projects
under Section 501(a)(3) of the Act. Of the remainder of the total appropriation, 15 percent of the funds are to be retained
by the Secretary to support (through grants, contracts, or otherwise) special projects of regional and national
significance, research, and training with respect to maternal and child health and children with special health
care needs (including early intervention training and services development); for genetic disease testing, counseling,
and information development and dissemination programs; for grants (including funding for comprehensive hemophilia
diagnostic treatment centers) relating to hemophilia without regard to age; and for the screening of newborns for
sickle cell anemia, and other genetic disorders and follow-up services. The MCH SPRANS set-aside was established
in 1981. Support for projects covered by this announcement will come from the SPRANS set-aside. 



2. Special Concerns 



In its administration of the MCH Services Block Grant, the MCHB places special emphasis on improving service delivery
to women and children from culturally identifiable populations who have been disproportionately affected by barriers
to accessible care. This means that SPRANS projects are expected to serve and appropriately involve in project activities
members of ethnoculturally distinct groups, unless there are compelling programmatic or other justifications
for not doing so. The MCHB
s intent is to ensure that project outcomes are of benefit to culturally distinct populations and to ensure that the
broadest possible representation of culturally distinct and historically underserved groups is supported through
programs and projects sponsored by the MCHB.

Projects supported under SPRANS are expected to be part of community-wide, comprehensive initiatives, to reflect
appropriate coordination of primary care and public health activities, and to target HRSA resources effectively
to fill gaps in the Nation's health system for at-risk mothers and children. This applies especially to projects in
the 15 communities in the Nation which have received grants from HRSA under the Healthy Start initiative. Grantees
in these communities providing services related to activities of a Healthy Start program are expected to coordinate
their projects with the Healthy Start program efforts. Healthy Start communities include: Aberdeen Area Indian
Nations, NE/ND/SD; Baltimore, MD; Birmingham, AL; Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; Cleveland, OH; Detroit, MI; Lake County,
IN; New Orleans, LA; New York, NY; Oakland, CA; Philadelphia, PA; Pittsburgh, PA; PeeDee Region, SC; Washington,
DC. 



3. Project Review and Funding 



The Secretary will review applications for funds under the specific project categories in section 4 below as competing
applications and will fund those which, in the Secretary's judgement, are consistent with the statutory mandate,
with special emphasis on improving service delivery to women and children from culturally distinct populations;
and which best address achievement of the Healthy People 2000 objectives related to maternal, infant, child and adolescent
health and service systems for children at risk of chronic and disabling conditions, and otherwise best promote improvements
in maternal and child health. 



3.1 Criteria for Review 



The following criteria are used, as pertinent, to review and evaluate applications for awards under all SPRANS grants
and cooperative agreement project categories announced in this notice. Further guidance in this regard is supplied
in application guidance materials, which may specify variations in these criteria. 




_The quality of the project plan or methodology. 

_The need for the services, research, training or technical assistance. 

_The cost-effectiveness of the proposed project relative to the number of persons proposed to be benefitted, served
or trained, considering, where relevant, any special circumstances associated with providing care or training
in various areas. 

_The extent to which the project will contribute to the advancement of MCH and/or CSHCN services. 

_The extent to which rapid and effective use of grant funds will be made by the project. 

_The effectiveness of procedures to collect the cost of care and service from third-party payment sources (including
government agencies) which are authorized or under legal obligation to make such payment for any service (including
diagnostic, preventive and treatment services). 

_The extent to which the project will be integrated with the administration of the Maternal and Child Health Services
block grants, State primary care plans, public health, and prevention programs, and other related programs in the
respective State(s). 

_The soundness of the project's management, considering the qualifications of the staff of the proposed project
and the applicant's facilities and resources. 

_The extent to which the project gives special emphasis to improving service delivery to women and children from culturally
identifiable populations who have been disproportionately affected by barriers to accessible care and ensures
that members of culturally distinct groups are appropriately represented in the activities of approved grants and
cooperative agreements. 

_In communities with Healthy Start projects, a commitment by applicants whose projects are related to activities
of a Healthy Start program to coordinate their projects with Healthy Start program efforts. 

_The strength of the project's plans for evaluation. 

_The extent to which the application is responsive to special concerns and program priorities specified in this notice.




3.2 Funding of Approved Applications 



Final funding decisions for SPRANS grants are the responsibility of the Director, MCHB. In considering scores for
the ranking of approved applications for funding, preferences may be exercised for groups of applications, e.g.,
competing continuations may be funded ahead of new projects. Within any category of approved projects, the score
of an individual project may be favorably adjusted if the project addresses specific priorities identified in this
notice. In addition, special consideration in assigning scores may be given by reviewers to individual applications
that address areas identified in this notice as special concerns.

4.1.4.5. Field-Initiated Projects



 

Application Deadlines: 

April 1 and August 15, 1994. 

 

Purpose: 

To support projects of high priority that are so time 
sensitive that they cannot be delayed for submission against 
normal MCHB category deadlines. Applications must be preceded by 
contact with an appropriate program official to justify why the 
proposed project is so time sensitive that the application cannot 
be submitted against normal MCHB category deadlines. Wherever 
possible, prospective applicants are urged to submit their 
proposals in other announced categories. Applications submitted 
in this category may not be under consideration under any other 
category during FY 1994. Research applications are not 
supportable under this sub-category. The Director of MCHB will be 
the final arbiter of the acceptability of special project 
applications for review. Prospective applicants are urged to make 
contact with a program official listed below well in advance of 
submitting a formal application, so that the work of proposal 
development can be avoided if the proposed project is judged as 
inappropriate for submission under this category. 
 

Grants/Amounts: 

About $500,000 will be available to support up 
to 10 new or competing renewal field-initiated projects. Project 
periods are up to 5 years. 

 

Contact: 

Potential applicants for field-initiated grants should 
contact: Chief, Grants Management Branch, or the MCHB Division 
Director responsible for the area of project interest: Director, 
Division of Maternal, Infant, Child and Adolescent Health, 
telephone: 301 443-2251; Director, Division of Services for 
CSHCN, telephone: 301 443-2350; or Director, Division of Systems, 
Education, and Science, telephone: 301 443-2340. The address for 
each of them is: Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Health 
Resources and Services Administration, Parklawn Building, 5600 
Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857. 



4.2. Cooperative Agreements 



A cooperative agreement will be awarded in one category: Children 
with Special Health Care Needs Child and Adolescent Service System 
Program (CASSP). It is anticipated that substantive Federal 
programmatic involvement will be required in this cooperative 
agreement. Federal involvement may include planning, guidance, 
coordination and participation in programmatic activities. 
Periodic meetings, conferences, and/or communications with the 
award recipient are held to review mutually agreed upon goals and 
objectives and to assess progress. Additional details on the 
degree of Federal programmatic involvement will be included in the 
application guidance for this cooperative agreement.

Purpose:

 To support the development of a network of community-based, family-focused, and culturally competent systems of
care 
for children with special health care needs. This network will: 
(1) Link the public and private sectors within the context of 
current efforts to reform the Nation's health and mental health 
care delivery systems and related reform efforts in education, 
child welfare, and juvenile justice; (2) within the broader 
context, establish a Child and Adolescent Service System Program 
(CASSP) Technical Assistance Center to focus on the needs of 
children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbances and 
their families and to address the psychosocial needs of all 
children with special health care needs and their families; and 
(3) work with critical State and local agencies serving children 
and Native American reservations to ensure support for integrated 
service delivery systems for children at all levels. 

This cooperative agreement will be jointly funded by the MCHB and 
the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), SAMHSA. Preference 
for funding will be given to public or private non-profit 
organizations with prior experience in the areas described above, 
especially those which can show: (1) The extent to which technical 
assistance efforts have focused on the needs of children and 
adolescents with serious emotional disorders; and (2) the degree 
to which prior networking efforts have been designed to link 
together health, mental health, education and other human services 
to address the psychosocial needs of all children with special 
health care needs and their families. 

 

Amount: 

Up to $1.5 million per year will be available to 
support one project. The award will be made for a project period 
of up to 5 years. 
 

Contact: 

For programmatic or technical information, contact John 
Shwab, telephone: 301 443-2370. 

The categories, priorities, special considerations and preferences 
described above are not being proposed for public comment this 
year. In July 1993, following publication of the Department's 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to revise the MCH special project 
grant regulations at 42 CFR 51a, the public was invited for a 60-day period to submit comments regarding all aspects
of the SPRANS 
application and review process. Public comments regarding SPRANS 
priorities received during the comment period were considered in 
developing this announcement. In responding to these comments, 
the Department noted the practical limits on Secretarial 
discretion in establishing SPRANS categories and priorities owing 
to the extensive prescription in both the statute and annual 
Congressional directives. Comments on this SPRANS notice which 
members of the public wish to make are welcome at any time and may 
be submitted to: Director, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, at 
the address listed in the ADDRESS section. Suggestions will be 
considered when priorities are developed for the next 
solicitation. 



5. Eligible Applicants

organization (as defined at 25 U.S.C. 450b), is eligible to apply 
for grants or cooperative agreements for MCHIP demonstration 
project categories. Training grants may be made only to public or 
nonprofit private institutions of higher learning. Research 
grants may be made only to public or nonprofit private 
institutions of higher learning and public or nonprofit private 
agencies and organizations engaged in research in maternal and 
child health or programs for CSHCN. 



6. Public Health System Reporting Requirements

Availability of an Environmental Assessment and Receipt of an Application for an Incidental Take Permit for a Residential
Development in Brevard County, FL 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Ocean Ridge, Ltd., (Applicant) a Florida limited partnership, is seeking an incidental take permit from the Fish
and Wildlife Service (Service) pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(B) 
of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The proposed permit 
would authorize for a period of 10 years the incidental take 
of a threatened species, the Florida scrub jay, 

Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens

, incidental to construction of Ocean Ridge, a development consisting of 29 single family residences and necessary
infrastructure on approximately 9.4 acres (Project). The Project is located along State Road A1A south of the city
of Melbourne, located north of an apartment complex known as The Hamptons, Sections 20 and 21, Township 28S, Range
38E, Brevard County, Florida. 



The Service also announces the availability of an environmental assessment (EA) and habitat conservation plan (HCP)
for the incidental take application. Copies of the EA or HCP may be obtained by making a request to the Regional Office
address below. The Service is soliciting data on 

Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens

 in order to assist in the requirement of the intra-Service consultation. This notice also advises the public that
the Service has made a preliminary determination that issuing 
the incidental take permit is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment
within the meaning of Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended. The Finding
of No Significant Impact is based on information contained in the EA and HCP. The final determination will be made no
sooner than 
30 days from the date of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental
Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR 1506.6). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens

 is geographically isolated from other subspecies of scrub jays found in Mexico and the Western United States. The
scrub jay 
is found almost exclusively in peninsular Florida and is restricted to scrub habitat. The total estimated population
is between 7,000 and 11,000 individuals. Due to habitat loss and degradation throughout the State of Florida, it has
been estimated that the scrub jay population has been reduced by at least half in the last 100 years. The scrub jay survey
provided by the Applicant indicates that two families, one consisting of a mating pair with helpers and the other consisting
of a mating pair without helpers, currently use the site and surrounding suitable habitat areas. The Applicant proposes
to impact a portion of the territories of both scrub jay families. Initial construction of roads and utilities and
subsequent development of individual homesites may therefore result in death of, or injury to, 

Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens

 incidental to the carrying out of these otherwise lawful activities. Habitat alternation associated with property
development may reduce the availability of feeding, shelter, and nesting habitat. 


The EA considers the environmental consequences of three alternatives. The no action alternative may result in some
loss of habitat for 

Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens 

and exposure of the Applicant under Section 9 of the Act. This action is inconsistent with the purposes and intent of
Section 10 of the Act. The delisting of the 

Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens

 as an alternative was rejected as biologically unjustifiable. Modification of the HCP as an alternative was in part
accommodated during the preapplication phase through negotiations between the Applicant and the Service. The proposed
action alternative is issuance of the incidental take permit. This provides for restrictions of construction activity,
purchase of offsite suitable 

Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens

 habitat, the establishment of an endowment fund to manage the purchased habitat, protection of active nesting areas
during construction of the Project, exotic plant removal and control, and provisions for placement of native plant
species within the Project. The HCP also provides a funding mechanism for these mitigation measures.

Fresh Garlic from China 


Determination 


On the basis of the record
 developed in the subject investigation, the Commission determines, pursuant to section 733(a) of the Tariff Act
of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1673b(a)), that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially
injured or threatened with material injury by reason of imports from The People's Republic of China (China) of fresh
garlic, provided for in subheadings 0703.20.00, 0710.80.70, and 0710.80.97 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of
the United States, that are alleged to be sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV). 





Background 



On January 31, 1994, a petition was filed with the Commission and the Department of Commerce by the Fresh Garlic Producers
Association, consisting of the A&D Christopher Ranch, Gilroy, CA; Belridge Packing Co., Wasco, CA; Colusa Produce
Corp., Colusa, CA; Denice & Filice Packing Co., Hollister, CA; El Camino Packing, Gilroy, CA; The Garlic Company,
Shafter, CA; and Vessey and Company, Inc., El Centro, CA, alleging that an industry in the United States is materially
injured and threatened with material injury by reason of LTFV imports of fresh garlic from China. Accordingly, effective
January 31, 1994, the Commission instituted antidumping investigation No. 731-TA-683 (Preliminary).


Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigation and of a public conference to be held in connection therewith
was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington,
DC, and by publishing the notice in the 

Federal Register

 of February 9, 1994 (59 FR 6043). The conference was held in Washington, DC, on February 22, 1994, and all persons who
requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. 

The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on March 17, 1994.
The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2755 (March 1994), entitled ``Fresh Garlic from China:
Investigation No. 731-TA-683 (Preliminary).''

<DOCTITLE>Commission Determination to Apply a Modified Procedure </DOCTITLE>
for Considering Two Petitions for Modification of Exclusion Order

In the Matter of Certain Processes for the Manufacture of Skinless Sausage Casings and Resulting Product.





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. International Trade Commission.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined, pursuant to rule 201.4(b), to
waive in part the interim rules normally applicable to consideration by the Commission of petitions for modification
of an exclusion order, and to follow instead a modified procedure for considering the petitions filed by counsel on
behalf of Viskase Corporation and Teepak, Inc. in the above-captioned investigation.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On January 18, 1994, counsel for Viskase Corporation, successor in interest to complainant in the above-captioned
investigation, filed a petition requesting, 

inter alia, 

modification of the exclusion order issued at the conclusion of the investigation. On February 24, 1994, counsel
for Teepak, Inc., also filed a petition requesting, 

inter alia, 

modification of that exclusion order. Commission interim rule 211.57 sets forth procedures for processing such
petitions. In this investigation, however, the Commission determined to waive in part the application of that interim
rule and instead to apply a revised procedure. The revised procedure is similar to the procedure set forth in proposed
final rule 210.76, published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52830, 52883). Interim rule 211.57 is waived for this investigation to the extent that it
conflicts with the procedure set forth below. 



Commission rule 201.4(b) provides for waiver of rules when in the judgment of the Commission there is good and sufficient
reason therefor. The Commission determined that these criteria are met here. Accordingly, consideration of the
petitions for modification of the exclusion order in this investigation will be according to the following procedure:



1. Any person may file an opposition to the petitions within 21 days of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. 


2. The Commission may thereafter institute a proceeding to modify the exclusion order by publishing notice of the
proceeding in the 

Federal Register

. Such notice will establish deadlines for submissions by interested persons. The Commission may hold a public hearing
and afford interested persons the opportunity to appear and be heard. The Commission may delegate any hearing to the
Chief Administrative Law Judge for designation of a presiding administrative law judge, who shall certify a recommended
determination to the Commission. 


3. After consideration of the petitions, any responses thereto, any information placed on the record at a public hearing
or otherwise, and any recommended determination, the Commission shall take such action as it deems appropriate.



This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1337, 19 U.S.C.
1335), and  201.4(b) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 201.4(b)). Hearing-impaired
persons are advised that information on the matter can be obtained by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal on
202-205-1810.




By order of the Commission.

<DOCTITLE>Lodging of Consent Decree Pursuant to the Toxic Substances Control Act (``TSCA''), 15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. </DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Departmental policy, 28 CFR 50.7, notice is hereby given that a proposed consent decree in 

United States 

v. 

New Waterbury, Ltd., et al., 

Civil Action No. 91CV00688 (WWE), was lodged on March 1, 1994 with the United States District Court for the District
of Connecticut. The consent decree resolves an action based on violations which occurred at the New Waterbury industrial
facility located at 59 Mill Street in Waterbury, Connecticut (``facility''). The facility is approximately 100
buildings on 100 acres in downtown Waterbury, Connecticut and was used for years in the manufacture of brass and copper
products. New Waterbury, Ltd., a real estate development limited partnership, acquired the manufacturing facility
in 1987 from the former Century Brass Products, Inc. 

Settling defendants are storing PCB equipment and drums of PCB waste in a building that does not comply with the structural
requirements for PCB storage areas established by 40 CFR 761.65(b) (it lacks an adequate roof and walls to prevent
contact with rain water, adequate spill containment, and surfaces impervious to PCB penetration). Until the filing
of the complaint settling defendants had not been conducting monthly leak inspections as required by 40 CFR 761.65(c)(5).


The PCB equipment and waste drums have been stored at the facility since before 1987, in violation of 40 CFR 761.65(a).
In addition, settling defendants are operating a commercial PCB storage facility without having applied for and
received Region I approval, in violation of 40 CFR 761.65(d). 

Pursuant to this proposed consent decree, settling defendants will remove and properly dispose of all PCB equipment
and PCB waste by August 15, 1995. Settling defendants will also clean up any spills of PCBs derived from the storage
of PCB equipment and PCB waste. The cost of PCB removal and disposal under the consent decree is estimated at nearly
$500,000. 

Pending proper disposal, settling defendants will provide and maintain adequate temporary storage measures to
prevent and contain PCB leaks and minimize the risks of fire and vandalism, will keep proper records on the stored PCBs,
and will report monthly to EPA. 

The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments
relating to the proposed consent decree. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General for the Environment
and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530, and should refer to

Company. The $1,000,000 to be paid into the Superfund will be paid on behalf of the State of Arkansas and shall constitute
a credit for the State's share of response costs at the Site if, pursuant to CERCLA section 104(c)(3), 42 U.S.C. 9604(c)(3),
the State is required to pay or assure payment of at least 10 percent of the government-conducted remedial action at

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Co.; Northeast Nuclear Energy Co. Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant
Impact


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of 10 CFR 26.21(b) regarding fitness-for-duty (FFD) refresher training to Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company
and Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (the licensees), for the Haddam Neck Plant, located in Middlesex County, Connecticut,
and Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit Nos. 1, 2 and 3, located in New London County, Connecticut.


Environmental Assessment


Identification of Proposed Action


The proposed action would exempt the licensees from the requirements of 10 CFR 26.21(b) regarding FFD refresher training
on a nominal 12-month frequency. By letter dated February 10, 1994, the licensees requested a one-time exemption
from 10 CFR 26.21(b) to allow the licensees to consolidate their response to several training requirements by extending
the time requirement for providing FFD refresher training to approximately 21 months.


The Need for the Proposed Action


The proposed exemption is needed because the licensees perform FFD refresher training as part of a consolidation
of various annual training requirements. While the consolidation of annual training requirements results in substantial
gains in efficiency, it also results in the potential for individuals who would have been scheduled to receive FFD
refresher training during January 1994, to go until October 1994, before receiving this training. In addition, there
will be individuals whose scheduled training interval is extended for shorter durations. However, the 9-month delay
is the most bounding, so an overall extension from 12 to 21 months has been requested by the licensees.
The licensees state in their February 10, 1994, application that they are confident that affected personnel understand
the FFD program and requirements, and that no adverse impact will result from this requested change. Between the four
units, approximately 15 percent of the on-shift personnel will fall outside of the nominal 12-month window. All of
the individuals have received FFD training in the past, and will read and sign a synopsis of the FFD requirements prior
to exceeding the nominal 12-month window. In addition, within each shift, the supervisory personnel will be trained
within the nominal 12-month frequency pursuant to 10 CFR 26.22.


 Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action


The NRC staff evaluation of the proposed exemption from 10 CFR 26.21(b) indicates that the granting of the exemption
will not impair the level of knowledge of personnel involved in the FFD program. Moreover, there will be no changes
in plant operating conditions or associated routine or accidental effluents. Therefore, the Commission concludes
that there are no measurable radiological or nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed
exemption.


Alternatives to the Proposed Action


Since the Commission has concluded that there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed
exemption, any alternatives will either have no environmental impact or have a greater environmental impact. The
principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. This would not reduce the environmental impacts
attributed to this facility and would result in forcing the licensees to separate the FFD refresher training from
other annual training.


Alternative Use of Resources


This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statements
for the Haddam Neck Plant (October 1973), Millstone, Units 1 and 2 (June 1973) and Millstone, Unit 3 (December 1984).


Agencies and Persons Consulted


The Commission's staff consulted with the Connecticut State official regarding the environmental impact of the
proposed action. The State official had no comments.


Finding of No Significant Impact


The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. Based
upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment.
For further details with respect to this action, see the request for exemption dated February 10, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the
local public document room located at the Russell Library, 123 Broad Street, Middletown, Connecticut 06457 for the
Haddam Neck Plant, and the Learning Resource Center, Three Rivers Community-Technical College, Thames Valley Campus,
574 New London Turnpike, Norwich, Connecticut 06360 for the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit Nos. 1, 2, and 3.

 Notice of meeting.







The Licensing Support System Advisory Review Panel (LSSARP) will hold a meeting on April 14 and 15, 1994, at the Yucca
Mountain Site Characterization Project Office, Conference Room 202, 101 Convention Center Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada.
The entire meeting will be open to the public pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Public Law 94-463,
86 Stat. 770-776).

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) established the LSSARP in 1989 to provide advice and recommendations to
the NRC and to the Department of Energy (DOE) on topics, issues, and activities related to the design, development
and operation of an electronic information management system known as the Licensing Support System (LSS). This system
will contain information relevant to the Commission's future licensing proceeding for a geologic repository for
the disposal of high-level radioactive waste. Membership on the Panel consists of representatives of the State of
Nevada, a coalition of effective units of local government in Nevada, the National Congress of American Indians,
a coalition of organizations representing the nuclear industry, DOE, NRC and two other agencies of the Federal government
which have experience with large electronic information management systems. 

The meeting will begin on April 14, 1994 at 9 a.m. and conclude at 5 p.m. If additional time is needed, the meeting will
reconvene at 8:30 a.m. on April 15, 1994 and conclude at approximately Noon. The primary agenda for the meeting will
consist of a presentation by the NRC and continuation of discussion by the Panel of the modified approach for the design
and operation of the LSS which was proposed by the NRC and discussed initially at the Panel's 1993 meeting.

Interested persons may make oral presentations to the Panel or file written statements. Requests for oral presentations
should be made to the contact person listed below as far in advance as practicable so that appropriate arrangements
can be made.

<DOCTITLE>Northeast Nuclear Energy Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
no Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-65, issued to Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (NNECO/the licensee), for operation of the
Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 2, located in New London County, Connecticut.

The proposed change to the Millstone Unit 2 Technical Specifications (TS) would provide a one-time extension of the
surveillance frequency from the required 18-month to the next refueling outage but no later than September 30, 1994,
of the power operated valves in the service water system (TS 4.7.4.4.1.b) and in the boran injection flow path (TS 4.1.2.2.c).
This would extend the surveillance for these valves approximately 5 months.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration (SHC), which is presented below:

The proposed changes do not involve a SHC because the changes would not:




1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.



Technical Specification 4.1.2.2.c



The subject valve in the boron injection flowpath was exercised through a complete cycle on March 7, 1994, during the
performance of SP 2601A. This surveillance verified the valve's operability. However, the performance of this surveillance
did not satisfy literal compliance with Technical Specification 4.1.2.2.c, because it was not performed while the
unit was shutdown. A one-time extension to the surveillance frequency for the subject valve in the boron injection
system does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.



Technical Specification 4.7.4.1.b



Service water valves 2-SW-3.1A and 2-SW-3.1B are normally open and are designed to fail in
the ``as is'' position. The valves do not perform any active safety function (are not considered in any operational
procedure to mitigate the effects of an abnormal event), nor do they provide isolation between the two service water
headers. Their primary function is to isolate the downstream portion of the header for maintenance activities. Increasing
the time interval between performance of surveillance testing 2-SW-3.1A and 2-SW-3.1B does
not involve a significant increase in the probability or the consequences of a previously analyzed accident.

In addition, a review of the maintenance and operational history of the service water system valves did not identify
any previous problems with the ability of the valves to open or close, or to meet any other design requirements.

Therefore, the one-time extension of the surveillance interval does not involve a significant increase in the probability
of consequences of an accident.

2. Create the possibility of new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940323-2-00132 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940323-2-00103 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposed changes do not involve any physical modifications to any equipment, structures, or components, nor
do they involve any changes to any plant operating procedures. The only change is a one-time extension of the surveillance
intervals for one power-operated valve in the boron injection system and two power-operated valves in the service
water system. Thus, the proposed changes do not introduce any new failure modes, and they do not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident.

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed changes to Technical Specifications 4.1.2.2.c and 4.7.4.1.b do not involve any changes to any safety
limits, setpoints, or design margins. Also the proposed changes do not affect any protective boundaries.



Technical Specifications 4.1.2.2.c



The subject value in the boron injection flowpath was exercised through a complete cycle on March 7, 1994. This surveillance
did not satisfy literal compliance with Technical Specification 4.1.2.2.c, because it was not performed while the
unit was shutdown. A one-time extension of the surveillance for the subject valve in the boron injection system does
not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

Service water valves 2-SW-3.1A and 2-SW-3.1B are normally open and are designed to fail in
the ``as is'' position. The valves do not perform any active safety function (are not considered in any operational
procedure to mitigate the effects of an abnormal event), nor do they provide isolation between the two service water
headers. Their primary function is to isolate the downstream portion of the header for maintenance activities. Since
service water valves 2-SW-3.1A and 2-SW-3.1B possess no risk significance, the proposed
one-time extension to the surveillance frequency for service water valves 2-SW-3.1A and 2-SW-3.1B
does not involve a reduction in the margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By April 22, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Learning Resource Center, Three Rivers Community-Technical
College, Thames Valley Campus, 574 New London Turnpike, Norwich, Connecticut 06360. If a request for hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an
appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940323-2-00133 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940323-2-00103 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to John F. Stolz: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed,
plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry & Howard, City Place, Hartford, Connecticut
06103-3499, attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated March 14, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Learning Resource Center, Three Rivers Community-Technical
College, Thames Valley Campus, 574 New London Turnpike, Norwich, Connecticut 06360.

The Plan provides for the automatic annual grant of 100 shares of Restricted Stock to each non-employee director following
the annual shareholders meeting on the date of such meeting. Each non-employee director granted Restricted Stock
shall be entitled to receive dividends on such Restricted Stock, to vote such Restricted Stock, and shall have all
other rights of a shareholder of CNG, except that until restrictions on such stock expire, the Restricted Stock cannot
be sold or otherwise transferred.

Restrictions on a director's Restricted Stock shall lapse in 25% installments on the anniversary date of each grant,
or shall lapse in total upon: (1) The director's retirement at age 70; or (2) the director's ceasing to serve due to death
or disability, whichever first occurs. In the event of a ``change of control'' of CNG, as that term is defined in CNG's
1991 Stock Incentive Plan, all restrictions on outstanding Restricted Stock will lapse and CNG will repurchase all
such shares which were awarded more than six months prior to the change of control at the then fair market value.

The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of CNG's Common Stock outstanding on March 23, 1994 is required
to authorize CNG: (1) To issue up to 15,000 shares of common stock to the Plan; (2) to acquire previously awarded shares
of the Restricted Stock, through the forfeiture and repurchase provisions of the Plan; and (3) to adjust the number
and par value of the common stock that may be issued under the Plan to implement the anti-dilution or anti-enlargement
of rights provisions of the Plan. CNG intends to submit the proposals to its shareholders for their approval at the
annual meeting of shareholders to be held on May 17, 1994. CNG requests authority to solicit proxies from its stockholders
for approval of the Plan at the meeting. CNG has filed its proxy solicitation material and requests that the effectiveness
of its declaration with respect to the solicitation be permitted to become effective as provided in rule 62(d).

It appearing to the Commission that CNG declaration regarding the proposed solicitation of proxies should be permitted
to become effective forthwith, pursuant to rule 62:



It is ordered, 

that the declaration regarding the proposed solicitation of proxies, be, and it hereby is, permitted to become effective
forthwith, under rule 62, and subject to the terms and conditions prescribed in rule 24 under the Act.

Agency Clearance Office:

 John J. Lane, (202) 942-8800.






Upon Written Request Copy Available From:

 Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Filings and Information Services, Washington, DC 20549.





Proposed Amendments: 

Rule 15c2-12; File No. 270-330.

Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et. seq.

), the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') has submitted for Office of Management and Budget approval
proposed amendments to rule 15c2-12 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78 

et seq.

). The proposed amendments to rule 15c2-12 would make it unlawful for a broker, dealer, or municipal securities
dealer to act as an underwriter of an issue of municipal securities unless the issuer or its designated agent has undertaken
in a written agreement or contract for the benefit of the holders of such municipal securities to provide certain information
to a nationally recognized municipal securities information repository, and would require brokers, dealers, and
municipal securities dealers, prior to recommending a transaction in a municipal security, to review the information
the issuer of the municipal security has undertaken to provide. It is anticipated that approximately 12,003 brokers,
dealers, municipal securities dealers, issuers of municipal securities, and nationally recognized municipal
securities information repositories will spend a total of 65,050 hours complying with rule 15c2-12.

Direct general comments to Gary Waxman at the address below. Direct any comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated
average burden hours for compliance with the Commission rules and forms to John J. Lane, Associate Executive Director,

Announcement of Global Positioning System (GPS) Initial Operational Capability (IOC) and Its Impact on Vessel Carriage
Requirement Regulations

<ACTION>
action: 

Notice.





Summary: 

The Department of Defense has notified the Department of Transportation that the Global Positioning System (GPS)
has reached its Initial Operational Capability (IOC). A GPS receiver now meets the carriage requirements for electronic
position fixing devices under 33 CFR 164.41 (a)(2).

GPS provides two levels of service: Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Precise Positioning Service (PPS). SPS
is the standard level of positioning, velocity, and timing accuracy that is available to any user on a continuous worldwide
basis. The horizontal positioning accuracy of this service is 100 meters (2 distance root mean squared (drms), 95%
probability) and 300 meters with 99.99% probability. PPS will be limited to authorized U.S. and allied Federal government
and military users and to those civil users who can satisfy U.S. requirements. These requirements are: the use must
be in the U.S. national interest; the user must meet specific GPS security requirements; and a reasonable alternative
to the use of PPS must not be available. Unauthorized users will be denied access to PPS through encryption of the signals.
PPS military user equipment will provide horizontal positioning accuracy of 21 meters (2 drms). The SPS is affected
by a process called Selective Availability (SA), which degrades the basic accuracy of the SPS through adjustment
and encryption of some of the signals and data.
One of the shortcomings of GPS for civil navigation use is its problem meeting integrity requirements. Integrity
is the ability of a system to provide timely warnings to users when the system should not be railed upon for navigation.
According to DOD's concept of operation, GPS satellites are monitored more than 95 percent of the time by a network
of five monitoring stations spread around the world. The information collected by the monitoring stations is processed
by the GPS Master Control Station (MCS) and used to periodically update the navigation message, including the satellite
health message, transmitted by each satellite. The health message is transmitted as part of the GPS navigation message
for reception by both PPS and SPS users. Additionally, satellite operating parameters such as navigation data errors,
signal availability failures, and certain types of satellite clock failures are monitored internally within the
satellite. If such internal failures are detected, users are notified within six seconds. Other failures detectable
only by the control segment may take from 15 minutes to several hours before users are notified of a problem. This is
unsatisfactory for many modes and phases of navigation, and, from the maritime perspective, it is particularly deficient
for the harbor and harbor approach (HHS) phase of navigation. The integrity required for HHA navigation will be provided
through augmentation of the GPS SPS by the Coast Guard's Differential GPS (DGPS) service, now being implemented.
As with Loran-C and Transit (the Navy Navigation Satellite System), the GPS should not be used by itself in or near restricted
waters. As described above, the accuracy of the system is not monitored continuously and it may take 2-6 hours
to be aware of a problem or fix a problem with a satellite. Additionally, mariners need to be aware of the real accuracy
of the system. GPS receivers may produce a latitude and longitude position that appears accurate to several decimal
places, which may mislead a mariner to believe the system is really that accurate. GPS SPS will only give an accuracy
to within 100 meters, with 95% probability. That means that the mariner can be anywhere within a 100 meter radius of
the position indicated by the receiver. It also means that 5% of the time, the actual position could be greater than
100 meters from the indicated location. Mariners must constantly be aware of this and navigate with due caution, using
all means available, most importantly in more restricted locations such as harbor and harbor approach areas.
The FRP outlines navigation accuracies required for the different phases of navigation. While the Ocean and Coastal
phases have been satisfied for some time, the harbor and harbor-approach phase requirements have been unattainable
with existing systems. Additionally, a similar need for higher accuracy exists for other Coast Guard missions such
as positioning aids to navigation and Vessel Traffic Services. DGPS is a solution to all of these needs.

DGPS improves upon GPS signals by using a local reference receiver to correct errors in the standard GPS signals. An
``all in view'' GPS receiver is located at a site which has been geodetically surveyed. The receiver monitors all visible
satellites and measures the pseudorange to each satellite. Since the satellite signal contains information on the
precise satellite orbits and the reference receiver knows its position, the true range to each satellite can be calculated.
By comparing the calculated true range and the measured pseudorange, a correction term can be determined for each
satellite. These corrections are then broadcast to the user over the communications network, and can be received
by the user with a DGPS receiver. The Coast Guard will be using selected marine radiobeacons to transmit the corrections
to users. The corrections are then applied to the pseudorange measurements within the user's receiver, achieving
a position accurate within 10 meters, with 95% probability. One advantage of DGPS is that it will provide radionavigation
accuracy that is not possible with existing systems. It will also reduce the integrity check of satellites from hours
to seconds, and will even allow for use of satellites considered unhealthy. By knowing its position, the reference
station can detect immediately when a satellite may be sending erroneous data. DGPS accuracies cannot be achieved
with either the GPS Standard Positioning Service, with Selective Availability on or off, or Precise Positioning
Service. The Coast Guard will also implement an integrity monitoring system which will verify the accuracy of the
corrections that it transmits on the selected radiobeacon. The Coast Guard's DGPS Service will be implemented for
harbor and harbor approach areas of the continential U.S., Great Lakes, Puerto Rico, and most of Hawaii and Alaska
by 1996.



Information Availability



Operational status and other information about GPS is available to worldwide users of GPS through the Coast Guard's
GPS Information Center (GPSIC). The GPSIC sends GPS operational status information to civil users through Operational
Advisory Broadcasts (OAB). These broadcasts contain the following general categories of GPS performance data:
Current constellation status, Recent (past) outages, Scheduled (future) outages, and Almanac data. The OAB is disseminated
or made available through the following media:




GPSIC Computer Bulletin Board System (BBS)
GPSIC 24-Hour Status Recording
WWV/WWVH worldwide high-frequency radio broadcasts
U.S. Coast Guard Marine Information Broadcasts (MIB)
DMAHTC Broadcast Warnings
DMAHTC Weekly Notice to Mariners
DMA Navigation Information Network (NAVINFONET)
NAVTEX Data Broadcast




Through a duty watchstander and an electronic bulletin board service (BBS), both available 24 hours per day, GPSIC
also makes the following information available:




_Operational status of GPS as provided by DOD

_Precise GPS orbit data from the National Geodetic Survey

_Technical information on GPS

_Operational status and information on other Coast Guard operated radionavigation systems
_Instructions on the access and use of GPSIC services




The U.S. Air Force Second Space Operations Squadron (2SOPS), which operates the GPS Master Control Station (MCS)
in Colorado Springs, CO, provides the following GPS information for the GPSIC:

Notice Advisories to NAVSTAR Users (NANU) are near real-time operational status capability reports. NANUs are issued
to notify users of future, current, or past satellite outages, system adjustments, or any condition which might adversely
affect users. NANUs are generated by 2SOPs as events occur. GPS Status Messages contain general information that
is downloaded daily from the Air Force's (2SOPS) electronic bulletin board. The message contains information about
the satellite orbit (plane/slot), clocks, and current or recent NANUs. Status Messages are generated by 2SOPS once
a day Monday through Friday, except on Federal holidays.
Almanacs contain the orbital information and clock data of all the satellites. The almanac for all satellites can
be obtained from downloading the continuously transmitted data stream from any satellite.
In addition to receiving information from the MCS, the GPSIC works with representatives of the National Geodetic
Survey (NGS) to offer NGS computed precise GPS orbit data to the public via the GPSIC bulletin board. This data is called
precise ephemeris data. Precise ephemeris data describes the orbit of each satellite as observed by numerous ground
stations. It is useful in making a refined determination of where the satellites were at some time in the past. The time
lag for this information is about eight days.
The BBS is an electronic version of a bulletin board, where information is made available in easy to access lists and
files. Any user with a computer and modem can dial the BBS and browse through the information or copy files into their
own computer for further use. The BBS is menu-driven and has an extensive set of on-line help utilities. If necessary,
users can also page the GPSIC watchstander to request personal assistance. The BBS is free and open to all. However,
users will have to pay their own connection charges (long distance telephone or public data network costs). First-time
callers are asked to register on-line (provide their names, addresses, etc.) before proceeding to the BBS main menu.
Through the BBS, a wide range of information is available 24 hours a day. BBS information is updated whenever the other
GPSIC sources are. Users may call the BBS via either telephone or SprintNet (a public data network). Ordinary telephone
is the easiest for most people, but SprintNet offers a high speed error-free alternative for those (especially international
callers) who may have difficulty in getting a good data connection over the voice phone lines. To contact the BBS, call:
(tel) 703-313-5910. Modem speeds of 300 to 14,400 bps and most common U.S. or international protocols
are supported. Communications parameters should be set to: 8 data bits, No parity, 1 stop bit (8N1), asynchronous
comms, full duplex. We have eight phone lines at this number and two auxiliary numbers to accommodate modems which
may be incompatible with the ones on 313-5910. The BBS SprintNet number is: 31102021323 (or abbreviate to 202
1328 if accessing SprintNet via telephone to one of their modems.) For SprintNet access, users must set up their own
accounts with Sprint or a similar public data network which has a ``gateway'' to SprintNet. For more information,
call: (800) 736-1130 (U.S.) or (913) 541-6876) (international).
Users who need further information or assistance may call the GPSIC watchstander at 703-313-5900, or
write to Commanding Officer, USCG Omega Navigation System Center, 7323 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA 22310-3998.

ACTION: 

Notice of proposed termination.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is proposing to terminate the eligibility of Pitkin County (County),
Colorado, owner and operator of Aspen-Pitkin County Airport (ASE), for airport grant funds and to disapprove its
application to impose or collect passenger facility charges (PFC) because it appears that Pitkin County has improperly
imposed an aircraft access restriction at ASE. This notices is issued in accordance with Sections 9304(e) and 9307
of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (ANCA), 49 U.S.C. App. 2153(e) and 2156, and 14 CFR 161.505. This Notice
has summarized the available information in order to facilitate any interested party's ability to comment or object.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (ANCA) requires an airport proprietor, as a condition of receiving grant
funds under the Airport Improvement Program and of collecting and imposing passenger facility charges: (1) To conduct
a public review process and cost-benefit analysis of any noise or access restriction affecting Stage 2 aircraft if
the restriction was not proposed before October 1, 1990; and (2) to obtain agreement from each affected operator or
approval of the Secretary of Transportation for any restriction affecting Stage 3 aircraft not in effect before October
1, 1990.
ASE is a commercial service airport which serves Aspen, Colorado. Pitkin County is the proprietor of ASE and operates
ASE through the Board of County Commissioners (Board). ASE is now open each day from 7 a.m. to one-half hour after sunset.
An exception until 11 p.m. exists for two air carriers (United Express and Continental Express) that maintain private
navigation aids at the airport. In its current form, the exception to ASE's nighttime curfew is only available to scheduled
carriers operating Stage 3 or exempt aircraft, which arrive or depart before 11 p.m. and who have access to an on-site
instrument landing system which is privately owned. The current operating hours of ASE are set out in County Ordinance
90-12.
In the past, Ordinance 89-3 (October 24, 1989) regulated hours of operation at ASE. It prohibited general aviation
aircraft from taking off or landing during the period one-half hour after sunset to 7 a.m. Scheduled air carriers operating
Stage 3 or exempt aircraft under Parts 135 or 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and who had access to privately-owned,
on-site instrument landing systems were permitted to operate until 11 p.m. Ordinance 89-3 established a yearly,
limited exception to the prohibition on nighttime operations for general aviation aircraft operators. General
aviation aircraft operating under instrument flight rules (IFR) were permitted to depart on Fridays, Saturdays
and Sundays until two and one-half hours past sunset local time during ski season each year. The airport manager was
also authorized to grant similar departure exceptions during high-traffic holiday periods such as Christmas Eve,
New Year's Day and President's Day.
On June 12, 1990 the Board introduced, first read, and set for public hearing a draft ordinance ``(e) establishing
the hours of airside operations at the Aspen-Pitkin County Airport (Sardy Field).'' The draft ordinance would have
expanded nighttime access at ASE to all aircraft until 10 p.m. and necessarily provided more liberal access than the
ski season exception. The Board proposed this change, in part, in response to concerns voiced by the FAA and general
aviation user groups about the potentially discriminatory nature of ASE's hours of operation. The Board did not adopt
the June 12, 1990 draft ordinance. At an August 7, 1990 special session and hearing the Board tabled the June 12, 1990
draft ordinance indefinitely.
The Board introduced, first read, and set for public hearing Ordinance 90-12 on November 13, 1990. The Board
adopted Ordinance 90-12 on November 27, 1990 which established the current operating hours. It also repealed
the ski season exception under Ordinance 89-3.
Over approximately a two year period, the FAA attempted to informally resolve the ANCA issues with the County. The
FAA repeatedly raised concerns that Ordinance 90-12 did not appear to be grandfathered either as to operations
by Stage 2 or Stage 3 aircraft, nor exempt from requirements under ANCA Sections 9304 (b) and (c). After extensive correspondence
and discussion, the FAA determined that the County had not provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that repeal
of the ski season exception through passage of Ordinance 90-12 was grandfathered. The FAA determined that informal
resolution had not been successful and issued a Notice of Apparent Violation (NOAV) on September 30, 1993.
The NOAV advised the County of the FAA's position that the existence, and continued enforcement, of Ordinance 90-12
was an apparent ANCA violation and that the County's eligibility for airport grant funds and authority to impose and
collect passenger facility charges was at issue, absent the County's agreement to rescind or permanently not enforce
Ordinance 90-12. The NOAV indicated that contrary to the County's contentions, the June 12, 1990 draft ordinance
did not reference an intent to repeal ASE's ski season exception as an alternative to liberalizing the curfew. The
FAA interprets ``proposed'' in the context of ANCA and 14 CFR Part 161 to mean issuance of an official proposal by the
government body with authority to adopt the proposal or ordinance. It does not appear that either the language of the
June 12, 1990 draft ordinance or the published notice in the Aspen Times indicated that the Board was proposing to repeal
the ski season exception as an alternative to liberalizing access to ASE.
The County provided a Response to the FAA's NOAV and made the following key arguments:



(1) When the Board tabled the draft ordinance by Resolution on August 7, 1990, the Board repealed the ski season exception,

</SUPPLEM>

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940323-2-00151 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940323-2-00114 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) The conduct of its County Manager and Airport Manager proves that the ski season exception was repealed prior to
October 1, 1990. That is, a Board Resolution of August 7, 1990 authorized the County Manager to direct the Airport Manager
to notify the FAA National Flight Data Center to delete the ski season exception,
(3) Adoption of Ordinance 90-12 on November 27, 1990, merely codified, and/or ratified, the repeal of the ski
season exception which, the County continued to contend, occurred on August 7, 1990; Ordinance 90-12 is irrelevant
because it is merely a housekeeping and codification measure, and
(4) Repeal was necessary because the Board was concerned about the safety of its citizens.



In addition, the County responded that it would not agree to rescind or permanently not enforce Ordinance 90-12,
an alternate method of compliance with ANCA or Part 161, as advised by the FAA in its NOAV.
The FAA has reviewed the evidence contained in the record and carefully evaluated the County's claims. It is the FAA's
preliminary conclusion that the County's Response to the FAA's NOAV did not provide any additional evidence or arguments
which would indicate that repeal of the ski season exception was proposed before October 1, 1990 within the meaning
of ANCA.
First, the usual meaning of ``tabled'' as applied to a piece of legislation is that consideration of the legislation
was postponed. Tabling the June 1990 draft ordinance on August 7, 1990 left the existing airport rules, including
the ski season exception, in effect at ASE.
Second, while the County argues that the Airport Manager's revision of the FAA Airport Facilities Directory (A/FD)
evidenced the County officials' intent to repeal the ski season exception, that argument is not dispositive of the
ANCA issues. Revision of the A/FD did not have a regulatory effect. It was not supported by an official proposal by the
Board of County Commissioners or any other government body with authority to adopt the proposal. The Airport Manager
does not have the power to repeal or amend ordinances independent of the Board.
Third, the County's position that the notice and reading of Ordinance No. 90-12 was a mere housekeeping measure
is contradicted by testimony at the August 7, 1990, hearing. In summarizing the options available to the Board at the
August 7, 1990, hearing, Commissioner Ross noted that a significant change in the proposal to liberalize the curfew
would require another reading (Minutes of the Pitkin County Board of County Commissioners, Special Meeting, August
7, 1990, p.2). The difference between the June 12, 1990 proposal to liberalize the curfew and repeal of the ski season
exception appears to have been a significant change, requiring public notice through another reading. Therefore,
the County appears to have been required to introduce and read Ordinance 90-12 on November 13, 1990. This supports
a conclusion that repeal of the ski season exception was not proposed within the meaning of ANCA prior to October 1,
1990.
Fourth, the FAA invited the County to provide technical data or studies in support of its safety contentions. In its
Response, the County has reasserted the arguments it has made previously against all night operations at Aspen (and
other high-elevation mountain airports). The airport itself is certificated by the FAA under 14 CFR Part 139, and
is served by an FAA air traffic control tower. The FAA does not find, and the County apparently does not argue, that there
is any safety issue with the airport facility itself. With respect to arrival and departure routes for Aspen, the FAA
Flight Standards Service has encouraged specialized training and planning for mountain flying generally, but has
not found a need for a prohibition at Aspen or other Rocky Mountain airports.

Corrective Action



Pursuant to 14 CFR 161.505(c), the County may rescind or agree to permanently not enforce Ordinance 90-12.


Related Matters



Both the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and the National Business Aircraft Association have filed formal
complaints under 14 CFR Part 13 which allege that the curfew violates the obligation of the County under its Federal
grant assurances to allow access on fair and reasonable terms, without unjust discrimination. A decision by the County
to adopt a restriction that relaxes the curfew and allows equal access to all operators could render both this proceeding
and the formal complaints moot.
In accordance with Senate Report 103-150, the General Accounting Office (GAO) has issued a Report on Mountain
Flying which examined the FAA's oversight of general aviation safety in mountainous areas. GAO Report to the Chairman,
Subcommittee on Aviation, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, U.S. Senate. Aviation Safety, FAA
Can Better Prepare General Aviation Pilots for Mountain Flying Risks, GAO/RCED-94-15 (December 1993)
Overall, GAO recommended additional efforts to prepare general aviation pilots for the greater risks of flying in
mountainous areas. In Chapter Four of the report GAO presents its views of the legal and safety issues involved with
Pitkin County's prohibition against general aviation night operations at Aspen Airport, but makes no recommendations.


Conclusion


Based on the available information, the FAA has determined to issue this Notice of Proposed Termination. The FAA will
review any additional comments, statements and data which are submitted and any other available information to determine
whether the County has provided satisfactory evidence of compliance or has taken satisfactory corrective action.
If the FAA finds satisfactory evidence of compliance, the FAA will provide written notice to the County and publish
notice of compliance in the 

Federal Register.

 If the FAA determines that the County has imposed an access restriction in violation of ANCA or Part 161 the FAA will
issue an order in accordance with Part 161 terminating eligibility for new airport grants and discontinuing payments
of airport grant funds as well as disapproving the County's PFC application.

Dow Corning Corporation; Receipt of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance


Dow Corning Corporation (Dow) of Midland, Michigan has determined that some of its brake fluid fails to comply with
the requirements of 49 CFR 571.116, Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 116, ``Hydraulic Brake Fluids,'' and has filed
an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Dow has also petitioned
to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act
(15 U.S.C. 1381 

et seq.

) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety.
This notice of receipt of a petition is published under section 157 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety
Act (15 U.S.C. 1417) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise of judgment concerning the merits
of the petition.
Paragraph S5.1.9, Water Tolerance, of Standard No. 116 states that:



At low temperature, after humidification, ``(1) The [brake] fluid shall show no sludging, sedimentation, crystallization,
or stratification; (2) Upon inversion of the centrifuge tube, the air bubble shall travel to the top of the fluid in
not more than 10 seconds; (3) If cloudiness has developed, the wet fluid shall regain its original clarity and fluidity
when warmed to room temperature.''



Between September 4, 1992, and October 29, 1993, Dow produced and sold 11 lots of DOT 5 silicone base brake fluid (SBBF)
that do not comply with the requirements in Paragraph S5.1.9 of Standard No. 116. These 11 lots were broken down into
191 55 gallon drums, 1,112 one gallon retail packages, 11,458 one quart retail packages, and 33,091 12 ounce retail
packages.
At some point near the end of the low temperature portion of the water tolerance test, these lots contained a very small
amount of a soft, slush-like crystallation. The crystallization usually formed around the top of the specimen, where
the SBBF met the vial headspace. The smallest amount of warming made the crystallization flow back into a liquid state.
Dow supports its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following:



First, the low temperature portion of the water, tolerance test was designed to [simulate] excessive water in non-SBBF
brake fluids. But as applied to SBBF, the humidification step results in a water content level for test samples that
is nearly double that of in-service SBBF. SBBF test samples clearly do not accurately represent in-service SBBF.
[Dow b]elieves this built-in error results in unrealistic and excess water. During this portion of the test, that
excess water becomes a seed for crystallization of the SBBF itself. Without the humidification step, SBBF does not
crystallize.
Second, the soft, slush-like crystals are identical to the liquid SBBF; that is, 20 centistoke polydimethylsiloxane,
some organic additives, and 350-400 [parts per million (ppm)] water. The SBBF crystals should not be considered
as water-based ``ice'' crystals. These SBBF crystals do not exhibit any of the negative safety impacts that result
from ice formation.



Dow also submitted the following additional material: (1) A 1982 petition for rulemaking it filed to amend this portion
of the standard; (2) data to support this petition; (3) test data showing that the subject SBBF would pass the requirements
of S5.1.9 when the humidification step is eliminated; and, (4) a statement by Ron Tecklenberg, Ph.D, a Dow chemist,
supporting Dow's petition. This additional material is available for review in the HNTSA Docket Section.
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on the petition of Dow, described above.
Comments should refer to the docket number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC, 20590. It is requested but not required that six copies be submitted.
All comments received before the close of business on the closing date indicated below will be considered. The application
and supporting materials, and all comments received after the closing date will also be filed and will be considered
to the extent possible. When the petition is granted or denied, the notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

 pursuant to the authority indicated below.
Comment closing date: April 22, 1994.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; new system of records.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552(e)(4)) requires that all agencies publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of the existence and character of their system of records. Accordingly, the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) published a notice of its inventory of personal records on September 27, 1977 (42 FR 49728). Notice is hereby given
that VA is adding a new system of records entitled ``National Chaplain Management Information System (NCMIS)-VA''
(84VA111K).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Chaplain Service of the Veterans Health Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, has developed a data base
to maintain information that will be used as part of a comprehensive program in Total Quality Improvement (TQI). Maintenance
of the information will facilitate more meaningful and effective management of the performance of individual chaplain
services and will be used for staff development to enhance and improve the work-related activities of chaplains nationally.
It will be used to assist in the personal growth and spiritual development of all chaplains over and above the performance

Categories of individuals covered by the system:



The personal data collected will be limited to VA Chaplains, other VA Chaplain Service staff, applicants for VA chaplain
positions (VA employees and individuals seeking VA employment), and selected providers of services to the VA chaplaincy.



Categories of records in the system:



1. The following data will be collected on individuals who are VA chaplains or chaplain candidates: Name, date of birth,
Social Security Number, educational data (e.g., college degrees), membership in religious bodies and related religious
experience, employment history relevant to the chaplaincy, name, location and dates of significant professional
events (e.g., ordination), continuing education data (e.g., name, location and type of continuing education course),

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION </USDEPT>



Federal Pell Grant Program 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice; deadline dates for receipt of applications, reports, and other documents for the 1993-94 award year.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary announces the deadline dates for receiving documents from persons applying for financial assistance
under, and from institutions participating in, the Federal Pell Grant Program during the 1993-94 award year.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Federal Pell Grant Program provides grants to students attending eligible institutions of higher education
to help them pay for their educational costs. The program supports Goals 2000, the President's strategy for moving
the Nation toward the National Education Goals, by enhancing opportunities for postsecondary education. The National
Education Goals call for increasing the rate at which students graduate from high school and pursue high quality postsecondary
education and for supporting life-long learning. Authority for the Federal Pell Grant Program is contained in section
401 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), 20 U.S.C. 1070a. Regulations that govern the Federal Pell
Grant Program are codified in 34 CFR part 690 and 34 CFR part 668. 




The Pell Grant Program includes a three-step application process. Under the first step, the student must submit an
application to have his or her expected family contribution (EFC) 
determined. The student may submit a paper application, or, if the institution he or she attends or will attend participates
in the Department of Education's Electronic Data Exchange (EDE), the student may submit an electronic application.
Under EDE, using software provided by the Department of Education (Department) or a needs analysis servicer, an institution
electronically transmits the student's application data to the Department's Federal Student Aid Central Processing
System (central processor). The institution may enter the application data, or the institution may have the student
enter that data. 


In the second step, the central processor determines a student's EFC based upon the information provided in a paper
or electronic application and forwards the results to the student. The central processor may also forward the results
to the student's institution. 


As a result of submitting a paper application, the student receives a Student Aid Report (SAR), and any institution
designated by the student may draw down a student's data in the form of an electronic SAR (ESAR) if the institution participates
in EDE. An ESAR or SAR contains the student's EFC and the information on which that EFC was based. If application data
was submitted electronically under EDE, the student will not receive an SAR, but the institution may draw down an ESAR.



The central processor may also transmit, to the institution that a student indicates he or she is attending or will
attend, an institutional student information report (ISIR) that includes the student's EFC and the information
on which that EFC was based. An ISIR is a paper document or an institutional paper printout from a computer-generated
magnetic or electronic record. 


Under the third step, a student must submit a valid SAR to the institution or sign a valid ESAR or ISIR. A valid SAR, ESAR,
or ISIR is one on which all the information used to calculate the student's EFC is accurate and complete. In addition,
a valid ESAR or ISIR must be signed by the student, and if corrections were made, signed by one of the student's parents
if the student is a dependent student. If corrections are made to an ESAR or ISIR, the ESAR or ISIR must also be signed
by the student's spouse if the student is married. However, a student may receive a Federal Pell Grant by signing a valid
ISIR only if the institution he or she attends reports its Federal Pell Grant payment data to the Department by floppy
disk, magnetic tape, or electronically under EDE. (Part IV of this notice describes the disbursement reporting requirements.)




I. Applications for Determination of Expected Family Contribution_Table I 




Under the first application step described above, if a student uses a paper application, he or she must submit an approved
application to an agency listed in table I of this notice, at the address indicated in table I. That application must
be received at that address no later than May 2, 1994. A paper application may not be hand-delivered. 




</SUPPLEM>

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940323-2-00173 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940323-2-00124 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

An approved application is an application listed in the first column of table I. Moreover, the student must send the
application to the address of the organization whose application is being used. Thus, the Free Application for Federal
Student Aid (FASFA) printed and distributed by the Department must be sent to the FAFSA processor in Iowa City, forms
printed and distributed by the College Scholarship Service (CSS) must be sent to CSS, forms printed and distributed
by the American College Testing Program (ACT) must be sent to ACT, and forms distributed by the Pennsylvania Higher
Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA) must be sent to PHEAA. 

If a student submits an electronic application under EDE, that application must be received by the Department's central
processor prior to midnight (Central Daylight Savings Time) on May 2, 1994. 

(For purposes of this notice, this deadline means that a student has all of May 2, 1994, to apply.) 

For the balance of this notice, the first application submitted by or on behalf of a student shall be called an ``original
application.'' 



Applications of Students Receiving ``Dependency Overrides'' 




Under section 480(d)(7) of the HEA, a financial aid administrator (FAA) may determine that a student qualifies as
an ``independent student'' as a result of unusual circumstances even though the student does not qualify as an independent
student under the other criteria in section 480(d). This determination, 
using what is known as ``professional judgment,'' results in a ``dependency override.'' 


If an FAA makes a dependency override with regard to a student, the student must submit an original Correction Application
to the Federal Student Aid Programs after that application has been specially coded for the dependency override and
signed by the FAA. If the student attends an institution that participates in EDE, the institution may electronically
transmit an original application or a Correction Application, coded for the dependency override, to the central
processor. 

If a student has not submitted an original application, the deadline date for the submission of a Correction Application
for a dependency override is May 2, 1994. If the student has submitted an original application, the deadline date for
the submission of a Correction Application is August 1, 1994. (For purposes of this notice, this deadline means that
a student has all of August 1, 1994, to apply.) Applications submitted electronically must be received by the central
processor prior to midnight Central Daylight Savings Time on the applicable deadline date.


 


(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB Control Number Application: 1840-0110) 



II. Other Documents_Table I 




Once a student has filed his or her original application, additional transactions may occur as a result of that application.
In some cases, the agency receiving the original application may request additional information. In other cases,
the student is responsible for initiating a request to the agency to consider additional or alternative information.



Table I of this notice lists the addresses to which additional forms and information, known as transactions, must
be sent and the deadline dates for the receipt of those transactions. 


The following explains each type of transaction: 




A. Correction Application 




In addition to being used when a student receives a ``dependency override,'' the Secretary provides a Correction
Application to a student if the student's original application lacks sufficient information to be processed or contains
inaccurate information. The student must include on the Correction Application all the information necessary to
process that application. 


If a student has misreported his or her dependency status, or if that status has changed after the student submitted
an original application for reasons other than a change in marital status, the student must submit a Correction Application
with the correct dependency status. 


A Correction Application may be obtained (1) from an FAA or an Educational Opportunity Center counselor, (2) by writing
to the addresses listed in table I, (3) by writing to Federal Student Aid Information Center, P.O. Box 84, Washington,
DC, 20044, or (4) by calling (800) 4 FED AID. The Correction Application must be returned to one of the addressees listed
in table I and received at that address no later than August 1, 1994, unless the Correction Application is submitted
as an original application, in which case it must be received by May 2, 1994. A Correction Application submitted electronically
under EDE through the electronic application process must be received by the central processor prior to midnight
(Central Daylight Savings Time) on August 1, 1994, unless the Correction Application is submitted as an original
application, in which case the correction application must be received prior to midnight (Central Daylight Savings
Time) on May 2, 1994. 





B. SAR and ISIR 


 Correction or Verification of Information Requested by the Secretary_If the Secretary returns an SAR to a
student for correction or notifies an institution through an ISIR that a student needs to correct application information,
the student must correct that information on the SAR. The student must return the SAR to the appropriate address listed
in table I, and that corrected SAR must be received at the appropriate address no later than August 1, 1994. If the student
attends an institution that participates in EDE, the corrected SAR may be transmitted electronically to the central
processor. That SAR must be received by the central processor prior to midnight (Central Daylight Savings Time) on
August 1, 1994.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940323-2-00174 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940323-2-00124 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

If the Secretary returns an SAR to a student for verification of certain data items included on the application or notifies
an institution through an ISIR that a student needs to verify application information, the student must verify the
information. The student verifies the information on the SAR, and returns the SAR in the same manner as described for
required corrections. This request for verification is separate and apart from the verification requirements contained
in 34 CFR part 668, subpart E.
 Correction of Inaccurate Information_If an SAR or an ISIR reflects information that was inaccurate when the
application was signed, the student must correct that information on the SAR and send the SAR to the appropriate address
listed in table I or submit the change electronically. The SAR must be received at that address no later than August
1, 1994.
 If the student attends an institution that participates in EDE, the corrected information may be transmitted
electronically to the central processor. That SAR must be received by the central processor prior to midnight (Central
Daylight Savings Time) on August 1, 1994.
 Recomputation of EFC_A student may request on his or her SAR that the Secretary recompute his or her EFC if the
student believes the EFC is inaccurate because of an arithmetic or clerical error. The student must return the SAR
to the appropriate address listed in table I, and that SAR must be received at the appropriate address no later than
August 1, 1994. If the student attends an institution that participates in EDE, the request for a recomputation may
be transmitted electronically to the central processor. That SAR must be received by the central processor prior
to midnight (Central Daylight Savings Time) on August 1, 1994.
 Request for Duplicate SAR_If a student wishes to receive a duplicate SAR, the student may write to the appropriate
agency's address listed in table I or call the appropriate agency's telephone number listed in table I. All written
and telephone requests must be received no later than August 1, 1994. A written request sent to the appropriate agency
(listed in table I) must be received through a U.S. Postal facility by August 1, 1994. Individuals at the agencies listed
in table I are not authorized to personally accept hand-delivered documents.

 



Note: 

Although corrections and requests for a duplicate SAR will be processed through August 1, 1994, this deadline date
does not extend the deadline date by which a student must submit to the institution's financial aid office his or her
valid SAR, valid ESAR, or valid ISIR with an EFC that permits the student to receive a Federal Pell Grant. If the student
does not submit such a valid SAR, valid ESAR, or valid ISIR to the financial aid office by his or her last date of enrollment
or June 30, 1994, whichever is earlier, he or she will be ineligible for a Federal Pell Grant award for the 1993-94
award year. 



III. Verification Procedures and Deadline Dates Under 34 CFR 668, Subpart E 



The information provided on an application and included on an SAR, ESAR, or ISIR may be subject to verification under
verification procedures contained in 34 CFR part 668, subpart E. In that case, in order to receive a Federal Pell Grant
award for the 1993-94 award year, the student_and his or her parents, if applicable_must submit the necessary
verification documents in accordance with the following procedures and by the deadline dates specified below. These
dates do not conflict with or supersede the deadline dates specified in table I of this notice. 



A. Verification of Information on Application 



If a student is selected to have the information on his or her application verified under the verification procedures
set forth in subpart E of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations (34 CFR part 668, subpart E), he or
she must submit the requested documents as specified below in steps 1-4. The deadline date for the completion
of these steps is the earlier of 60 days after the student's last date of enrollment for a student who leaves school because
of graduation, completion of an academic term, or withdrawal; or August 30, 1994. A student who will still be enrolled
in a course of study in the 1993-94 award year after August 30, 1994, must submit the requested documents by August
30, 1994. (Documents that are hand-delivered must be received by the institution by the close of business on August
30, 1994. Documents sent by mail must be postmarked or demonstrate other comparable proof of mailing by August 30,
1994.)

<DOCNO> FR940323-2-00175 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940323-2-00124 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This process is complete when the student has: (1) Submitted all requested verification documents to his or her institution;

(2) Made all necessary corrections on (a) part 2 of the SAR, (b) an ESAR, (c) a correction application, or (d) an EDE Correction
Application; 
(3) Either (a) signed the corrected part 2 of the SAR or completed and signed a paper Correction Application and submitted
it to the appropriate address indicated in table I so that the addressee receives the form prior to midnight (Central
Daylight Savings Time) on August 1, 1994; or (b) signed and submitted the corrected ESAR or electronic Correction
Application to the institution so that the institution can transmit the data to the central processor (for those institutions
participating in EDE) prior to midnight (Central Daylight Savings Time) on August 1, 1994; and 
(4) By August 30, 1994, submitted to the institution the corrected and reprocessed SAR, ESAR, or ISIR that, if required,
is appropriately signed (34 CFR 668.60). 


B. Application Forms and Information 


Student aid application forms, Correction Applications, and information brochures may be obtained at an institution's
financial aid office, at an Educational Opportunity Center, or by writing or calling: Federal Student Aid Information
Center, P.O. Box 84, Washington, DC 20044. 
Telephone: (800) 4 FED AID.

IV. Submissions to the Secretary of Institutional Payment Summary and Student Aid Reports (Part 3 Payment Vouchers)




Each institution that participates in the Federal Pell Grant Program is required by 34 CFR 690.83(b) to submit to the
Secretary reports and information in connection with the Federal Pell Grant funds the Department makes available
to the institution for payment to students during an award year. One of the required reports is the Institutional Payment
Summary (IPS). The IPS accompanies an institution's submission of Federal Pell Grant Payment Vouchers and summarizes
the information contained on the individual Payment Vouchers.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940323-2-00177 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940323-2-00124 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Secretary provides a paper IPS form to the institution for completion and return to the Department.
The institution may also meet this reporting requirement by submitting the IPS and Payment Voucher information to
the Department on a floppy disk, on a magnetic tape, or by an electronic transmission through a modem from a personal
computer, minicomputer, or mainframe computer. These submissions are referred to, respectively, as the Federal
Pell Grant Program Floppy Disk Data Exchange, the Federal Pell Grant Program Recipient Data Exchange (RDE), and Electronic
Payments service under EDE. An institution that wishes to use one of these automated reporting methods must enter
into a written agreement with the Department and must agree to (1) comply with the Department's prescribed manner
of formatting and presenting the submitted information, (2) restrict access to the records from which the IPS and
Payment Voucher information is derived, and (3) ensure that only authorized officials or agents of the institution
may enter the data sent in the IPS submission to the Department.
The Department credits an institution's Federal Pell Grant account on the basis of acceptable Federal Pell Grant
payment data submitted through the system described in this notice. Such information must be submitted to the Department
in a timely, certified, and acceptable form. A submission is timely if received by the Department by the deadlines
prescribed in Tables II and III in part IV.C. of this notice; certified if its accuracy is attested to by the institution
in the manner described in part IV.D. of this notice; and acceptable if submitted in accordance with the directions
provided by the Department for the particular medium of submission used by the institution.
Failure to meet these reporting requirements may result in administrative action by the Department under Subpart
G of 34 CFR Part 668 under which the Department may fine the institution or limit or terminate its participation in the
Federal Pell Grant Program. In addition, failure to report accurately a student's award amount by the reporting deadline
may render the student ineligible for all or part of his or her Federal Pell Gr
