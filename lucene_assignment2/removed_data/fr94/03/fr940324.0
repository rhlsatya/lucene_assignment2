Official Testing Service for Vomitoxin


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Grain Inspection Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) is adopting without change the provisions of an interim final rule to
offer official vomitoxin testing services for grain under the authority of the United States Grain Standards Act
and to establish a fee to recover the cost of this service. Due to the widespread occurrence of scab this year and the
market's demand for rapid, onsite testing capabilities, FGIS decided it is in the best interest of the grain industry
to offer vomitoxin testing as an official service at field locations using quick test kits under the authority of the
United States Grain Standards Act (USGSA). This action permits FGIS, delegated States, and designated agencies
to provide the grain industry with official service to facilitate the orderly and timely marketing of grain.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Executive Order 12866


We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This rule has been determined to be not-significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by OMB.


Executive Order 12778


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have retroactive effect. The United States Grain Standards Act provides in section 87g that no State or subdivision
may require or impose any requirements or restrictions concerning the inspection, weighing, or description of grain
under the Act. Otherwise, this final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted
prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule.


Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification


David R. Shipman, Acting Administrator, FGIS, has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Most users of the official inspection and weighing services and
those persons who perform those services do not meet the requirements for small entities as defined in the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

).


Information Collection Requirements


In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the information collection requirements
contained in the rule being amended have been previously approved by OMB under control number 0580-0013.


Background


The Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) published an interim rule in the 

Federal Register

 on September 23, 1993, (58 FR 49421), announcing the immediate availability of official vomitoxin testing services
for grain as official criteria under the authority of the United States Grain Standards Act. This service is available
upon request.
Wheat scab, also known as head blight, pink mold, white heads, and tombstone scab, is a disease caused by certain fungal
species in the genus Fusarium. This disease occurs in wheat and other grains; the severity of the infection depends
on weather conditions. This year's weather was favorable for scab infection in wheat, resulting in its more prevalent
occurrence.
Wheat infected with scab has a tendency to have lighter weight kernels, some of which are removed during normal harvesting
and some during normal cleaning operations. The Fusarium may cause the occurrence of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol
(more commonly known as vomitoxin or DON).

In 1982, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed advisory levels for vomitoxin in wheat and wheat products
to assist States and others in use and disposition. On September 16, 1993, FDA issued updated advisories for certain
human food and animal feed products containing vomitoxin.
FDA's new advisories set the level for vomitoxin in finished wheat products intended for human consumption at 1 part
per million (ppm). Levels were not established for wheat intended for milling because milling processes used to produce
flour substantially reduce vomitoxin levels, to varying degrees.
FDA's new advisories also set levels for products intended for use as animal feed. Grains and grain by-products destined
for ruminating beef and feedlot cattle older than 4 months or chickens were set at 10 ppm provided these products do
not exceed 50 percent of their diet. Grains and grain by-products destined for swine and all other animals were set
at 5 ppm provided these products do not exceed 20 percent of the swine diet or 40 percent of the diet for all other animals.
To assist the grain industry in the marketing of wheat, FGIS had offered vomitoxin testing at its Commodity Testing
Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland, using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) under the authority of the Agricultural
Marketing Act of 1946. The TLC analysis is very time consuming, thus limiting the number of analyses available in a
single day. Providing the service under the authority of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 also limits the availability
of service since it is provided only by FGIS and State cooperators.
Due to the widespread occurrence of scab this year in certain areas of the country and the market's demand for rapid,
onsite testing capabilities, FGIS decided it is in the best interest of the grain industry to offer vomitoxin testing
as an official service at field locations using quick test kits under the authority of the United States Grain Standards
Act. This action permits FGIS, delegated States, and designated agencies to provide the grain industry with official
service.
FGIS evaluated the cost of providing this service and established different fees for qualitative and quantitative
analyses. FGIS fees for vomitoxin testing will also vary depending on whether the service is initiated as an original
FGIS inspection or as an appeal inspection of an original service provided by an official agency. FGIS fees for vomitoxin
testing services initiated as an original FGIS inspection service are $7.50 per test for qualitative analysis and
$12.00 per test for quantitative analysis plus the applicable hourly rate per service representative required to
obtain a sample and perform the test.
FGIS fees for vomitoxin testing services initiated at the appeal inspection level are $35.00 per test (regular workday)
and $44.00 per test (nonregular workday) for qualitative analysis, except as otherwise provided for in fee Schedule
A. For quantitative testing, the fees are $40.00 per test (regular workday) and $50.00 per test (nonregular workday).
This fee per test does not include a sampling fee. Delegated States and designated agencies are responsible for establishing
their fees subject to approval by FGIS.


Comment Review


FGIS received two comments during the comment period announced in the September 23, 1993, interim rule (58 FR 49421).
Both comments supported the action to offer the service as official criteria under the authority of the United States
Grain Standards Act.
One commenter encouraged FGIS to place emphasis on ensuring vomitoxin testing is done at origin, and to promote further
test kit research and development to increase test speed and reduce costs, and to improve accuracy and consistency.
The commenter also requested that FGIS confirm that the rule would not mandate ``official'' testing or prohibit or
restrict unofficial vomitoxin testing agreed to by the buyer and seller.
Widespread occurrences of vomitoxin in the United States are very unusual in wheat and similar grains. This year's
(1993) weather conditions in certain areas of the country led to scab infection in wheat. Thus the occurrence of vomitoxin
is a localized problem. FGIS believes that requiring vomitoxin testing at origin would impede the orderly marketing
of grain. In addition, this action permits FGIS, delegated States, and designated agencies to provide, upon request,
to the grain industry official vomitoxin testing services for grain under the authority of the USGSA. An applicant
for service can request vomitoxin testing at any time. However, buyers and sellers may agree to do otherwise. FGIS
has and will continue to encourage vomitoxin test kit research and development to increase test speed and reduce costs,
and to improve accuracy and consistency.

The other commenter questioned the manner in which FGIS determined that the Neogen test kit was the best method to be
declared official and suggested that the agency publicly release the testing data regarding the test kit. FGIS announced
its intent to examine vomitoxin (deoxynivalenol) test kits in the February 4, 1992, 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 4184). Specifically, FGIS solicited input regarding the availability of commercial test kits for qualitatively
and quantitatively determining the presence of vomitoxin to conduct a study under field conditions. Manufacturers
were requested to notify FGIS of the commercial availability of test kits and to provide information on the performance
of these test kits.

In response to this request, only Neogen Corporation submitted information regarding their test kit for vomitoxin.
FGIS, after examining the Neogen test kit, determined that it was suitable for official use. The test kit provides
qualitative or quantitative results and is adaptable to the existing environment of official aflatoxin laboratories.
Further, the chemical compounds used in the test procedure comply with FGIS' established safety and waste disposal
programs.

FGIS examined the Neogen test kit for accuracy at several different known contamination levels in wheat and corn samples.
Overall, the FGIS field study revealed that the kit was capable of producing accurate results in 89 percent of the wheat
tests and 91 percent of the corn tests. For more specific information regarding the comparative analysis and future
research plans, contact the FGIS Research and Development Branch, USA-FGIS Technical Center, 10383 North
Executive Hills Blvd., Kansas City, Missouri, 64153-1394; (816) 891-0464.



Final Action



FGIS has determined that offering official vomitoxin testing services for grain under the authority of the United
States Grain Standards Act and establishing a fee to recover the cost of this service would facilitate the orderly
and timely marketing of grain. Accordingly, the interim rule amending 7 CFR part 800 which was published in 58 FR 49421
on September 23, 1993, is adopted as a final rule without change.

Vidalia Onions Grown in Georgia; Revision of Handler Reporting Requirements


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule that revised the administrative rules and regulations established under the Federal marketing order
for Vidalia onions grown in Georgia. The interim final rule relaxed the reporting requirements on handlers by expanding
the period of coverage of the report for receipts and shipments of onions from one week to one month. This is the only
form handlers are required to file with the Vidalia Onion Committee (Committee). The reduction in the reporting burden
on handlers will not adversely impact program operations. This rule is based on a unanimous recommendation of the
Committee, which is responsible for local administration of the order.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 955 [7 CFR Part 955] regulating the handling of Vidalia
onions grown in Georgia. The marketing agreement and order are authorized by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the Act.


The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This rule has been reviewed under Executive 
Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt
any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of entry of the ruling.
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are approximately 145 handlers of Vidalia onions that are subject to regulation under the marketing order and
approximately 250 producers in the production area. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business
Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000, and small agricultural
producers have been defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of the Vidalia onion
handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.
This rule finalizes an interim final rule which revised  955.101 of Subpart _ Administrative Rules and Regulations
and is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Committee and other available information.
Previously under  955.101, Report of Shipments, handlers were required to provide the Committee with information
regarding the volume of Vidalia onions received and shipped during each week of the shipping season. The normal shipping
season for cured Vidalia onions runs from April through June, approximately 12 weeks. In addition, green Vidalia
onions usually are shipped beginning in January of each year. Handlers were required to provide this information
to the Committee each week. The Committee provided a form to assist handlers in providing this information. The information
required included the name and address of handler, the period covered for the report, the total weekly receipts of
Vidalia onions and the total fresh market shipments of Vidalia onions.

The Committee needs such information for the purpose of computing and collecting assessments, which are necessary
to finance the program. When the reporting requirement was first implemented, the Committee believed that the best
method for obtaining the necessary information was to require handlers to report to the Committee the volume of fresh
market shipments at the end of each week during the harvesting and shipping season. 

The Committee also uses the information from the reports in planning and evaluating market development activities
and recommending production research projects. This information is also made available to the industry on a composite
basis to aid growers and handlers in planning their individual operations and making marketing decisions during
the season. At the time of implementation, the reporting burden was estimated to be five minutes for a handler to complete
each weekly report. 

The Committee was experiencing problems in receiving the reports on a timely basis from many handlers. Many of the
handlers not reporting were smaller grower-handlers (2 to 10 acres) who only operate two or three weeks of the year
and do their bookkeeping at the end of the season. During the harvest season, these small handlers, mostly family-run
operations, are very busy and have complained that weekly reporting is burdensome to them. These reports are used
by the Committee in calculating the assessments owed by each handler. Thus, it is important that the reports be filed
on a timely basis. Because many handlers filed reports late, the Committee experienced difficulty in collecting
all assessments. The Committee expended much time and effort in identifying and locating these handlers. In addition,
handlers who filed their reports on a timely basis complained to the Committee that others were not being assessed.


The Committee met on August 28, 1993, to discuss these complaints and reporting problems and unanimously recommended
revising the administrative rules and regulations by expanding the period of coverage of the reports to be filed from
one week to one month. This reduced the number of reports filed on an annual basis from approximately 24 to approximately
6. Prior to the issuance of the interim final rule, the reporting process for the 24-week period expended approximately
203 reporting hours annually. The interim final rule reduced the reporting hours to approximately 93, a reduction
of 110 hours on an annual basis. 

The Committee also recommended that the report be required to be filed no later than seven days after the end of each
month. 

The Committee believed that its recommendation would decrease the reporting burden on handlers by eliminating unnecessary
reporting while still providing the Committee with the information it needs to properly administer the order. The
interim final rule brought the reporting requirements into conformance with current industry operating practices
and provided an acceptable time frame for the submission of reports.

The Committee believed that this relaxation would enable the small family-run operations to file reports and pay
assessments on a timely basis, and reduce the time and effort the Committee expends on locating handlers who have not
filed reports. 

The Committee expressed concern about the effect monthly reporting will have on their marketing efforts. The weekly
reporting provided a good source of information that was used in their marketing decisions. It was determined that
the monthly reporting will provide sufficient information to assist the Committee in its marketing efforts and if
any problems arise at a later date, alternate sources of obtaining this information on a weekly basis can be explored.
The Committee continues to believe, at this time, that it is more important to ensure that all handlers are properly
filing reports with the Committee and paying assessments that are due on a timely and equitable basis.

The interim final rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 13, 1994, [59 FR 1894]. That rule amended  955.101 of the rules and regulations in effect under the
order. That rule provided a 30-day comment period which ended February 14, 1994. No comments were received. 

Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.
 

The information collection requirements contained in these regulations have been previously approved by the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been assigned OMB Control Number 0581-0160.
 

After consideration of all relevant information presented, including the Committee's unanimous recommendation
and other information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act.

Mariel Cuban Parole Determinations



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule clarifies and expands the discretionary authority of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (the
Service), under the Cuban Review Plan, to withdraw parole approval for excludable Mariel Cubans where circumstances
make it impossible to execute the parole decision, and release of the detainee is contrary to the public interest.
It further provides for flexibility in the scheduling of parole reviews in the case of a new or returning Mariel Cuban
detainee whose previous immigration parole has been revoked. These changes are necessary to reduce administrative
costs and to clarify the status of the detainee whose parole decision cannot be implemented.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On May 7, 1991, a proposed rule to amend 8 CFR 212.12(e) and 212.12(g)(1), with request for public comments, was published
in the 

Federal Register,

 at 56 FR 21100. The comment period expired on June 6, 1991. The Service received four comments, representing the views
of an alien advocacy organization, a Federal Government agency, and private attorneys. The Service greatly appreciates
these comments. Each comment has been considered and some aspects of the comments have been taken into account in this
rule.



This rule will revise and expand the discretionary authority of the Service under 8 CFR part 212 to withdraw parole
approval previously authorized for excludable Mariel Cubans where circumstances warrant a reversal of the parole
approval decision. The proposed changes amend the current regulation, which does not provide the cases where sponsorship
is declined or appropriate sponsorship is unavailable. The amendments clarify the authority of the Associate Commissioner
for Enforcement to withdraw parole of a detainee prior to release for any appropriate reason, not merely because of
the detainee's conduct. Finally, the proposed changes will provide for greater flexibility in the parole review
process for Mariel Cubans who are subject to repatriation.

Only one comment was received on the proposed amendment to 8 CFR 212.12(g)(1). That comment suggested word changes
to the proposed amendment. The suggested change has been incorporated in the final rule, which replaces the phrase
``if such detainee's return to Cuba has been negotiated'' with ``if such detainee's prompt deportation is practicable
and proper.''

The remainder of the comments addressed the proposed changes to 8 CFR 212.12(e). One commenter indicated that the
detainee should not be advised of a release decision if the Service is aware that the few programs that are available
for the placement of released detainees will not accept those detainees. Unfortunately, this situation may arise
despite Service efforts to prevent its occurrence. It is beyond the scope of this rule to address that issue. However,
one commenter suggested that the panels making release decisions should be informed of the criteria used by the Community
Relations Service and the Public Health Service in determining whether an individual is suitable for their programs.
The Service has and will continue to address this issue with the review panels.

Two commenters expressed concern that those making the placement decisions sometimes rely on incomplete, outdated,
or inaccurate information. The Service attempts throughout the parole process to obtain updated, accurate information
and to make reasonable efforts to identify suitable sponsorship opportunities, as described in 8 CFR 212.12(f).
For example, detainees are asked at the time of each panel interview for the names of potential sponsors. In order to
further address this concern, however, the Service, where appropriate, may extend an additional opportunity to
detainees to demonstrate that there are unexplored reasonable sponsorship alternatives.

One commenter asserted that the proposed rule was too broad in scope. The commenter also faulted the proposal because
it does not require the Service to notify detainees of the reasons for withdrawal of parole approval, and advise them
of what efforts had been made to secure sponsorship. Furthermore, the commenter objected that the proposed rule does
not provide detainees with an opportunity to secure appropriate sponsorship. The Service has attempted to provide
such notification whenever possible in cases where suitable sponsorship has not been located. Such notification
specifies what sponsorship efforts have been made and the results of each attempt to secure suitable sponsorship.
Where appropriate, detainees may be provided with the opportunity to submit evidence of appropriate sponsorship
prior to withdrawal of parole approval. Further, if the detainee's parole approval is withdrawn, he or she will continue
to receive a yearly interview at which time he or she may advise the Service of any sponsorship opportunities.

This same commenter also asserted that the proposed rule fails to provide independent review of the decision to repatriate
an eligible detainee. It is beyond the scope of this regulation to address that issue. This rule deals solely with parole
of Mariel Cubans, rather than repatriation procedures and determinations.

One commenter contended that the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement should not be permitted to withdraw parole
approval for reasons that do not relate to the established guidelines for parole release. However, the revocation
authority exercised pursuant to 8 CFR 212.12(e) is identical to that which was granted by the Attorney General to the
Departmental Panels in 8 CFR 212.13. The ultimate criteria for the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement to follow
in determination of parole release under both 8 CFR 212.12(e) and 212.13 is set forth in section 212(d)(5)(A) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A). When a detainee cannot be sponsored by someone who can help
him or her integrate into the community, that fact is a significant consideration in determining whether the detainee's
release on parole is in the public interest. Without an appropriate support system, vocational training, and essential
social skills, the detainee will be unable in many instances to maintain acceptable behavior upon release. This difficulty
is recognized in 8 CFR 212.12(f), which prohibits release without suitable sponsorship or placement. The Service
is committed to the task of locating suitable placement for each detainee whose release has been approved. However,
administration of the Cuban Review Program has been severely handicapped by cases where suitable placement cannot
be secured. In such cases, the detainee remains in custody without any resolution of his or her status. In sponsorship
problem cases, parole approval will be withdrawn only after reasonable efforts to secure appropriate placement
and after the detainee, where appropriate, has been afforded an opportunity to demonstrate reasonable sponsorship
alternatives. The current process does not preclude the detainee from offering sponsorship alternatives. In fact,
many detainees do suggest sponsorship possibilities, particularly family sponsors, some of which may ultimately
be selected for placement. The Service retains final authority to evaluate sponsorship alternatives and to determine
whether release of a detainee is in the public interest.

Several commenters also expressed the hope that exhaustive efforts to locate appropriate sponsorship should be
made to ensure that those detainees who have been approved for release are actually released from custody. As indicated,
the Service will make reasonable efforts to ensure appropriate placement for each detainee approved for release.

One of these commenters also maintained that it is inappropriate to withdraw parole approval without a hearing. The
Service disagrees. See 

Alvarez-Mendez

 v. 

Stock,

 941 F.2d 956, 963 (9th Cir. 1991), 

cert. denied,

 113 U.S. 127 (1992); 

Fernandez-Roque

 v. 

Smith,

 734 F.2d 576, 582 (11th Cir. 1984). These court decisions establish that withdrawal of parole approval can be accomplished
without a hearing. Nevertheless, in cases of sponsorship problems, it is in the Government's best interest to explore
alternatives in order to reduce detention costs and to ensure the safe release of an individual into the community.
Detainees are encouraged to submit sponsorship alternatives to the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement, as
appropriate.

Where the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement determines that the inability to secure sponsorship is the sole
reason behind withdrawal of parole approval, he may, in the exercise of discretion, give the detainee notice of that
fact and the opportunity to present proposals for appropriate placement. This authority is made discretionary with
the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement to allow for cases where it would be inappropriate to delay the decision
to withdraw parole approval, such as where the detainee has previously provided erroneous or inappropriate information
relating to sponsorship.

The Service benefits from the detainee's submission of reasonable sponsorship alternatives by the potential for
reduction in detention costs. This also may assist the Service in securing the detainee's release pursuant to the
initial grant of parole approval. The sponsorship area is particularly amenable to input from the detainee, who may
be able to provide information of reasonable sponsorship opportunities otherwise unknown to the Service. The detainee's
participation in the placement process will help ensure that no detainee who is approved for parole continues in custody
where suitable sponsorship is available and where identifying that sponsorship is the only issue remaining in obtaining
release to the community.

An opportunity for the detainee to present information to the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement prior to withdrawal
of parole approval is only appropriate where the sole grounds for revocation is the Service's inability to locate
appropriate sponsorship. Under these narrow circumstances, it may prove beneficial to solicit any information
the detainee possesses in order to implement the parole decision. Where the detainee's parole has been revoked for
other reasons, it would be inappropriate and contrary to the public interest to delay the revocation decision in order
to solicit information from the detainee. For example, in cases where the misconduct of the detainee is the cause of
revocation of parole approval, immediate action is required in the interest of public safety.

One commenter was concerned that the proposed rule change could have a major impact on future political events involving
the relationship between the Governments of the United States and Cuba. This issue is beyond the scope of this rule.
Should the Cuban Review Plan be substantially changed or abolished, such action will be published, as appropriate,
in the 

Federal Register

.

One commenter expressed the view that insufficient programs exist as alternatives to detention. It is beyond the
scope of this rule to address this issue. It should be noted, however, that the Department continues to work with other
government agencies and private enterprise to develop additional programs.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Attorney General certifies that this rule will not have a significant adverse
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule affects only a class of Cuban Nationals in their

Special Conditions: Learjet, Inc., Model 45 Airplane, High Altitude Operation



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final special conditions.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

These special conditions are issued to Learjet Inc. of Wichita, KS, for the Learjet Inc., Model 45 airplane. This new
airplane has an unusual design feature associated with an unusually high operating altitude (51,000 feet), for which
the applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards. These special
conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level
of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background



On January 27, 1992, Learjet Inc., (Learjet), 8220 West Harry Street, Wichita, KS 67209-2942, or P.O. Box 7707,
Wichita, KS 67277-7707, applied for a new type certificate in the transport airplane category for the Model
45 airplane. The Learjet Model 45 is a T-tail, low wing, medium sized business jet powered by two Garrett TFE 731-20
turbofan engines mounted on pylons extending from the aft fuselage. Each engine will be capable of delivering 3,500
pounds thrust, with auto performance reserve 3,650 pounds thrust. The airplane will be capable of operating with
two flight crewmembers and a maximum of ten passengers (standard is eight passengers). The type design of the Learjet
Model 45 series airplanes contains a number of novel and unusual design features for an airplane type certificated
under the applicable provisions of part 25 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). Those features include the
relatively small passenger cabin volume and a high operating altitude. The applicable airworthiness requirements
do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Learjet 45 series airplanes; therefore, special
conditions are necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations.



Type Certification Basis



Under the provisions of  21.17 of the FAR, Learjet must show, except as provided in  25.2, that the Model
45 meets the applicable provisions of part 25, effective February 1, 1965, as amended by Amendments 25-1 through
25-75. In addition, the proposed certification basis for the Model 45 includes part 34, effective September
10, 1990, plus any amendments in effect at the time of certification; and part 36, effective December 1, 1969, as amended
by Amendments 36-1 through the amendment in effect at the time of certification. These special conditions will
form an additional part of the type certification basis. In addition, the certification basis may include other special
conditions that are not relevant to these special conditions.


If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain
adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Learjet Model 45 because of a novel or unusual design feature, special
conditions are prescribed under the provisions of  21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established
in the regulations.

Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with  11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as
required by   11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with  21.17(a)(2).



Novel or Unusual Design Feature



The Learjet Model 45 will incorporate an unusual design feature in that it will be certified to operate up to an altitude
of 51,000 feet.

The FAA considers certification of transport category airplanes for operation at altitudes greater than 41,000
feet to be a novel or unusual feature because current part 25 does not contain standards to ensure the same level of safety
as that provided during operation at lower altitudes. Special conditions have therefore been adopted to provide
adequate standards for transport category airplanes previously approved for operation at these high altitudes,
including certain Learjet models, the Boeing Model 747, Dassault-Breguet Falcon 900, Canadair Model 600, Cessna
Model 650, Israel Aircraft Industries Model 1125, and Cessna Model 560. The special conditions for the Cessna Model
650 or previously certified Learjet models are considered the most applicable to the Model 45 and its proposed operation
and are therefore used as the basis for the special conditions described below.

Damage tolerance methods are proposed to be used to assure pressure vessel integrity while operating at the higher
altitudes, in lieu of the 1/2-bay crack criterion used in some previous special conditions. Crack growth data are
used to prescribe an inspection program that should detect cracks before an opening in the pressure vessel would allow
rapid depressurization. Initial crack sizes for detection are determined under  25.571, as amended by Amendment
25-72. The maximum extent of failure and pressure vessel opening determined from the above analysis must be
demonstrated to comply with the pressurization section of the proposed special conditions, which state that the
cabin altitude after failure must not exceed the cabin altitude/time curve limits shown in Figures 3 and 4.

In order to ensure that there is adequate fresh air for crewmembers to perform their duties, to provide reasonable
passenger comfort, and to enable occupants to better withstand the effects of decompression at high altitudes, the
ventilation system must be designed to provide 10 cubic feet of fresh air per minute per person during normal operations.
Therefore, these special conditions require that crewmembers and passengers be provided with 10 cubic feet of fresh
air per minute per person. In addition, during the development of the supersonic transport special conditions, it
was noted that certain pressurization failures resulted in hot ram or bleed air being used to maintain pressurization.
Such a measure can lead to cabin temperatures that exceed human tolerance. Therefore, these special conditions require
airplane interior temperature limits following probable and improbable failures.

Continuous flow passenger oxygen equipment is certificated for use up to 40,000 feet; however, for rapid decompressions
above 34,000 feet, reverse diffusion leads to low oxygen partial pressures in the lungs, to the extent that a small
percentage of passengers may lose useful consciousness at 35,000 feet. The percentage increases to an estimated
60 percent at 40,000 feet, even with the use of the continuous flow system. Therefore, to prevent permanent physiological
damage, the cabin altitude must not exceed 25,000 feet for more than 2 minutes, or 40,000 feet for any time period. The
maximum peak cabin altitude of 40,000 feet is consistent with the standards established for previous certification
programs. In addition, at high altitudes the other aspects of decompression sickness have a significant, detrimental
effect on pilot performance (for example, a pilot can be incapacitated by internal expanding gases).
Decompression resulting in cabin altitudes above the 37,000-foot limit depicted in Figure 4 approaches the physiological
limits of the average person; therefore, every effort must be made to provide the pilots with adequate oxygen equipment
to withstand these severe decompressions. Reducing the time interval between pressurization failure and the time
the pilots receive oxygen will provide a safety margin against being incapacitated and can be accomplished by the
use of mask-mounted regulators. These special conditions therefore require pressure demand masks with mask-mounted
regulators for the flightcrew. This combination of equipment will provide the best practical protection for the
failures covered by the special conditions and for improbably failures not covered by the special conditions, provided
the cabin altitude is limited.


Discussion of Comments


Notice of proposed special conditions No. SC-93-8-NM was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67716). No comments were received, and the special conditions are adopted as proposed.


Conclusion


This action affects only certain unusual or novel design features on one model of airplane. It is not a rule of general
applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the airplane.

106(g).


The Special Conditions


Accordingly, the following special conditions are issued as part of the type certification basis for the Learjet
Model 45 series airplanes:


Operation to 51,000 Feet


1. 

Pressure vessel integrity. 

(a) The maximum extent of failure and pressure vessel opening that can be demonstrated to comply with paragraph 4 (Pressurization)
of this special condition must be determined. It must be demonstrated by crack propagation and damage tolerance analysis
supported by testing that a larger opening or a more severe failure than demonstrated will not occur in normal operations.
(b) Inspection schedules and procedures must be established to assure that cracks and normal fuselage leak rates
will not deteriorate to the extent that an unsafe condition could exist during normal operation.
(c) With regard to the fuselage structural design for cabin pressure capability above 45,000 feet altitude, the pressure
vessel structure, including doors and windows, must comply with  25.365(d), using a factor of 1.67 instead
of the 1.33 factor described.
2. 

Ventilation. 

In lieu of the requirements of  25.831(a), the ventilation system must be designed to provide a sufficient amount
of uncontaminated air to enable the crewmembers to perform their duties without undue discomfort or fatigue, and
to provide reasonable passenger comfort during normal operating conditions and also in the event of any probable
failure to any system that could adversely affect the cabin ventilating air. For normal operations, crewmembers
and passengers must be provided with at least 10 cubic feet of fresh air per minute per person, or the equivalent in filtered,
recirculated air based on the volume and composition at the corresponding cabin pressure altitude of not more than
8,000 feet.
3. 

Air conditioning. 

In addition to the requirements of  25.831, paragraphs (b) through (e), the cabin cooling system must be designed
to meet the following conditions during flight above 15,000 feet mean sea level (MSL): (a) After any probably failure,
the cabin temperature-time history may not exceed the values shown in Figure 1.
(b) After any improbable failure, the cabin temperature-time history may not exceed the values shown in Figure 2.
4. 

Pressurization. 

In addition to the requirements of  25.841, the following apply: (a) The pressurization system, which includes
for this purpose bleed air, air conditioning, and pressure control systems, must prevent the cabin altitude from
exceeding the cabin altitude-time history shown in Figure 3 after each of the following: (1) Any probable malfunction
or failure of the pressurization system. The existence of undetected, latent malfunctions or failures in conjunction
with probable failures must be considered.
(2) Any single failure in the pressurization system, combined with the occurrence of a leak produced by a complete
loss of a door seal element, or a fuselage leak through an opening having an effective area 2.0 times the effective area
that produces the maximum permissible fuselage leak rate approved for normal operation, whichever produces a more
severe leak.

(b) The cabin altitude-time history may not exceed that shown in Figure 4 after each of the following: (1) The maximum
pressure vessel opening resulting from an initially detectable crack propagating for a period encompassing four
normal inspection intervals. Mid-panel cracks and cracks through skin-stringer and skin-frame combinations must
be considered.

(2) The pressure vessel opening or duct failure resulting from probable damage (failure effect) while under maximum
operating cabin pressure differential due to a tire burst, engine rotor burst, loss of antennas or stall warning vanes,
or any probable equipment failure (bleed air, pressure control, air conditioning, electrical source(s), etc.)
that affects pressurization.

(3) Complete loss of thrust from all engines.

(c) In showing compliance with paragraphs 4(a) and 4(b) of these special conditions (Pressurization), it may be assumed
that an emergency descent is made by approved emergency procedure. A 17-second crew recognition and reaction time
must be applied between cabin altitude warning and the initiation of an emergency descent.







Note: 

For the flight evaluation of the rapid descent, the test article must have the cabin volume representative of what
is expected to be normal, such that Cessna must reduce the total cabin volume by that which would be occupied by the furnishings
and total number of people.





5. 

Oxygen equipment and supply. 

(a) A continuous flow oxygen system must be provided for the passengers.

(b) A quick-donning pressure demand mask with mask-mounted regulator must be provided for each pilot. Quick-donning
from the stowed position must be demonstrated to show that the mask can be withdrawn from stowage and donned within
5 seconds.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

These special conditions are issued for the SAAB Model 2000 airplane. This airplane will utilize certain fully hydraulically
powered electronically controlled flight control systems which are design features that are novel and unusual when
compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards of part 25 of the Federal Aviation Regulations

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background




On April 28, 1989, SAAB Aircraft AB of Sweden applied for an FAA Type Certification through the Swedish Luftfartsverket
(LFV) to the FAA, AEU-100, for the SAAB Model 2000 airplane. (The application for FAA Type Certificate was dated
June 9, 1989.)

The SAAB Model 2000 is a twin-engined, low-wing, pressurized turboprop aircraft that is configured for approximately
50 passengers and is intended for short to medium haul (100 nm to 1,000 nm). The airplane will have two new Allison GMA-2100
engines rated at 3650 shp. The propeller is a new 6 bladed Dowty Rotol swept shaped propeller. A single lever controls
each prop/engine combination. An Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) will be installed in the tail. The fuselage cross-section
will be the same as the SAAB Model 340. The fuselage skin will be thicker to handle greater pressures. The wing and empennage
are new and larger in all dimensions and the fuselage is longer when compared to the SAAB Model SF-340B. The new
cockpit will be a 5 or 6 screen CRT display with new Collins systems. There will be provisions for a Microwave Landing
System (MLS), Global Positioning System (GPS), Selective Calling (SELCAL), Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting
System (EICAS), and Traffic Collision and Avoidance System (TCAS). The landing gear system will be new. The airplane
will have provisions for two pilots, an observer, two flight attendants, overhead bins, a toilet, and provisions
for the installation of a galley. There will be a forward and aft stowage compartment and an aft cargo compartment.
The airplane will have a maximum operating altitude of 31,000 feet.


The SAAB Model 2000 will have a fully hydraulically powered electronically controlled rudder for initial certification
and will have fully hydraulically powered electronically controlled elevators as a follow-on design modification.

The rudder is hydraulically powered and electronically positioned without manual reversion modes. Pilots position
the rudder by pedal position transducers connected to the rudder pedals. The transducers supply rudder pedal position
to two electronic rudder control units which have two channels each. The rudder control units position two rudder
servos which control two actuators that drive the rudder. Parallel and cross channel signals provide redundancy.
The rudder limiting function is built into the rudder control units. The rudder system is checked by a preflight built
in test system (PBIT) and a continuous built in test system (CBIT). One pedal force cam unit (spring and cam) generates
artificial pedal forces. The pedal force cam unit is controlled by the trim actuator which in turn is controlled by
a relay connected to manual trim or automatic trim from the autopilot.

The rudders two hydraulic actuators are supplied by two hydraulic circuits and each circuit is driven by an engine
driven pump. To protect against common failures including engine burst, fire and tire/wheel failures, two back-up
pumps, two emergency shut-off valves, together with a transfer valve, have been added aft of the debris zones. The
back-up pumps are driven by a common motor with shear out features. Accumulators aft on both hydraulic circuits provide
further reserves against hydraulic power loss and loss of damping.

The rudder system is electrically supported by two redundant system sides, a left hand (LH) and a right hand (RH) side.
The electrical system is normally powered by two AC generators, each driven by a propeller gear box. An APU equipped
with a standby generator is optional. Each system side includes a DC system with a Transformer Rectifier Unit (TRU).
When only one TRU unit is working, the LH and RH buses are tied together with power being received from the remaining
TRU. Two DC feeders in addition to two AC feeders provide power aft of the debris zone. The DC feeders are supplied by
battery or a TRU unit. The LH is routed through the ceiling and the RH side is routed through the floor.

The proposed elevator system, to be introduced for follow-on certification, is in many respects similar to the rudder
design. Control columns, connected to Linear Variable Differential Transducers (LVDT), provide signals to two
Powered Elevator Control Units (PECU). The PECUs are connected to the Flight Control Computer, Air Data Computers
and servo actuators. Each PECU has built in test circuitry and two channels for direct control and crossmonitoring.



Type Certification Basis



The applicable requirements for U.S. type certification must be established in accordance with   21.16,
21.17, 21.19, 21.29, and 21.101 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). Accordingly, based on the application
date of June 9, 1989, the TC basis for the SAAB Model 2000 airplane is as follows:

Discussion



Effect of Flight Control Systems on Structure



The SAAB Model 2000 incorporates certain fly-by-wire (FBW) electronic flight control systems (EFCS). The rudder
system includes a yaw damper, rudder limiter, and an auto-trim function which can affect loads. The follow-on design
for the elevators has many similar features. System failures can lead to design load conditions not envisioned by
the certification rules for transport airplanes. These special conditions are issued to ensure the same level of
safety by providing comprehensive criteria in which the structural design safety margins are dependent on systems
reliability.



Discussion of Comments



Notice of Proposed Special Conditions No. SC-93-7-NM for the SAAB Model 2000 airplane was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on December 9, 1993 (58 FR 64700). One commenter (an organization representing professional pilots) responded.

``Our comments are fundamentally in support of the proposed special conditions. However, one commenter is concerned
regarding the reliability of providing hydraulic power by the two back-up pumps mentioned in the `Background' information.
This apprehension stems from the fact that both back-up pumps are powered from a common motor with shear out features.
The commenter questioned this system as redundant or a single point where the `system' could break down and not provide
the required hydraulic power necessary to operate the rudder. The commenter's concern extends to the elevators if
a similar design is used.''

The commenter's concern is addressed in the SAAB 2000 design. The SAAB 2000 can be flown without hydraulic power to
the rudder for most hydraulic failure conditions. However, if during takeoff, one engine fails, hydraulic power
is necessary to maintain control of the airplane. With this in mind, the SAAB design provides the rudder's two hydraulic
actuators with power from two independent hydraulic circuits. One actuator with one functioning circuit is capable
of driving the rudder if the other hydraulic circuit is lost.

Each hydraulic circuit is supplied by an engine driven pump, and for a short duration, power can also be supplied by
accumulators. Each circuit is isolated fore and aft by fuses in case the circuits are severed by engine debris. Each
circuit, aft of the fuse, has a back-up pump and an accumulator. The back-up pumps, driven by a common electric motor,
are activated by low hydraulic pressure in either hydraulic circuit. To protect the independence of the two hydraulic
circuits and to eliminate the single point where the ``system'' could break down, as expressed by the commenter, a
shear out feature is provided between each back-up pump and the common electric motor. As a further precaution, the
AC motor is automatically started (tested) as part of the preflight reliability check.

Regarding the commenter's concern for the elevator system, that system will have three hydraulic systems which have
many of the same features provided for the hydraulic systems supporting the rudder.



Conclusion



This action affects only certain unusual or novel design features on one model of airplane. It is not a rule of general
applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the airplane.

Final Special Conditions



Accordingly, the following special conditions are issued as part of the type certification basis for the SAAB Model
2000 airplane:



1. Interaction of Systems and Structures



(a) 

General

. For an airplane equipped with certain fully hydraulically powered electronically controlled flight control systems,
which directly, or as a result of a failure or malfunction, affect its structural performance, the influence of these
systems and their failure conditions shall be taken into account in showing compliance with subparts C and D of part
25 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR).

(b) 

System fully operative. 

With the system fully operative, the following apply: (1) Limit loads must be derived in all normal operating configurations
of the systems from all the deterministic limit conditions specified in subpart C, taking into account any special
behavior of such systems or associated functions or any effect on the structural performance of the airplane which
may occur up to the limit loads. In particular, any significant nonlinearity (rate of displacement of control surface,
thresholds or any other system non-linearities) must be accounted for in a realistic or conservative way when deriving
limit loads from limit conditions.

(2) The airplane must meet the strength requirements of part 25 (static strength, residual strength), using the specified
factors to derive ultimate loads from the limit loads defined above. The effect of nonlinearities must be investigated
beyond limit conditions to ensure the behavior of the systems presents no anomaly compared to the behavior below limit
conditions. However, conditions beyond limit conditions need not be considered when it can be shown that the airplane
has design features that make it impossible to exceed those limit conditions.

(3) The airplane must meet the aeroelastic stability requirements of  25.629.

(c) 

System in the failure condition. 

For any system failure condition not shown to be extremely improbable, the following apply:

(1) 

At the time of occurrence. 

Starting from 1-g level flight conditions, a realistic scenario, including pilot corrective actions, must
be established to determine the loads occurring at the time of failure and immediately after failure. The airplane
must be able to withstand these loads, multiplied by an appropriate factor of safety, related to the probability of
occurrence of the failure. These loads should be considered as ultimate loads for this evaluation. The factor of safety
is defined as follows:

 














(i) The loads must also be used in the damage tolerance evaluation required by  25.571(b) if the failure condition
is probable. The loads may be considered as ultimate loads for the damage tolerance evaluation.

(ii) Freedom from flutter and divergence must be shown at speeds up to V

D

, or 1.15 V

C

, whichever is greater. However, at altitudes where the speed is limited by Mach number, compliance need be shown only
up to M

D

, as defined by  25.335(b). For failure conditions which result in speed increases beyond V

C

/M

C

, freedom from flutter and divergency must be shown at increased speeds, so that the above margins are maintained.

(iii) Notwithstanding subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, failures of the system which result in forced structural
vibrations (oscillatory failures) must not produce peak loads that could result in permanent deformation of primary
structure.

(2) 

For the continuation of the flight

. For the airplane, in the failed configuration and considering any appropriate flight limitations, the following
apply: (i) Static and residual strength must be determined for loads induced by the failure condition if the loads
could continue to the end of the flight. These loads must be combined with the deterministic limit load conditions
specified in subpart C.

(ii) For static strength substantiation, each part of the structure must be able to withstand the loads in subparagraph
(2)(i) of this paragraph multiplied by a safety factor depending on the probability of being in this failure state.
The factor of safety is defined as follows:

(vi) If the time likely to be spent in the failure condition is not small compared to the damage propagation period,
or if the loads induced by the failure condition may have a significant influence on the damage propagation, then the
effects of the particular failure condition must be addressed and the corresponding inspection intervals adjusted
to adequately cover this situation.

(vii) If the mission analysis method is used to account for continuous turbulence, all the systems failure conditions
associated with their probability must be accounted for in a rational or conservative manner in order to ensure that
the probability of exceeding the limit load is not higher than the prescribed value of the current requirement.

(d) 

Warning considerations.

 For system failure detection and warning, the following apply: (1) Before flight, the system must be checked for failure
conditions, not extremely improbable, that degrade the structural capability below the level as intended in paragraph
(b) of this special condition. The crew must be made aware of these failures, if they exist, before flight.

(2) An evaluation must be made of the necessity to signal, during the flight, the existence of any failure condition
which could significantly affect the structural capability of the airplane and for which the associated reduction
in airworthiness can be minimized by suitable flight limitations. The assessment of the need for such signals must
be carried out in a manner consistent with the approved general warning philosophy for the airplane. 

(3) During flight, any failure condition, not shown to be extremely improbable, in which the safety factor existing
between the airplane strength capability and loads induced by the deterministic limit conditions of Subpart C of
part 25 is reduced to 1.3 or less must be signaled to the crew if appropriate procedures and limitations can be provided
so that the crew can take action to minimize the associated reduction in airworthiness during the remainder of the
flight.

(e) 

Dispatch with failure conditions.

 If the airplane is to be knowingly dispatched in a system failure condition that reduces the structural performance,
then operational limitations must be provided whose effects combined with those of the failure condition allow the
airplane to meet the structural requirements as described in paragraph (b) of this special condition. Subsequent
system failures must also be considered.

Discussion: This special condition is intended to be applicable to certain fully hydraulically powered electronically
controlled flight controls. The criteria provided by the special condition only address the direct structural consequences
of the systems responses and performances and therefore cannot be considered in isolation but should be included
into the overall safety evaluation of the airplane. The presentation of these criteria may in some instances duplicate
standards already established for this evaluation. The criteria are applicable to structure, the failure of which
could prevent continued safe flight and landing.

The following definitions are applicable to this special condition:




1. Structural performance: Capability of the airplane to meet the requirements of part 25.

2. Flight limitations: Limitations which can be applied to the airplane flight conditions following an inflight
occurrence and which are included in the flight manual (e.g., speed limitations, avoidance of severe weather conditions,
etc.).

3. Operational limitations: Limitations, including flight limitations, which can be applied to the airplane operating
conditions before dispatch (e.g., payload limitations).

4. Probabilistic terms: The probabilistic terms (probable, improbable, extremely improbable) used in this special
condition should be understood as defined in AC 25.1309-1.

5. Failure condition: The term failure condition is defined in AC 25.1309-1, however this special condition
applies only to system failure conditions which have a direct impact on the structural performance of the airplane
(e.g., failure conditions which induce loads or change the response of the airplane to inputs such as gusts or pilot
actions).

Establishment of Class D Airspace; Hailey, ID


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action proposes to establish Class D airspace at Friedman Memorial Airport, Hailey, Idaho. Midwest ATC Service,
Inc., operates a control tower at Friedman Memorial Airport with an associated airport traffic area. Airspace Reclassification,
which became effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and eliminated
those ATA's not already designated to become Class D Airspace. As a result, the requirement for two-way radio communication
with the control tower at Friedman Memorial Airport lapsed. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate
Class D airspace to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) operations and continue the two-way radio communication
requirement at Friedman Memorial Airport.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
History


On January 12, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) by establishing
the Hailey, Idaho, Class D airspace (59 FR 1680). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking
proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received.
Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``airspace traffic
area,'' replacing it with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' Class D airspace areas are published in Paragraph
5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document will be published
subsequently in the Order.


The Rule


This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes the Class D airspace at Friedman Memorial
Airport, Hailey, Idaho. Midwest ATC Service, Inc., operates a control tower at Friedman Memorial Airport with an
associated airport traffic area (ATA). Airspace Reclassification, which became effective September 16, 1993,
discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and, for control zones with operating control towers, replaced
it with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' Only ATA's already designated to become Class D airspace continued
to exist; Friedman Memorial Airport was not so designated. As a result, the requirement for two-way radio communication
with the control tower at Friedman Memorial Airport lapsed. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate
Class D airspace to contain IFR operations and continue the two-way communication requirement at Friedman Memorial
Airport.
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Removal of National Security-Based Validated License Requirements for Exports to Proscribed Destinations of Oil
Well Perforators 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Export Administration, Commerce.

 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule amends ECCN 1C18A to remove national security-based validated license requirements for exports
to Country Groups Q, W, Y, and Z and the People's Republic of China of certain oil well perforators. This action is a result
of a determination that foreign availability exists for certain oil well perforators within the meaning of section
5(f) of the Export Administration Act (EAA), as amended, and part 791 of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).
The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) published an interim rule in the 

Federal Register

 on November 23, 1993 (58 FR 61806), that included the foreign availability determination and removed national security-based
validated license requirements for exports of these oil well perforators to Country Groups T and V, except the People's
Republic of China. 



A validated export license continues to be required for exports to Iran, Syria, Country Groups S and Z, and the South
African military and police, for foreign policy reasons. 

This rule will eliminate export license applications for these oil well perforators for all but a few countries, thereby
reducing the paperwork burden on exporters. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Section 5(f)(3) of the EAA and part 791 of the EAR set forth the procedures and criteria for determining the foreign
availability of items controlled for national security reasons. The Secretary of Commerce, or the Secretary's designee,
is authorized to determine whether foreign availability exists. 

With limited exceptions, the Department of Commerce may not maintain national security controls on exports of an
item when the Department determines that items of comparable quality are available, in fact, to countries from foreign
sources in quantities sufficient to render the controls ineffective in achieving their purpose. 



On June 21, 1993, the Office of Foreign Availability (OFA) initiated a foreign availability assessment of oil well
perforators controlled by ECCN 1C18A in response to a claim filed pursuant to Part 791 of the EAR. The Department published
a notice of the initiation of the assessment in the 

Federal Register

 on July 28, 1993 (58 FR 40407). 

On October 18, 1993, the Acting Assistant Secretary, having considered the assessment and other relevant information
provided by OFA, determined that foreign availability of certain oil well perforators exists within the meaning
of section 5(f) of the EAA and part 791 of the EAR. The Department provided all interested agencies an opportunity to
review and comment on the assessment and determination. On November 8, 1993, based on discussions with other agencies,
the Acting Assistant Secretary clarified the scope of oil well perforators covered by the foreign availability determination,
as provided for in the EAA.

On November 23, 1993, the Department published an interim rule containing the foreign availability determination.
This rule removed validated licensing requirements for exports to most non-proscribed destinations (i.e. Country
Groups T and V, except for Iran, Syria, and the People's Republic of China) for oil well perforators controlled by 1C18A,
and made them eligible for export under General License GFW.

Effective March 18, 1994, these oil well perforators are eligible for export under General License G-DEST to all destinations
except Cuba, North Korea, Libya, Iran, Syria, and the South African military and police.

Exporters should also be aware that the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control maintains an
embargo on other destinations, such as Iraq, Haiti, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).

In the course of the foreign availability study, the U.S. determined that there was not unanimous agreement that these
oil well perforators were, in fact, controlled under the COCOM International Munitions List. Consistent with the
foreign availability procedures, the United States has notified COCOM that it is removing national security controls
on these oil well perforators.

This final rule amends ECCN 1C18A by revising the GFW paragraph in the Requirements section to remove GFW eligibility
for certain oil well perforators. General License GFW no longer applies to these oil well perforators because they
may now be exported under General License G-DEST to most destinations. 

This rule also creates a new ECCN 1C93F for shaped charges specially designed for oil well operations, utilizing one
charge functioning along a single axis, that upon detonation produce a hole, and: (a) Contain any formulation of RDX,
PYX, PETN, HNS, or HMX; and (b) have only a uniformly shaped conical liner with an included angle of 90 degrees or less;
and (c) have a total explosive mass of no more than 90 grams; and (d) have a diameter not exceeding three inches.

These changes are controlled for foreign policy reasons to Country Groups S and Z, Iran, Syria, and the South African
military and police. The creation of ECCN 1C93F does not constitute a new control.



Rulemaking Requirements



1. This rule was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866.

2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0694-0005,
0694-0007, and 0694-0010.

3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
assessment under Executive Order 12612.

4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this
rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under section 3(a) of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has
to be or will be prepared.

5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the
opportunity for public participation, and a delay in the effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation
involves a military or foreign affairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does not require that
this rule be published in proposed form because this rule does not impose a new control. Further, no other law requires
that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule.

Provisional Exemption From Registration for Certain List I Chemical Handlers 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Justice.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule. 

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under the provisions of the Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993 (DCDCA), which was enacted on December
17, 1993, and becomes effective April 16, 1994, any person who manufactures, distributes, imports or exports a list
I chemical (formerly known as a precursor chemical), or who proposes to do so, must first obtain a registration. 



Since regulations implementing the DCDCA may not be finalized by April 16, 1994, DEA is establishing a temporary exemption
from the registration requirement for any person who must register under the DCDCA. The exemption will stay in effect
for each affected person until DEA has either approved the person's application for registration or the Administrator
has issued a final order regarding the application, provided that the person makes proper application for registration
within 45 days of the effective date of the regulations implementing the DCDCA. Failure to submit to a proper application
within this time period will invalidate the exemption. At this time, affected persons are requested to submit to DEA
a notice of their intent to seek registration.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On December 17, 1993, the Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993 was enacted. The DCDCA redesignates precursor
chemicals and essential chemicals in Title 21, section 802, as list I chemicals and list II chemicals respectively,
and requires that any person who manufactures, distributes, imports or exports a list I chemical shall obtain an annual
registration from DEA for each location where such activities are carried out. 



The DCDCA also removes the exemption from the definition of a regulated transaction for drugs marketed or distributed
under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act which either, (1) contain ephedrine or its salts, optical isomers, or salts of
optical isomers either as the only active medicinal ingredient or in combination with therapeutically insignificant
quantities of another active medicinal ingredient, or (2) contain another listed chemical which DEA has determined
is being diverted to obtain the listed chemical for use in the manufacture of a controlled substance. As a result, any
person who manufactures, imports, exports or distributes, either by wholesale or retail sales, any drug described
above will be required to register and will also be subject to the applicable requirements of the DCDCA and title 21,
Code of Federal Regulations, parts 1310 and 1313, when the DCDCA becomes effective on April 16, 1994. Those persons
manufacturing, distributing, importing, or exporting drugs distributed or marketed under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act which contain ephedrine in combination with therapeutically significant quantities of another drug will remain
exempt from the requirements of the DCDCA and the applicable portions of title 21 of the regulations. 

The DCDCA also establishes certain other requirements with respect to listed chemicals which will be addressed in
a separate 

Federal Register

 notice proposing the establishment of regulations implementing the DCDCA. 

In the event that the regulations and administrative mechanisms to implement the DCDCA are not finalized prior to
the April 16, 1994 effective date, DEA is establishing a temporary exemption from the registration requirement for
affected persons who manufacture, distribute, import or export list I chemicals. Each affected person will be exempted
from the registration requirement until they have made proper application for registration with DEA, provided such
application is made within 45 days after the effective date of the regulations implementing the DCDCA, and that application
has either been approved by DEA or the Administrator has issued a final order regarding the application following
a full administrative proceeding pursuant to sections 823 and 824 of the Controlled Substances Act. Failure to make
proper application within the specified time period will result in loss of the exemption. Further, the exemption
will apply only to the requirement to register which goes into effect in April 16, 1994. All other requirements of the
DCDCA become effective on April 16, 1994, and the requirements of parts 1310 and 1313 of title 21 of the regulations
will remain in full force and effect. The change in the designation of the regulated chemicals from precursor and essential
to list I and list II chemicals will have no effect on the requirements of parts 1310 and 1313. 

To assist DEA in ensuring that the necessary information regarding registration and application forms reaches the
affected persons, these persons are requested to notify DEA at this time of their intent to register for their activities.
The notice should reflect the name under which business is conducted, the address at which the list I chemical activities
are conducted, the type of activity (i.e., manufacture, distribute, import or export), and the specific list I chemical(s)
involved. Notice should be submitted for each separate physical location at which such activities are carried out.
Notices should be sent to: 

Drug Enforcement Administration, Chemical Operations Section, Office of Diversion Control, Washington, DC 20537.

With respect to persons who manufacture list I chemicals, DEA has made a preliminary determination that registration
will not be required for persons who manufacture a list I chemical solely for internal consumption with no subsequent
distribution or exportation of the List I chemical. Those persons who manufacture a list I chemical for distribution
will be required to register. Specific details regarding DEA's determination will be set forth in the 

Federal Register

 notice proposing the regulations to implement the DCDCA.

The Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration hereby certifies that this interim rulemaking
will have no significant impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility
Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. This interim rulemaking grants a temporary exemption from the registration requirements
of the DCDCA pending completion of the regulatory amendments necessary to implement the DCDCA.

This rule is not a significant regulatory action and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and
Budget pursuant to Executive Order 12866.

This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in Executive Order 12612, and it has been
determined that the interim rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of
a Federalism Assessment.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans Florida: Approval of Revisions to Florida Regulations



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving revisions to the Florida State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. These revisions were submitted
to EPA through the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation (FDER) on January 8, 1993, and revise regulations
for Stage I vapor recovery (Stage I) in Florida's SIP and add regulations pertaining to Stage II vapor recovery (Stage
II). This plan has been submitted by the FDER to satisfy the requirement of section 182(b)(3) of the 1990 Clean Air Act,
which requires all ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or above to require owners and operators of gasoline
dispensing facilities to install and operate Stage II vapor recovery systems. FDER has also submitted this plan as
an integral part of the program to achieve and maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone,
carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. EPA proposed approval of these revisions on December 14, 1993, (58 FR 65307),
and no comments were received. 
These regulations meet all of EPA's requirements for Stage II programs and therefore EPA is approving the SIP revisions.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On November 15, 1990, the President signed into law the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The Clean Air Act as amended
in 1990 (CAA) includes new requirements for the improvement of air quality in ozone nonattainment areas. Under section
181(a) of the CAA, nonattainment areas were categorized by the severity of the area's ozone problem, and progressively
more stringent control measures were required for each category of higher ozone concentrations. The basis for classifying
an area in a specific category was the ambient air quality data obtained in the three year period 1987-1989. The
CAA delineates in section 182 the SIP requirements for ozone nonattainment areas based on their classifications.
Specifically, section 182(b)(3) requires areas classified as moderate to implement Stage II controls unless and
until EPA promulgates On Board Vapor Recovery (OBVR) regulations pursuant to section 202(a)(6) of the CAA. Based
on consultation with the National Highway Transportation Safety Board, EPA determined that OBVR were unsafe and
therefore moderate areas must implement a Stage II program. On January 22, 1993, the United States Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia ruled that EPA's previous decision not to require OBVR controls be set aside and that OBVR
regulations be promulgated pursuant to section 202(a)(6) of the CAA. Subsequently, EPA reached a settlement with
the plaintiffs which required EPA to promulgate final regulations by January 22, 1994. After such promulgation,
moderate areas will not be required to implement Stage II regulations, but Florida has indicated that the State intends
to continue Stage II as part of its long term maintenance plan. The EPA Administrator signed the OBVR final rule on January
24, 1994. Under section 182(b)(3), EPA was required to issue guidance as to the effectiveness of Stage II systems.
In November 1991, EPA issued technical and enforcement guidance to meet this requirement. These two documents are
entitled ``Technical Guidance-Stage II Vapor Recovery Systems for Control of Vehicle Refueling Emissions at Gasoline
Dispensing Facilities'' (EPA-450/3-91-022) and ``Enforcement Guidance for Stage II Vehicle
Refueling Control Programs.'' In addition, on April 16, 1992, EPA published the ``General Preamble for the Implementation
of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990'' (57 FR 13498). The guidance documents and the General Preamble discuss
Stage II statutory requirements and indicate what EPA believes a State submittal needs to include to meet those requirements.
The Florida regulations meet those requirements and are discussed below.



Rule 17-252, Gasoline Vapor Recovery 


Stage II


The Southeast Florida Air Quality region is designated nonattainment for ozone and classified as moderate. See 56
FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (November 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.300 through 81.437. Under section
182(b)(3) of the CAA, Florida was required to submit Stage II vapor recovery rules for this area by November 15, 1992.
On January 8, 1993, FDER submitted to EPA Stage II vapor recovery rules that were adopted by the State on December 9,
1992, and the rules became state effective January 21, 1993. The Florida regulation meets all EPA requirements (see
proposal, December 14, 1993, 58 FR 65307). Additional information is contained in the Technical Support Document
(TSD) which is available for review in the EPA Region IV office. 



Stage I


The Stage I regulations have been amended to require Stage I vapor recovery at all facilities subject to the Stage II
requirements in areas which are designated as a nonattainment or maintenance area for ozone under Rule 17-275,
F.A.C. (Broward, Dade, Duval, Hillsborough, Palm Beach, and Pinellas Counties). The gasoline tanker truck section
was also revised to require submerged filling at bulk plants and facilities required to have Stage I and II vapor recovery.
These revisions are consistent with EPA policy and requirements.



Final Action


EPA is approving the above referenced revisions as meeting the requirements of section 182(b)(3) of the CAA. All of
the revisions are consistent with EPA guidance. 
This document makes final the action proposed at (58 FR 65307). As noted elsewhere in this document, EPA received no
adverse public comment on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified this
action from Table 2 to Table 3 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989.

This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements
of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and
Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request
continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed
in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by May 23,1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration
by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2).)

Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall
be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to
relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small non-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements,
I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the
Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal
inquiry into the 
 economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

Approval and Promulgation of State Implementation Plans: Alaska



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Alaska Department of Environmental
Conservation (ADEC) for the purpose of bringing about the attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM

10

). The SIP revision was submitted to EPA by ADEC on June 22, 1993 to satisfy certain Federal Clean Air Act requirements
for an approvable moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area SIP for Mendenhall Valley, Alaska. EPA is also approving the contingency measures submitted
by the state of Alaska for the Mendenhall Valley and Eagle River moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas. This action to approve this plan has the effect of making requirements adopted by the ADEC federally
enforceable by EPA. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Background


The Mendenhall Valley, Alaska area was designated nonattainment for PM

10

 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990.

1

 See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991). The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D, title I of the Act.

2

 EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIP's and SIP
revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including those state submittals containing moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area SIP requirements. See generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992); see also 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992).







On December 22, 1993 EPA announced its proposed approval of the moderate nonattainment area PM

10

 SIP for Mendenhall Valley, Alaska and the contingency measures submitted for Mendenhall Valley and Eagle River Alaska
(58 FR 13572-13575). In that rulemaking action, EPA described its interpretations of title 1 and its rationale
for proposing to approve the PM

10

 SIP revisions, taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. 
Those states containing initial moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas (those areas designated nonattainment under section 107(d)(4)(B)) were required to submit,
among other things, the following provisions by November 15, 1991:

 

1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions
from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control
technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 
2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously
as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;

3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every three years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress
(RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and

4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM

10

 also apply to major stationary sources of PM

10

 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM

10

 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act. 
Some provisions were due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas were required to submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 which became effective without
further action by the state or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the
PM

10

 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline (see section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR 13543-13544).


II. Response To Comments


EPA received no comments on its December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67754-67759) 

Federal Register

 proposal to approve the Mendenhall Valley moderate nonattainment area PM

10

 SIP and contingency measures for Mendenhall Valley and Eagle River as revisions. 


III. This Action


Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review and processing of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-13566).
In this action, EPA is approving the plan submitted to 
EPA on June 22, 1993 which contains the Mendenhall Valley contingency measures, and the Eagle River contingency measures
submitted to EPA on January 13, 1992. EPA has determined that the submittals meet all of the applicable requirements
of the Act. Among other things, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation has demonstrated the Mendenhall
Valley moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area will attain the PM

10

 NAAQS by December 31, 1994.


IV. Administrative Review


This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent
waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's
request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on
September 30, 1993.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit May 23, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2))

Approval and Promulgation of Emission Statement Implementation Plan for Oregon 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing full approval of Oregon's state implementation plan (SIP)
submitted for the purpose of implementing an emission statement program for stationary sources within the Portland
ozone nonattainment area. The implementation plan was submitted by the state to satisfy the Federal requirements
for an emission statement program as part of the SIP for Oregon.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background


The air quality planning and state implementation plan (SIP) requirements for ozone nonattainment and transport
areas are set out in subparts I and II of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 (CAA or ``the Act''). 
EPA has also issued a draft guidance document describing the requirements for the emission statement programs discussed
in this document, entitled ``Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program'' (July, 1992). The
Agency is also conducting a rulemaking process to modify 40 CFR part 40 to reflect the requirements of the emission
statement program. 
Section 182 of the Act sets out a graduated control program for ozone nonattainment areas. Section 182(a) sets out
requirements applicable in Marginal nonattainment areas, which are also made applicable in subsections (b), (c),
(d), and (e) to all other ozone nonattainment areas. Among the requirements in section 182(a) is a program in paragraph
(3) of that subsection for stationary sources to prepare and submit to the state each year emission statements showing
actual emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO

x

). This paragraph provides that the states are to submit a revision to their state implementation plans (SIPs) by November
15, 1992 establishing this emission statement program.
The CAA requires facilities to submit the first emission statement to the state within three years after November
15, 1990, and annually thereafter. The minimum emission statement data should include: certification of data accuracy;
source identification information; operating schedule; emissions information (to include annual and typical
ozone season day emissions); control equipment information; and process data. EPA developed emission statement
data elements to be consistent with other source and state reporting requirements. This consistency is essential
to assist states with quality assurance for emission estimates and to facilitate consolidation of all EPA reporting
requirements.



II. Analysis of State Submission


There are several key general and specific components of an acceptable emission statement program. Specifically,
the state must submit a revision to its SIP and the emission statement program must meet the minimum requirements of
the CAA. 
In general, the program must include, at a minimum, provisions for applicability, definitions, compliance, and
specific source requirements detailed below.


A. SIP Revision Submission 


The Act requires states to observe certain procedural requirements in developing the implementation plans and plan
revisions for submission to EPA. Sections 110(a)(2) and 110(l) of the Act provides that each implementation plan
and plan revision submitted by a state must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.
EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see
section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix
V. EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, a submittal
is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months after receipt of
the submission.
After providing adequate public notice and holding a public hearing, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality
(ODEQ) submitted an emission statement SIP revision on November 16, 1992. A revised submittal was signed and submitted
by the Governor's designee (Director of ODEQ) on November 15, 1993. Prior to the Director's signature, the state provided
adequate public notice and public hearings (June 28 and August 17, 1993) on the emission statement SIP revision. EPA
received an official SIP submitted by the Director of ODEQ on November 15, 1993. The November 15, 1993 submittal wholly
superseded the November 16, 1992 SIP revision and therefore is the subject of this proposal.
The November 15, 1993 SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance
with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991).
The submittal was found to be complete on December 20, 1993.


B. Program Elements

Oregon's emission statement program contains provisions covering applicability of the regulations, definitions
of key terms used in the regulations, a compliance schedule for sources covered by the regulations, and the specific
reporting requirements for sources. In accordance with the Act and with a portion of the suggested guidelines, Oregon
conforms by dictating that the emission statement submitted by the source should contain, at a minimum, a certification
that the information is accurate to the best knowledge of the individual certifying the statement, source identification
information and emissions information. The ODEQ requires the submission of data from the sources no later than February
28 of each year or the due date for the annual permit report specified in the source's Air Contaminant Discharge Permit.
In addition, sources subject to these rules shall keep records at the plant site containing all applicable operating
data, process rate data, and control equipment efficiency information and other information used to calculate or
estimate actual emissions, and shall be available for ODEQ's review, or submitted upon request. Such records shall
be kept by the owner or operator for three calendar years after submittal of the emission statement.


C. Sources Covered 


The states may waive, with EPA approval, the requirement for emission statements for classes or categories of sources
with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide NO

x

 or VOC emissions in nonattainment areas if the class or category is included in the base year and periodic inventories
and emissions are calculated using emission factors established by EPA (such as those found in EPA publication AP-42)
or other methods acceptable to EPA. States should get clearance from the appropriate EPA Regional Office to waive
the emission statement requirement for these smaller sources. Oregon's rule applies to sources of VOC and NOx in ozone
nonattainment areas, with a Plant Site Emission Limit (PSEL) 25 tons or greater per year for either pollutant, and
to any source whose actual emissions are equal to or greater than 25 tons per year. EPA believes this is sufficient to
meet the requirements of the CAA.


D. Enforceability 


All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the state and EPA. The EPA criteria addressing the
enforceability of SIP's and SIP revisions were stated in a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from
J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al. (see 57 FR 13541). SIP provisions must also
contain a program that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section
110(a)(2)(C)). 
The state of Oregon has a program in its SIP that will ensure that the requirements of section 182(a)(3)(B) and sections
184(b)(2) and 182(f) for emission statement measures contained in the SIP are adequately enforced. The ODEQ will
supply sources with guidance and an example on how to submit emission reports, informing sources to attach this information
with the annual permit report. The enforcement section of ODEQ will follow through with violators by sending out notices
of compliance and fines accordingly. EPA expects that the state's existing air enforcement program will be adequate.


III. Final Action


Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-66).
EPA is approving Oregon's emission statement SIP revision submitted to EPA on November 15, 1993 because it meets all
of the applicable requirements of the CAA.


IV. Administrative Review


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not



create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because
the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact
on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation
of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state
action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. 

Union Electric Co.

 v. 

U.SE.P.A.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).


Because EPA considers this action noncontroversial and routine, we are approving it without prior proposal. The
action will become effective on May 23, 1994. However, if we receive notice by April 25, 1994 that someone wishes to
submit adverse comments, then EPA will publish: (1) A document that withdraws the action; and (2) a document that begins
a new rulemaking by proposing the action and establishing a comment period.
Nothing is this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic and 
environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from 
Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general
public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions
(54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request
for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time
as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order
12291 on
September 30, 1993.
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by May 23, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be
challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(2))

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of C.I. Pigment Violet #23
(Carbazole Violet; CAS Registry No. 6358-30-1), C.I. Pigment Blue #15 (CAS Registry No. 147-14-8), C.I. Pigment
Green #7 (CAS Registry No. 1328-53-6), and FD & C Red No. 40 (CAS Reg. No. 25956-17-6) when used as inert ingredients
(dyes, coloring agents) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops only.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of June 30, 1993 (58 FR 34973), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that Becker-Underwood, Inc., 801 Dayton
Ave., Ames, IA 50010, had submitted pesticide petitions (PP) 2E4129, 2E4130, and 2E4131 requesting that the Administrator,
pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), amend 40 CFR 180.1001(d)
by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of C.I. Pigment Violet #23 (Carbazole
Violet; Cas Registry No. 6358-30-1), C.I. Pigment Blue #15 (CAS Registry No. 147-14-8), and C.I. Pigment Green #7
(CAS Registry No. 1328-53-6) when used as inert ingredients (dyes, coloring agents) in pesticide formulations applied
to growing crops only. The proposal also noted that Gustafson, Inc., P.O. Box 660065, Dallas, TX 75266-0065, had requested
a tolerance exemption for FD & C Red No. 40 (CAS Reg. No. 25956-17-6).


Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active.

One comment was received in response to the proposed rule. The commenter was concerned that there would be inadequate
monitoring of impurities in the pigments and dyes. Specifically, the commenter cited the possibility of toxic contaminants
contained in C.I. Pigment Violet #23, C.I. Pigment Green #7, and C.I. Pigment Blue #15 as a result of the manufacturing
processes used. The commenter addressed the possible contamination of C.I. Pigment Violet #23 with polychlorinated
dibenzo-

p

-dioxin and/or polychlorinated dibenzofuran (as a result of the basic reactant chloranil) and contamination of
C.I. Pigment Green #7 and C.I. Pigment Blue #15 with polychlorinated biphenyls. The commenter requested that a mechanism
be included in the regulation to ensure that pigments made from contaminated intermediates not be sanctioned. 
As a result of this comment, the Agency has included previously specified limits (Significant New Use Rule (SNUR),
published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 12, 1993 (58 FR 27980)) in the regulations for C.I. Pigment Violet #23, C.I. Pigment Blue #15, and C.I. Pigment
Green #7 restricting the contamination of C.I. Pigment Violet #23 by polychlorinated dibenzo-

p

-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, and restricting the contamination of C.I. Pigment Blue #15 and C.I.
Pigment Green #7 by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB)s. These limits were developed to bar use of contaminated intermediates
in the production of these pigments. In addition, the exemptions for C.I. Pigment Violet #23, C.I. Pigment #15, and
C.I. Pigment #7 have also been limited to seed treatment, as originally requested by Becker-Underwood, Inc.
The data submitted in the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemption will protect the
public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemption is establised as set forth below. 
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). 
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof, or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat.
1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising
tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Pesticide Tolerance for Metsulfuron Methyl




<AGENCY>

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document establishes a tolerance for the combined residues of the herbicide metsulfuron methyl and its metabolite
in or on the raw agricultural commodity sugarcane. The regulation to establish a maximum permissible level for residues
of the herbicide in or on the commodity was requested in a petition submitted by the Interregional Research Project
No. 4 (IR-4). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64536), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that the Interregional Research Project
No. 4 (IR-4), New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, P.O. Box 231, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903,
had submitted pesticide petition 2E4094 to EPA on behalf of the Agricultural Experiment Station of Hawaii requesting
the Administrator under section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a(e)) to propose establishing
a tolerance for residues of metsulfuron methyl (methyl 2-[[[[(4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino]
carbonyl]amino]sulfonyl] benzoate) and its metabolite methyl 2-[[[[(4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino]carbonyl]amino]sulfonyl]-4-hydroxybenzoate
in or on the raw agricultural commodity sugarcane at 0.05 part per million (ppm).



There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance will protect the public
health. Therefore, the tolerance is established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Action: 

Technical amendment.









Summary: 

EPA is amending recordkeeping instructions in order to match those unit of measurement codes and handling codes used
by hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities to report to EPA on the Part A Permit Application Form
with the codes used to maintain records on-site by these facilities. This technical amendment also adds additional
handling codes to allow for the proper recording of those processes relating to Boilers and Industrial Furnaces and
Miscellaneous Units (subpart X) facilities. This amendment will encourage the consistent recordkeeping and reporting
of information by hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities. 







Effective Date: 

March 24, 1994.






Addresses: 

All comments concerning this technical amendment should be addressed to Jeffrey Gaines, Assistance Branch, Permits
and State Program Division (5303W), Office of Solid Waste, U.S. EPA, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460.

 Liza Hearns, (202) 260-3393.






Supplementary Information:

 For several years, the disposal process codes listed in Appendix I of 40 CFR parts 264 and 265 have been different from
those listed on the 

Part A Permit Application

 form. In consultation with State, Regional and Headquarters personnel, it was determined that changing the CFR to
match the forms was the appropriate step to take. Therefore, the Office of Solid Waste has prepared this technical
amendment to appendix I of 40 CFR parts 264 and 265 to modify those process codes (also referred to as handling codes)
listed in the CFR so that they match those codes used on the 

Part A Permit Application

 form.

South Pacific Tuna Fisheries


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NMFS adopts the interim final rule implementing revisions to the annexes to the Treaty on Fisheries Between the Governments
of Certain Pacific Island States and the Government of the United States of America (Treaty) as final with one change.
As a result of public comments, NMFS hereby modifies the definition of Treaty.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The background and specifics of the Treaty have been published (54 FR 4033, January 27, 1989; 56 FR 19312, April 26,
1991; 58 FR 33565, June 18, 1993) and are not repeated here. The South Pacific Tuna Act, 16 U.S.C. Chapter 16C (Act),
authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to issue regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes and objectives
of the Treaty. The Treaty was signed in 1987 by the United States and member states of the South Pacific Forum Fisheries
Agency (FFA). The 16 island nations participating under the Treaty and collectively referred to as the Pacific Island
Parties are Australia, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Republic of Kiribati, Republic of the
Marshall Islands, Republic of Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Republic of Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Kingdom
of Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Western Samoa. The Treaty authorizes U.S. tuna vessels to fish within fishing zones
of a large region of the South Pacific. NMFS is responsible for most of the day-to-day operational aspects of the United
States obligations under the Treaty; the Department of State is responsible for the formal country-to-country contacts
under the Treaty. On May 13, 1992, negotiations were concluded to amend and extend for 10 years: (1) The Annexes to the
Treaty, and (2) schedule 2 to Annex II of the Treaty. On June 18, 1993, NMFS published an interim final rule that implemented
the May 1992 amendments (58 FR 33565).


This rule adopts as final the interim final rule published on June 18, 1993, with one minor change regarding the definition
of Treaty. This change was suggested based on public comment and is described below.


Comments and Responses


The only comment on the interim final rule was received from the Department of State. The commenter pointed out that
the Annexes to the Treaty were not amended on May 13, 1992, as implied in the definition of Treaty as revised by NMFS's
interim final rule; only the negotiations were concluded. He suggested deleting the reference to May 13, 1992, in
the new definition of Treaty. NMFS agrees and has deleted the date from the definition. (Subsequently, the Annex revisions
were ratified, effective June 15, 1993).


Classification


Because it involves a foreign affairs function of the United States, this action is not subject to section 553 of the
Administrative Procedure Act. Thus, this rule may be made immediately effective.

Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for species that comprise the shallow water species fishery by vessels using
trawl gear in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), except directed fishing for pollock by vessels using pelagic trawl gear in those
portions of the GOA that remain open to directed fishing for pollock. This action is necessary because the first seasonal
allowance of Pacific halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) apportioned to the shallow water trawl fishery category
in the GOA has been caught.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the GOA 
exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce 
according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the 
Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery 
Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is 
governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 
and 672. 



An emergency interim rule (58 FR 6222, February 10, 1994) apportioned the Pacific halibut PSC limit for trawl gear
into bycatch allowances and seasonal apportionments thereof among fishery categories. In accordance with  672.20(f)(3)(iii)
the shallow water species fishery, which is defined at  672.20(f)(3)(ii)(A) was apportioned 500 mt of Pacific
halibut PSC for the first season, the period January 20, 1994, through March 31, 1994. 

The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, 
in accordance with  672.20(f)(3)(iv), that vessels participating in the trawl shallow water species fishery
in the GOA have caught the first seasonal allowance of Pacific halibut PSC apportioned to that fishery. Therefore,
NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for each species and species group that comprise the shallow water species fishery
by vessels using trawl gear in the GOA, except directed fishing for pollock by vessels using pelagic trawl gear in those
portions of the GOA that remain open to directed fishing for pollock. The species and species groups that comprise
the shallow water species fishery are: Pollock, Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, Atka mackerel,
and ``other species''. This closure is effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., March 21, 1994, through 12 noon, A.l.t., March
31, 1994.

ACTION:

 Decision concerning petition for reconsideration.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On June 3, 1992, EPA issued a final rule revising 40 CFR part 61, subpart R, the National Emission Standard for Radon
Emissions From Phosphogypsum Stacks (57 FR 23305, June 3, 1992). The Fertilizer Institute (TFI) filed a petition
seeking reconsideration of the 1992 rule pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B). This notice sets forth the
Agency's decision concerning the TFI reconsideration petition. 


EPA has decided to partially grant and to partially deny the TFI petition for reconsideration. EPA will reconsider
40 CFR 61.205, the provision of the final rule which governs distribution and use of phosphogypsum for research and
development, and the formula in 40 CFR 61.207(d). EPA will publish a separate 

Federal Register

 notice convening a proceeding to reconsider these provisions shortly. EPA is denying the remainder of the TFI petition.
In this notice, EPA summarizes the principal remaining objections by TFI. EPA also explains why these objections
are not of central relevance to the outcome of the rule and therefore do not constitute a basis for reconsideration.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


Phosphogypsum is a waste resulting from wet acid phosphorus production. Phosphogypsum stacks are piles of waste
or mines utilized to store and dispose of phosphogypsum. EPA issued a National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air
Pollutants (NESHAP) applicable to radon emissions from such stacks in 1989, 40 CFR part 61, subpart R (54 FR 51654,
December 15, 1989). As part of that standard, EPA adopted a work practice requirement that all phosphogypsum be disposed
in stacks, thereby permitting control and measurement of gaseous radon-222 which is emitted when radium present
in the phosphogypsum decays. 

Subsequent to issuance of Subpart R, EPA received petitions for reconsideration from The Fertilizer Institute (TFI),
Consolidated Minerals, Inc., and U.S. Gypsum Company. These petitioners objected to the requirement that all phosphogypsum
be disposed and managed in stacks, because it operated to preclude various alternative uses of phosphogypsum, including
use of phosphogypsum in agriculture, construction, and research and development. Because EPA had not fully considered
the implications of its work practice standard for alternative uses, EPA agreed to convene a reconsideration proceeding
in which the risks associated with alternative uses and the procedures under which alternative uses might be permitted
could be evaluated (54 FR 9612, March 7, 1989). 
Rather than setting forth one specific proposal for revision of subpart R, EPA requested comment on a variety of substantive
issues, including specific types of proposed alternative uses of phosphogypsum and the health risks associated
with these alternative uses. EPA also requested comment on four general options for regulation of alternative uses:
(1) No change in the work practice requirement, (2) changing the definition of phosphogypsum to exclude from the work
practice requirement material with radium-226 concentrations up to 10 picocuries/gram (pCi/g), (3) permitting
use of phosphogypsum in research and development on processes to remove radium from the phosphogypsum, and (4) permitting
alternative use of phosphogypsum only after specific permission from EPA. 
After analyzing the risks associated with the various alternative uses of phosphogypsum which were proposed and
evaluating the comments which were received, EPA issued a final rule revising subpart R (57 FR 23305, June 3, 1992).
The approach which EPA ultimately adopted was a hybrid of the options it had previously identified. For phosphogypsum
use in agriculture, EPA decided that it would be impractical to require case-by-case approval. Based on its analysis
of potential risks associated with long-term use of phosphogypsum in agriculture, EPA set a maximum upper limit of
10 pCi/g for radium-226 in phosphogypsum distributed for use in agriculture. Rather than excluding material at or
below 10 pCi/g from the standard, EPA established sampling, measurement, and certification procedures permitting
such material to be removed from stacks and sold for agricultural use. Based on analysis of potential risks associated
with the research and development use, EPA decided to permit use of up to 700 pounds of phosphogypsum for a particular
research and development activity. EPA also decided to adopt procedures permitting approval of other uses of phosphogypsum
on a case-by-case basis. 
After EPA issued its final rule concluding the reconsideration proceeding and revising subpart R, The Fertilizer
Institute (TFI) sought judicial review of the 1992 revisions of subpart R in 

The Fertilizer Institute

 v. 

Environmental Protection Agency

, No. 92-1320 (D.C. Cir.). TFI also filed a petition dated August 3, 1992 seeking further reconsideration of
the revisions of the rule pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B). TFI, EPA, and ManaSota-88, another petitioner
who sought review of the 1992 rule in 

ManaSota-88

 v. 

Browner

, No. 92-1330 (D.C. Cir.), later reached an agreement to jointly move the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to stay
judicial review of the 1992 rule, and the Court granted the motion. As part of that agreement, EPA agreed to make a final
decision whether to grant or to deny the TFI petition for reconsideration by January 31, 1994. This notice sets forth
the Agency's decision concerning the TFI reconsideration petition. 


II. Standard for Reconsideration 


Under Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), the EPA Administrator is required to convene a reconsideration proceeding
if: (1) The person raising an objection to a rule can demonstrate to the Administrator that it was impracticable to
raise such objection within the time permitted for public comment or the grounds for the objection arose after the
period for public comment, and (2) if the Administrator determines that the objection is of central relevance to the
outcome of the rule. Therefore, reconsideration is not required if the objections by a petitioner were raised or could
reasonably have been raised during the pendency of the rulemaking. Moreover, even in the circumstance where a particular
objection could not have been raised earlier, reconsideration is not required if EPA determines that such objections
would not have altered the outcome of the rule had they been raised earlier.

TFI argues in its petition that EPA should reconsider the entire 1992 rule revising subpart R because the 1989 notice
convening the reconsideration proceeding did not specify, or provide an opportunity for comment on, the details
of the technical methodology which EPA subsequently utilized in analyzing the risks associated with alternative
uses of phosphogypsum. However, EPA does not believe that it was obligated to select and specify each of the technical
models to be utilized in its analysis and to describe all of the analytic assumptions to be utilized before convening
the reconsideration proceeding. TFI also argues in its petition that a number of the elements of the rule as it was promulgated
were not specifically proposed for notice and comment. In general, EPA believes that the provisions of the rule adopted
in 1992 were a logical outgrowth of the options described in the 1989 reconsideration notice and the comments received
concerning those options.
EPA acknowledges that TFI did not have sufficient information to state many of the detailed technical objections
set forth in its petition for reconsideration within the period provided for public comment. However, under the criteria
set forth in CAA section 307(d)(7)(B), it is still necessary for EPA to assess the substantive significance of each
of these objections to determine whether it is of central relevance to the outcome of the rule and therefore an appropriate
basis for reconsideration.
Applying the criteria for reconsideration set forth in section 307(d)(7)(B) to the August 3, 1992 TFI petition, EPA
has concluded that certain objections raised by TFI do warrant convening a reconsideration proceeding concerning
particular provisions included in the 1992 revisions to Subpart R, but that the remaining objections by TFI do not
warrant reconsideration of the remaining provisions of the 1992 rule.


III. Decision to Partially Grant Petition


In its petition, TFI objects that the EPA analysis of the potential risks associated with the use of phosphogypsum
in research and development assumes an emanation rate for radon from phosphogypsum in the laboratory 40 times greater
than the rate for phosphogypsum in stacks, and that EPA has therefore greatly overestimated the risk presented by
the research and development use. TFI also argues that the analysis by EPA assumed that normal good laboratory practices,
such as segregated storage of hazardous materials, limiting removal of materials to an as needed basis, appropriate
ventilation, and appropriate disposal of used material, would be disregarded.
The analysis by EPA of the potential risks associated with the research and development use assumed that all of the
free radon generated by phosphogypsum containing 26pCi/g radium-226 would be released to a small laboratory room
with a total volume of 64 cubic meters and an air volume of 50 cubic meters. The EPA analysis thus assumed that none of
the radon would be retained in the physical matrix of the phosphogypsum long enough to permit further decay the radon
and adsorption of the decay products, which would prevent release of gaseous radon to the laboratory environment.
While there are certainly some experiments or circumstances where all of the radon generated by decay of radium in
the phosphogypsum could be released in the laboratory, EPA has concluded that this would be unusual and that such high
emanation rates would be infrequent.
In addition, EPA discovered during its review of the analysis of potential risks associated with the research and
development use that EPA assumed in its estimation of radon emissions to the laboratory environment that five 700
pound drums would be stored or utilized in the same area of the laboratory, rather than the single 700 pound drum permitted
by the rule. As a consequence, the portion of the risk to laboratory personnel attributable to radon emissions was
overestimated by a factor of five. In view of these conclusions, EPA has determined that the objections by TFI are of
central relevance to the provision limiting use of phosphogypsum in research and development to no more than 700 pounds,
and that EPA should request further comment on the assumptions to be utilized in analyzing the risks associated with
the research and development use.
In its petition, TFI also argues that it is not clear from the text of the 1992 rule whether more than one research and
development activity utilizing 700 pounds of phosphogypsum would be permitted at a single facility, as well as whether
or not a single research activity would be limited to a total of 700 pounds or only to 700 pounds at any given time. TFI
states that it assumes that multiple research and development activities each utilizing 700 pounds of phosphogypsum
would be permitted at a single facility, and that the 700 pound limit applies only to the amount of phosphogypsum on
hand at any given time, but requests that EPA clarify the rule. EPA believes that TFI has correctly construed the rule
and questions the need for further clarification of the existing rule. However, the fact that a given laboratory worker
might be exposed to radiation as a result of more than one research and development activity utilizing phosphogypsum
was not considered in the EPA risk analysis. Accordingly, EPA has decided that it will also request comment on whether
there should be any limit on multiple research and development activities at a single facility or by a particular investigator,
and how the possibility of greater exposures attributable to multiple research and development activities should
be accounted for in the EPA analysis.

In its petition, TFI objects that it is not clear what purpose is served by requiring owners or operators to conduct
sampling or measurement of radium-226 in phosphogypsum distributed for use in research and development, because
there is no quantitative limit on the amount of radium-226 which phosphogypsum distributed for this use may contain.
Because there is no limit on the amount of radium permitted in phosphogypsum distributed for research and development
use, EPA assumed in its analysis of potential risks associated with such use that the phosphogypsum would contain
high levels of radium. EPA believes that in most instances analysis of the radium-226 content in phosphogypsum distributed
for use in research and development will be necessary as part of the research activity. However, EPA has concluded
that requiring certification documents accompanying phosphogypsum distributed for use in research and development
to include quantitative analyses of radium content is not necessary to monitor compliance. Accordingly, EPA has
decided that this objection by TFI is also of central relevance to the outcome of this provision.
In view of the multiple objections by TFI which are of central relevance to the outcome of 40 CFR 61.205, the provision
of the revised Subpart R governing distribution of phosphogypsum for use in research and development, EPA has decided
to partially grant the TFI petition by convening a proceeding to reconsider 40 CFR 61.205. To implement this decision,
EPA is preparing and will publish shortly a notice of reconsideration specifying the specific subjects on which further
comment will be requested and the range of options to be considered.
In its petition, TFI objects that the formula set forth in 40 CFR 61.207(d), which is used to establish the number of
samples necessary to determine a representative average radium-226 concentration, is ambiguous, because it does
not specify the amount of allowable error. EPA agrees with this objection. The failure to include an allowable error
component in the formula was an inadvertent omission. EPA believes that it would not be necessary to convene a reconsideration
proceeding for the sole purpose of correcting this inadvertent omission, but has decided to include 40 CFR 61.207(d)
among the provisions to be reconsidered. To assist affected facilities in complying with the existing rule while
the reconsideration proceeding is pending, EPA will provide specific guidance in the notice of reconsideration
concerning selection of an appropriate error component.


IV. Decision to Partially Deny Petition


EPA has carefully reviewed all of the remaining objections set forth in the TFI petition for reconsideration. Based
on that review, EPA has concluded that none of the remaining technical objections by TFI to the EPA analysis of the potential
risks of phosphogypsum use are of central relevance to the outcome of the 1992 rule. In addition, EPA has determined
that some of the remaining policy objections by TFI could have been raised during the public comment period, and that
none of the remaining policy objections is of central relevance to the outcome of the rule.
Based on its review of the remaining objections in the TFI petition for reconsideration, EPA is denying the TFI petition
with respect to all provisions in the rule not specifically included in the decision to grant reconsideration set
forth above. The Agency's response to each of the remaining TFI objections is summarized below.


A. Technical Objections




Objection: 

The radon emanation coefficient of 0.3 for phosphogypsum is too high. Field observations (HP91) and the PATHRAE model
(EPA87) suggest the radon emanation coefficient for phosphogypsum in soil should be 0.2. The coefficient used is
50 percent larger than suggested by empirical data, but no explanation is given for why the higher value was selected.

Response:

 The selection of 0.3 for the radon emanation coefficient (E) is based on 30 measurements using phosphogypsum from
four sites in central Florida and Texas (RO88). As this reference is not publicly available, it was not cited in the
Background Information Document (BID). The measurements were made at typical in-situ moistures for phosphogypsum
stacks. The arithmetic average of these data is about 0.35. Thus, the value of 0.3 used in the BID is reasonable and applicable.


The data and other information (NI82) show the dependence of E on moisture. At lower moisture levels E increases significantly
with moisture. This is also demonstrated in the work of van Dijk and deJong (HP91) referenced by TFI. As their Figure
4 shows, E for phosphogypsum can increase by more than 50 percent as equilibrium moisture increases. The E values of
0.18 and 0.19, reported in their Table 2 and referenced by TFI, are for nearly their driest conditions. As they were
interested in the effects of using phosphogypsum in building materials, these lower values were appropriate. However,
the exalation rates that they measured at higher moistures give E values of about 0.28. This is consistent with the
value of 0.30 used in the risk assessments. Moisture saturations in soils under residences are expected to be near
the values in the Rogers measurements and closer to the higher moisture measurements by van Dijk and deJong. 


The higher emanation coefficients are further confirmed in field measurements of the specific radon flux from the
surface of phosphogypsum stacks. In 1985, Dr. C.E. Roessler (University of Florida) determined that the specific
radon flux from phosphogypsum stacks in central Florida was 1 pCi/m

2^

s per pCi/g of Ra-226 in the phosphogypsum. This value requires an E value of at least 0.29. 

TFI also commented that an E of 0.2 was used in the PATHRAE model (EPA87). This value was used in an example problem in
the reference. However, the example problem was for soil, not phosphogypsum, and should not be construed as a recommendation
for all cases. 




Objection: 

The radon diffusion for concrete is given as 16 m

2

/y. Published measurements of radon diffusion in concrete (HP80a, HP83) provide values that are factors of 8 to 15
lower. Use of the lower radon diffusion coefficients would reduce the indoor radon risks by a factor of about two. 


Response:

 The value of 16 m

2

/y (5.1  x  10

-3

 cm

2

/s) for the radon diffusion coefficient of concrete (D

c

) is the upper end of the range of D

c

's measured for residential concretes by Nielson and Rogers (NI91). The upper end of the range was used because PATHRAE
only considers radon diffusion as the entry mechanism for soil radon. While diffusion may dominate radon entry (TA90,
RO90), advective transport is also a factor and may dominate under some circumstances (RO90, LO90). The value that
was used for D

c

 in the risk assessments partially accounts for the radon entry by advection.

TFI refers to D

 measurements made by Zapalac (HP83) and Stranden and Berteig (HP80a). Zapalac reports D

 values of 3.3  x  10

. The measurements by Rogers and Nielson (RO90) also give the dependence of D

c

 on the concrete density. The residential concretes that they tested had densities generally of 2.1 g/cm

3

 or less. For the densities used by Zapalac, the Rogers and Nielson correlation predicts D

c

 values of 1.2  x  10

^4

 and 4.0  x  10

^4

 cm

2

/s. Thus, the data used in the risk assessments are 
consistent with Zapalac's data. 


Stranden and Berteig did not give the densities for their concrete, so a direct comparison is not possible. However,
it is worth noting that since the Stranden and Berteig measurements relied only on the radon generated within the concrete,
they are not a very sensitive measure of D

c

. Since a significant fraction of residential concretes have densities less than 2.2 g/cm

3

, the value of 5.1  x  10

^3

 cm

/s for D

c

 is reasonable for the risk assessments. 




Objection: 

The radon decay product equilibrium fraction of 0.5 is the upper bound of the range of 0.3 to 0.5 found in the Florida
Statewide Radiation Study. The average indoor radon equilibrium fraction from houses where the radon concentrations
ranged from 0.4 to >8 pCi/l was 0.42. The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) in its Report
94 and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) recommend 0.4 as an indoor
equilibrium fraction. The selected value of 0.5 is also inconsistent with the assumption of 2 air changes per hour.
Krisiuk (HP80b) gives a value of 0.36 for a ventilation rate of 2 air changes per hour. If other removal mechanisms are
considered (e.g., plateout and deposition), the equilibrium would be even lower. Use of 0.5 for the equilibrium fraction
results in overestimating the risks from indoor radon exposure by a factor of at least 1.4. 




Response: 

The EPA's radon risk factor incorporates a 0.5 equilibrium fraction. The value of 2 air changes per hour was not chosen
to be consistent with the radon decay product equilibrium fraction. If they were made consistent, then 1 air change
per hour (HP80b) would have been used. The value of 1 air change per hour is about the average for residences in the United
States (NA88), and results in an average equilibrium fraction of about 0.5. Thus, the use of 2 air changes per hour in
the risk assessments is non-conservative. 




Objection: 

Based on estimates of the NCRP in Report No. 45, the PATHRAE model overestimates the effective gamma dose rate by a factor
of 2.5. 




Response: 

For Scenarios 1 and 2, the BID gives an annual external gamma dose equivalent of 3.5 mrem/y from a soil Ra-226 concentration
of 0.69 pCi/g. This is equal to a dose rate of 2.5 urad/h per Pci/g of Ra-226. TFI references the 1.6 urad/hr per pCi/g
value recommended by the NCRP (NCRP75 and NCRP87). Thus, the NCRP's value is lower than the PATHRAE results by 36 percent,
not the factor of 2.5 claimed by TFI.

The external gamma dose rate at a given distance above soil containing Ra-226 depends on the source geometry and the
self-absorption of the radiation in the soil. For the conditions being assessed, an infinite plane best describes
source geometry and the PATHRAE model used an infinite plane dose factor for 
Ra-226 and its decay products of 1.67  x  10

^4

 mrem/y per pCi/m

2

. As this value is nearly the same as the value of 1.69  x  10

^4

 mrem/y per pCi/m

2

 used by the DOE (DOE88), it does not appear to be too high. The effect of self-absorption is quite variable and depends
on the soil density and the low gamma energy cutoff value. The NCRP's theoretical value is based on work by Beck (BE75),
which assumes a soil density of 1.6 g/cm

3

 and used 50 KeV as the low energy cutoff values. These differences, particularly the difference in the low energy cutoff
values, account for the differences between the BID and the results that would be obtained using the NCRP's value of
1.6 urad/hr per pCi/g. It should also be noted that both values (1.6 urad/hr per pCi/g and 2.5 urad/hr per pCi/g) are
within the variability of field measurements. 



Objection: 

The use of a 70 year exposure period for residential scenarios is inconsistent with the Superfund policy of using 90th
percentile e
