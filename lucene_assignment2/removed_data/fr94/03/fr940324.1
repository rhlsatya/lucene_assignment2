<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are proposing to amend the regulations regarding the number of samples that a firm would need to submit to the Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service for testing at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL), Ames,
Iowa. The effect of the proposed amendment would be to specify the number of samples that NVSL would need for diagnostic
test kits and for Master Seeds and Cells. The proposed amendment is necessary to provide criteria to licensees regarding
diagnostic test kits and Master Seeds and Cells because no criteria are currently included in the regulations. 



</SUMMARY>

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The regulations in 9 CFR part 113 contain Standard Requirements for evaluating veterinary biological products that
are licensed by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), U.S. Department of Agriculture, under the
Virus-Serum-Toxin Act of 1913, as amended by the Food Security Act of 1985. Veterinary biological products are defined
as all viruses, serums, toxins, and analogous products of natural or synthetic origin, such as diagnostics, antitoxins,
vaccines, live microorganisms, killed microorganisms and antigenic or immunizing components of microorganisms
intended for the use in the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of diseases of animals. In order to be licensed, veterinary
biological products must be demonstrated to be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious. 

Purity and identity tests are performed by the licensee and the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL)
on the Master Seed(s) and Master Cell Stock(s) used in the production of veterinary biological products. The licensee
is also required to perform tests on the veterinary biological product following complete formulation for purity,
safety, and potency as prescribed in a filed Outline of Production or Standard Requirements for the product in accordance
with  113.5. The manufacturer's test results may be checked by NVSL personnel on biological product samples
that the manufacturer 
is required to submit to NVSL in accordance with  113.3.

Section 113.3 currently provides licensees with criteria for selection and submission of veterinary biological
products, such as vaccines, bacterins, antiserums, and toxoids to NVSL; however, it does not state the number of samples
of diagnostic test kits and Master Seeds and Cells needed by NVSL for evaluation. The proposed amendments would specify
that a minimum of 1 diagnostic test kit, 10 samples of Bacterial Master Seeds, 13 samples of Viral Master Seeds, and
36 milliliters of Master Cell Stocks would be needed for evaluation by NVSL. 

Minor editorial changes would also be made in  113.309 to reflect organizational changes within APHIS. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been
reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 

There are currently no criteria in the regulations which specify the number of samples needed by NVSL to evaluate diagnostic
test kits and Master Seeds and Cells. However, almost all of the 114 currently licensed veterinary biologics companies
submit samples of Master Seeds and Cells to NVSL for testing. In addition, at least 25 of these companies produce veterinary
diagnostic test kits and submit samples of them to NVSL for testing. Many of these companies would be considered small
entities. This proposed amendment would benefit these entities. 

This proposed rule, if adopted, would reduce the licensees' time and expense in submitting samples to the NVSL by clearly
stating the number of samples required to be submitted, by increasing the uniformity of sample submissions, and by
allowing for more efficient handling of samples by licensees and APHIS personnel. In addition, this amendment could
potentially increase revenues for manufacturers of veterinary diagnostic test kits by allowing them to return unrequested
samples to inventory for sale. 

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Executive Order 12372 



This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive
Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015,
subpart V.) 



Executive Order 12778 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted:
(1) All State and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule will be preempted; (2) no retroactive
effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file
suit in court challenging this rule. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



This proposed rule contains no new information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

).

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Saab Model
SF340A and SAAB 340B series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections to detect discrepancies of certain
main landing gear (MLG) retract actuator bracket retaining bolts; replacement of discrepant parts; installation
of washers, if necessary; and eventual replacement of certain MLG retract actuator bracket retaining bolts and certain
nose landing gear (NLG) trunnion pin cross bolts. This proposal is prompted by reports of extension and retraction
problems on the MLG, due to loose retract actuator brackets on the MLG shock struts. The actions specified by the proposed
AD are intended to prevent a loose retract actuator bracket from interfering with the MLG shock strut trunnion support,
which could result in the inability of the MLG to extend or retract.

Discussion 



The Luftfartsverket, which is the airworthiness authority for Sweden, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition
may exist on certain Saab Model SF340A and SAAB 340B series airplanes. The Luftfartsverket advises that several operators
have reported extension and retraction problems on the main landing gear (MLG) due to loose retract actuator brackets
on the MLG shock struts. These difficulties were caused by the shearing at the head of one of the two bracket retaining
bolts. Laboratory investigations have revealed that the fracture of the retaining bolt has been attributed to fatigue
or hydrogen embrittlement (corrosion). There have also been some cases where the retaining 
bolt for the bonding strap had not been installed with a proper amount of washers. This can reduce pre-tension of the
bolt and allow the bracket to move and apply excessive load on the retaining bolts, and can lead to fatigue fracture
of the retract actuator bracket retaining bolt. A loose retract actuator bracket, if not detected and corrected in
a timely manner, could interfere with the MLG shock strut trunnion support, and subsequently 
result in the inability of the MLG to extend or retract. 

Saab has issued Service Bulletin 340-32-094, dated October 29, 1993, that 
describes procedures for a one-time visual inspection to detect corrosion, cracking, or damage of certain MLG retract
actuator bracket retaining bolts and to determine if the nut is bottoming the threads of certain other bolts; replacement
of any corroded, cracked, or damaged bolt; and the installation of washers, if any nut is found bottoming the threads.
The service bulletin also describes procedures for a one-time visual and magnaflux inspection during MLG overhaul
to detect any scored, cracked, or out-of-tolerance condition of certain MLG retract actuator bracket retainer bolts;
replacement of any 
discrepant bolt; and eventual replacement of certain MLG retract actuator bracket retaining bolts and certain nose
landing gear (NLG) trunnion pin cross bolts. The Luftfartsverket classified this service bulletin as mandatory
and issued Swedish Airworthiness Directive (SAD) No. 1-061, dated November 15, 1993, in order to assure the
continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Sweden. 

This airplane model is manufactured in Sweden and is type certificated for 
operation in the United States under the provisions of  21.29 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness
agreement, the Luftfartsverket has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the
findings of the Luftfartsverket, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary
for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a one-time visual inspection to detect corrosion,
cracking, or damage of certain MLG retract actuator bracket retaining bolts and to determine if the nut is bottoming
the threads of certain other bolts; replacement of any discrepant bolt; and the 
installation of washers, if any nut is found bottoming the threads. The proposed AD would also require a one-time visual
and magnaflux inspection during MLG overhaul to detect any scored, cracked, or out-of-tolerance condition of certain
MLG retract actuator bracket retainer bolts; replacement of any discrepant bolt; and eventual replacement of certain
MLG retract actuator bracket retaining bolts and certain NLG trunnion pin cross 
bolts. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.

The FAA estimates that 217 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this 
proposed AD, that it would take approximately 4 work hours per airplane to accomplish 
the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required 
parts will be provided at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost 
impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $47,740, or $220 per 
airplane. 


The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
adopted. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' 
under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); 
and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, 
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the 
Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the

Bureau of Export Administration, Commerce.


 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule with a request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is proposing to amend the short supply provisions of the Export Administration
Regulations (EAR) by revising the restrictions on exports to initially allow the export of up to 25,000 barrels per
day of California heavy crude oil having a gravity of 20 degrees API or lower. The changes proposed by this rule are based
on the President's October 22, 1992, memorandum to the Secretary of Commerce to modify existing restrictions on the
export of certain California heavy crude oil. This notice delineates the actions the Department is taking to implement
the President's decision. It also proposes specific regulatory changes implementing those actions and solicits
public comments.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Section 777.6(d)(1) of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) restricts exports of crude petroleum, including
reconstituted crude petroleum, tar sands and crude shale oil. This rule proposes to amend  777.6(d)(1) to permit
exports of certain California crude oil pursuant to a Presidential Memorandum of October 22, 1992,
 in which the President determined that exports of California heavy crude oil having a gravity of 20 degrees API or lower
were in the national interest. Before the President authorized this export of crude oil, he made findings and determinations
under three statutes: Section 103 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6212(b)); section 28(u) of
the Mineral Leasing Act, as amended by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act of 1973 (30 U.S.C. 185(u)); and
provisions of the Export Administration Act, as amended, and to the extent consistent with law, continued in effect
through the President's invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The Export Administration
Act was continued on March 27, 1993, by Public Law 103-10. The President made findings that exports of California
heavy crude oil having a gravity of 20 degrees API or lower: (1) Were in accord with the provisions of the Export Administration
Act of 1979, as amended; 




(2) Were consistent with the purposes of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act; and 
(3) Would not diminish the total quality or quantity of petroleum available to the United States.

Based upon the above findings, the President authorized the Secretary of Commerce to modify the existing restrictions
on the export of crude oil produced in the lower 48 states to initially allow the export of an average quantity of 25,000
barrels per day (MB/D) of California heavy crude oil having a gravity of 20 degrees API or lower.
The President also directed the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretaries of Commerce, the Interior,
Transportation, and other interested agencies, to conduct periodic reviews of such exports in light of then-existing
market circumstances. Based upon the results of these market reviews, the President authorized the Secretary of
Energy to recommend to the Secretary of Commerce that adjustments be made in the quantity of California heavy crude
oil that may be authorized for export (i.e., adjustments to the initial average authorized level of 25 MB/D).


Department of Commerce Actions


The Department proposes to take the following actions to implement the President's decision: (1) Propose rules to
implement the President's decision; 
 (2) Solicit public comments on the rules; and 
 (3) Publish a final rule implementing the President's findings and taking into account public comments on this proposed
rule and other relevant evidence. 


The Department of Commerce's Proposals


This notice proposes to amend  777.6 of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to allow the licensing
of exports of up to 25 MB/D per day of California heavy crude oil having a gravity of 20 degrees API or lower.
To implement this program, the Department proposes to: (1) Grant licenses for these exports on a first-come-first-served
basis; (2) authorize the export of up to 25 percent (2.28 million barrels) of the annual authorized volume (9.125 million
barrels) of such California crude oil per license; (3) approve only one application per company, including its affiliates,
as long as there are other outstanding non-affiliate company applications in that month; (4) allow the licensee up
to 90 days from the issuance of the license to export the oil; (5) require the licensee to certify to the Department in
writing that the export(s) occurred during the 90-day license term; (6) carry forward any portion of the 25 MB/D quota
that the Department has not licensed, except that the Department will not carry forward unlicensed portions more
than 30 days into a new calendar year; (7) return to the available quota volume all licensed volumes not shipped during
the 90-day term of an export license, except that the Department will not carry forward unshipped portions more than
30 days into the new calendar year; and (8) allow a 10 percent shipping tolerance on the licensed, but not shipped volume
of barrels and a 25 percent shipping tolerance on the total dollar value of the license, respectively.
The Department proposes to require that a prospective exporter: (1) Submit an application on BXA Form 622-P;
(2) state the total number of barrels for export during the 90-day license term not a per day rate; (3) include supporting
documents proving that the applicant has: (i) Title to the quantity of barrels stated in the application, or an accepted
order for the purchase of the quantity of barrels stated in the application, (ii) a verifiable contract of sale to export
the crude oil contingent on the applicant obtaining an export license, (iii) documentation proving that the crude
oil to be exported has a gravity of 20 degrees API or lower, (iv) documentation proving that the crude oil was derived
from production within the state of California, including its state submerged lands, (v) documentation certifying
that the crude oil was not produced or derived from a U.S. Naval Petroleum Reserve, and (vi) documentation certifying
that the crude oil was not produced from the submerged lands of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf; and (4) export the
licensed volumes within 90 days of the issuance of the license and to report the export to the Department of Commerce.
In addition, the Department will allow the applicant to combine licensed quantities into one or more shipments, provided
that the validity period of none of the affected licenses has expired. As set forth in the EAR, the applicant cannot
transfer a license to another person.
An applicant can file for a license at any time during the calendar year. The Department, however, will process only
one license per applicant per month as long as there are other non-affiliated applications pending during that month.
The Department will issue validated licenses expeditiously as long as there are sufficient quantities of the authorized
heavy crude oil volumes available. If there is no available volume of heavy crude oil, the Department will return the
application without action. If the volume of heavy crude oil available for export is less than the applicant requested,
the Department will contact the applicant and determine if the applicant wants the available volume. If not, the Department
will return the application without action. If the applicant wants the available volume, the Department will request
that the applicant amend its application to reflect the lesser volume.

The Department will apply the procedures eventually adopted in response to this proposed rulemaking with additional
notice and comment to any future increase in the export volume that the Secretary of Energy may from time to time recommend
to the Department of Commerce.



Nature of the Export Market



In developing an approach to implementing the President's decision, the Department is taking into account the nature
of the heavy crude oil export market. The Department's 1989 ``Report to the Congress on U.S. Crude Oil Exports,'' (pp.
IV-4-IV-11) concluded that opportunities to export California heavy crude generally consist
of spot market rather than year-round export activity. The report found that opportunities to export California
heavy crude oil occur intermittently and randomly throughout the year when the price of these oils are low and the price
of Pacific Rim substitutes are high. The Department's recent experience monitoring licensed export volumes strongly
supports this position. The Department recognized the need, therefore, to develop licensing procedures permitting
firms to take advantage of brief windows of opportunity and to conduct spot market export transactions.

The 1989 Commerce Report also identified numerous potential participants in such a market with a wide range of economic
strengths and capabilities. The study found that allowing limited exports of California heavy crude oil would enable
some firms (e.g., the independent producers) to expand their crude oil marketing opportunities, to maintain their
existing oil production, and to earn additional revenue to reinvest in exploring for new domestic oil reserves. 

The Department also recognized that having only one applicant could reduce the effectiveness of the export program.
For example, an exporter could, in a licensing program without time limits, apply for and obtain an export license
for the entire 25 MB/D per day for a one year period. If, however, the firm did not export the oil because of some problem
with the transaction, the license would never be used. This would limit the number of potential exporters, deny commercial
opportunities to other participants, and frustrate the intent of the President's export initiative. This concern
argued for limiting the term of an export license to insure that the licensee used the license and exported the oil,
or that the volume of oil quickly became available to other interested applicants.

There was also a need to assure that licenses issued to exporters would be in commercially viable volumes since the
total volume initially authorized for export is low_9.125 million barrels annually. It would be difficult to achieve
economically viable shipments if the Department were to issue numerous licenses for small volumes (e.g., 100,000
barrels).

Departmental Considerations



Given the noted market dynamics and commercial consideration, the Department considers it necessary to develop
a licensing regime that: (1) Is equitable; (2) minimizes government involvement in commercial transactions; (3)
makes licenses available to a wide number of participants; (4) reviews license applications expeditiously to allow
firms to take advantage of time-sensitive spot market trading opportunities; (5) prevents a firm from obtaining
a license and not exporting the oil; (6) allows for economically viable export cargoes; and (7) does not impose unnecessary
administrative burdens on exporters.

Although the Department proposes to implement the option of first-come-first-served, the Department will consider
and may adopt any of the options in this rulemaking, or an alternative proposal that addresses the above considerations.
In fact, the Department did consider several different options; they are discussed below. The Department is soliciting
comments from interested parties on the most effective approach for the Department to implement the President's
decision.



Option 

#1

_First-Come-First-Served



Under this option, the Department would grant licenses for the export of California heavy crude oil on a first-come-first-served
basis. This option involves the minimum government management of an export licensing regime and intervention in
the market. There are numerous variations to this option which involve the number of times per year that the Department
would review and authorize export licenses. The Department could grant the licenses annually, quarterly or monthly
on a first-come-first-served basis. There are also numerous variations on the volume of oil the Department could
authorize per license. Under one variation the Department could license the entire export volume (9.125 million
barrels) to the first firm that filed an export license application.

Although licensing the entire volume at one time would achieve the Department's objective of minimizing the government's
role in export transactions, it may result in limiting this export opportunity to the first firm that filed a license
application. The Department, however, wants to ensure that the potential benefits of the program are diffused among
many firms and utilized. This option, therefore, calls for limiting the quantity per license (i.e., 25 percent of
the total authorized volume) and for each license to have a 90 day limit. In addition, a company and its affiliates can
receive only one license per month as long as there are other outstanding applications.

The Department considers this option to be the best means available to provide a number of opportunities (at least
four) for a number of firms to participate in heavy crude oil exports with a minimum of government interference in the
export transaction. The Department also considers that the 90 day license term would assure the utilization of the
license or the rapid return of the volume of oil to the quota so others may use it.

On the negative side, a single company could request and receive for four months in a row a license covering 25 percent
of the authorized volume of oil just by being the earliest applicant to file with the Department. In addition, this
option would require the Department to keep running accounts on the amount available for licensing at any one time.
The Department, however, should be able to handle this because the authorized export volumes are small and the exports
are likely to occur intermittently rather than year round.



Option 

#2

_Prorationing



Prorationing procedures, such as the one the Department uses for the Alaskan North Slope/Canada (ANS/Canada) crude
oil export regime, offer some advantages but also involve a greater measure of government involvement than does licensing
on a first-come-first-served basis.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940324-1-00013 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940324-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

On the positive side, this option may ensure that more firms could participate in the export program than would be the
case under licensing option 

#

1. This option also would assure everyone who applies would get some portion of the authorized export volume.


On the negative side, this option would entail active government involvement in administering an export prorationing
regime on a year round basis. In addition, a prorationing scheme could be difficult to administer and could result
in economically not viable volumes. The volume of California heavy crude oil exports (25 MB/D) allowed under the President's
October 22, 1992 decision amounts to one-half of the volume authorized for the ANS/Canada export regime (50 MB/D).
Over the past four years the demand for ANS exports to Western Canada has not forced the Department to prorate exports
among competing applications. This may not be the case in the California situation where the volume is much smaller
and more firms have expressed an interest in participating in this program. Although several licensees with small
volumes could possibly combine volumes to make one shipment, it would not help exporters that had contracts to deliver
large volumes.



Option 

#

3_Pre-Qualification With Export Nominations




This option would result in a greater degree of government management than would be the case under any of the other options
described above because it would involve a two step review process of all export licensing transactions.


Under this procedure, potential exporters would provide enough information to allow the Department to pre-qualify
a firm as an exporter and subsequently grant final export authorization to the firm upon the provision of satisfactory
information regarding end-users and intermediate consignees, if any. 


The first step would involve the Department pre-qualifying exporters based upon the following criteria: (1) The
firm is a commercial entity that is interested in exporting California heavy crude oil; (2) the applicant can demonstrate
that an end-user is interested in purchasing oil from them as evidenced by a letter/telex. 


The nominations process_step 2_would operate as follows:


1. On a monthly basis, a pre-qualified exporter would nominate the quantity it would like to export during the month.



2. A pre-qualified exporter would have to submit his nomination no later than 10 calendar days before the first day
of the month.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940324-1-00014 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940324-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

3. At the outset of each month, the Department would notify pre-qualified exporters of how much oil was available for
export pursuant to the quota for the month. (It could provide notice by having firms telephone a special number and/or
talk with a licensing officer.) 


4. When nominating export volumes, the licensee would be required to provide the Department with documentation establishing:
(a) Title to the oil or a contract to purchase the oil subject to approval of the export transaction; (b) a contract or
contingent contract to export the oil subject to approval of the export transaction. The Department would also have
to approve the intermediate and ultimate foreign consignees for the oil, and; 


5. The licensee would have 30 days to complete the export. If the export did not occur during the 30 day license term,
the Department would return the volume to the quota. If the licensee shipped part of the volume, the Department would
return unshipped volumes to the quota. 


Other key provisions include:


1. The Department would allow the export of up to a total of 2,281,000 barrels during any 30 day period. 


2. The Department would limit individual company exports to 1,000,000 barrels of oil during any 30 day period. 


3. The Department would process only one nomination per firm per 30 day period as long as there are outstanding nominations
from non-affiliated firms. 


The Department would implement the following provision in the event the volume of crude oil nominated for export exceeds
the amount allowed during a 30 day period: 1. It would allocate to each applicant an equal share of the authorized volume.
For example, if five licensees nominated a total over the authorized volume of exports, the Department would allocate
each party 20 percent of the volume available for export (i.e., 456,000 barrels out the total of 2,281,000 barrels
available), and 


2. Licensees would be allowed to combine volumes to achieve economic-sized cargoes. 


On the positive side, this option would be responsive to the spot-market nature of the market. The pre-qualifying
process may ensure that many firms had the opportunity to participate in the export program.


On the negative side, the Department considers the two-step review process unnecessarily bureaucratic. This approach
would require the Department to actively manage licenses and keep running accounts on the amounts available for licensing
at any one time. In addition, exporters would have to contact the Department on an ongoing basis to determine what volume
was available for export during a given month. Exporters would have to constantly report on whether they conducted
exports and whether they exceeded their authorized export level. The Department would also have to establish a procedure
to screen and pre-qualify new entrants on a continuous basis to ensure that they would receive an opportunity to participate
in the export program.


The Department invites written comments from interested parties that may assist it in implementing the President's
decision. Specifically, we solicit information concerning the following:


(1) What are the pros and cons of each of the licensing options presented, and which, if any, do you prefer? 


(2) Are there other licensing approaches that would better allow U.S. exporters to take advantage of this opportunity?
If you have a specific licensing scheme in mind, please explain it, discuss the pros and cons of the selected option,
and explain how the Department should implement your approach. 


(2) Should the Department review export license applications monthly, or more or less frequently (e.g., quarterly,
semiannually, annually, continuously)? Are exports of up to 2.28 million barrels per license sufficient to make
licenses available to more than one company while retaining the commercial viability of the exports? If not, what
is the optimal cargo size (barrels) for economically viable export shipments? 


(3) Should an exporter have more or less than a 90-day license to export California crude oil in a spot market trading
environment? What would be the optimal time to allow an exporter to pursue business activities while not denying opportunities
to other exporters? 


(4) Should the Department carry over export volumes not shipped in one calendar year to the next year? What is the optimal
time that the Department should carry over volumes not shipped during one calendar year?

(5) Are there any specific heavy crudes, with particular assay properties, that the Department should exclude from
licensing? Comments in this area should indicate the specific source and type of crude, its full assay, the unique
nature of the assay, the availability of substitutes and the special user.

Department of State.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Advance notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as amended, the Department of State is compiling information
to update the list, by particular activity, of countries that prohibit by law, regulation or in practice crewmembers
aboard U.S. vessels from performing longshore work.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 258(d)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as added by the Immigration Act of 1990, Public Law
101-649, 8 U.S.C.  1288 (hereinafter: the Act) directs the Secretary of State (hereinafter: the Secretary)
to compile and annually maintain a list, of longshore work by particular activity, of countries where performance
of such activity by crewmembers aboard United States vessels is prohibited by law, regulation or in practice by the
country. The Attorney General will use the list to determine whether to permit an alien crewmember to perform an activity
constituting longshore work in the United States or its coastal waters, in accordance with the conditions set in the
Act.



The Department issued a list in Final Rule (56 FR 66970) on December 17, 1991, with correction at 57 FR 1384 on January
14, 1992. On December 13, 1993, an updated list was issued at 58 FR 65118. The Department formulated the lists on the
basis of reports from United States diplomatic posts aboard about relevant laws, regulations and practices of their
host countries and submissions from interested parties in response to the notice-and-comment process.

To update the list, the Department proposes to ask U.S. diplomatic and consular posts abroad to contact host government
officials and other appropriate sources for information on (a) any host government laws or regulations restricting
or having the effect of restricting any type of longshore activities by crews of U.S. vessels, including general immigration
laws and regulations, (b) host country practices restricting the crews of U.S. vessels from performing any type of
longshore activity normally performed in the country in the past year, and (c) changes in host country laws, regulations
or practices which have reduced or increased restrictions on longshore activities by crews of U.S. vessels. Through
this notice, the Department is seeking comments from interested parties.

Taking into account the language of section 258 and its legislative history, the Department adopted in prior rulemakings
an interpretation that confined its reach to situations in which crewmenbers of U.S. vessels were precluded from
performing longshore work in a foreign port by virtue of specific laws, regulations or governmental imposition or
approval of collective bargaining agreements.

As part of the proposed rulemaking, the Department is considering whether the above interpretation of section 258
should be maintained. Interested parties are therefore invited to submit comments on this question, including its
policy implications, as well.

Copies of public comments submitted in response to this Notice and reports from the U.S. diplomatic posts abroad will
be available for public inspection in Room 1239, Department of State, 2201 C St., NW., Washington, DC. For access,
interested persons should call Olga Luck at (202) 647-8484.

Anchorage Ground; Boston Harbor, Boston, MA



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; withdrawal.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is withdrawing a proposed rule to amend existing anchorage ground regulations for Boston Harbor.
This withdrawal is a result of a comprehensive review of the use of the local anchorages in Boston Harbor, recent rules
issued, written opinions received, and oral comments expressed at a public meeting held on December 15, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice withdraws the notice of proposed rulemaking to amend existing anchorage ground regulations in 33 CFR
110.134 for Boston Harbor, published in the 

Federal Register

 April 3, 1992 (57 FR 11455, CGD1-90-202). The original goals of the proposed rule were: (1) To assure maximum
availability of the limited deepwater anchorage area within Boston Harbor for use by deepdraft vessels; (2) to enhance
safety and to reduce environmental risks associated with the carriage and transfer of oil products aboard the ships
and barges that anchor in Boston Harbor. Several developments since the publication of the proposed rule have occurred
which make it unnecessary.



Recent dredging in the Weymouth Fore River has alleviated some of the congestion at the President Roads Anchorage.
The barges which have filled Anchorage No. 1 for the dredging portion of Boston's Third Harbor Tunnel construction,
will be out of Anchorage No. 1 by the summer of 1994 and will free up space for other barge traffic currently utilizing
the President Roads Anchorage. In addition, the Army Corps of Engineers plans to expand the President Roads Anchorage
which will provide greater access for vessels. The Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers, Boston Pilots, Massport,
and local shipping agents and companies, held a meeting on December 15, 1993. They agreed that better communication
between entities using the President Roads Anchorage should solve any potential overcrowding problem at the anchorage.
The Boston Pilots Association has agreed to act as an information clearinghouse for users of the President Roads Anchorage.

Recent regulations mandated by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990
(OPA 90) have forced operators to improve response capabilities and minimize the impact of oil spills. Vessel response
plan (58 FR 7376), lightering (58 FR 48434), and on-board equipment requirements (58 FR 67996) have been published
in the 

Federal Register

 since the publication of this proposed rule. They have helped to reduce environmental risks associated with the carriage
and transfer of oil products aboard the ships and barges that anchor in Boston Harbor.

Finally, the main premise for anchorage regulations is that navigation safety is improved and commerce is facilitated.
Excluding barges from this anchorage has the potential to restrict commerce (i.e., the tug and tow industry).

Nine written comments were received by this office. Six of the nine comments strongly opposed the proposed rule due
to their view that it unduly restricted barges from anchoring in the President Roads Anchorage. Two comments received
requested the Coast Guard become the clearinghouse for information on anchorage activities. One comment received
requested the Coast Guard provide language in the rule to allow for lightering/bunkering operations in Board Sound
due to the overcrowding at the President Roads Anchorage. Two comments received requested increased regulation
of watchstanding standards aboard vessels at anchorage. Other comments received requested minor clarification
of the rule, but were not substantive in nature. All verbal comments expressed at the meeting held on December 15, 1993,
reflect the text of this notice and the desire to withdraw the proposed rule.

The Captain of the Port carefully considered all written and verbal comments and concluded that safety concerns expressed
in the notice of proposed rulemaking had been adequately addressed by the present and future operating conditions
at the President Roads Anchorage and other Boston Harbor anchorages. In addition, the information clearinghouse
sponsored by the Boston Pilots should minimize any overcrowding at the President Roads Anchorage.





For the reasons stated above, the notice of proposed rulemaking, CGD1-90-202, is withdrawn.

Electronic Mail Systems 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Archives and Records Administration.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is developing standards for management of Federal records
created or received on electronic mail (E-mail) systems. These standards will be published as an appendix to regulations
on electronic records in 36 CFR part 1234 and will supplement the NARA instructional guide, Managing Electronic Records.
The standards would affect all Federal agencies.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



NARA has been working with components of the Executive Office of the President to develop specific records management
policies and procedures for their E-mail records, pursuant to court rulings in 

Armstrong

 v. 

Executive Office of the President,

 1 F.3d 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Because nearly all Federal agencies now use E-mail, NARA recognizes that there also is
the need for Government-wide standards on managing E-mail records. Consequently, NARA has drafted the following
standards for all Federal government agencies on the proper means of identifying, maintaining, and disposing of
Federal records created or received on an E-mail system. These standards reflect the legal definition of records
in the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. 3301) and supplement NARA records management guidance previously issued under
the law (44 U.S.C. 2904 and 2905; 36 CFR Chapter XII Subchapter B). 

When finalized, these general standards will be used by Federal agencies to develop specific recordkeeping policies,
procedures, and requirements to fulfill their obligations under the statute and regulations. Agencies that already
have specific E-mail recordkeeping policies, procedures, and requirements in place should review them to ensure
that they are consistent with these general NARA standards. In addition, agencies are encouraged to submit their
directives implementing these standards to NARA for review and comment. 

NARA has already issued regulations on electronic recordkeeping (36 CFR part 1234), and an instructional guide,
Managing Electronic Records. In addition, General Records Schedules 20, Electronic Records, and 23, ``Records
Common to Most Offices,'' provide disposition authority for some types of records created or received in electronic
form. These proposed new E-mail standards will expand this general guidance on managing electronic records. 

In developing these standards NARA has recognized that agency E-mail systems have different characteristics and
agencies have differing recordkeeping requirements. Some agencies may find that currently it is only feasible to
maintain E-mail records on paper. Other agencies may find that currently it is possible and desirable to maintain
E-mail records electronically. While NARA recognizes the practical considerations that may preclude electronic
maintenance of E-mail records at this time, agencies are encouraged to consider the benefits for future use of electronically
maintaining those records that are likely to be permanently valuable. These benefits include the ease of searching
and manipulating electronic records, the availability of electronic records to many users simultaneously, and
efficient storage. Agencies that are not now technologically able to maintain E-mail records electronically should
consider electronic maintenance when updating or designing systems. This is particularly important for E-mail
records that are likely to be appraised as permanent by NARA, such as records of cabinet members or other high level
officials. The recent decision of the Office of Administration of the Executive Office of the President to begin maintaining
its E-mail records in an electronic recordkeeping system is an example of an agency updating a system that contains
permanently valuable records. NARA encourages other agencies to consider the value of electronic maintenance of
E-mail records, and it will assist agencies in evaluating the desirability of an electronic format. 

Agencies must also determine how to manage under the Federal Records Act the transmission and receipt information
in the E-mail system. The agency should decide how to maintain the transmission and receipt information either as
part of the E-mail communication or as a separate record linked to the communication. Because printouts may not contain
necessary transmission and receipt information, the Court of Appeals in 

Armstrong

 held that to comply with the Federal Records Act, certain transmission and receipt information must be preserved
along with all E-mail messages that are Federal records. 

NARA will work closely with the agencies in the implementation of the final standards and will review, upon request,
agency directives concerning E-mail records. In addition, NARA records management evaluations of agencies will
include review and analysis of the management of E-mail records. 



Comments 



In soliciting comments from Federal agencies and the public, NARA particularly requests that agencies address the
practical effects of compliance with these standards. Specifically, NARA is interested in how agencies manage documents
with transmission and receipt information and handle the other types of documents, such as calendars, that are frequently
part of electronic communications systems. In addition, NARA would like to learn from agencies if they intend to maintain
E-mail records electronically now or in the future, and how they would monitor the E-mail system for compliance with
recordkeeping obligations. Agencies are also encouraged to comment on any other aspect of this guidance, or to request
further information or clarification. NARA encourages those submitting comments to include examples of solutions
to electronic recordkeeping problems that may be of assistance to other agencies in developing recordkeeping requirements
and programs for these systems. 



List of Subjects in 36 CFR Part 1234 



Archives and records; Computer technology.

 


For the reasons set forth in the preamble, NARA proposes to amend part 1234 of chapter XII of the Code of Federal Regulations
as follows: 



PART 1234_ELECTRONIC RECORDS MANAGEMENT 



1. The authority citation for part 1234 continues to read as follows:

 




Authority:

 44 U.S.C. 2904, 3101, 3102, and 3105.

 


2. Appendix A is added to part 1234 as follows:

These standards cover documentary materials created or received by electronic mail (E-mail) systems in Federal
agencies. Because of the widespread use of E-mail for conducting agency business, many E-mail documents meet the
definition of a ``record'' under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. chapters 29, 31, and 33). 

The definition of ``record'' in the Federal Records Act encompasses documentary materials in all media. The Act requires
the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to issue records management standards for all Federal agencies
(44 U.S.C. 2094 and 2905). NARA has issued records management regulations on electronic records (36 CFR part 1234),
guidance on electronic recordkeeping entitled 

Managing Electronic Records

 (1992), and 

General Records Schedules

 20, Electronic Records, and 23, Records Common to Most Offices. The standards being proposed here expand the existing
issuances and apply established records management and archival principles and techniques to records created or
received on E-mail systems. They provide instructions to program officials, information specialists, records
managers, and other E-mail users on the proper means of identifying, maintaining, and disposing of E-mail records.




2. Definitions 



The following definitions of terms used in these standards are included for clarity and convenience. We have provided
citations to those that are based on definitions in the Federal Records Act or existing NARA guidance or regulations.







 

Electronic Mail System.

 A computer application used to create, receive, and transmit messages and other documents or create calendars that
can be used by multiple staff members. Excluded from this definition are file transfer utilities (software that transmits
files between users but does not retain any transmission data), data systems used to collect and process data that
have been organized into data files or data bases on either personal computers or mainframe computers, and word processing
documents not transmitted on an E-mail system. 






 

Electronic Record.

 Numeric, graphic, text, and any other information recorded on any medium that can be read by using a computer 

and

 satisfies the definition of a Federal record in 44 U.S.C. 3301. This includes, but is not limited to, both on-line storage
and off-line media such as tapes, disks, and optical disks. (36 CFR 1234.1) 






 

Electronic Mail Message.

 A document created or received on an E-mail system including brief notes, more formal or substantive narrative documents,
and any attachments, such as word processing documents, which may be transmitted with the message. 






 

General Records Schedules.

 Schedules authorizing the disposal, after the lapse of specified periods of time, of records common to several or
all agencies if such records will not, at the end of the periods specified, have sufficient administrative, legal,
research, or other value to warrant their further preservation by the United States Government. (44 U.S.C. 3303a(d))







 

Nonrecord Material.

 Materials that do not meet the statutory definition of records (44 U.S.C. 3301), i.e., they were not created or received
under Federal law or in connection with Government business, or they are not preserved or considered appropriate
for preservation because they lack evidence of agency activities or information of value. In addition, the statute
specifically excludes from coverage extra copies of documents kept only for convenience of reference, stocks of
publications and processed documents, and library or museum materials intended solely for reference or exhibit.
(36 CFR 1220.14, 1222.34(d)) Nonrecord materials also include personal papers and materials. 






 

Permanent Record.

 Any Federal record that NARA has determined to have sufficient value to warrant its continued preservation by the
National Archives and Records Administration. (36 CFR 1220.14) 






 

Preserved Record.

 Documentary materials that have been deliberately filed, stored, or otherwise systematically maintained as evidence
of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government
or because of the informational value of the data in them. This applies to documentary materials in a file or other storage
system, including electronic files and systems, and those temporarily removed from the files or other storage system.







 

Records.

 All books, papers, maps, photographs, machine readable materials, or other documentary materials, regardless
of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of the United States under Federal law or in connection
with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate
successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities
of the Government or because of the informational value of data in them. (44 U.S.C. 3301) 






 

Recordkeeping System.

 A system for collecting, organizing, and storing records in order to facilitate their preservation, retrieval,
use, and disposition and to fulfill recordkeeping requirements. 






 

Records Management.

 The planning, controlling, directing, organizing, training, promoting, and other managerial activities involved
with respect to records creation, records maintenance and use, and records disposition in order to achieve adequate
and proper documentation of the policies and transactions of the Federal Government and effective and economical
management of agency operations. (36 CFR 1220.14)

Records Schedule. 

A document describing, providing instructions for, and approving the disposition of specified Federal records.
It consists of one of the following:
(a) An SF 115, Request for Records Disposition Authority, which NARA has approved to authorize the disposition of
Federal records;
(b) A 

General Records Schedule

 (GRS) issued by NARA; or
(c) A printed agency manual or directive containing the records descriptions and disposition instructions approved
by NARA on one or more SF 115s or issued by NARA in the GRS.



(36 CFR 1220.14)







 

Security Backup. 

Copy of a record in any medium created to provide a means of ensuring retention and access in the event the original record
is destroyed, inaccessible, or corrupted.





 

System Backup. 

Copy on off-line storage media of software and data stored on direct access storage devices in a computer system used
to recreate a system and its data in case of unintentional loss of data or software.





 

Temporary Record. 

Any Federal record that the Archivist of the United States has determined to have insufficient value to warrant its
preservation by the National Archives and Records Administration. (36 CFR 1220.14)





 

Transmission and Receipt Data.
(a) Transmission Data. 

Information in E-mail systems regarding the identities of sender and addressee(s), and the date and time messages
were sent.
(b) 

Receipt Data. 

Information in E-mail systems regarding date and time of receipt of a message, and/or acknowledgment of receipt or
access by addressee(s).


3. Records Management Responsibilities


Under the Federal Records Act, agencies' records management responsibilities include creating and maintaining
adequate and proper Federal records, regardless of the medium in which the records are created or received, and scheduling
the disposition of records no longer needed for conduct of Government business (44 U.S.C. Chapters 31 and 33). Agencies
are legally obligated to ensure creation and maintenance, for an appropriate period, of ``records containing adequate
and proper documentation of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, and essential transactions
of the agency * * *.'' (44 U.S.C. 3101). Because E-mail is often used to conduct Government business,
it is critical that agencies take steps to ensure that records created or received on E-mail systems are managed according
to the law. Accordingly, agencies must develop and implement an agency-wide program for the management of all Federal
records created or received on electronic communications systems (36 CFR 1234.10(a)). All features of E-mail systems
(including messages, calendars, directories, distribution lists, attachments such as word processing documents,
messages sent or received over external communications systems) must be evaluated to identify documentary materials
that satisfy the definition of Federal records. An agency's records management program should address all Federal
records in the E-mail system. The agency should also incorporate procedures that ensure recordkeeping and disposition
requirements are met before approving a new E-mail system or enhancements to an existing system (36 CFR 1234.10(d)).


4. What Are Federal Records?


The definition of ``records'' in the Federal Records Act specifies the criteria under which documentary materials
are to be considered Federal records. The phrase ``regardless of physical form or characteristics'' means that the
records may be paper, film, disk, or any other physical type or form; and that the method used to record information
may be manual, mechanical, photographic, electronic, or any combination of these or other technologies.
Whatever the medium, the statute establishes two conditions that must be met for a document to be a record: (1) The document
is made or received by agency personnel under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business,
and (2) it is preserved or appropriate for preservation. Documentary materials, in any physical form, are Federal
records when they meet both tests. The word ``preserved'' means the deliberate act of filing, storing, or otherwise
systematically maintaining material as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures,
operations, or other activities of the Government or because of the informational value of the data in it. ``Appropriate
for preservation'' means documentary materials made or received by an agency which in its judgment should be filed,
stored, or otherwise systematically maintained by the agency because of the evidence of agency activities or information
they contain, even though the materials may not be covered by its current filing or maintenance procedures (36 CFR
1222.12). Agencies must apply carefully reasoned judgment in deciding when E-mail documents are ``appropriate
for preservation'' and in exercising this judgment, must consider their obligation to create and maintain records
that adequately document their policies, programs, and activities under 44 U.S.C. 3101 (see previous section entitled
Records Management Responsibilities).


5. Record Status of E-Mail Messages


It is critical that all E-mail users understand the concept of Federal records and that agencies provide sufficient
information for users to distinguish Federal records from nonrecord materials. E-mail messages are Federal records
when they meet the criteria specified in the statutory definition, i.e., they are made or received under Federal law
or in the conduct of agency business, and they are preserved or are appropriate for preservation as evidence of the
agency's organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities, or contain
information of value. Since E-mail systems transmit a variety of messages, not all E-mail documents will meet the
statutory definition of records.


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940324-1-00024 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940324-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Some categories of E-mail messages or documents that would satisfy the definition of record are those:
1. Containing information developed in preparing position papers, reports, and studies;
2. Reflecting official actions taken in the course of conducting agency business;
3. Conveying information on agency programs, policies, decisions, and essential transactions;
4. Conveying statements of policy or the rationale for official decisions or actions;
5. Documenting oral exchanges, such as meetings or telephone conversations, during which policy was discussed or
formulated or other agency activities were planned, discussed, or transacted.
E-mail messages are not considered nonrecord materials merely because the information they contain may also be available
elsewhere on paper or in electronic files. Separate E-mail messages that contain the same information on Government
activities may differ in important respects and, thus, are not automatically nonrecord materials. In addition,
multiple copies of messages may all be records if they are used for different purposes in the conduct of official business
or filed in different files. In other words, if more than one office takes action or otherwise uses copies of a message,
copies would be records in each of those offices.
To assist in the process of determining record status, NARA recommends that agencies consider designing into their
current or future E-mail systems a feature that helps users to identify records. For example, agencies may want their
systems to allow users to tag messages as record or nonrecord or to automatically default to the determination that
system-produced documents are records, requiring users to take additional steps to mark a document as nonrecord.
Another option would be to develop a system that analyzes the contents of a message according to specified rules in
order to prompt the user with a suggested categorization.
For further information on making these distinctions between records and nonrecord materials, see Personal Papers
of Executive Branch Officials: A Management Guide, published by NARA in 1992.


6. Transmission and Receipt Data


Besides the text of messages, E-mail systems may provide transmission and receipt data. In some systems, transmission
data is part of the message. In other systems some transmission data is in a separate message. Generally, receipt data
is separate from the messages.
E-mail messages require some transmission data to be intelligible and to understand their context. It is essential
that necessary transmission data is preserved with all E-mail records. Many E-mail systems automatically capture
with an E-mail message the identity of the sender and the addressee(s) and the date the message was sent. Just as with
a paper record, this transmission data is necessary for an E-mail record to be complete and understandable. Agencies
should determine if any other E-mail transmission data is needed for purposes of adequacy of documentation. Both
the message and the related transmission data are Federal records and must be maintained in recordkeeping systems
for the same retention period. (See section entitled Maintenance of Federal Records Created by an E-mail System,
below.)
E-mail systems may provide users with the ability to request acknowledgments or receipts showing that an E-mail message
reached the mailbox or inbox of each addressee. E-mail systems may also provide, upon request, information about
or acknowledgments of E-mail messages that were received or viewed by the addressee. Agency instructions to E-mail
system users should specify when to request such receipts or acknowledgments. Users should request receipt data
when it is needed for adequate and proper documentation of agency activities, especially when it is necessary to confirm
when an addressee has received or viewed a message. Agencies should maintain such receipts and acknowledgments associated
with Federal records for the same period as the electronic message to which they refer.


7. Draft Documents


Agency staff may use the E-mail system to circulate draft documents created on either the E-mail system or a separate
word processing or other system. Preliminary drafts must be maintained for purposes of adequate and proper documentation
if (1) they contain unique information, such as annotations or comments, that helps explain the formulation or execution
of agency policies, decisions, actions, or responsibilities, and (2) they were circulated or made available to employees
other than the creator for the purpose of approval, comment, action, recommendation, follow-up, or to keep staff
informed about agency business.
Because drafts in electronic form may be Federal records, the record status of electronically created drafts that
are transmitted as part of, or as attachments to, E-mail messages must be evaluated as changes are made. Successive
drafts containing substantive revisions may be Federal records; drafts containing only minor changes are less likely
to qualify as records. If the draft qualifies as a record, the agency should save a copy before the draft is deleted or
altered.


8. Directories and Distribution Lists


Some electronic communication systems identify users by codes or nicknames. Some identify the recipients of a communication
only by the name of a distribution list. Directories or distribution lists linking such shorthand names or codes with
the names of users must be retained to ensure identification of the sender and addressee(s) of messages that are records.


9. Calendars


An E-mail system may provide calendars and task lists for users. Agencies that have such features on their E-mail system
should advise users that calendars, indexes of events, and task lists are Federal records if they meet the criteria
specified by law. Calendars, whether individual or shared, despite the level of the individual to whom they relate,
may be Federal records or they may be personal materials. The NARA publication Personal Papers of Executive Branch
Officials: a Management Guide provides guidance on the record status of calendars. That publication notes that the
Freedom of Information Act case law regarding ``agency records'' is the most pertinent guidance for deciding whether
calendars are Federal records.
Most calendars and related documents that are Federal records are disposable under General Records Schedule 23,
Item 5. Federal record calendars that relate to the activities of high-level officials, however, must be specifically
scheduled for disposition to allow NARA to appraise their value for future use. GRS 23 provides guidance on identifying
high-level officials. Users may delete calendars that are nonrecord materials at their discretion.

10. External Communications Systems 



Some Government agencies use electronic communications systems external to the Government, such as the Internet
or other commercial network services. These communications systems have established protocols that are not subject
to agency modification. However, the use of external communications systems which are neither owned nor controlled
by the agency does not alter in any way the agency's obligation under the Federal Records Act. Agencies must ensure
that Federal records sent or received on these systems are preserved and that reasonable steps are taken to capture
available transmission and receipt data needed by the agency. As is the case with any Federal record, those that are
communicated to or received from persons outside the agency or Government should include the identity of the outside
senders or addressees. 



11. Maintenance of Federal Records Created by an E-Mail System 



Agencies must ensure that all E-mail records are maintained in appropriate recordkeeping systems. Such recordkeeping
systems must meet the following requirements: (1) Permit easy and timely retrieval; (2) facilitate the distinction
between record and nonrecord materials (if such distinctions were not made previously); (3) retain the records in
a usable format until their authorized disposition date; and (4) permit transfer of permanent records to the National
Archives and Records Administration (see 36 CFR 1228.188, 36 CFR 1234.28(a)). 

Agencies should consider the advantages of maintaining their records electronically. An electronic system may
be more easily searched and manipulated than records in paper files. An electronic file may also be available for simultaneous
use by multiple staff members and may provide a more efficient method to store records. In addition, future use of permanently
valuable E-mail records for agencies and for historical research could be enhanced by storing them electronically.


System backup tapes normally are not suitable for recordkeeping purposes because they are merely mirrors of storage
disks with data and documents scattered throughout as they are on the disks themselves. They are meant to provide only
a means of recreating a system and its data in case of emergency. Agencies should have a separate system that is appropriate
for recordkeeping. 

In all cases when records are maintained electronically, agencies should provide for regular backups to guard against
system failures or loss through inadvertent erasures (36 CFR 1234.30). 



A. Maintenance on the E-Mail System 



E-mail systems are generally designed for convenient and efficient agency communications and not as a system for
storing agency records for their entire life cycle. To maintain instantaneous communications capability without
increasing hardware capacity, these systems often limit the number of messages that can accumulate on the system
and may automatically delete messages after a short period. If an E-mail system is not designed for or adaptable to
use as a recordkeeping system, E-mail records must be copied or moved to an appropriate recordkeeping system for maintenance
and disposition. 



B. Maintenance in an Electronic Recordkeeping System Other Than the E-Mail System 



Some agencies store their E-mail records on an electronic system separate from the E-mail system. Agencies that maintain
their records in this way must move or copy all E-mail records to the electronic recordkeeping system. The recordkeeping
system must allow segregation of permanent and temporary records and have sufficient capacity to store records for
their authorized retention periods (36 CFR 1234.10). 

Agencies may retain records from E-mail systems in an off-line electronic storage format (such as optical disk or
magnetic tape) that meets the requirements described above (36 CFR 1234.28(a)). Factors to be considered in selecting
a storage medium or converting from one medium to another are identified in 36 CFR 1234.28(b)). Agencies may use optical
disk systems for the storage and retrieval of permanent records while the records remain in the agency's legal custody,
but NARA currently does not accession permanent records stored on optical disks. Permanent records stored on optical
disk must be converted to a medium acceptable to NARA at the time of transfer to NARA's legal custody, as specified in
36 CFR 1228.188. 



C. Maintenance in Paper Recordkeeping Systems 



Agencies that do not have the technological capability to maintain E-mail records in an electronic recordkeeping
system must print their E-mail records. In such instances, agencies must also print related transmission and receipt
data and maintain it together with the printed communications according to the same procedures as other paper records.


Other agencies may have the technological capability to maintain E-mail records electronically but, nevertheless,
determine that current agency use is best served by also printing them on to paper. While it is the agency's responsibility
to determine whether its current needs are best served by one or both formats, an electronic format may be in the best
interest of future use. Accordingly, agencies must schedule and NARA must appraise both formats before E-mail records
are deleted from the electronic recordkeeping system. This ensures the opportunity for NARA to determine the best
format for the preservation of records of potential historical or other research value. (See the section below for
instructions on the disposition of records.) 

Any agencies that maintain E-mail records only on paper even though they have the technology to maintain them electronically
are strongly encouraged to consider the benefits of an electronic format. NARA will assist such agencies in evaluating
the advantages of maintaining E-mail records electronically. 

Those agencies that have no plans for implementing an electronic recordkeeping system are also encouraged to consider
this format when their current systems are redesigned or replaced.

12. Disposition of E-Mail Records 



E-mail records may not be deleted or otherwise disposed of without prior disposition authority from NARA (44 U.S.C.
3303a). This applies to all versions of E-mail records, including the original record that is on the E-mail system
and all copies that have been forwarded to a recordkeeping system. NARA authorizes records disposition through two
mechanisms; issuance of the General Records Schedules developed by NARA for temporary records common to most or all
Federal agencies, and approval of schedules developed by agencies for records unique to the agency. The authorization
process employed by NARA involves appraisal, which is the determination of the historical or other value of the records
including the most appropriate format for future use when the same information is captured in records on different
physical formats. 

Electronic records must be scheduled even if the same information is available in another medium, including paper
printouts of electronically stored records. Information in electronic records may have greater research utility
than similar information stored on another medium because it is easier to access and manipulate. Also, it may be more
efficient to capture transmission and receipt data in electronic systems. Thus, the disposition of electronic records
may differ from the disposition of paper records with the same information. The disposition of all records, regardless
of medium (paper, magnetic, microform, etc.) must be in accordance with an approved schedule. 



A. Records on the E-Mail System 



If an agency has an E-mail system that is designed for or is adaptable for use as an agency recordkeeping system as well
as a communications system, users must be instructed on the required steps to be taken to ensure that the record on the
user's screen or in his or her mailbox is forwarded to the recordkeeping feature of the system. If, on the other hand,
an agency has an E-mail system that cannot also serve as a recordkeeping system, users should be instructed to forward
all records from the E-mail system to an appropriate recordkeeping system to ensure that the records are preserved
and the E-mail system continues to operate efficiently. When the necessary steps have been taken to preserve the record
by using the recordkeeping feature or by forwarding it to an appropriate recordkeeping system, the identical version
that remains on the user's screen or in the user's mailbox has no continuing value to the agency or for future research.
Therefore, NARA considers the version of the record on the ``live'' E-mail system appropriate for deletion after
it has been preserved on a recordkeeping system along with all appropriate transmission data. NARA will revise General
Records Schedule 23 to authorize deletion of the copy of the record on the ``live'' E-mail system after the necessary
preservation steps have been taken. This general authorization will apply only to the E-mail record on the ``live''
E-mail system. There is no formal authorization at this time for agencies to delete E-mail records from the E-mail
system if they are stored only on the system itself or if they have been transferred to an electronic recordkeeping
system. The revised General Records Schedule will extend the authorization to these categories of records. 



B. Records in Recordkeeping Systems 



Because E-mail records must be maintained for varying retention periods and, when appraised as permanent, transferred
to NARA, it is not appropriate for NARA to issue a General Records Schedule that pertains to all E-mail records in recordkeeping
systems. Consequently, those E-mail records that have been incorporated into a recordkeeping system that includes
records from other sources or systems must be managed in accordance with the records schedule of the recordkeeping
system in which they are filed. Alternatively, those E-mail records that are maintained as a separate system must
be separately scheduled. Agencies must develop and submit to NARA schedules that identify the categories of E-mail
records in their systems if they are maintained separately so that NARA can appraise the records and provide appropriate
disposition authority. 

As indicated previously, it is established NARA policy that agencies that maintain records in paper and electronic
formats must receive the approval of NARA before disposing of either format. This will ensure that future use considerations
enter into determinations of the most appropriate format for the preservation of permanent records. 



13. Security of E-Mail Records 



Agencies must take adequate measures to protect records in E-mail systems (36 CFR 1234.26). Security measures must
protect E-mail records from unauthorized alterations or deletions. Agencies should regularly back up messages
stored on-line to off-line media to guard against system failures or inadvertent erasures. 



14. Training Employees 



Agencies must ensure that all employees are familiar with the legal requirements for creation, maintenance, and
disposition of records on E-mail systems. The agency's directives must provide sufficient guidance so that agency
personnel are familiar with the agency's specific recordkeeping requirements and can distinguish between records
and nonrecord materials on E-mail systems (36 CFR 1222.30). Because Federal records may be created using an E-mail
system, each agency using an E-mail system should provide records management training and guidance for all employees
which includes criteria for determining which E-mail messages are records. As indicated above, it may be useful for
agencies to have designed into their E-mail systems a feature that helps users to identify Federal records.

15. Monitoring Implementation of Recordkeeping Guidance for the E-Mail System 



Agencies are responsible for monitoring the implementation of records management guidance to ensure that E-mail
users are accurately identifying records and properly maintaining them. Each agency must ensure that the implementation
of directives concerning records on its E-mail system is carried out by reviewing the systems periodically for conformance
to established agency procedures. These reviews should consist of auditing or reviewing representative samples
of all electronic communications, conducting periodic staff interviews, and internal records management evaluations.
The purpose of these reviews is to ensure that E-mail users properly determine record status and that record messages
are being properly maintained. These reviews would determine whether permanent and temporary records are segregable
and schedules are being implemented properly. Such reviews should be used to correct errors when they are found, and
to evaluate, clarify, and update agency recordkeeping directives, disposition schedules, and training for agency
staff (36 CFR 1234.10(l)). Reports concerning the results of the reviews should be made available to NARA upon request
and when it conducts evaluations of the agency's records management program. 



16. Conclusion 



E-mail systems provide unprecedented communications convenience. However, agencies must take the necessary measures
to ensure that there is no diminution of their records resulting from the use of E-mail systems. E-mail systems have
become important tools for the transmission of substantive information, and, therefore, they are used to create
Federal records. Agencies must take special care that employees understand their responsibilities when using E-mail
to ensure the adequate creation and proper maintenance and disposition of Federal records. 

As specified in 44 U.S.C. 3102, NARA and the agencies shall cooperate in the implementation of NARA standards. Agencies
should amend their recordkeeping policies and procedures where necessary to meet these standards. NARA will assist
agencies in implementing these standards by reviewing agency directives concerning E-mail and by participating
in agency considerations of maintaining permanent E-mail records electronically. NARA and the agencies will work
together to ensure that recordkeeping policies and programs for E-mail records serve the needs of the agencies and
the needs of future researchers.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Illinois


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Environmental Protection Agency.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is proposing to disapprove a February 7, 1992, request
by Service Plastics, Inc., to incorporate certain operating restrictions for its Elk Grove Village, Illinois, facility
into the Chicago Federal Implementation Plan for ozone (Chicago FIP). If approved by USEPA, this restriction (which
attempts to limit emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) to less than 100 tons per year) would exempt Service
Plastics, Inc. from the otherwise applicable emission limits in the Chicago FIP, as promulgated by USEPA on June 29,
1990.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under 40 CFR 52.741 (u) and (x) in the Chicago FIP, sources located in Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will Counties
with total Maximum Theoretical Emissions
 (MTE) of more than 100 tons per calendar year of VOC
 and which are not covered by a Control Techniques Guideline document, must comply with certain requirements. The
rule provides an exemption, however, for sources which are limited to 100 tons or less of VOC emissions per calendar
year, before the application of capture systems and control devices, through production or capacity limitations
contained in a federally enforceable construction permit or a State Implementation Plan (SIP) or FIP revision.






On February 7, 1992, Service Plastics, Inc. requested a FIP revision that would impose the identical limitations
on its plant operations as those specified in a February 13, 1992, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA)
operating permit. If granted, this FIP revision would restrict its use of lacquers, thinners, and other VOC containing
materials with the intent of keeping its VOC emissions below 100 tons per year. IEPA's operating permit contains the
following limitations on the VOC content and the amount of VOC containing materials that can be used at its ELK Grove
Village facility:

Emissions and operation of the 27 paint spray booths shall not exceed the following limits:






An April 1, 1992, discussion with a Service Plastics, Inc. representative revealed that the 6.2 pounds VOC per gallon
of coating limitation is merely an average, based upon the extent to which a specific lacquer is thinned with solvent.

Service Plastics, Inc.'s requested FIP revision is not approvable for the following reasons.


1. The 6.2 pounds VOC per gallon is not a meaningful limit. It is merely an average VOC content of lacquers that are used.


2. The ``other'' category is not specifically defined and, as a result, it is not possible to verify how much ``other''
material is used.


3. The recordkeeping requirements are inadequate for the operating restrictions that are being requested. Neither
the monthly usage of ``as applied'' coating nor the monthly use of ``other'' material is specifically required.


These deficiencies were discussed with a representative of Service Plastics, Inc. on April 1, 1992.



Proposed Rulemaking Action and Solicitation of Public Comment




For the reasons stated above, USEPA is proposing to disapprove Service Plastics, Inc.'s request for a FIP revision
in the form of operating restrictions on the amount of lacquer, thinners, and other VOC-containing materials used.
Public comment is solicited on Service Plastics, Inc.'s requested revision and on USEPA proposed rulemaking action.
Additionally, if requested, USEPA will provide an opportunity for a public hearing on this proposal. All comments
received by the close of the public comment period will be considered in the development of the USEPA final rule.


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.,

 USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.


This action involves only one source, Service Plastics, Inc. Therefore, USEPA certifies that this RACT promulgation
does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Furthermore, as explained in this notice,
the request does not meet the requirements of the Act and USEPA cannot approve the request.


Under Executive Order 12866 today's action is not significant. It has been submitted to the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) for review.

Air Pollution Control: Amendments To Regulations Governing the Importation of Nonconforming Vehicles 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to amend 40 CFR part 85, subpart P to 
permit the importation of certain motor vehicles and motor 
vehicle engines from Canada without obtaining a certificate of 
conformity from EPA. Such vehicles will be allowed entry into 
the United States provided a commercial importer proves they are 
identical, in all material respects, to a vehicle certified for 
sale in the United States. EPA is proposing this change because 
it believes that many vehicles produced by manufacturers for sale 
in Canada are identical to their United States certified 
counterparts. 



In addition to the changes in subpart P which affect 
commercial importers of vehicles produced for the Canadian 
market, this proposal also addresses other issues relating to the 
importation of nonconforming vehicles. EPA is proposing to: 
Formalize a longstanding EPA policy regarding the importation of 
individually owned vehicles that are proven to be identical, in 
all material respects, to a vehicle certified for sale in the 
United States, establish new emission standards applicable to 
imported nonconforming vehicles, clarify the regulatory 
language at 40 CFR part 85, subparts P and R, which concern the 
exclusion or exemption of motor vehicles and motor vehicle 
engines from meeting Federal emission requirements, and provide 
several minor clarifications to the existing regulations. 

EPA is proposing that implementation of these regulations 
take place 30 days after publication of the final rule. 

This preamble is abbreviated from a larger supplementary 
document which expands upon the issues discussed here and which 
may be found in the Docket No. A-89-20 described below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Statutory Authority 



Today's proposal discusses several regulatory programs 
administered by EPA which provide for the importation of vehicles 
into the United States. Section 203 of the Clean Air Act (Act), 
42 U.S.C. 7522, provides the statutory authority for regulations 
relating to the importation of new motor vehicles
 and motor 
vehicle engines which are not covered by a certificate of 
conformity. Sections 203(a)(1) and 203(b)(2) provide the 
statutory authority for the regulations in today's proposal. 
Generally, section 203(a)(1) prohibits the importation of 
vehicles not covered by a certificate of conformity by any person 
except as provided by regulation of the Administrator. The 
exception for regulations of the Administrator in section 
203(a)(1) refers to the grant of authority in section 203(b)(2), 
which states that a vehicle not covered by a certificate of 
conformity and offered for importation shall be refused admission 
into the United States unless the Administrator, by regulation, 
provides for deferring final determination regarding admission of 
the vehicle offered for importation upon such terms and 
conditions as may appear appropriate to insure that any imported 
vehicle will be brought into conformity with applicable 
standards, requirements and limitations. 





To implement section 203(b)(2), EPA has established 
procedures regarding the importation of vehicles not covered by a 
certificate of conformity. EPA first promulgated regulations on 
November 15, 1972 (37 FR 24314) which allowed individuals to 
import vehicles and perform modifications subsequent to 
importation. This regulatory structure was replaced on July 1, 
1988 with a new regulatory program promulgated on September 25, 
1987. This program established the independent commercial 
importer (ICI) as the entity responsible for the importation of 
nonconforming vehicles. The primary purpose of this NPRM is to 
propose additional provisions regarding the importation of 
vehicles intended for sale in Canada but identical to U.S. 
certified configurations. See section II for a discussion of the 
importation of Canadian vehicles. This proposal also includes 
amendments to the procedures governing the importation of 
nonconforming vehicles generally. 

In addition to the regulations administering the importation 
of vehicles pursuant to section 203(b)(2), EPA is proposing 
amendments to regulations which implement section 203(b)(1) of 
the Act. Section 203(b)(1) states, ``[t]he Administrator may 
exempt any new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine * * * 
upon such terms and conditions as he may find necessary for the 
purpose of research, investigations, studies, demonstrations, or 
training or for reasons of national security.'' To implement this 
section of the Act, regulations were initially promulgated on 
September 10, 1974 (39 FR 32609), codified at 40 CFR part 85, 
subpart R, to provide for a program allowing manufacturers to 
apply for and receive exemptions for vehicles that were used for 
the purposes specified in section 203(b)(1) of the Act. These 
regulations were amended on March 3, 1980 (45 FR 13733) to extend 
the availability of exemptions under section 203(b)(1) to 
individuals and other non-manufacturers. On July 14, 1982 (47 FR 
30482) these regulations were amended to reduce the information 
required in a manufacturer's exemption application. The 
regulations were also amended on August 27, 1985 (50 FR 34797) to 
require that a claim of confidentiality accompany information 
submitted to EPA that is covered by such a claim. 

The proposed amendments to the regulations, codified at 40 
CFR 85.1703, implement section 203(b)(1) of the Act to address 
the definition of a motor vehicle; to clarify the definition of a 
precertification vehicle in contrast to a vehicle subject to a 
testing exemption; and, to revise the regulations regarding 
obtaining a display exemption pursuant to 40 CFR 85.1511(b)(4) 
and 85.1707. These proposed changes are discussed in section V, 
Proposed Amendments to subpart R. 



II. Background for Canadian Importations 



The framework of EPA's current Imports regulations 
establishes, with some limited exceptions, that only independent 
commercial importers (ICIs) holding a valid certificate of 
conformity may import nonconforming vehicles into the United 
States. An ICI bears the responsibility not only for performing 
all necessary modifications and testing, but also for ensuring 
that the vehicle it imports complies with United States emission 
requirements for the vehicle's useful life. In effect, this 
imposes on the ICI the same emission requirements the Act imposed 
on original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). 

On November 24, 1987, potential importers of Canadian 
vehicles for resale in the U.S. petitioned EPA
 to reconsider 
the regulations as they apply to the commercial importation of 
vehicle models originally designed and built for sale in Canada 
which are identical to vehicles certified by EPA for sale in the 
United States. The petitioners maintained that, although these 
vehicles may not be labeled by the OEM as meeting United States 
emission requirements, the vehicles do not have to be 
mechanically modified to comply with such requirements and do not 
present air quality concerns similar to those presented by other 
imported nonconforming vehicles.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940324-1-00033 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940324-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The evidence available to EPA suggests that an overwhelming 
majority of the vehicle models manufactured for sale in Canada 
are not configurations unique to the Canadian market, but are 
mechanically identical to their corresponding United States 
version regarding emissions compliance, except for EPA's labeling 
and warranty requirements. Given this situation, EPA believes 
that it is not necessary to require individuals and commercial 
importers to obtain separate certificates of conformity from EPA 
for those vehicles that are mechanically identical to their 
corresponding United States version regarding emissions 
compliance. 

On June 29, 1988, EPA granted the petition for 
reconsideration (the document granting the petition may be found 
in the docket at A-89-20), and agreed to commence this rulemaking 
to address the unique issues surrounding Canadian vehicles. 

Today's action proposes formal revisions to EPA's 
regulations for importing vehicles from Canada. It also 
clarifies or changes certain other provisions contained in the 
existing regulations. 



A. EPA's Proposal 



EPA's proposal would allow only commercial importers with 
designated Canadian importer status approved by EPA to import 
vehicles from Canada both for which the title has previously been 
transferred to an ultimate purchaser and for which the title has 
not yet been transferred to an ultimate purchaser, for the 
purpose of resale. The designated Canadian importers would be 
permitted to import only those vehicles which were previously 
proven to be identical, in all material respects, to their United 
States certified counterparts. In addition to making the showing 
of identical in all material respects, a designated Canadian 
importer must agree to: (1) Label each vehicle for fuel economy 
and emissions compliance purposes; (2) fulfill emission warranty 
and recall obligations, and notify owners of recalls and 
available warranty coverage; (3) maintain adequate records; (4) pay 
any applicable Gas Guzzler Taxes, and Corporate Average Fuel 
Economy penalties (49 CFR 531, 533); (5) submit applications for 
final admission to EPA; (6) hold vehicles for a period of five 
working days (or less if approved by EPA on a case-by-case basis) 
for EPA inspection before transfer to an ultimate purchaser or 
dealer; and (7) submit to inspections conducted by EPA enforcement 
officers. 



B. Importations by Individuals 



Today's proposal also addresses the importation of vehicles 
by individual owners. Often an individual moving to the United 
States from Canada wishes to import his/her vehicle for personal 
use. In many of these cases, the vehicle is identical, except 
for labeling, to its United States certified counterpart. The 
few vehicles which are not identical to their United States 
certified counterparts, typically require only minor 
modifications to make them identical. For these reasons, EPA 
believes that the special circumstances associated with an 
individual moving to the United States from Canada also warrant 
consideration in this rulemaking. EPA believes that similar 
circumstances may also apply to some individuals importing 
vehicles from other countries. Consequently, this proposal 
addresses vehicle importations by individuals moving to the 
United States from other countries, as well.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940324-1-00034 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940324-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

EPA's current policy permits entry to certain vehicles on a 
case-by-case basis. EPA proposes to formalize this policy to 
grant exemptions to individual owners (individuals and 
businesses) to import their personal vehicles (

i.e.

, vehicles not 
imported for the purpose of resale), provided they have proven 
that their vehicles were: (1) Originally manufactured to be 
identical, in all material respects, to a vehicle described in an 
OEM's application for certification, or (2) modified to be 
identical in all material respects to a vehicle described in an 
OEMs application for certification. EPA is not proposing to 
change individual vehicle owners' responsibility for payment of 
any Gas Guzzler taxes applicable to vehicles they import. 

EPA's proposal also offers individual importers the option 
of having an ICI import their vehicle or engine for the purpose 
of modifying it to be identical in all material respects to a 
vehicle or motor vehicle engine certified by the OEM for sale in 
the United States. Vehicles imported under this option must be 
modified by the ICI according to OEM instructions, but do not 
have to be tested. EPA is confident that detailed instructions 
provided by an OEM specifying parts to be installed and 
adjustments to be performed will be sufficient to make a vehicle 
or engine identical in all material respects to a certified 
vehicle or engine, because these modifications will result in the 
vehicle or engine having the same parts and parameters as are 
described in the OEM's application for certification, which 
describes the vehicles or engines produced by the OEM within a 
given certified engine family. Individual vehicle owners who 
might otherwise have to incur the greater expense of ICI testing 
for a vehicle they wish to import may benefit from this option, 
if modification instructions can be obtained from the OEM. 



C. Emission Standards 



Today, EPA is proposing to delete the requirement that 
nonconforming light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks imported 
pursuant to 40 CFR 85.1505 or 85.1509 meet current year emission 
standards.
 Instead of meeting current year emission standards, 
these vehicles will be allowed to meet emission standards (with 
applicable deterioration factors applied) that were in effect at 
the time of original vehicle production, with a few exceptions. 
These vehicles must, however, meet such emission standards using 
the currently applicable testing procedures, and must meet all 
applicable current model year fuel economy requirements. EPA is 
not proposing to change ICIs' status as small volume 
manufacturers and they must comply with corporate average fuel 
economy (CAFE) requirements as imposed by the Department of 
Transportation (DOT). This revision would give owners of older 
motor vehicles a way to import their vehicles. Many of these 
vehicles are now effectively excluded from importation due to the 
high cost of modification to meet current model year standards, 
which may be greater than the value of the vehicle involved. 





EPA would continue, as under current regulations, to define 
the useful life of imported nonconforming vehicles as a period of 
time or mileage of use in the United States, beginning with the 
date and mileage at the time of a vehicle's release to the owner 
or purchaser. Consequently, this proposal would not affect the 
warranty and recall requirements pursuant to 40 CFR 85.1508 and 
85.1510 or any other requirement under that subpart. 



D. Other Issues 



(1) Precertification Exemption 



Today's proposal revises the precertification exemption 
available to ICIs pursuant to 40 CFR 85.1511(b)(3) for the 
importation of nonconforming prototype vehicles for use in 
certification. Presently, the ICI must obtain written approval 
from the Administrator prior to importing such nonconforming 
motor vehicles, must use the vehicle to obtain a certificate of 
conformity, and must obtain a certificate of conformity within 
180 days of importation. In this rulemaking, EPA retains these 
provisions, and proposes additional requirements regarding the 
number of precertification exemptions given to an ICI at any 
given time and EPA's criteria for granting precertification 
exemptions pursuant to 40 CFR 85.1511(b)(3) while other 
precertification exemptions are pending. In addition, a 
provision is made for extension of the 180 day time limit under 
certain circumstances. A precertification exemption allows an 
ICI to bring a vehicle or engine into the U.S. for the purpose of 
obtaining a certificate of conformity.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940324-1-00035 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940324-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


EPA is concerned with granting, or with the need for 
granting, precertification exemptions when the ICI has failed to 
complete the certification process and obtain certificates of 
conformity for other prototype vehicles previously entered under 
this exemption. EPA is also concerned about the technical 
capability of some ICIs, that the ICIs successfully modify the 
pending precertification vehicles, and that the ICIs continue to 
comply with all requirements of the Imports regulations. 
Therefore, EPA is proposing limits to precertification 
exemptions.



EPA is proposing an automatic limit of no more than three 
precertification exemptions to an ICI at any one time except upon 
a case-by-case determination that the ICI has demonstrated an 
ability to meet the EPA technical and time requirements for the 
additional prototype vehicle as well as for all other vehicles it 
has already imported. Absent such approval, the ICI will not be 
granted another precertification exemption until a certificate 
for the existing prototype vehicle(s) is obtained or the 
vehicle(s) unable to be brought into conformity with Federal 
emission requirements has been exported. Secondly, regardless of 
the number of outstanding precertification exemptions, EPA also 
would not grant another precertification exemption if the ICI is 
in noncompliance with the Imports regulations for any other 
vehicle already imported until the noncompliance situation is 
resolved. When determining whether to grant approval of 
additional exemptions, EPA will consider such factors as an ICI's 
previously demonstrated success in obtaining certificates of 
conformity in a timely manner, accurate and efficient compliance 
with all certification procedures, extent of progress on other 
outstanding precertification exemptions, and whether the ICI is 
and will likely be in compliance with all requirements of the 
Imports regulations for other vehicles it has already imported. 
EPA is also proposing the following clarifications to the 
precertification process to eliminate confusion associated with 
the final admission of prototype vehicles. The prototype vehicle 
is the first vehicle imported and tested under the certificate of 
conformity for the purposes of testing every third (or fifth) 
vehicle under 40 CFR 85.1505.



Under current regulations, an ICI must obtain a certificate 
of conformity within 180 days of the date of entry of the 
prototype vehicle. If not, then either the total amount of the 
bond is forfeited or the vehicle is exported. EPA recognizes 
there are limited instances when it is not possible to obtain a 
certificate of conformity within 180 days. Therefore, EPA is 
proposing that an extension of the 180 day requirement may be 
granted by the Administrator. The length of the extension will 
be determined by EPA on a case-by-case basis considering the 
needs of each ICI. The ICI must request such an extension prior 
to the expiration of the 180 days. EPA expects to grant such 
requests only under unique circumstances. For example, EPA would 
expect to grant an extension to an ICI who has completed all 
modifications for the vehicle and certification testing is 
pending, but circumstances beyond the ICI's control have led to 
failure to obtain the certificate of conformity within the 
required 180 days. EPA specifically will not grant an extension 
for situations such as (but not limited to) when an ICI allows a 
significant amount of time to elapse in which significant 
progress was not made on the vehicle, or when an ICI fails to 
submit in a timely manner the application for certification (or 
applicable parts, thereof) to EPA. 



The ICI must comply with all requirements of Subpart P once 
the certification process is complete, including the submittal of 
final admission forms as stated in 40 CFR 85.1505, the 
recordkeeping requirements and labeling requirements of 40 CFR 
85.1706 and any other requirements of 40 CFR 85.1501 

et seq.

(2) Racing Exclusion 





According to 40 CFR 85.1511(e), a racing vehicle may be 
imported by any person provided the vehicle meets one or more of 
the exclusion criteria set forth in 40 CFR 85.1703. Presently, 
EPA policy will allow such a vehicle to be imported only with a 
prior written EPA determination that the vehicle meets these 
exclusion criteria. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that 
vehicles which may be legally operated or are capable of being 
legally operated on the streets and highways will not be imported 
as racing vehicles. EPA proposes to incorporate this practice 
into the regulations. 




(3) Warranty/Insurance 





When the current Imports program was initially implemented 
in 1988, EPA discovered that ICIs were not capable of obtaining 
the independent insurance coverage as required in 40 CFR 
85.1510(b)(2). As a result, EPA proposes to amend the existing 
regulations to allow an ICI to obtain prepaid independent 
insurance coverage less than that required by the regulations, 
with the ICI retaining full responsibility for the remaining 
warranty coverage. The prepaid insurance policy, underwritten by 
an independent insurance company, shall at a minimum provide 
coverage for emission related components installed or modified by 
the ICI and to the maximum extent possible, the emission related 
components installed by the OEM. 



This change does not alter the requirement that the ICI 
provide an emissions warranty as required by section 207 (a) and 
(b) of the Act.




(4) Minor Clarifications 





EPA is also proposing the following minor clarifications and 
changes: (1) Adding a definition of fifteen working day hold 
period (and five working day hold period) (40 CFR 85.1502), (2) 
clarifying that the fifteen (or five) working day hold period 
begins the first working day after the application for final 
admission is received by the Manufacturers Operations Division 
(40 CFR 85.1505 and 85.1509), (3) providing for the transfer of 
control of a nonconforming motor vehicle between ICIs after 
conditional admission (40 CFR 85.1504), (4) adding a requirement 
that vehicles be stored within 50 miles of the test facility 
during the fifteen working day hold period (importers wishing to 
use storage facilities not meeting this criterion must obtain 
EPA's prior written approval) (40 CFR 85.1505 and 85.1509), (5) 
providing for the acceptance of alternative dates in lieu of the 
date of original manufacture, if it is unobtainable (40 CFR 
85.1507), (6) clarifying the repair and alteration exemption (40 
CFR 85.1511), (7) clarifying the exclusion for methanol-fueled 
vehicles produced prior to the 1990 model year (40 CFR 85.1511), 
(8) clarifying the catalyst control programs and other 
requirements for United States version vehicles driven overseas 
(40 CFR 85.1512), (9) clarifying that the ICI must retain control 
of each vehicle until final admission is granted by EPA (40 CFR 
85.1513), (10) adding a requirement that to be eligible to modify 
and test six-year old or older vehicles under 40 CFR 85.1509, an 
ICI must have a currently valid certificate of conformity for the 
same vehicle type (

i.e.,

 light-duty gasoline-fueled 
vehicle/truck, heavy-duty diesel engine, or motorcycle) (40 CFR 
85.1509), (11) clarify that unless all requirements of 40 CFR 
85.1505 or 85.1509 have been met, final admission status will not 
be granted (40 CFR 85.1505 and 85.1509), (12) delete the 
requirement that a vehicle greater than 20 original production 
(OP) years old which is ineligible for exclusion, must be 
imported by an ICI (40 CFR 85.1511), (13) clarify that vehicles 
returning to the United States may be imported under bond for 
restoration of any missing, damaged, or disabled emission-related 
parts (40 CFR 85.1512), (14) modify existing regulatory language 
to accurately reflect recent changes in the Act regarding useful 
life and civil penalties (40 CFR 85.1507, 85.1508, 85.1510, and 
85.1513), (15) clarify that a conditionally admitted vehicle or 
engine must comply with EPA requirements at the time that the 
application for final admission is submitted to EPA (40 CFR 
 85.1513), (16) clarify that the recordkeeping requirements for 
maintaining a list of vehicle modifications includes all part 
numbers and calibration changes (40 CFR 85.1507), and (17) 
clarify that a vehicle that is emission tested in order to obtain 
final admission must satisfy all of the applicable testing 
requirements of part 86 (40 CFR 85.1502, 85.1505, 85.1507, 
85.1509, 85.1513, 85.1516).

III. Proposed Amendments To Subpart R 



A. Application of Section 216(2) 



Section 216(2) of the Act defines the term ``motor vehicle'' 
as ``* * * any self-propelled vehicle designed for transporting 
persons or property on a street or highway.'' Generally, EPA 
proposes to amend section 40 CFR 85.1703 to provide additional 
guidance on when a vehicle is not a ``motor vehicle'' under section 
216 of the Act. 

To provide further guidance to the regulated industry, EPA 
proposes to: (1) Amend this exclusion provision to reflect EPA's 
policy that the use of a governor to limit a vehicle's speed to 
25 mph is unacceptable unless the speed control device cannot 
easily be removed, disabled, or circumvented; (2) amend 40 CFR 
85.1703(a)(2) by deleting the reference to safety features 
required by Federal law; (3) revise 40 CFR 85.1703(a)(3) to state 
that the Federal Interstate Highway limitations will be used to 
determine if a vehicle is of ``inordinate size''; (4) include a new 
provision reflecting the Agency's policy that racing and other 
vehicles which are not capable of safe and practical street or 
highway use will not be considered motor vehicles under section 
216 of the Act; and (5) include a new provision to specify when a 
motorcycle (as defined at 40 CFR 86.402-78) will be deemed to not 
be a motor vehicle. 

It is important to note that converting a non-motor vehicle 
into a motor vehicle, and operating it on a public street or 
highway may be considered to be manufacturing and introduction 
into commerce of an uncertified motor vehicle. This is a 
violation of section 203(a)(1) of the Act and may subject the 
manufacturer to civil penalties under section 205 of the Act. 



B. Precertification Exemption 



EPA proposes to amend 40 CFR 85.1702(a) (3) and (4), to 
clarify the distinction between a ``Precertification motor vehicle 
or motor vehicle engine'' and a motor vehicle or motor vehicle 
engine subject to a testing exemption (40 CFR 85.1705). 

EPA further proposes to revise 40 CFR 85.1702(a) (3) and (4) 
by substituting the terms ``Manufacturer-owned vehicle'' and 
``Manufacturer-owned vehicle engine'' for the terms 
``Precertification vehicle'' and ``Precertification vehicle engine'' 
respectively. Finally, EPA proposes to rename 40 CFR 85.1706 
``Manufacturer-owned exemption''. For purposes of this provision, 
this substitution does not expand the meaning of the subject 
terms, but only distinguishes them from the exemptions provided 
to ICIs under Subpart P in order to eliminate possible confusion 
created by the current use of the terms. 



C. Display Exemption 



EPA is also proposing a revision to the display exemption 
found at 40 CFR 85.1511(b)(4) and 85.1707. Presently, EPA will 
grant a temporary display exemption for uncertified motor 
vehicles under certain conditions. Although the exemption will 
be retained, EPA is proposing several clarifications. These 
clarifications include incorporating EPA's policy of granting the 
display exemption for business or public display purposes only; 
and establishing a time limit for the display exemption. In 
addition, the language in the display exemption in 40 CFR 
85.1511(b)(4) and 40 CFR 85.1707 will be reconciled so that both 
provisions will prohibit use on public streets and highways 
except for purposes incident and necessary to the display 
purpose. 



IV. Administrative Requirements 



A. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis 
Executive Order 12866 



Under Executive Order 12866, [58 FR 51,735 
(October 4, 1993)] the Agency must determine whether the 
regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB 
review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order 
defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to 
result in a rule that may: 




(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or 
more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a 
sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the 
environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or 
tribal governments or communities; 

(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere 
with an action taken or planned by another agency; 

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, 
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and 
obligations of recipients thereof; or 

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set 
forth in the Executive Order.

 


It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant 
regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and 
is therefore not subject to OMB review.

B. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The information collection requirements in this proposed 
rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 
3501 

et seq. 

An Information Collection Request document has been 
prepared by EPA (OMB control number 2060-0095, ICR No. 10.06) and 
a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy 
Branch,; EPA; 401 M St., SW. (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC 
20460 or by calling (202) 260-2740. 

This collection of information has an estimated reporting 
burden averaging 0.5 hours per response and an estimated annual 
recordkeeping burden averaging 0.3 hours per respondent. These 
estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching 
existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, 
and completing and reviewing the collection of information. 

Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other 
aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions 
for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch; 
EPA; 401 M St., SW. (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460; and 
to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of 
Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: 
Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final Rule will respond to any OMB or 
public comments on the information collection requirements 
contained in this proposal. 



C. Impact on Small Entities 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires federal 
agencies to identify potentially adverse impacts of federal 
regulations upon small entities. In instances where significant 
impacts are possible on a substantial number of these entities, 
agencies are required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility 
Analysis. 

There will not be a significant impact on a substantial 
number of small business entities because the proposed rule 
benefits the small businesses that import nonconforming vehicles 
into the United States, allowing them additional options for 
importing these vehicles and minimizing their costs. 


Therefore, as required under section 605 of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et. seq

., the Administrator 
certifies that this regulation does not have a significant impact 
on a substantial number of small entities. 



D. Statutory Authority 



Subpart P_Secs. 203, 206, 207, 208, 301 and 307, Clean Air 
Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 7522, 7525, 7541, 7542, 7601 and 
7607). 

Subpart R_Secs. 203(b)(1), 216(2), 301 and 307, Clean Air 
Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 7522(b)(1), 7550(2), 7601 and 7607).

National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program: Revision to Vaccine Injury Table 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Health Resources and Services Administration, HHS. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Extension of Public Comment Period. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document affords interested members of the public an additional 30 days to comment on proposed regulations to
amend the Vaccine Injury Table governing the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) due to recent publication
of a study that may be relevant to the vaccine injury table.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Agency is publishing this Notice to afford members of the public an additional 30 days to provide comments on proposed
regulations to amend the Vaccine Injury Table governing the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (hereinafter
``VICP'' or ``Program''). The VICP was established by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-660
[42 U.S.C. 300aa-10 et seq.] (Act), and provides a system of no-fault compensation for certain individuals
who have been injured by specific childhood vaccines. Petitions for compensation under this Program are filed with
the United States Court of Federal Claims, with a copy served on the Secretary, who is denominated the ``Respondent.''
The Vaccine Injury Table (Table) included in the Act establishes presumptions about causation of certain illnesses
and conditions, which are used by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to adjudicate petitions. 



Under section 312 of the Act, Congress mandated that the Secretary review the scientific literature and other information
on specific adverse consequences of pertussis and rubella vaccines. In accordance with the requirements of that
law, the Secretary entered into a contract with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to perform this review. The IOM published
on August 27, 1991 a report of its review entitled, ``Adverse Effects of Pertussis and Rubella Vaccines'' (hereinafter
``IOM Report.'') 

Section 312 also required the Secretary to propose regulations to amend the Table as a result of such findings. Accordingly,
on August 14, 1992, the Assistant Secretary for Health, with the approval of the Secretary of Health and Human Services
(the Secretary) published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 36878) a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to amend the Table. The NPRM was issued pursuant to section 2114
of the Act, which authorizes the Secretary to promulgate regulations to modify the Table. As required by section 2114(c)
of the Act, the Department provided for a 6-month comment period which closed on February 11, 1993. In addition, on
December 3, 1992, the Department held a public hearing for the purpose of receiving oral testimony on the proposed
rule. 

The Agency analyzed the comments received in preparation for publication of the final rule. During this process,
however, the Agency became aware of the imminent publication of a 10-year follow-up study to the National Childhood
Encephalopathy Study (Madge N., Diamond J., Miller D., Ross E., McManus C., Wadsworth J., Yule W. The National Childhood
Encephalopathy Study: A 10-year follow-up. A report of the medical, social, behavioural and educational outcomes
after serious, acute, neurologic illness in early childhood. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology 1993;
Supplement No. 68;35(7):1-118; Miller D.L., Madge N., Diamond J., Wadsworth J., Ross E. Pertussis immunization
and serious acute neurological illness in children. British medical Journal 1993; 307:1171-1176, hereinafter
``Miller study.''). Because the National Childhood Encephalopathy Study (NCES) was reviewed initially by the IOM,
and because the Miller study looked specifically at the relationship between vaccine administration and resulting
neurological damage, the Department determined that it should not proceed with publication of the final rule until
there had been a sufficient opportunity to consider the conclusions of the new Miller study. Accordingly, the Department
asked the IOM to convene a Committee for purposes of evaluating the Miller study in light of the conclusions of its initial
report. On March 2, 1994, the Institute of Medicine issued a report entitled ``DPT Vaccine and Chronic Nervous System
Dysfunction: A New Analysis.'' 

The Agency has determined that the public should have an additional 30 days to comment on the conclusions of this report
prior to publication of the final rule. Only those comments addressing the conclusions of this latest IOM report will
be considered. Commenters should address whether the proposed rule should be modified in light of the conclusions
of this latest IOM report. The Department will consider carefully all comments received, and will address these comments
in the preamble to the final rule. 

The Department is not able to reproduce herein the entire study for review by the public. Set forth below, however,
is the Executive Summary of the report containing the IOM's conclusions. Copies of the full report can be obtained
by contacting the National Academy of Sciences, 2101 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20077-5576.

Executive Summary 



An Institute of Medicine (IOM) committee recently concluded that the evidence is consistent with a causal relation
between vaccination with DPT and acute encephalopathy (IOM, 1991), and the excess risk was estimated to range from
0 to 10.5 per million DPT immunizations. However, the same IOM committee also concluded that the evidence was insufficient
to indicate a causal relation between DPT and permanent neurologic damage (IOM, 1991). In fact, the relation between
DPT and chronic nervous system dysfunction had not been studied in a rigorous scientific manner until recently. Because
the evidence has been so limited, the appearance of a single new report, a 10-year follow-up to the National Childhood
Encephalopathy Study (NCES, Miller et al., 1993), prompted the U.S. Public Health Service to ask IOM to convene the
Committee to Study New Research on Vaccines with the charge of studying the new data and, if warranted, reevaluating
the causal relation between DPT and chronic nervous system dysfunction. 

The NCES reported that the occurrence of hospitalization for serious neurologic disorders among 2- to 35-month-old
children is very strongly related to the occurrence of death or nervous system dysfunction (neurologic, behavioral,
educational, motor, sensory, or self-care impairment) up to 10 years (Madge et al., 1993; Miller et al. 1993). Children
who experienced the rare but serious acute neurologic disorder within 7 days after receiving DPT were no more or less
likely to experience documented chronic nervous system dysfunction or to have died within 10 years of the acute disorder
than children who had not received DPT within 7 days prior to the onset of the disorder. There were no special characteristics
associated with the acute or chronic nervous system illnesses linked to DPT exposure. 

The NCES did not investigate the possibility of a direct relation between DPT and chronic nervous system dysfunction,
that is, in the absence of a serious acute neurologic illness that occurs within 7 days after receiving DPT. The NCES
provides data only on the limited case of a possible relation between DPT and chronic nervous system dysfunction in
those children in whom a serious acute neurologic illness followed DPT vaccination within 7 days. 

The committee posits three possible scenarios whereby the acute neurologic illnesses that follow DPT might be related
to chronic nervous system dysfunction. 

1. DPT administration might cause serious acute neurologic illness and subsequent chronic dysfunction in children
who might not have otherwise experienced either an acute neurologic illness or chronic dysfunction in the absence
of DPT. 

2. DPT might trigger (and thereby be an immediate or proximate cause) an acute neurologic illness and subsequent chronic
dysfunction in children with underlying brain or metabolic abnormalities. Such children might experience acute
neurologic illness and subsequent chronic dysfunction in association with some trigger other than DPT. 

3. DPT might cause an acute neurologic illness in children with underlying brain or metabolic abnormalities that
would themselves eventually have led to chronic dysfunction even in the absence of an acute neurologic illness. 

The Committee believes its conclusions take into account the fact that the data do not support any one of these scenarios
over the others. Because the NCES did not (and probably could not) rule out the possibility that only children with
underlying brain or metabolic abnormalities react to stimuli such as DPT with acute neurologic illness, and no other
studies establish or rule out such a possibility, the committee concludes that the evidence is insufficient to indicate
whether or not DPT increases the overall risk in children of chronic nervous system dysfunction. 

The NCES data are consistent with the possibility that some children without underlying brain or metabolic abnormalities
might experience serious, acute neurologic illness within 7 days after receiving DPT and that acute neurologic illness
will have chronic nervous system sequelae. The NCES data also are consistent with the possibility that some children
with underlying brain or metabolic abnormalities (which foster a ``triggering'' by DPT of an acute neurologic illness)
might go on to develop chronic nervous system dysfunction due to a DPT-triggered acute illness. Therefore, the committee
concludes that the balance of evidence is consistent with a causal relation between DPT and the forms of chronic nervous
system dysfunction described in the NCES in those children who experience a serious, acute neurologic illness within
7 days after receiving DPT vaccine. This serious, acute neurologic response to DPT is a rare event. The excess risk
has been estimated to range from 0 to 10.5 per million immunizations (IOM, 1991). The evidence does not ``establish''
or ``prove'' a causal relation. The evidence remains insufficient to indicate the presence or absence of a causal
relation between DPT and chronic nervous system dysfunction under any other circumstances. That is, because the
NCES is the only systematic study of long-term dysfunctions after DPT, the committee can only comment on the causal
relation between DPT and those long-term dysfunctions under the conditions studied by the NCES. In particular, it
should be noted that the long term dysfunctions associated with DPT followed a serious acute neurologic illness that
occurred in children within 7 days after receiving DPT.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Designated Ports for Listed Plants 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (the Service) proposes to amend the regulations that establish designated ports for
the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants by adding the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) ports
at Gulfport, MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, as designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees
that are listed as endangered or threatened, under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (the Act), or listed
under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The USDA has adequate
facilities and personnel at these ports to qualify the ports as designated ports for the importation, exportation,
and reexportation of plants under the terms of the Act and CITES. The addition of these three ports to the list of designated
ports would facilitate trade and the enforcement of the Act and CITES. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (the Act), requires, among other things, that plants be imported, exported,
or reexported only at designated ports or, under certain limited circumstances, at nondesignated ports. Section
9(f) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1538(f)) provides for the designation of ports. Under section 9(f)(1), the Secretary of
the Interior (the Secretary) has the authority to establish designated ports based on a finding that such an action
would facilitate enforcement of the Act and reduce the costs of that enforcement. The United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) and the Secretary are responsible for enforcing provisions of the Act and the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) relating to the importation, exportation, and reexportation
of plants listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under CITES. 
The regulations contained in 50 CFR part 24, ``Importation and Exportation of Plants,'' are for the purpose of establishing
ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants. Plants that are listed as endangered or threatened
in 50 CFR 17.12 or in the appendices to CITES in 50 CFR 23.23 are required to be accompanied by documentation and may be
imported, exported, or reexported only at one of the USDA ports listed in  24.12(a) of the regulations. Certain
other USDA ports are designated for the importation, exportation, or reexportation of specific listed plants. Section
24.12(e) of the regulations contains a list of USDA ports that are, for the purposes of the Act and CITES, designated
ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants that are not listed as endangered or threatened
or under CITES. (The USDA regulations in 7 CFR 319.37 contain additional prohibitions and restrictions governing
the importation of plants through those ports.) 

For the purposes of its enforcement of the Act and CITES, the Service requires that a port have personnel with expertise
in identifying endangered or threatened plants, and CITES listed plants, to ensure that such plants are properly
identified by their accompanying documentation. A port must also possess adequate facilities for holding live plants
and plant material, since plants are subject to seizure if imported, exported, or reexported in violation of the Act
or CITES. The Service further requires that, whenever possible, ports be located to coincide with established patterns
of plant trade in order to help reduce shipping costs.

The Service has been asked to add the USDA ports at Gulfport, MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, to the list of designated
ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under
CITES. Logs and lumber from listed trees may currently be imported through one of the designated ports for the importation
of logs and lumber from trees listed as endangered or threatened or under CITES, or through one of the USDA ports designated
for the importation, exportation, or reexportation of plants listed as endangered or threatened or under CITES.
Currently, importers wishing to import logs and lumber from listed trees into a U.S. port on the Gulf of Mexico may use
only Mobile, AL, New Orleans, LA, and Houston and Brownsville, TX. Importers wishing to import logs and lumber from
listed trees into a port in the northwestern United States have only the port of Seattle, WA. 

After consultations with the USDA, the Service has determined that the USDA ports at Gulfport, MS, Portland, OR, and
Vancouver, WA, possess adequate facilities and personnel to carry out enforcement activities related to the Act
and CITES. Additionally, these locations appear to coincide with established patterns of trade. Therefore, the
Service proposes to add these ports to the list of designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from listed
trees. 



Requests for Public Hearing 



Section 9(f)(1) of the Act provides that any person may request an opportunity to comment at a public hearing before
the Secretary confers designated port status on any port. Accordingly, the Service will accept public hearing requests
within 45 days of the publication of this proposed rule. These requests should be sent to the Office of Management Authority
address listed in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this document. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This proposed rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review under Executive Order 12866. 

The Service believes that adding the USDA ports at Gulfport, MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, to the list of designated
ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under
CITES would have a positive economic impact. These ports are significant ports of entry for logs and lumber, but they
currently may not be used to import logs and lumber from listed trees. Currently, importers wishing to import logs
and lumber from listed trees into a U.S. port on the Gulf of Mexico may use only Mobile, AL, New Orleans, LA, and Houston
and Brownsville, TX. Importers wishing to import logs and lumber from listed trees into a port in the northwestern
United States have only the port of Seattle, WA. Adding Gulfport, MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, to the list of
designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees listed as endangered or threatened or under CITES
would result in a savings in time and transportation costs for importers of logs and lumber. 

Under these circumstances, the Service has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities, as described in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). 



Executive Order 12372 


This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive
Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015,
subpart V.) 



Executive Order 12778 


This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. The Office of the Solicitor
has determined that the requirements of Executive Order 12778 have been satisfied.

National Environmental Policy Act 



The Service has determined that this proposed rule to add designated ports under authority of the Endangered Species
Act of 1973 for the importation and exportation of plants is not a major Federal action which would significantly affect
the quality of the human environment within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969.

This proposed rule contains no new information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction

Northeast Multispecies Fishery 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notification of Flexible Area Action System.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NMFS issues this notification to inform the public and the fishing industry that the New England Fishery Management
Council (Council) is considering Flexible Area Action System 

#

8 (FAAS) implementing regulations for the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The purpose of
the action would be to address the discard problems associated with a substantial concentration of spawning and sub-legal
sized haddock. This action is initiated in part based on the data and information generated in support of FAAS 

#

7, which was not implemented by NMFS due, in part, to insufficient supporting data. The area affected is located offshore
of Cape Cod, MA and is in and around the area known as Closed Area I.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This action is taken under 50 CFR 651.26 of the regulation implementing the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management
Plan. Section 651.26 specifies a FAAS whereby protection can be provided to concentrations of juvenile, sub-legal
or spawning fish. As part of this process, the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), will initiate
a fact-finding investigation of the alleged problem. The Council will also provide an impact analysis of alternative
measures that might be implemented under this action. 



The problem that may require measures to be taken under the FAAS is the possible discarding of large quantities of haddock,
including spawning females. This situation may present an impediment to haddock spawning success, result in significant
waste of haddock, and would be detrimental to the Council's haddock stock-rebuilding efforts. Fishermen are required
to discard haddock due to either the implementation of emergency rules to protect haddock, which include a 500-pound
(226.8 kg) haddock possession limit, or the setting of a 19-inch (14.26 cm) minimum legal size for haddock. 

The Council was alerted to this possible discard problem in early February, 1994 and initiated FAAS 

#

7. The Regional Director conducted a fact-finding mission. The Committee formulated a recommendation to close an
area on the basis of the fact-finding report, an additional sea-sampling report, and information presented at a public
hearing. The Regional Director did not implement the Committee's recommendation to close the area because the information
available was inconclusive, particularly with respect to the large area under consideration.

The Council learned from a sea-sampling report in conjunction with FAAS 

#

7 that 95 percent by weight of the haddock caught on that trip was discarded. On that trip, a sampling of discarded fish
indicated that 80 percent of the discarded haddock was sub-legal size. The Council has requested the Regional Director
to gather additional information under FASS 

#

8 to determine whether a problem exists that requires management action.

 Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Indian Affairs is proposing to revise its regulations on the administration of its roads. These proposed
changes are necessary because of new procedures and methods, the adoption of the Federal Lands Highways Program,
and other events since the last revision. The purpose of this revision is to reflect the current Bureau of Indian Affairs
(BIA) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) policies for the road systems on Indian Reservations; to ensure
that funds are made available from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) for construction projects on Indian Reservations
Roads (IRR) in accordance with the relative needs of the reservations; and to implement aspects of tribal self-determination.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Bureau of Indian Affairs is proposing this revision to incorporate the requirements and procedures of the Federal
Lands Highways Program, 23 U.S.C. 202 and 204, and to reflect the policies of the FHWA for road systems on Indian reservations.
The incorporation of these requirements will ensure that funds from the HTF are available for construction projects
on IRR according to the needs of the reservation as prioritized by the affected Indian Tribes. 



A substantial backlog of needed road construction serving Indian reservations exists making the establishment
of project priorities a necessity. The requirements of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of
1991 (ISTEA), Public Law 102-240, 105 Stat. 1914 (December 18, 1991) and the policy of Indian Self-Determination,
mandate that consultation procedures with Tribal Governments to determine these priorities should be established,
subject to BIA approval of the expenditure of Federal Funds. 

Procedures shall be followed and periodically revised to ensure that the opportunity exists for the various Indian
reservations to receive a fair and equitable share of funds from the HTF for construction projects on Indian reservation
roads. These projects are funded according to their relative needs and to meet the legislative requirements established
which affect Indian reservations.

This rule is not a significant rule under Executive Order 12866 and, thus, will not be reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget. This rule does not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the
criteria established by the Regulatory Flexibility Act and does not constitute a major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment as defined in the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. This rule
does not contain information collection requirements as defined by 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. which require the approval
of the Office of Management and Budget. The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these
proposed regulations meet the applicable standards provided in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) (2) of Executive Order 12778.
In accordance with Executive Order 12630, the Department has determined that this rule does not have significant
takings implications and that this rule does not have significant federalism effects under Executive Order 12612.

Subpart A_Construction and Maintenance of Roads 


 170.1 

Purpose. 



The purpose of this part is to set forth regulations to govern the planning, design, construction, maintenance, and
general administration of Indian reservation roads. In compliance with 23 U.S.C. 202, these regulations have been
jointly developed and approved by the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs (DOI) and the Federal Highway Administrator,
Department of Transportation. Any FHWA/BIA interagency agreements relative to the administration of the IRR program
shall be developed and approved after allowing tribal governments the opportunity to review and comment. 



 170.2 

Definitions. 




BIA Road System 

means those existing and proposed IRR for which the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) owns or plans to obtain legal right-of-way.
This includes only roads for which the BIA has the primary responsibility to construct, improve and maintain, and
for which any changes to this system shall be supported by a tribal resolution. 



Construction 

means engineering, supervising, inspecting, actual building, and all expenses incidental to the construction
and improvement of roads and bridges. Construction includes the elimination of roadway hazards, the acquisition
of right-of-way, reconstruction, resurfacing, restoration, rehabilitation, sealing of the roadway, and traffic
flow control or improvement. Also included are designed pavement overlays that add to the structural value and design
life of the pavement, or provide identified safety skid resistance, and double bituminous surface and chip seals
that are part of predefined stage construction or form the final surface on low volume roads. 



Force account 

means the use of BIA personnel to perform construction and maintenance on IRR. Program and project documentation
is completed under these operations in accordance with specifications and applicable directives from the Bureau
of Indian Affairs Manual (BIAM) for each project. 



Indian Reservation Roads (IRR) 

``means public roads that are located within or provide access to an Indian reservation or Indian trust land or restricted
Indian land which is not subject to fee title alienation without the approval of the Federal Government or Indian and
Alaska Native villages, groups or communities in which the majority of the residents are Indians or Alaskan Natives,
whom the Secretary has determined are eligible for services generally available to Indians under Federal laws specifically
applicable to Indians.'' (23 U.S.C. 101(a).) Roads in the BIA Road System are included in the IRR system. 



Maintenance 

means the act of preserving the entire roadway, including the surface, shoulder, roadsides, drainages, and structures,
preserving the road as nearly as practical to the original as-built condition, and providing snow and ice removal,
vegetation control, traffic control devices, and other services for the safety and convenience of the user. Maintenance
may also include minor improvements which could not be done efficiently with road construction funds, or the removal
of safety hazards. Maintenance does not include constructing roads to a substantially higher standard. 



Public road 

means any road or street under the jurisdiction of and maintained by a public authority and open to public travel. 
(23 U.S.C. 101(a).)

Secretary

 means the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, or a designated representative, who will usually be the Assistant
Secretary_Indian Affairs or a Deputy to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.



State

 means one of the 50 United States, a Territory, or a political subdivision of a State or Territory. For purposes of 23
U.S.C. 402_Highway Safety Programs and for other programs in the future, and with the approval of the Secretary of
Transportation, State may include the BIA; Governor of a State may include the Secretary of the Interior; and a political
subdivision of a State may include the tribal government on an Indian Reservation.



Superintendent

 means the Agency Superintendent at all locations. The Area Director or a designated representative may appear for
the Superintendent at public hearings on arterial roads which cross Agency boundaries of jurisdiction.



 170.3

 Federal Lands Highways Programs (23 U.S.C. 202 and 204).



(a) The coordinated Federal Lands Highways Program (FLHP) consists of the Forest Highways, Public Lands Highways,
Park Roads, Parkways and Indian Reservation Roads as defined in 23 U.S.C. 101. The purpose is to treat all Federal Roads
which are public roads under the same uniform policies as roads on the Federal-Aid Systems. (23 U.S.C. 204).

(b) BIA shall coordinate management of IRR construction with the programs of the National Park Service, U.S. Forest
Service, and the Public Lands Highways program of the FHWA. BIA management policies shall conform to policies for
roads which are on the Federal-aid highways, including application of the FAR and Government Accounting Standards.

(c) In planning and constructing IRR the BIA may enter into contracts with other Federal agencies, States, counties,
cities, or tribal governments. In these contracts, the BIA or one of the other governmental agencies may be the lead
agency, accepting contributions from the other agencies involved. When the BIA is the lead agency in a cooperative
project with a State, county, local subdivision, or tribal government, reimbursement authority shall be issued
to the BIA for crediting the funds received to the appropriation available for IRR construction projects. All projects
shall be developed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, the National Historic
Preservation Act, and other Federal requirements. These projects are included as part of the continuing cooperative
and comprehensive planning process used to develop Statewide transportation improvement programs by States. The
projects will also be part of approved long-range and short-range plans in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 134, 135(e)(f)
and 204(a).

(d) Indian labor shall be used at the maximum practical level on projects using IRR construction funds or road maintenance
funds. Since ceilings on Federal employment do not apply to construction and improvement of Indian reservation roads,
staffing and overtime decisions shall be based upon project requirements, efficiency, the availability of Indian
labor, and other governmental costs including unemployment compensation and welfare. The BIA shall assist the FHWA
and the States to apply Indian preference to Federal-aid highway projects on or near Indian reservations.

(e) The BIA shall cooperate with the FHWA in developing procedures to provide the information needed by the Secretary
of Transportation in making the determination that a proposed obligation of IRR funds on a Federal-aid project is
supplemental to, and not in lieu of, the obligation of a fair and equitable share of funds apportioned to the State pursuant
to 23 U.S.C. 104. The Secretary may enter into an agreement with a State or subdivision of a State for supplementary
funding in the construction and maintenance of IRR. At locations where road projects serve non-Indian land as well
as Indian land, State participation shall be requested. Funds for IRR may be used in conjunction with Federal-aid
funds on State Federal-aid highway projects, including projects in the Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation
Program (HBRRP). Pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 144(g)(4), not less than one percent of the apportioned HBRRP funds is set aside
in each State that has an Indian Reservation, as defined in 25 CFR 170.2, within its boundaries for projects to replace,
rehabilitate, paint, or apply magnesium acetate to IRR bridges. The IRR funds can also be used for the required 20 percent
State match requirements. (23 U.S.C. 144).

(f) Subject to availability of qualified Indian contractors, IRR construction contracts shall be advertised for
award to the lowest qualified bidder under the provisions of the Buy Indian Act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 891). Subject
to availability of qualified Indian subcontractors, prime contractors shall be required to give preference to Indian
subcontractors on IRR construction contracts. A good faith effort to locate qualified Indian contractors and subcontractors
shall be required. Incentives may be provided for training Indian subcontractors. Contracts with tribal governments
under Public Law 93-638 shall be written, negotiated, and monitored to ensure meeting the requirements of 23
U.S.C.

(g) On cooperative projects where Federal aid and IRR funds are used, guidelines will be developed to include procedures
for the BIA and State to negotiate the use of the Buy Indian Act (36 Stat. 891) based on the percentage of fund contribution
for the project.

(h) IRR funds can also be used on tribally-owned vocational post-secondary school road construction projects pursuant
to section 1032(d) of the ISTEA. For the purpose of this part, roads constructed under section 1032(d) are public roads.

(i) The BIA, in cooperation with the FHWA and the states, will develop procedures for implementing management systems
for bridge, pavement, and safety on Indian reservation roads (23 U.S.C. 204(a)).



 170.4

 Approval of fund distribution.



(a) The Secretary, with the concurrence of the Secretary of Transportation, shall approve the distribution of IRR
construction funds.

(b) The Secretary shall approve the distribution of maintenance funds for Indian road needs. This type of approval
does not require the concurrence of the Secretary of Transportation.

(c) Indian tribal governments shall be consulted concerning the distribution of Indian road construction and maintenance
funds.



 170.5

 Federal-aid highways.



(a) Federal-aid highways, containing rural major collector or higher functional classification routes, are designated
by each State highway department in cooperation with local officials, and are subject to the approval of the Secretary
of Transportation. The BIA will assist tribal governments as they participate in the State-Tribal responsibility
of designating Federal-aid highways which serve Indian lands.

(b) Some public roads on Indian Reservations are eligible for funding from the Federal-aid program through the States
and counties. Pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 204(c), IRR funds shall be supplementary to, and not in lieu of, the obligation
of funds apportioned to an IRR project from the Federal-aid program. The BIA will assist tribal governments as they
participate with local governments in the development of programs of construction projects and maintenance of those
roads which are on Indian Reservations.



 170.6

 Road Inventory and Needs Study.



(a) The BIA shall maintain an inventory of identified Indian Reservation Roads as defined in  170.2 of this subpart.
The inventory shall be maintained to provide: (1) Appropriate reports required by 23 CFR 460.3(c), 23 CFR 470.107(b)
and (c), or by Congressional request.

(2) Long-range planning estimates of construction costs and annual maintenance needs. This construction data will
be provided to FHWA as part of the annual Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) requirements of 23 U.S.C. 135.


(b) An overall needs analysis will be an ongoing function by the BIA to provide appropriate information necessary
to develop a relative needs data base. This data will be used in the budgetary process and as support for any needs study
to: (1) Make reports to Congress from time to time or as required. 

(2) Determine the costs for all identified Indian Reservation Roads improvements. 

(c) The BIA shall provide assistance to tribal governments in developing their administrative capabilities for
managing their reservation transportation systems and economic development plans. 



 170.7 

Transportation planning. 



The BIA shall carry out a transportation planning process for IRR to support the construction and improvement program
similar to 23 U.S.C. 134, 135, 307, and in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 204 (h) and (j). Transportation plans shall be developed
using an in-depth and comprehensive evaluation of all factors and elements influencing the orderly development
of transportation systems. Planning will establish a definitive system for determining the needs for both new and
improved highway facilities commensurate with social, environmental, and economic conditions, and shall provide
the information needed for developing future transportation programs and distribution of IRR funds in accordance
with the relative needs of the various Indian Reservations and tribal priorities. Transportation planning shall
consider the information contained in management systems for highway pavement, bridges, and safety. BIA's transportation
planning process shall be reviewed and deemed adequate by FHWA. 



 170.8 

Selection of road construction project priorities. 



(a) The Superintendent shall inform the appropriate local tribal officials of all financial and technical information
relating to the IRR program and alternatives of proposed road developments, arranging for technical assistance
from other offices as required. The Superintendent shall recommend to the tribe those proposed road projects having
the greatest need as determined by a comprehensive transportation analysis. Tribes shall develop a prioritized
list of projects. Where more than one tribe is involved, the Superintendent shall make special efforts to ensure that
all tribes are informed and given an opportunity to participate in priority decisions. Where the Superintendent
and the tribe or tribes cannot agree on priorities, the Superintendent shall forward the proposals for review and
decision to the Area Office. 

(b) The Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs may establish priorities for programs of national scope and for administrative
purposes with the concurrence of the Secretary of Transportation and in consultation with national Indian organizations.
Such national priorities may include safety, hazard elimination, bridge programs, and economic development. 



 170.9 

Annual program approval. 



(a) The Secretary and the Secretary of Transportation, or an authorized representative, shall approve all projects
in the IRR construction program before any expenditures are made. An annual transportation improvement program
shall be developed for approval of the Secretary and the Secretary of Transportation or an authorized representative,
pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 135. 

(b) Since IRR are defined in 23 U.S.C. 101 as public roads, no funds appropriated for IRR may be spent for the construction,
maintenance, or improvement of roads which are not public roads, except in emergencies hazardous to life or property,
which are subsequently reimbursed back to the IRR program, or except as noted in section 1032(d) of the ISTEA. 



 170.10 

Allocations. 



After October 1 of each fiscal year, the Secretary of Transportation shall allocate the sums appropriated for such
fiscal year as provided in 23 U.S.C. 202. Funds for IRR construction projects shall be allocated according to the relative
needs of the various reservations as jointly identified by the Secretary and the Secretary of Transportation. Allocations
may be modified during the year to ensure maximum benefit to the Indian people. The Secretary will identify the amount
of IRR funds allocated to each BIA Area Office and how this amount was determined. The Secretary also will document
how each BIA Area Office distributes these funds. 



 170.11 

Availability of funds. 



Funds authorized for IRR shall be available for contract or Force Account construction upon distribution, or on October
1 of the fiscal year for which authorized if no distribution is required. Any amount of contract authority remaining
unobligated at the end of a fiscal year that is greater than the funds authorized during that fiscal year and the prior
three (3) fiscal years combined shall be considered lapsed and will be withdrawn. The Secretary has authority to incur
obligations, approve projects, and enter into contracts under such authorizations, and the action in doing so is
deemed a contractual obligation of the United States for the payment of the cost thereof, and such funds shall be deemed
to have been expended when so obligated (23 U.S.C. 203).

 170.12 

Program certification. 



(a) The Secretary of Transportation may discharge all responsibilities, or any part of them, pursuant to 23 U.S.C.
117 relative to projects in the IRR program, upon the request of the BIA, by accepting a certification by the BIA of its
performance of such responsibilities. The acceptance of the BIA Certification by the Secretary of Transportation
acknowledges that the BIA road construction program procedures shall be carried out in a manner which will accomplish
the objectives of title 23, U.S.C. The certification may include all or part of the procedures, and may involve all
or part of the field offices, of BIA. The Secretary of Transportation may rescind the BIA Certification of Performance
of Responsibilities under 23 U.S.C. at any time considered necessary. 

(b) The BIA will notify the Secretary of Transportation upon the completion of each construction project. The Secretary
of Transportation shall require an adequate report of the estimated and actual cost of construction, as well as such
other information as is determined necessary. All final inspections on each project will be conducted in accordance
with procedures jointly established by the Secretary and the Secretary of Transportation. 



 170.13 

Program analysis. 



To ensure proper implementation of title 23 U.S.C. requirements in the IRR programs, the BIA shall conduct reviews
at the national, Area, and tribal levels. These reviews shall evaluate policy, procedures, operations, and service
delivery and shall make recommendations for improvements and corrective actions in compliance with statutes, manuals,
and policy regarding road construction and road maintenance. The BIA shall also analyze workload, adequacy of staffing,
efficiency of operations, and program effectiveness at each level and report to the Assistant Secretary_Indian
Affairs. A review of support services to road programs shall be performed. The analysis shall assess the efficiency
of program operations; effectiveness of organizational structures and relationships and of operating systems
and procedures; and work force requirements and utilization. It shall assist management in the establishment of
program objectives and provide a mechanism to develop performance measurements; to ensure accountability for the
Highway Trust Funds; and to promote the efficiency, economy, and effectiveness of roads programs. 



 170.14 

Right-of-way. 



(a) The procedures for obtaining permission to survey or to grant any necessary right-of-way are governed by 25 CFR
part 169 of this chapter. Prior to any work being done for the construction of road projects, the Superintendent shall
obtain the written consent of the Indian and non-Indian landowners. Where an Indian has an interest in tribal land,
consent shall be obtained in accordance with the policy of the Indian tribe. Right-of-way easements are to be documented
on forms approved by the Secretary. All right-of-way actions shall be in accordance with the requirement of the Uniform
Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act (42 U.S.C. 4601 

et seq.

 as amended), and 49 CFR part 24. 

(b) Prior to construction, right-of-way easements for the project shall be obtained in favor of the public agency
that will be responsible for maintenance and reconstruction of the route. When that agency is the BIA, easements shall
be in favor of the United States, its successors and assigns, with the right to construct, maintain, and repair improvements
thereon and thereover, for such purposes; and with the further right in the United States, its successors and assigns,
to transfer the right-of-way easements by assignment, grant, or otherwise. 

(c) No right-of-way shall be transferred without consultation with the tribal government. 



 170.15 

Road design. 



The BIA is responsible for collecting reliable data, designing safe and economical roads, and developing adequate
construction plans, specifications, and estimates. General guidelines will be the latest edition of the relevant
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) publications, ``A Policy on Geometric
Design of Highways and Streets,'' and the ``Roadside Design Guide''; and the FHWA publications, ``Standard Specifications
for Construction of Roads and Bridges on Federal Highway Projects'' (or approved State specifications) and the ``Manual
on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.''

(b) The BIA shall conduct engineering and traffic analysis in accordance with established traffic engineering practices
to determine the necessary maximum speed limit, maximum vehicular size and weight limit, and traffic control devices.
The BIA shall, in cooperation with tribes and local government officials, erect, maintain, and enforce compliance
with the needed regulatory signs and pavement markings in accordance with the ``Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices (MUTCD).'' 



 170.18 

Equipment pool operations. 



(a) BIA Equipment Pools operating on a reimbursable basis may rent BIA-owned equipment to approved IRR Force Account
projects funded under contract authority from the Highway Trust Fund, or other authorized Federal programs. The
equipment pool manager must obtain reimbursement authority to retain and re-obligate income for costs incurred.
The accounting procedures and methods of determining reimbursement costs shall be uniformly and equitably applied
to all projects and activities irrespective of source of funds in accordance with the provisions of 23 CFR 140.715.


(b) Equipment rent shall be collected from approved projects and activities for the use of pool equipment. The established
equipment rental rates shall be limited to the recovery of actual acquisition costs, including equipment replacement
costs, equipment pool overhead, and actual operating cost. (See 23 CFR part 140 (Reimbursement) and 48 CFR part 31
(Contract Cost Principles and Procedures)). Examples of eligible costs for reimbursement are listed in the Office

are receiving a fair and equitable share of road maintenance services provided by funds derived from highway user
taxes. Where problems are identified, the Superintendent shall coordinate a meeting of appropriate tribal representatives
and other government officials to discuss methods of correcting the problems. Where these problems cannot be resolved
locally, the Superintendent shall refer this matter to the Area Director. The Area Director shall attempt to resolve
the problems with the assistance of the FHWA and the State Officials. Any problems that cannot be resolved at the Area
level shall be referred to the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs. 

(c) Any jurisdiction failing to maintain roads constructed with Highway Trust Funds shall be ineligible for further
Highway Trust Funded construction projects (23 U.S.C. 116). 



 170.20

 170.21 

Emergency Relief Program. 



Any natural disaster over a widespread area or catastrophic failure which causes serious (more than heavy maintenance)
damage to IRR, may be cause for eligibility for reimbursement under the Emergency Relief Program of 23 U.S.C. 125 and
23 CFR part 668. To qualify, the occurrence should be declared a disaster by the President of the United States and shall
have a positive finding determination made by the Federal Highway Administration. If the road repairs in an area may
be considered for authorization under the Emergency Relief Program, records and photographs of the damage sites
and of initial repairs and closures to assure public safety shall be kept by the BIA for possible reimbursement under
this program. Those initial repairs may, as an emergency measure, be charged to any available program under the control
of the line official. Reimbursement will be made from Emergency Relief Funds after approval, or from road maintenance
funds if approval is denied. Careful analysis of program fund usage shall be made considering the temporary charges
made to a program whose authority may terminate with the fiscal year. (Specific procedures to be followed in the Emergency
Relief Program are contained in 23 CFR part 668.) 



 170.22 

Bridges. 



(a) The existence of a flood plain encroachment by a proposed structure shall be determined by technical study. An
analysis of the hydrology and the hydraulics of the site shall be performed in accordance with established Executive
Order 11988 as implemented in 23 CFR 650.111. 

(b) All existing bridges on the BIA road system shall be inspected periodically for structural condition and functional
adequacy, in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 144 and 151. These field inspections shall be conducted in accordance with
the National Bridge Inspection Standards. The following measures shall be taken in accordance with recommendations
of the inspecting engineer in the field inspection report, as amended by a technical review by the BIA Division of Transportation
and the Area Road Engineer, in order to protect the safety of the travelling public: 

(1) The erection and maintenance of load limit and safety warning signs and other maintenance work; 

(2) The construction or installation of safety enhancement appurtenances such as traffic delineators, bridge railing
and approach guardrailing; and 

(3) The rehabilitation or replacement of deficient structures. (23 U.S.C. 144 (g)(4)). 

(c) Current data obtained from the bridge inspections shall be maintained in a computer inventory file. The inventory
data shall be used to produce a biennial bridge inventory report and an annual bridge sufficiency rating report. 

(d) The National Bridge Inspection Standards require each State to maintain an inventory of all bridge structures
subject to the Standards, which includes all bridges on public roads. Therefore, the required inventory and inspection
data for all IRR bridges must be submitted to the State for inclusion in the State's bridge inventory file. The data
shall include all items contained in the current ``Recording and Coding Guide for the Structure Inventory and Appraisal
of the Nation's Bridges.'' 

(e) Bridges that are identified on the bridge sufficiency rating report as being deficient shall be prioritized and
programmed for closure, maintenance, rehabilitation, or replacement. Correction of the deficiency shall be accomplished
expeditiously after the deficiency is first identified. 



 170.23 

Airports. 



Airports, including heliports, which provide service to Indian reservations shall not be constructed or improved
with appropriated road construction or road maintenance funds. Public airports and heliports may be maintained
with road maintenance funds in accordance with appropriations and tribal priorities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The Secretary is proposing to revise 34 CFR part 682 to implement changes made to the HEA by the Higher Education Amendments
of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-325), enacted July 23, 1992. These regulations seek to improve the efficiency of Federal
student aid programs, and, by so doing, to improve their capacity to enhance opportunities for postsecondary education.

Summary of Comments From Regional Meetings 



In compliance with section 492(a) of the HEA, the Secretary convened regional meetings during September 1992 to obtain
public involvement in the development of these proposed regulations. The purpose of the meetings was to ``provide
for a comprehensive discussion and exchange of information concerning the implementation'' of certain parts of
Public Law 102-325. In addition, attendees of the regional meetings were asked to nominate individuals to act
as negotiators in the negotiated rulemaking process required by section 492(b) of the HEA. 

The regional meetings were conducted for two days each in San Francisco, California; New York, New York; Atlanta,
Georgia; and Kansas City, Missouri during September 1992. Each participant at the regional meetings was assigned
to one of six groups which were asked to discuss particular issue areas identified by the Department. Each group at
the regional meetings prepared a report of its discussion and recommendations and those reports were presented to
the Department for consideration during the preparation of the proposed regulations. 

At each regional meeting, groups discussed the statutory changes relating to repayment of loans that are addressed
in these proposed regulations. The Department considered the comments received during the regional meetings in
preparing draft proposed regulations. Below is a summary of the information received and the proposals made to the
Secretary during the regional meetings relating to these proposed regulations. 



Repayment Plans

_Public Law 102-325 amended section 428(b)(1)(E) to require that borrowers be offered income-sensitive repayment
plans. Participants at all of the regional meetings discussed whether lenders were required to provide both graduated
and income-sensitive repayment plans to all borrowers or whether lenders had some discretion, but none of the groups
reached an agreement. 

Participants at the meetings also discussed what documentation should be considered in determining an income-sensitive
repayment schedule. The participants at the Atlanta and Kansas City meetings recommended that the lender be permitted
to rely on the borrower's self-certification of income, while participants at the San Francisco meeting recommended
that the borrower be required to submit documentation reflecting income to the lender every three years. Participants
at the Atlanta and San Francisco meetings also recommended that borrowers be permitted to change repayment plans
during the repayment period, but participants at the Kansas City meeting recommended that the lender be given flexibility
to determine the borrower's repayment schedule without regulatory restrictions. 



Deferments

_Public Law 102-325 substantially modified the deferments available to borrowers under the FFEL Program.
The deferments for borrowers who are in school or unemployed were only slightly modified, but the other specific deferments
in prior law were eliminated and replaced by a deferment for periods (up to three years) in which the borrower has or
will have an economic hardship. 

There was extensive discussion at all of the regional meetings regarding the appropriate criteria for an economic
hardship deferment. Participants at each of the regional meetings supported a different standard for economic hardship:
participants at the New York meeting concluded that income below the minimum wage should be used as the standard for
economic hardship; participants at the Atlanta meeting recommended that borrowers who relied on public assistance
and borrowers whose income did not exceed certain levels or whose debts exceeded their income should be considered
as satisfying the economic hardship criteria; the San Francisco attendees recommended that the Department consider
a variety of factors in defining economic hardship, including the ratio of debt payment to income, poverty level based
on family size, and any disabilities the borrower may have. The Kansas City participants also recommended consideration
of poverty level and analysis of debt and income. 

Participants at all of the meetings generally recommended that the deferment be approved for one year at a time. However,
there were significant differences in the recommendations relating to the documentation requirements. Participants
at the Atlanta meeting identified specific documents that the attendees believed should be submitted to support
a request for an economic hardship deferment; participants at the New York meeting recommended that the Department
require ``reasonable, appropriate'' documentation; the attendees at the San Francisco meeting recommended that
the regulations not require the borrower to provide documentation with the application for a deferment but permit
the lender to require supporting documentation; and attendees at the Kansas City meeting recommended that the borrower
be allowed to self-certify eligibility for the deferment.

Forbearance based on income-to-debt ratio

_The Department initially interpreted section 428(b)(1)(V)(ii) of the HEA to provide that the mandatory forbearance
for borrowers with a debt burden under Title IV of the Act that equals or exceeds 20 percent of the borrower's gross income
applied only to medical and dental interns. Attendees at the regional meeting in Kansas City disagreed with this view
and recommended that the Department's regulations permit all borrowers who meet the debt burden criteria to receive
the forbearance. Participants at the meeting in New York agreed with the Department's interpretation but recommended
that lenders be given the discretion to apply the debt burden standard to all borrowers. Participants at all of the
regional meetings recommended that the regulations permit lenders to base a decision regarding forbearance on income
and debt information certified by the borrower. The attendees at the Atlanta meeting specifically recommended that
the regulations permit the decision on forbearance to be based on the borrower's anticipated income for the next 12
months rather than relying on past income records. 



Forbearance_General Requirements

_Public Law 102-325 amended section 428(c)(3) of the HEA to make changes in the requirements for forbearance
in the FFEL Program. Participants at all of the regional meetings agreed that the Department should allow the lender
discretion as to when to approve changes in an existing forbearance arrangement and recommended that borrower-certified
information should be sufficient to support the granting of a forbearance. In addition, attendees at the regional
meetings agreed that the period of forbearance should not be counted against the borrower's limited repayment period.


However, there was disagreement among the meeting participants on other issues. Participants at the Kansas City
regional meeting recommended the use of a single national forbearance application form, while attendees at the Atlanta
meeting recommended the use of ``local'' forms and the attendees at the San Francisco meeting recommended the continuation
of current procedures. There was also disagreement as to whether a forbearance should be available to take a loan out
of default_attendees at the Kansas City and Atlanta meetings agreed that forbearance should be available for this
purpose while attendees at the New York meeting recommended that a forbearance be available only until a default claim
is submitted on the loan. 

Finally, participants at all of the regional meetings identified a number of situations in which the regulations
could require a lender to provide administrative forbearance. Participants at all of the meetings, except Atlanta,
recommended that notice to the borrower of administrative forbearance be required, but participants at all the meetings
also recommended that the regulations not require the borrower to agree to the forbearance. 



Negotiated Rulemaking 



After completion of the regional meetings, the Department prepared draft proposed regulations to implement the
provisions of Public Law 102-325 relating to the FFEL Program. In accordance with the requirements of section
492(b) of the HEA, those regulations were submitted to a negotiated rulemaking process. During the weeks of January
4-8 and February 1-5, 1993, the Department met with negotiators selected from among individuals nominated
by attendees at the regional meetings. 

The discussion below of the proposed regulations reflects those areas where the negotiators reached a consensus
and the proposed regulations reflect that agreement. The discussion below also indicates where consensus was not
reached during the negotiations. However, the negotiators did not choose to discuss every part of these proposed
regulations. Accordingly, the discussion below of those issues not discussed during the negotiations reflects
only the views of the Secretary. 



Proposed Regulatory Changes 



Section 682.209 Repayment of a Loan 



The proposed regulations implement the provisions of section 428(b)(1)(E)(i) of the HEA in requiring lenders to
offer income-sensitive or graduated repayment schedules to borrowers. In developing criteria to be used by lenders
when establishing income-sensitive repayment schedules, the Secretary believes that borrowers should be required
to provide documentation of income. The Secretary therefore proposes that lenders request at least a copy of the borrower's
most recent Federal income tax return if one had been filed within eight months prior to the date it is requested by the
lender, and evidence showing the amount of the borrower's most recent monthly disposable income, including, if applicable,
pay statements from employers and documentation of any income received by the borrower from other parties. 

In addition, the Secretary does not believe it would be helpful to the borrower or in the interests of the taxpayer if
the borrower's monthly payment amount is not changed whenever there is a significant increase in the borrower's income.
Therefore, the proposed regulations require an adjustment in the monthly payment amount if the borrower's disposable
income, for each of three consecutive months, exceeds twice the income upon which the payment amount is based. Similarly,
if the borrower experiences a comparable decrease in disposable income, the Secretary strongly encourages a lender
to grant a forbearance to a borrower who asks the lender for assistance, but who is ineligible for a deferment. In a notice
of proposed rulemaking published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 16, 1994 (59 FR 12484), the Secretary also proposes to define ``disposable income'' in  682.200(b)
as that part of a borrower's compensation from an employer or other income from any source that remains after the deduction
of any amounts required by law to be withheld.

The Secretary does not believe it would be helpful to the borrower or in the interests of the taxpayer if the borrower's
monthly payment amount is dramatically increased in the later stages of the maximum repayment period to accommodate
payments that are too small in earlier years. The proposed regulations prohibit a lender from establishing a graduated
repayment plan that schedules any single installment to be greater than three times the amount of any other scheduled
installment. Under an income-sensitive repayment schedule, the borrower's payment amount is adjusted at least
annually. Given the fact that some borrowers may experience wide fluctuations in their income from year-to-year,
a strict adherence to the ``three times'' rule in the case of an annual adjustment to a borrower's income-sensitive
repayment schedule would not always permit the intention of a true income-sensitive schedule to be achieved. However,
the Secretary encourages lenders, whenever feasible, to attempt to establish a borrower's income-sensitive repayment
amount within the ``three times'' rule. To implement these requirements, the proposed regulations would permit
a lender to grant forbearance (which does not count against the maximum 10-year repayment period) under 34 CFR 682.211
for a period up to 3 years if the effect of an income-sensitive repayment schedule causes the extension of the maximum
repayment term of the loan. 

Finally, the Secretary proposes that a fixed-amount repayment schedule be used if a borrower fails to indicate a choice
of repayment schedules, or fails to maintain eligibility for an income-sensitive repayment schedule. 

The Secretary estimates that lenders collectively will need an additional 20,000 hours to comply with the statutory
requirement that income-sensitive repayment schedules be offered to most borrowers. The income documentation
required from borrowers (the borrower's most recent Federal income tax return if one had been filed within six months
prior to the date it is requested by the lender, and evidence showing the amount of the borrower's most recent monthly
disposable income) is needed to obtain verifiable data to accurately determine the amount of the borrower's installment
payment. 



Section 682.210 Deferment 



The proposed regulations implement the requirements of section 428(b)(1)(M)(iii) of the HEA. During the negotiations,
a point of contention was the requirements a borrower must meet to qualify for an economic hardship deferment. In developing
criteria to be used by lenders when granting an economic hardship deferment to a borrower based on the borrower's income
and debt-to-income ratio, as required by section 435(o)(2) of the HEA, the Secretary believes that borrowers should
be required to provide documentation of income. The Secretary therefore proposes that lenders obtain at least a copy
of the borrower's most recent Federal income tax return if one had been filed within six months prior to the date it is
requested, and evidence showing the amount of the borrower's most recent monthly disposable income. 

In addition, the Secretary does not believe it would be helpful to the borrower or in the interests of the taxpayer if
a borrower who has the means to repay the loan does not do so. Therefore, the Secretary proposes an income limitation
on a borrower who requests an economic hardship deferment based on income and debt-to-income ratio. The Secretary
believes the income cap in the proposed regulations_no more than four times the minimum wage or four times the poverty
line for a family of two_is reasonable. 

The public, at the regional meetings in September, and through its negotiators, did not agree on the definition of
``debt'' or the precise ratio to be used when comparing debt to income. In the Secretary's view, it would not be appropriate
to include all debts that a borrower owed in developing the debt-to-income ratio. In a related section of the HEA (section
437A(c)) that evaluates a borrower's debt-to-income ratio to determine if a borrower has a high risk of defaulting
on a loan, only the borrower's FFEL Program debts are considered. Therefore, the Secretary believes that for the purpose
of establishing the borrower's eligibility for an economic hardship deferment, a similar evaluation should be used.
The proposed regulations reflect the Secretary's belief that the calculation of ``debt'' for this purpose should
include only the monthly amount due on the borrower's non-defaulted education loans that were obtained through a
program administered by any agency of the Federal government. Given the ease with which borrowers can remove a default
status from an FFEL Program loan through a guaranty agency's loan rehabilitation program, a conscientious borrower
with a defaulted FFEL Program loan is not likely to be harmed by this restriction solely because of the defaulted loan.

As for the debt-to-income ratio to be used, the Secretary notes that the HEA has created a mandatory forbearance for
a borrower who has a Title IV debt-to-income ratio that equals or exceeds 20 percent. Since a deferment during which
the borrower's interest is paid by the federal government provides a much greater financial benefit to a borrower
than a forbearance, it would be logical to establish a similar standard for a borrower to meet to qualify for a deferment.
Therefore, in the Secretary's opinion, the 20 percent ratio is appropriate. 

The Secretary estimates that lenders collectively will need an additional 14,000 hours to process the statutorily
required economic hardship deferments for borrowers. 

The income and debt documentation required from borrowers (the borrower's most recent Federal income tax return
if one had been filed within six months prior to the date it is requested by the lender; evidence showing the amount of
the borrower's most recent monthly disposable income; and evidence showing the most recent monthly amount due on
the borrower's non-defaulted 
education loans (or eligible defaulted loans) that were obtained through a Federal program) is needed to obtain verifiable
data to accurately determine the borrower's eligibility to receive an economic hardship deferment. 



Section 682.211 Forbearance



Consistent with the rationale expressed earlier with regard to income-sensitive repayment schedules and economic
hardship deferments, the Secretary does not believe it would be helpful to the borrower or in the interests of the taxpayer
if a borrower who has the means to repay the loan does not do so. The Secretary proposes that, in order to qualify for a
mandatory general forbearance under  682.211(i)(2)_which permits a borrower to postpone making scheduled
loan payments_a borrower should be required to provide at least a copy of his or her most recent Federal income tax return
if one had been filed within six months prior to the date the forbearance is requested, and evidence showing the amount
of the borrower's most recent monthly disposable income. In conformance with section 428(b)(1)(V) of the HEA, this
requirement does not apply if the borrower is a medical or dental intern or resident, as described in  682.211(i)(1).


Based on comments received at the regional meetings and other information provided to the Secretary from other sources,
the Secretary has concluded that the public's views concerning the general applicability of the use of an administrative
forbearance to assist a borrower in avoiding default should be reflected in the proposed regulations. The Secretary
agrees that it would be in the best interests of borrowers and taxpayers to require lenders to grant administrative
forbearance to borrowers or endorsers under the exceptional conditions described in  682.211(j), such as
emergencies and national disasters, whereas the granting of the forbearances authorized under  682.211(f)
is best left to the judgement of the lender on a case-by-case basis. The proposed regulations would permit a lender
to grant forbearance under  682.211 for a period of up to 3 years if the effect of an income-sensitive repayment
schedule causes the extension of the maximum repayment term of the loan, and up to one year if the effect of a variable
interest rate on a fixed-amount or graduated repayment schedule similarly causes the extension of the maximum repayment
term. 

The Secretary estimates that lenders collectively will need an additional 15,000 hours to process mandatory forbearances
for borrowers. The income and debt documentation required from borrowers (the borrower's most recent Federal income
tax return if one had been filed within six months prior to the date it is requested by the lender; evidence showing the
amount of the borrower's most recent monthly disposable income; and evidence showing the most recent monthly amount
due on the borrower or endorser's Title IV loans) is needed to obtain verifiable data to accurately determine the borrower
or endorser's eligibility to receive a mandatory forbearance. 



Executive Order 12866



These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 

The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and
those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently, as
discussed in those sections of the preamble that relate to specific sections of the regulations. Burdens specifically
associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained elsewhere in this preamble
under the heading Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.

In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations,
the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs, and do not interfere
with state, local, and tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 

To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits
resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program.




Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 



The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. 

Certain reporting, recordkeeping, and compliance requirements are imposed on lenders by the regulations. These

requirements, however, would not have a significant impact because they would not impose excessive regulatory burdens
or require unnecessary federal supervision. 



Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 



Sections 682.209, 682.210, and 682.211 contain information collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) 

These regulations affect lenders that participate in the FFEL Program. The Department needs and uses the information
to properly carry out its responsibility to administer certain aspects of the HEA. 

Annual public reporting burden for this collection of information by approximately 7,500 lending institutions
participating in the FFEL Program is expected to increase by a total of 49,000 hours. The collection and reporting
of the information in  682.209(a) is expected to occur two million times per year, with each occurrence requiring
lender processing time of 0.01 hours, for a total increase of 20,000 hours. The collection and reporting of the information
in  682.210(s)(6) is expected to occur 1.4 million times per year, with each occurrence requiring lender processing
time of 0.01 hours, for a total increase of 14,000 hours. The collection and reporting of the information in  682.211
(i) and (j) is expected to occur 1.5 million times per year, with each occurrence requiring lender processing time
of 0.01 hours, for a total increase of 15,000 hours. 

Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
DC 20503; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok. 



Invitation To Comment 



Interested persons are invited to submit comments and recommendations regarding these proposed regulations. 

All comments submitted in response to these proposed regulations will be available for public inspection, during
and after the comment period, in ROB-3, room 4310, 7th and D Streets, SW., Washington, DC, between the hours of
8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week except federal holidays. 



Assessment of Educational Impact 



The Secretary particularly requests comments on whether the proposed regulations in this document would require
transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United
States.

The Secretary proposes to amend part 682 of title IV of the Code of Federal Regulations, to read as follows:



PART 682_FEDERAL FAMILY EDUCATION LOAN PROGRAM



1. The authority citation for part 682 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 20 U.S.C. 1071 to 1087-2, unless otherwise noted.




2. Section 682.209 has been amended by adding paragraphs (a)(6) (iii) through (viii) and revising paragraphs (a)(7)(ii)
and (h)(4)(ii) to read as follows:



 682.209

 Repayment of a loan.



(a) * * *

(6) * * *

(iii) Not more than six months prior to the date that the borrower's first payment is due, the lender shall offer a choice
of a fixed-amount, graduated, or income-sensitive repayment schedule to a new borrower who receives a Stafford or
SLS loan first disbursed on or after July 1, 1993. For purposes of this section, a ``new borrower'' is an individual
who has no outstanding principal or interest balance on an FFEL Program loan as of July 1, 1993 or on the date he or she
obtains a loan on or after July 1, 1993. This term also includes a borrower who obtains a Federal Consolidation Loan
on or after July 1, 1993 if the borrower has no other outstanding FFEL Program loan when the Consolidation Loan is made.
The lender shall also offer a choice of repayment schedules to any individual whose Consolidation loan application
is received by the lender on or after January 1, 1993. The Secretary encourages lenders to offer the choice of repayment
schedules to all other borrowers.

(iv) The repayment schedule must require that each payment equal at least the interest that accrues during the interval
between scheduled payments.

(v) The lender shall require the borrower to repay the loan under a fixed-amount repayment schedule described in paragraph
(a)(6)(vi) of this section if the borrower does not select, or does not qualify for, an income-sensitive or a graduated
repayment schedule.

(vi) Under a fixed-amount repayment schedule, the borrower is scheduled to pay the same amount for each installment
payment made during the repayment period, except that the borrower's final payment may be slightly more or less than
the other payments.

(vii) Under a graduated repayment schedule, the amount of the borrower's installment payment is scheduled to change
(usually by increasing) during the course of the repayment period. If a graduated repayment schedule is established,
it may not provide for any single installment that is more than three times greater than any other installment. An agreement
as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is not required if the schedule provides for less than the minimum
annual payment amount specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

(viii) (A) Under an income-sensitive repayment schedule, the amount of the borrower's installment payment is adjusted
annually, based on the borrower's expected monthly disposable income, as defined in  682.200(b), during the
course of the repayment period. The Secretary encourages lenders to develop income-sensitive repayment schedules
that do not result in any single installment that is more than three times greater than any other installment.

(B) The lender shall inform the borrower that the loan must be repaid within the time limits specified under paragraph
(a)(7) of this section.

(C) No earlier than 90 days prior to the due date of the borrower's initial installment payment and subsequent annual
payment adjustment under an income-sensitive repayment schedule, the lender shall request documentation from
the borrower sufficient for the lender to make a reasonable determination of what the borrower's payment amount should
be. The lender shall require the borrower to submit at least the following documentation:

(

1

) Evidence showing the amount of the borrower's most recent monthly disposable income from all sources, including,
if applicable, pay statements from employers and documentation of any income received by the borrower from other
parties.

(

2

) A copy of the borrower's Federal income tax return if the borrower filed a tax return within eight months prior to the
date the lender requested it.

(D) If the borrower fails to provide the documentation described in paragraph (a)(6)(viii)(C) of this section, the
lender shall require the borrower to repay the loan in accordance with either a fixed-amount or a graduated repayment
schedule.

(E) The agreement between the borrower and lender must specify that if, at any time, the borrower's monthly disposable
income for each of three consecutive months exceeds twice the income upon which the current installment amount is
calculated, the borrower must inform the lender of that fact within 30 days after receiving the income.

(F) Not later than 30 days after learning from the borrower or other sources that the borrower's monthly disposable
income has exceeded twice the amount upon which the current installment amount is calculated for each of three consecutive
months, the lender shall notify the borrower that, unless the borrower provides documentation showing that information
to be incorrect or, if it is correct, that the borrower's monthly disposable income has since decreased to the level
that the payment amount had been based on, the amount of the borrower's installment payment will be increased commensurately,
beginning with the second payment due after the date the lender notifies the borrower of the new payment amount.

(7) * * *

(ii) If the borrower receives an authorized deferment or is granted forbearance, as described in  682.210 or
 682.211 respectively, the periods of deferment or forbearance are excluded from determinations of the 5-,
10-, and 15-year periods, and from the 12-, 15-, 20-, 25-, and 30-year periods for repayment of a Consolidation loan
pursuant to  682.208(h).



* * * * *



(h) * * *

(4) * * *

(ii) Does not include the unpaid balance on any loan on which the borrower is in default, unless the borrower has made
satisfactory repayment arrangements with the holder to repay that loan.

3. Section 682.210 has been amended by adding a new paragraph (a)(11); by revising paragraph (c)(4); and adding a new
paragraph (s) to read as follows:



 682.210

 Deferment.



(a) * * *

(11) If two individuals are jointly liable for repayment of a PLUS loan or a Consolidation loan, the lender shall grant
a request for deferment only if both individuals meet the requirements of this section.



* * * * *



(c) * * *

(4) A borrower serving in a medical internship residency program, except for an internship in dentistry, is prohibited
from receiving or continuing deferment on a Stafford, SLS, or Consolidation loan under paragraph (c) of this section.

(s) 

Deferments for new borrowers on or after July 1, 1993.

(1) General.

 A new borrower who receives an FFEL Program loan first disbursed on or after July 1, 1993 is entitled to receive deferments
under paragraphs (s)(2) through (s)(6) of this section. For purposes of this section, a ``new borrower'' is an individual
who has no outstanding principal or interest balance on an FFEL Program loan as of July 1, 1993 or on the date he or she
obtains a loan on or after July 1, 1993. This term also includes a borrower who obtains a Federal Consolidation Loan
on or after July 1, 1993 if the borrower has no other outstanding FFEL Program loan when the Consolidation Loan was made.

(2) 

Student deferment.

 An eligible borrower is entitled to a deferment for half-time study in accordance with the rules prescribed in  682.210(c
