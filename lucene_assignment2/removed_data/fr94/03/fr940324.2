Sweaters Wholly or in Chief Weight of Man-Made Fiber From Hong Kong; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative
Review 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 International Trade Administration/Import Administration, Department of Commerce.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final results of antidumping duty administrative review. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On December 3, 1993, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its administrative review of
the antidumping duty order on sweaters wholly or in chief weight of man-made fiber from Hong Kong. The review covers
29 manufacturers/exporters and the period April 27, 1990 through August 31, 1991. 



We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on our preliminary results. We have analyzed the comments received,
and have changed the method in which the sample rate is calculated. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On September 24, 1990, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 39036) the antidumping duty order on sweaters wholly or in chief weight of man-made fiber (MMF sweaters) from
Hong Kong. On September 30, 1991, the petitioner, the National Knitwear & Sportswear Association (NKSA), requested
that we conduct an administrative review, in accordance with section 751(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the
Tariff Act) and 19 CFR 353.22(a). We published the notice of initiation of the antidumping duty administrative review
on October 18, 1991 (56 FR 52254), covering the period April 27, 1990 through August 31, 1991. On December 3, 1993 the
Department published the preliminary results in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 63913). The initiation notice named 31 companies. Of these 31 companies, we terminated the review of two companies,
which had requested review of their own shipments, but later withdrew those requests. (See ``Termination of Review
in Part'' section of the preliminary results notice.) Of the remaining 29 companies the following four companies
were selected to be analyzed, using sampling techniques: Apace Knitting Factory (Apace), Bond Manufacturing Co.,
Ltd. (Bond), Hayward Knitters (Hayward), and LaMagma, Ltd. (LaMagma). The other companies covered by this review
preliminarily received a rate which was the simple average of the margins of these four companies. 

Four exporters, Peninsula Knitters Ltd. (Peninsula), Fang Brothers Knitting Limited (Fang), Sun Hing Knitting
Factory Limited (Sun Hing) and Comitex Knitters Limited (Comitex), and the Hong Kong Woollen & Synthetic Knitting
Manufacturers' Association, (Peninsula et al.) submitted a joint case brief. Susan Bristol, Inc. (Bristol) an importer,
submitted a case brief. No party submitted a rebuttal brief. The Department has now completed this administrative
review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act. 



Scope of the Review 



Imports covered by this review are shipments of MMF sweaters from Hong Kong. MMF sweaters are defined as garments for
outerwear that are knitted or crocheted, in a variety of forms including jacket, vest, cardigan with button or zipper
front, or pullover, usually having ribbing around the neck, bottom, and cuffs on the sleeves (if any), encompassing
garments of various lengths, wholly or in chief weight of man-made fiber. The term ``in chief weight of man-made fiber''
includes sweaters where the man-made fiber material predominates by weight over each other single textile material.
This excludes sweaters 23 percent or more by weight of wool. It includes men's, women's, boys', or girls' sweaters,
as defined above, but does not include sweaters for infants 24 months of age or younger. It includes all sweaters as
defined above, regardless of the number of stitches per centimeter, provided that, with regard to sweaters having
more than nine stitches per two linear centimeters horizontally, it includes only those with a knit-on rib at the bottom.


Garments which extend below mid-thigh or cardigans that contain a sherpa lining or heavy-weight fiberfill lining,
including quilted linings, used to provide extra warmth to the wearer, are not considered sweaters and are excluded
from the scope of the order. Also specifically excluded from the scope are sweaters assembled in Guam that are produced
from knit-to-shape component parts knit in and imported from Hong Kong and entering under Harmonized Tariff Schedule
(HTS) item number 9902.61. 

The subject merchandise is currently classifiable under HTS item numbers 6110.30.30.10, 6110.30.30.15, 6110.30.30.20,
6110.30.30.25, 6103.23.00.70, 6103.29.10.40, 6103.29.20.62, 6104.23.00.40, 6104.29.10.60, 6104.29.20.60,
6110.30.10.10, 6110.30.10.20, 6110.30.20.10, and 6110.30.20.20. This merchandise may also enter under HTS item
numbers 6110.30.30.50 and 6110.30.30.55. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes
only. The written description remains dispositive.

Sampling Methodology 



We applied our sampling methodology in the following manner. First, each of the 18 companies included in the sample
pool was assigned points according to its percentage share of total export sales, by volume, to the United States.
One point was given for each 1/2 percent of U.S. sales. (Each company received a minimum of one point.) Each company
was represented in the sample pool in proportion to the number of points it received. For example, a company that comprised
25 percent of exports to the United States would receive 50 points and go ``into the hat'' 50 times. A company that comprised
one percent of total exports would receive two points and go ``into the hat'' twice. In this way, the company with a greater
volume of exports had a greater chance of being selected than a company with a smaller volume of exports. There was a
total of 203 points in the pool. We then selected random numbers between one and 203 corresponding to the points until
four separate companies were selected. (In all, we selected seven points, four of which corresponded to the same company.)


For the preliminary results, the companies in the sample pool that were not selected to be analyzed received a rate
which was the simple average of the margins of the four selected companies. For the final results we have determined
that it is more appropriate to weight the sample by the points drawn from the pool. Since each point represents a percentage
of the total sales volume, each time we randomly selected a point we were, in effect, selecting a segment of the sales
volume as representative of the entire pool. Each volume segment had an equal chance for selection, and each segment
is equally representative of the pool. Therefore, each segment should be given equal weight in calculating the sample
pool rate. Four points assigned to Hayward were drawn; therefore, Hayward's rate of 5.86 percent has entered the sample
rate calculation four times. Points assigned to Apace, Bond and LaMagma were drawn only once; therefore, their rates
of 115.15 percent, 5.86 percent, and zero percent have each entered the sample rate once. The sample rate for these
final results is 20.64 percent. 



Analysis of the Comments Received 



Comment 1 



Peninsula et al. contend that the Department does not have legal authority to utilize sampling to select respondents
in administrative reviews. Peninsula et al. argue that the provision in the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 dealing with
sampling was not intended to permit the Department to use sampling in selection of respondents, but in the calculation
of foreign market value (FMV). They argue that, while the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 expanded the Department's authority
with regard to sampling, it did not give the Department the authority to sample respondents. 

Peninsula et al. argue that the statute and legislative history indicate that Congress intended to extend the authority
for sampling to the calculation of U.S. price and other variables within the databases of a particular respondent,
rather than to a group of respondents. They claim that when the Department restricts its review to a sample of the respondents
named by the domestic industry, those respondents not selected for active participation are 

ipso facto

 excluded from the administrative process, and their fate is entirely in the control of their competitors. Peninsula
et al. further contend that because the consequences of sampling are so dire, it should not be assumed, in the absence
of an explicit statutory provision, that Congress intended that the Department investigate anything less than the
entire universe of named parties in an administrative review. 

Peninsula et al. further contend that there is no judicial precedent to support the Department's sampling authority.
They argue that in the one case where the Court of International Trade (CIT) considered the Department's exercise
of sampling for respondent selection in an administrative review, 

Floral Trade Council 

v. 

United States, 

775 F. Supp. 1492, 15 CIT 497 (1991), the Court assumed that the Department had the authority to use representative
samples, and that the argument was therefore untested. 



Department's Position: 

We disagree. Section 777A of the Tariff Act provides the Department with broad authority to apply sampling techniques
in administrative reviews (19 U.S.C. 1677f-1). The legislative history of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 indicates
that this provision grants the Department the discretion to apply sampling to any aspect of an antidumping review:

 


Section 109 [of H.R. 4784] authorizes sampling and averaging techniques utilized by the administering authority
in determining foreign market value under the present antidumping law also to be used in determining United States
price in dumping investigations and 

in all aspects of the annual review of outstanding countervailing and antidumping duty orders. 

(emphasis added) (H.R. Rep. No. 98-725, 98th Cong., 2nd. Sess., Reprinted in 1984 U.S. AAN., 5127, 5135.)




The only criteria for using the sampling provision of section 777A are that a significant volume of sales be involved
or a significant number of adjustments to prices be required, and that such samples shall be representative of the
transactions under review. (See 19 U.S.C. 1677f-1.) Those criteria were met in this case. (See comment 4.) 

We have employed sampling techniques to select respondents to be analyzed in past administrative reviews. See, 

e.g., 

Certain Fresh Cut Flowers From Colombia; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, Partial
Termination of Administrative Review and Intent To Revoke Order (In Part) (58 FR 65329, December 14, 1993) Fresh and
Chilled Atlantic Salmon from Norway; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, (58 FR 17380,
April 2, 1993), and Certain Fresh Cut Flowers from Colombia: Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review
(55 FR 20491, 20495-96, May 17, 1990).

The CIT has reviewed and upheld the Department's sampling methodology in the context of an antidumping duty review.
(See 

Floral Trade Council 

v. 

United States

, 775 F. Supp. 1492 (1991) (Floral Trade II).) In that case, the Court acknowledged Commerce's authority, which was
unchallenged, to use sampling techniques (which in this case involved sampling among manufacturers/exporters).
The decisions in Floral Trade II and numerous other cases support the proposition that the only limitations on Commerce's
authority to use sampling techniques are the criteria in Section 777A, noted above. (See also 

Asociacion Colombiana de Exportadores 

v. 

United States

, 704 F. Supp. 1114 (CIT 1989); 

Floral Trade Council 

v. 

United States

, 704 F. Supp. 233 (CIT 1988) (Floral Trade I).) 



Comment 2 



Peninsula et al. argue that, assuming the Department does have the authority to sample, the Department should not
have done so in this review, as the statute mandates that the Department must use a generally accepted statistical
method to conduct sampling. Peninsula et al. assert that, as reflected in the December 16, 1991 letter and December
13, 1991 sampling memorandum that the Department issued, the decision to sample was based simply on the total number
of respondents requested by petitioners for the three concurrent MMF Sweater reviews (Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Korea),
without regard to whether the total number of respondents in each individual country was amenable to sampling under
generally recognized principles of statistical theory. 

Peninsula et al. contend that there is no evidence on the record which demonstrates that the Department made any effort
to decide how large a sample was necessary to reduce the sampling error to an acceptable level. They argue that statistical
theory does not permit sampling to be undertaken in all instances where there is a multitude of objects to be studied,
and point out that required sample size should be directly proportional to the population variance. They argue that
there is no analysis on the record which demonstrates that the Department considered how many firms, from the sample
pool of 18, needed to be investigated in order to bring the sampling error to an acceptable level, and that Peninsula
and Fang noted this in their December 23, 1991 letter to the Department. 



Department's Position:

 As in similar cases in the past, the Department's decision to sample was based on the large number of respondents in
the three concurrent MMF sweater reviews, and the resource constraints that existed at the time these reviews were
initiated. We have employed sampling in the past based on a large sales volume and the resulting burden that analyzing
all sales would place upon us. In Certain Fresh Cut Flowers From Colombia; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty
Administrative Review, Partial Termination of Administrative Review and Intent To Revoke Order (In Part) (58 FR
65329, December 14, 1993), we noted the large number of firms and transactions under review, and in Antifriction Bearings
(Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany; Preliminary Results
of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Partial Termination of Administrative Reviews (56 FR 11200, March
15, 1991) we noted the large number of transactions and the resulting administrative burden involved in calculating
individual margins for all of these transactions. Furthermore, the CIT has upheld the use of sampling based on the
cumulative burden resulting from simultaneous cases. (See, e.g., Floral Trade I.) In the present case, we initiated
reviews on 128 firms from Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, and, due to the significant sales volume, we sampled firms.
(We later eliminated from the sample pools companies which did not respond to our sampling questionnaire, had no shipments,
or could not be located.) 

We also disagree with Peninsula et al. regarding the information we had concerning the firms in the sample, at the time
we made the decision to sample. We received from the Hong Kong government a list of quota holders and their allocated
export quantities on November 11, 1994, more than a month before our decision to sample. Based on that information,
we were able to assess the approximate volume of the Hong Kong MMF sweater manufacturers/exporters before making
our decision to sample in the three cases. The Hong Kong sample constituted 22 percent of the firms in the sample pool,
and captured approximately 60 percent of the sales volume. We therefore concluded that the sample was adequate. 



Comment 3 



Peninsula et al. argue that sampling was inappropriate because the sample pool was too small. They cite the December
23, 1991 letter from NKSA to the Department, in which NKSA pointed out that the Department had not sampled respondent
companies in other administrative reviews that had involved a greater number of companies. They also cite a 1991 submission
from Peninsula and Fang, in which Peninsula and Fang argued that the 17 companies which had, at that time, responded
to the preliminary questionnaire, accounted for only 204,742 dozen sweaters worth $19 million, and that, in reviews
of other antidumping duty orders, the Department had reviewed transactions of single respondents with much greater
values and volumes. 

Peninsula et al. argue that even the results of the review demonstrate that the pool was too small, noting that the presence
of a single BIA respondent drove the sample rate from 5.86 to 31.72 percent. They point out that in Fresh Cut Flowers
from Colombia: Preliminary Results of Antidumping Administrative Review, 58 FR 65329 (December 14, 1993), a BIA
margin of 72.35 percent was applied to two firms and was included in the sample pool margin, but that the effect of the
inclusion of these firms was a margin of 5.71 percent. They also argue that the Department did not seem to verify that
the four companies which claimed no shipments did not export to the United States during the period of review. 



Department's Position:

 We disagree with Peninsula et al. that the size of the sample was too small to be appropriate. As mentioned above, our
sample captured approximately twenty-two percent of firms and sixty percent of all sales. While we have at times been
able to review companies with greater value and volume, given that we simultaneously initiated reviews on 128 firms
from three countries, and that there were scarce resources available to us at the time, the decision to sample was justified.
In Hong Kong alone, the sample pool was 18 firms, a greater number than in most antidumping reviews. Furthermore, given
the differences in selling practices generally found among companies, and the necessity of conducting a separate
analysis of each company selected, it is less of an administrative burden to analyze a large number of sales from a few
companies, than a smaller number of sales spread among a greater number of companies. 

Regarding the companies which claimed no shipments, we did verify their claims with the U.S. Customs Department.
(See e-mail from the U.S. Department of Commerce to U.S. Customs, dated July 2, 1992.)

Comment 4 



Peninsula et al. argue that the Department's methodology was erroneous because the sample was not representative.
They point out that Peninsula and Fang, in a December 23, 1991 letter to the Department, argued that the pool of respondents
was not homogeneous, and displayed clear biases related to company size. Peninsula et al. state that the Department
presumed that it was dealing with a homogenous universe of potential respondents. They present a chart which shows
quantity, value, and average per unit value for each of the firms in the pool, which, they argue, shows that there is
an inverse correlation between volume of sales and unit price. They claim that the selected firms were predominantly
large-size, low-unit-value firms, and the results for these big firms are being applied to the smaller, higher-unit-value
firms. Peninsula et al. cite the Department's January 6, 1992 memorandum, in which we noted that the Korean respondents
were theoretically correct in their argument that the sampling methodology was biased towards small firms, although
the potential bias was minimal. 



Department's Position:

 Because of the way our sample was structured, firms with the largest volumes were more likely to be chosen. We assigned
one point for every 0.5 percent of total sales volume within the sample, then randomly drew numbers, corresponding
to the assigned points. Firms with less than 0.5 percent of total sales volume were assigned one point. As larger firms
had more points assigned to them, they were more likely to be chosen. However, the theoretical statistical bias was
actually in favor of the selection of the smallest firms, because there were five firms with less than 0.5 percent of
sales volume, all of whom received one point. None of these low volume firms were selected for the sample, so this theoretical
bias had no practical effect. 

We chose our sampling methodology because it was both representative and efficient. When we issued our proposed sampling
methodology and invited interested parties to comment thereon, we asked that the parties focus on methodology rather
than the decision to sample. In their submissions, NKSA, as well as Fang and Peninsula, objected to sampling, but did
not suggest an alternative to the sampling methodology we proposed. Where, as here, the sampling methodology is legally
adequate and the results have not been shown to be unrepresentative, the CIT has upheld the sampling of representative
firms. In 

Asociacion Colombiana de Exportadores de Flores 

v. 

U.S., 

the CIT upheld the Department's sampling of respondent firms in a less than fair value investigation, noting that
``the sampling methodology was legally adequate and the results of the sampling have not been shown to be unrepresentative.''
(704 F. Supp. 1114, 1122 (1989).) 

We also disagree that sales price should be used as the basis of stratification, as Peninsula et al. now suggest. Whether
a company's price to the United States is high or low is not in itself indicative of the existence or level of dumping.
Rather, dumping is measured by a comparison of U.S. prices to the home market or third country prices, or to constructed
value. A company that sells at higher prices than a second company could have a higher margin of dumping, depending
on the FMVs of the two companies. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to group respondents on the basis of price, or
a surrogate for price, as Peninsula et al. suggest. 



Comment 5 



Peninsula et al. argue that given the technical deficiencies in the sampling protocol, the Department should have
allowed respondents who were not selected to participate voluntarily, without such firms' results going into the
sample-rate calculation. They argue that Peninsula and Fang, in their December 23, 1991 letter, suggested that respondents
not selected as questionnaire recipients be able to participate voluntarily without the rates for such firms being
incorporated in the sample rate. 



Department's Position:

 We disagree. Every MMF sweater manufacturer/exporter in Hong Kong had ample opportunity to request that it be reviewed
during the anniversary month of the antidumping duty order, should it have wanted its own rate. Peninsula and Fang,
as well as other companies in the sample pool, chose not to request a review of their sales.

Comment 6 


Peninsula et al. argue that the best information available (BIA) outlying rate of 115.15 percent should have been
excluded from the sample rate calculation. Rather, the fourteen firms in the sample pool should be subject to a sample
rate of 3.91 percent. Bristol similarly argues that the companies in the sample pool were unfairly punished by the
inclusion of Apace, the firm which received the 115.15 percent rate. Bristol contends that the fourteen companies
in the sample pool indicated a willingness to cooperate with the Department by submitting sampling questionnaire
responses. Bristol further argues that had Apace not responded to the sampling questionnaire, it would have been
assigned the 115.15 percent BIA rate, but would not have been included in the sample pool, thereby punishing itself,
but not the others in the pool. 



Department's Position: 

We disagree with Peninsula et al. and Bristol regarding the appropriateness and fairness of including Apace in the
sample pool. Removal of Apace from the sample pool would have jeopardized the integrity of the sample, as the sample
margin would be skewed towards firms with low margins. We note that the sample rate of the four firms includes not one,
but three firms with BIA rates. It is as reasonable for us to assume that Apace's rate of 115.15 percent represents one-seventh
of the volume of sampled firms as it is to assume that LaMagma's zero percent rate represents one-seventh of that volume.


Bristol is correct in its assertion that had Apace not responded to the sampling questionnaire, it would have received
an uncooperative BIA rate of 115.15 percent, and would have not been included in the sample pool. However, once the
sample universe is defined, and the sample selected, we cannot then discard the results of the sample for any particular
selected company. There is no reason to believe that Apace's failure to respond to the antidumping questionnaire
was not representative of other companies that answered the sampling questionnaire. 



Final Results of Review 



As a result of our review, we determine that the following margins exist: 



 


Parties to the proceeding may request disclosure within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice. 

The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
Individual differences between U.S. price and FMV may vary from the percentages stated above. The Department will
issue appraisement instructions on each exporter directly to the Customs Service.

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of this notice of final results
of review for all shipments of MMF sweaters from Hong Kong entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on
or after the publication date, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rates for the
reviewed companies will be those established in the final results of this administrative review; (2) for previously
investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published
for the LTFV investigation; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review or the LTFV investigation, but the
manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established in the LTFV investigation for the manufacturer
of the merchandise; and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will be the ``all other''
rate established in the final notice of LTFV investigation of this case (see 55 FR 30733), in accordance with the Court
of International Trade's decisions in 

Floral Trade Council 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-79, and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-83. These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final
results of the next administrative review. 

This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 



Notification to Interested Parties 



This notice also serves as a final reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibility
concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d).
Timely written notification of return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order
is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation. 

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

 Notice of initiation of changed circumstances antidumping duty administrative review, consideration of revocation
of order, preliminary results of changed circumstances antidumping duty administrative review, and intent to revoke
order.

 




</ACTION>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 



On August 28, 1991, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 42593) an antidumping duty order on personal word processors (PWPs) from Japan (the order). On August 20, 1992
(57 FR 37770), the Department published an amended order. On February 15, 1994, Smith Corona Corporation (Smith Corona),
the petitioner in the underlying less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation, submitted a request for a changed
circumstances administrative review and revocation of the order based on the represented fact that the order no longer
is of interest to the domestic interested parties. For the same reasons, in its February 15, 1994 request, Smith Corona
withdrew its petition requesting an investigation to determine whether the order was being circumvented pursuant
to section 781(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Smith Corona made the withdrawal of that petition
and the revocation contingent upon termination of the suspended antidumping investigation on portable electric
typewriters from 
Singapore (A-559-806). 


Scope of Review 



The scope of the order covers PWPs from Japan as defined in the Department's antidumping duty order on personal word
processors from Japan (56 FR 42593, August 28, 1991), as amended (57 FR 37770, August 20, 1992). PWPs are currently
classifiable under item number 8469.10.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) of the United States. HTS item
numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive as to the
scope of the product coverage. 



Initiation of Changed Circumstances Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, Consideration of Revocation of Order,

Preliminary Results of Changed Circumstances Administrative Review, and Intent To Revoke Order 



Pursuant to section 751(c) of the Act, the Department may revoke an antidumping duty order if the Department determines,
based on a review under section 751(b)(1) of the Act, that changed circumstances exist sufficient to warrant revocation.
Section 751(b)(1) of the Act requires a changed circumstances review to be conducted upon receipt of a request containing
sufficient information concerning changed circumstances. 

Section 353.25(d)(2) of the Department's regulations permits the Department to conduct an administrative review
under  353.22(f) based upon an affirmative statement of no interest from the petitioner in the proceeding.
Section 353.25(d)(1)(i) further provides that if the Department determines that the order under review is no longer
of interest to domestic interested parties, the Department may revoke the antidumping duty order. In addition, in
the event the Department concludes that expedited action is warranted,  353.22(f)(4) of the regulations permits
the Department to combine the notices of initiation and preliminary results.

Therefore, in accordance with sections 751(b)(1) and (c) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.25(d) and 353.22(f), based on an
affirmative statement of no interest in the proceeding by Smith Corona, the Department is initiating this changed
circumstances administrative review. Further, based upon the facts of this case and the representations made by
Smith Corona that other U.S. producers of this merchandise (Canon Business Machines and Brother Industries (USA),
Inc.) consent to revocation of the order, we have determined that expedited action is warranted, and we have preliminarily
determined that the order no longer is of interest to domestic interested parties. Because the Department concludes
that expedited action is warranted, the Department is combining these notices of initiation and preliminary results.
The Department determines that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the requirement for revocation based on
the changed circumstance that the order no longer is of interest to domestic interested parties has been met. Therefore,
we are hereby notifying the public of our intent to revoke the antidumping duty order on personal word processors from
Japan. We hereby notify the public that if this revocation becomes final we will also publish notice of the termination
of the ongoing anticircumvention inquiry of the order on PWPs from Japan. 

If these preliminary results are made final, they will apply to all shipments of the merchandise entered, or withdrawn
from warehouse, for consumption on or after August 1, 1993 (the day after the last administrative review period for
which automatic liquidation instructions were sent to the U.S. Customs Service). In that event, we intend to instruct
the U.S. Customs Service to liquidate all entries of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,
for consumption on or after 
August 1, 1993, without regard to antidumping duties. We will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to refund with interest
any estimated antidumping duties collected with respect to those entries. 

The current requirement for a cash deposit of estimated antidumping duties will continue until publication of the
final results of this changed circumstances review. 


Public Comment 



Any interested party may request a hearing within 10 days from the date of publication of this notice. Any hearing,
if requested, will be held no later than 28 days after the date of publication of this notice, or the first workday thereafter.
Case briefs and/or written comments from interested parties may be submitted not later than 14 days after the date
of publication of this notice. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttals to written comments, limited to the issues raised in
those comments, may be filed not later than 21 days after the date of publication of this notice. All written comments
shall be submitted in accordance with 19 CFR 353.31 and shall be served on all interested parties on the Department's
service list. Persons interested in attending the hearing should contact the Department for the date and time of the
hearing. The Department will publish the final results of this changed circumstances review, including the results
of its analysis of issues raised in any written comments. 

This initiation, preliminary results of review, intent to revoke, and this notice are in accordance with   751(b)(1)
and (c) of the Act and   353.22(f) and 353.25(d)(1993) of the Department's regulations.

 Notice of initiation of changed circumstances antidumping duty administrative review; consideration of revocation
of order; preliminary results of changed circumstances antidumping duty administrative review; and intent to revoke

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background: 



On May 9, 1980, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (53 FR 40926) an antidumping duty order on Portable Electric Typewriters (PETs) from Japan (the order). On February
15, 1994, Smith Corona Corporation (Smith Corona), the petitioner in the underlying less-than-fair-value (LTFV)
investigation, submitted a request for a changed circumstances administrative review and revocation of the order
based on the represented fact that the order no longer is of interest to the domestic interested parties. Smith Corona
submitted this request contingent upon termination of the suspended antidumping investigation on portable electric
typewriters from Singapore (A-559-806). 



Scope of Review 



The scope of the order covers PETs, automatic PETs (PATs), PETs incorporating a calculating mechanism, and certain
personal word processors (PWPs). On August 7, 1990, in Preliminary Scope Ruling; Portable Electric Typewriters
from Japan (55 FR 32107), the Department clarified the scope of the order, ruling that ``* * * certain
later-developed PETS, including so-called `personal word processors', are presumptively of the same class or kind
as PETs within the scope of the order * * *.'' The Department determined that to be of the same class or
kind as a PET, a typewriter must meet the following seven physical criteria: (1) Be easily portable, with a handle and/or
carrying case, or similar mechanism to facilitate portability; (2) be electric, regardless of source of power; (3)
be comprised of a single, integrated unit; (4) have a keyboard embedded in the chassis or frame of the machine; (5) have
a built-in printer; (6) have a platen (roller) to accommodate paper; and (7) only accommodate its own dedicated or
captive software. The final scope ruling was published on November 13, 1990 (55 FR 47358). 

PETs, PATs, and certain PWPs are currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) item numbers 8469.10.00,
8469.21.00, and 8469.29.00. The HTS subheadings are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. Our written
description of the scope of this order is dispositive. 

This changed circumstance administrative review covers all manufacturers/exporters of PETs and PATs, and PETs
incorporating a calculating mechanism manufactured in Japan and all manufacturers/exporters of those PWPs falling
within the scope of the PETs order that are manufactured in Japan. 




Initiation of Changed Circumstances Antidumping Duty Administrative Review; Consideration of Revocation of Order;
Preliminary Results of Changed Circumstances Administrative Review; and Intent To Revoke Order



Pursuant to section 751(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), the Department may revoke an antidumping
duty order if the Department determines, based on a review under section 751(b)(1) of the Act, that changed circumstances
exist sufficient to warrant revocation. Section 751(b)(1) of the Act requires a changed circumstances administrative
review to be conducted upon receipt of a request containing sufficient information concerning changed circumstances.

Section 353.25(d)(2) of the Department's regulations permits the Department to conduct an administrative review
under  353.22(f) based upon an affirmative statement of no interest from the petitioner in the proceeding.
Section 353.25(d)(1)(i) further provides that, if the Department determines that the order under review is no longer
of interest to domestic interested parties, the Department may revoke the antidumping duty order. In addition, in
the event the Department concludes that expedited action is warranted,  353.22(f)(4) of the regulations permits
the Department to combine the notices of initiation and preliminary results. 

Therefore, in accordance with sections 751 (b)(1) and (c) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.25(d) and 353.22(f), based on an
affirmative statement of no interest in the proceeding by Smith Corona, the Department is initiating this changed
circumstances administrative review. Further, based upon the facts of this case and on the representations made
by Smith Corona that other U.S. producers and potential producers of this merchandise (Nakajima All Manufacturing
Limited, Canon Business Machines, and Brother Industries (USA), Inc.) consent to revocation of the order, we have
determined that expedited action is warranted, and we have preliminarily determined that the order no longer is of
interest to domestic interested parties. Because the Department concludes that expedited action is warranted,
the Department is combining these notices of initiation and preliminary results.

The Department determines that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the requirement for revocation based on
the changed circumstance that the order no longer is of interest to domestic interested parties has been met. Therefore,
we are hereby notifying the public of our intent to revoke the antidumping duty order on portable electric typewriters
from Japan. 

In the event this revocation is made final, the Department will terminate the administrative reviews covering the
following periods: May 1, 1990 through April 30, 1991 (initiated on June 18, 1991 (56 FR 27943)); May 1, 1991 through
April 30, 1992 (initiated on June 18, 1992 (57 FR 27212)); and May 1, 1992 through April 30, 1993 (initiated on June 25,
1993 (58 FR 34414)). 

In addition, in the event that this revocation is made final, the following will take place. For all companies for which
an administrative review has been requested but not completed, the effective date of revocation will be May 1, 1990.
May 1, 1990 is the first day after the most recent period for which an administrative review has been completed for all
of these companies. For all other companies subject to this antidumping duty order, the effective date of revocation
will be May 1, 1993. May 1, 1993, is the first day for which automatic liquidation instructions have not been issued
for these other companies.

If final revocation occurs, we intend to instruct the U.S. Customs Service to liquidate all entries of subject merchandise
in accordance with the above effective dates of revocation. We will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to refund with
interest any estimated antidumping duties collected with respect to entries made on or after May 1, 1990, for which
a review has been requested but not completed, and we will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to refund with interest
any estimated antidumping duties collected with respect to all entries made on or after 
May 1, 1993. 
The current requirement for a cash deposit of estimated antidumping duties will continue until publication of the
final results of this changed circumstances review. 


Public Comment 


Any interested party may request a hearing within 10 days of the date of publication of this notice. Any hearing, if
requested, will be held no later than 28 days after the date of publication of this notice, or the first workday thereafter.
Case briefs and/or written comments from interested parties may be submitted not later than 14 days after the date
of publication of this notice. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttals to written comments, limited to the issues raised in
those comments, may be filed not later than 21 days after the date of publication of this notice. All written comments

Department for the date and time of the hearing. The Department will publish the final results of this changed circumstances
review including the results of its analysis of issues raised in any written comments. 

This initiation, preliminary results of review, intent to revoke, and notice are in accordance with sections 751(b)(1)
and (c) of the Act and   353.22(f) and 353.25(d) of the Department's regulations.

Commissioner of Customs,


Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229.




Dear Commissioner: This directive amends, but does not cancel, the directive issued to you on April 3, 1987, by the

interagency policies related to the provision of services to infants, toddlers, and preschoolers with disabilities;
(2) develop and implement joint policy interpretations on issues related to infants, toddlers, and preschoolers
that cut across Federal agencies, including modifications of regulations to eliminate barriers to interagency
programs and activities; and (3) coordinate the provision of technical assistance and dissemination of best practice
information. The FICC is chaired by the Assistant Secretary for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services.


At this meeting the FICC plans to: (1) update the membership on the IDEA reauthorization process; and (2) discuss the
congressional testimony presented around individuals with disabilities and health care reform.
The meeting of the FICC is open to the public. Written public comment will be accepted at the conclusion of the meeting.

Arkla Energy Resources Company, et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings 


March 15, 1994.


Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 


1. Arkla Energy Resources Co.


[Docket No. CP94-275-000]


Take notice that on March 10, 1994, Arkla Energy Resources Company (AER), P.O. Box 21734, Shreveport, Louisiana 71151,
filed in Docket No. CP94-275-000 a request pursuant to   157.205 and 157.216 of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.216) for authorization to abandon sales tap facilities
in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas, 
under AER's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-384-000, 

et al

., pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 
AER proposes to abandon in place 45 rural domestic sales taps located on AER's Line S in Bossier, Caddo, and Webster
Parishes, Louisiana; Columbia County, Arkansas, and Harrison County, Texas. It is stated that the taps were installed
to serve customers of Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company (ALG). It is further stated that no customers are located at these
taps and that they have been inactive for years. It is asserted that ALG has provided written consent to the abandonment.



Comment date

: April 29, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 



2. Northwest Pipeline Corp.


[Docket No. CP94-282-000]



Take notice that on March 11, 1994, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest), 295 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City,
Utah 84108, filed in Docket No. CP94-282-000 a request pursuant to   157.205 and 157.211 of
the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.211) for authorization to construct
and operate facilities in Klickitat County, Washington required to implement a firm transportation service for
Development Associates, Inc. (DA), under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-433-000,
pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 

Northwest proposes to construct and operate approximately 5.3 miles of pipeline to partially loop and extend its
existing Hood River Lateral in Klickitat County, Washington and to construct and operate a new meter station, to be
named the KEP Meter Station. Northwest states that the proposed facilities would be used to provide approximately
11,000 million Btu per day of firm transportation service to the planned Klickitat Energy Partners (KEP), cogeneration
facility. Northwest states that the looping and other facility modification are required because the capacity of
the existing Hood River Lateral is fully committed to deliver up to 5,909 million Btu per day at two existing meter stations
for the account of Northwest Natural Gas Company under existing blanket agreements. It is indicated that KEP was formed
to develop, finance, construct and own the new KEP cogeneration facility. 

It is indicated that KEP's planned cogeneration plant would have 53.5 megawatts of generating capacity and would
consist of a natural gas-fired combustion turbine, a heat recovery steam generator and three steam turbines. It is
also stated that KEP has contracted to sell up to 49.5 average megawatts of power generated at its facility to the Bonneville
Power Administration under a 20-year contract and that process steam would be sold to a lumber company located at the
proposed plant site. 

Northwest states that DA has agreed with KEP to secure firm transportation service from Northwest to the plant site
beginning when the plant commences operations, scheduled for August 1995 and for plant start-up prior to that time.
It is indicated that Northwest and DA have modified existing transportation arrangements under Northwest's Rate
Schedule TF-1 to provide the requested service.

Northwest estimates a construction cost of $3,118,100, which would be installed and paid for pursuant to a facilities
agreement with DA and the facilities reimbursement provisions of Northwest's tariff. Northwest estimates the net
present value of the future revenues projected to be generated as a result of the proposed facilities of $4.6 million
which would exceed the incremental cost of service of approximately $2.9 million. 

Northwest states that no significant impact on its system peak day deliveries is projected to result from the installation
of the proposed facilities. It is indicated that, because DA elected to extend its existing firm transportation agreements
with Northwest, the existing firm contract delivery obligations would remain the same. 



Comment date

: April 29, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 



3. Arkla Energy Resources Co.


[Docket No. CP94-278-000]



Take notice that on March 10, 1994, Arkla Energy Resources Company (AER), 1600 Smith Street, Houston, Texas 77002,
filed in Docket No. CP94-278-000 a request pursuant to  157.205 of the Commission's Regulations
under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) for authorization to abandon and relocate certain facilities in Oklahoma
and Louisiana, under AER's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-384-000 and CP82-384-001
pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 

Specifically, AER proposes to (1) abandon in place 8 miles of 6-inch Line 634-2 and eight domestic delivery taps
in Hughes County, Oklahoma; and (2) abandon in place 1.9 miles of 4-inch Line FM-27 and three domestic delivery
taps and relocate one rural industrial tap, all in Claiborne Parish, Louisiana. AER states that it proposes to cut,
cap and fill the abandoned pipelines with water and that it would remove all above ground facilities. 

AER states that the pipelines were used to provide service to 11 domestic and one industrial customer of Arkansas Louisiana
Gas Company (ALG). AER asserts that nine domestic customers have or would convert to alternate fuels and have given
AER written releases. AER further asserts that ALG would construct 1800 feet of plastic pipeline from its existing
Gulftown Rural Extension to serve the remaining two domestic customers. AER would continue service to ALG's industrial
customer by relocating the meter and ALG would construct a distribution line to the industrial customer, it is stated.


AER maintains that it has provided notice of the proposed abandonments to the Oklahoma Corporate Commission and the
Louisiana Public Service Commission. 



Comment date

: April 29, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 



Standard Paragraphs



G. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission,

<DOCTITLE>Texas Gas Transmission Corporation, et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings </DOCTITLE>


March 9, 1994.



Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 



1. Texas Gas Transmission Corporation



[Docket No. CP94-265-000]



Take notice that on March 4, 1994, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas Gas), P.O. Box 1160, Owensboro, Kentucky
42302, filed in Docket No. CP94-265-000 an application pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act
for authorization to increase the certificated horsepower of its Haughton Compressor Station located in Bossier
Parish, Louisiana, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public
inspection. 

Texas Gas states that the compressor unit installed at Haughton has a full nameplate capability of 2,250 horsepower,
but has been programmed to a 2,000 horsepower capability to meet the station requirements existing at the time of its
installation. Texas Gas states further that because its firm shippers have requested increased volumes, it is now
necessary to uprate the compressor to its 2,250 horsepower maximum capability. 

It is stated that because the uprating can be accomplished by simply rewriting the control software, there is no cost
associated with the alteration. It is further stated that the proposed uprating would increase the capacity available
in the winter on Texas Gas' North Louisiana system by approximately 5.3 Mmcf per day, but would not increase the summer
ambient capability of the Haughton compressor. Thus, it is said, there would be no increase in Texas Gas' annual available
capacity along this system. 



Comment date: 

March 30, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 



2. Columbia Gas Transmission Corp.


[Docket No. CP94-269-000]

Charleston, West Virginia 25314-1599, filed in Docket No. CP94-269-000, a request pursuant to
 157.205 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) for authorization to construct
and operate an additional point of delivery for interruptible transportation service to National Gas and Oil Corporation
(NGO) in Perry County, Ohio, under the authorization issued in Docket No. CP83-76-000 pursuant to section
7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public
inspection. 

Columbia states that it will provide the interruptible transportation service under its blanket certificate in
Docket No. CP86-240-000 under existing authorized rate schedules and within certificated entitlements.
Columbia estimates that the quantities of gas to be delivered at the new delivery point will be 20,000 Dth per day and
7,300,000 Dth annually. It is estimated that the cost to establish this delivery point will be approximately $215,739.
Columbia states that it has agreed to contribute $125,000 toward the cost of upgrading the interconnecting facilities.
It is stated that NGO has agreed to reimburse Columbia for the remaining $90,739, plus any gross-up for tax purposes.


Columbia proposes to upgrade an existing receipt meter to a bidirectional facility capable of delivering and receiving
up to 20,000 Dth/d. It is stated that interconnecting facilities by Columbia consist of an 8-inch tap, electronic
measurement, flow control, installation of a filter separator and less than 20 feet of pipeline within the existing
right-of-way. Columbia states that it has obtained the necessary environmental clearances from the Ohio State Historical
Preservation Office and the United States Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Service for its proposed construction.

<DOCTITLE>Transwestern Pipeline Co., Notice of Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>



March 18, 1994.



Take notice that on March 16, 1994, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern), tendered for filing as part of
its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets, with a proposed effective date of April
1, 1994:




9th Revised Sheet No. 87

8th Revised Sheet No. 88

17th Revised Sheet No. 89

6th Revised Sheet No. 89A





On June 9, 1993, as amended July 16, 1993, Transwestern filed tariff sheets in which it sought to modify its take-or-pay,
buy-out and buy-down mechanism (``Transition Cost Recovery'' or ``TCR'' mechanism) in order to recover certain
take-or-pay, buy-out, buy-down, and contract reformation costs. On July 30, 1993, the Commission accepted and suspended
the filings, subject to conditions. On August 30, 1993, in Docket Nos. RP93-56-002, RP93-86-002,
RP93-139-002, the California Public Utilities Commission and Southern California Gas Company filed
a joint request for rehearing of the July 30 order requesting that the Commission remove the litigation exception
provision from Transwestern's tariff prospectively. In its order on rehearing on March 1, 1994, the Commission found
that the litigation exception language should not apply to future filings and ordered it removed. Transwestern states
that the purpose of this filing is to file tariff sheets to comply with such order.

Transwestern also states that in addition to changes necessitated by removing litigation exception language, 17th
Revised Sheet No. 89 is being submitted in order to correct an error made on 16th Revised Sheet No. 89 in which the amount
for TCR No. 13 was inadvertently changed to an incorrect amount. The correct amount, $20,100,000, was approved by
the Commission in Docket No. RP93-139 on 15th Revised Sheet No. 89.

Transwestern states that copies of the filing were served on its gas utility customers, interested state commissions,
and all parties to this proceeding.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC, 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before March 25, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission
in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

Title:

 Quality Assurance Specifications and Requirements (EPA No. 866.04; OMB No. 2080-0033). 


Abstract:

 This ICR is an extension of existing information collection activities associated with quality assurance (QA) procedures
as required at 40 CFR 30.503 and 31.45. Under these regulations, State and local governments or non-profit research
institutions seeking Federal assistance for proposed projects must include written QA plans or narrative statements
that document the steps taken to assure that the data are of the quality that is needed. The EPA needs this documentation
to ensure that all extramural projects involving environmental measurements adhere to existing EPA QA guidelines.
By so doing, the EPA may ensure that all data used in environmental protection efforts will be valid, scientifically
sound, legally defensible, and of known and documented quality.
Non-profit research institutions must provide a narrative statement that describes the purpose and objectives
of the proposed study, and the QA/Quality Control (QC) procedures documenting the precision and bias of the data produced
in support of the research. State and local governments must submit a more extensive written QA plan, as described
in the ``Interim Guidelines and Specifications for Preparing Quality Assurance Projects Plans.'' The plan should
describe in detail, or by reference, the measurement systems used, the QC procedures to be followed, data analysis
and reporting, and any other aspects of QA/QC used to document that the data generated are of the quality claimed and
needed to meet project objectives. The information submitted to EPA will be used by appropriate EPA offices and their
respective Quality Assurance Managers as a basis for recommending approval of financial assistance for projects
involving environmental measurements. The EPA project officers will maintain file copies of the plans and narratives.


Burden Statement:

 Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 79 hours per response, including
time for reviewing instructions, searching existing information sources, completing and reviewing the collection
of information, and submitting the information to EPA.


Respondents:

 State and local governments, non-profit research institutions.

Title:

 Certification and Training of Pesticide Applicators. (EPA ICR No. 0155.05; OMB No. 2070-0029). This is a request
for extension of the expiration date of a currently approved collection with no changes.


Abstract:

 In compliance with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), and to minimize the threat to
human health and the environment, EPA classifies pesticides as general or restricted use. Restricted-use pesticides
can only be used by or under the supervision of a certified applicator. EPA conducts a program to certify pesticide
applicators in states whose programs have not received Agency approval (Colorado for private applicators and Nebraska
for private and commercial applicators). Individuals applying for or renewing certification as applicators of
restricted-use pesticides, must complete EPA form 8500-17. Applicants for certification must establish
their competency in pesticide use through completion of a training program. Certified commercial applicators and
dealers of restricted-use pesticides are required to maintain records of use and sale of restricted-use pesticides.
In addition, states, Indian tribes, and Federal Agencies with EPA-approved certification programs must submit
to the Agency an annual report of their sale and use of restricted-use pesticides. EPA uses the information to determine
compliance with FIFRA, and, when necessary, as evidence in enforcement cases. 

Burden Statement:

 The burden for this collection of information is estimated to average .92 hour per response for reporting, and 3.5
hours per recordkeeper annually. This estimate includes the time needed to review instructions, gather the data
needed, and review the collection of information.


Respondents:

 Private and commercial applicators, and dealers of restricted-use pesticides. States, Indian tribes, and Federal
Agencies. 


Estimated Number of Respondents:

 11,809 for reporting, and 351,100 for recordkeeping.


Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent:

 1.


Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents:

 1,241,400 hours.


Frequency of Collection:

 Annually and on occasion.

Announcement of a Cooperative Agreement to the Ambulatory Sentinel Practice Network 
 


Summary 


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
a sole source cooperative agreement with the Ambulatory Sentinel Practice Network (ASPN) for the Laboratory Medicine
Quality Improvement Program. Approximately $200,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund this cooperative agreement.
It is expected that the award will begin on May 1, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project
period of up to 5 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project
period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds.
 
The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to increase the ability of the primary care physician to determine: (1)
Problems that exist in the total process of laboratory testing, (2) how often problems occur, (3) what impact these
problems have on patient care, and (4) what interventions can be developed to improve the total testing process. Activities
to achieve these ends will include two primary focus areas. The first area of focus is studying the extent and nature
of problems in the diagnosis and treatment of patients caused by inaccurate laboratory test results. The second area
of focus is studying the effect of errors on patient care in each component of the clinical laboratory testing process
to include the following: (a) Communication between the attending physician and the clinical laboratory which is
to conduct the tests; (b) selection of the tests to be performed; (c) limits applicable to the tests selected; (d) acquisition
of the specimen to be tested; (e) transportation of the specimen to the laboratory, (f) storage of the specimen by the
laboratory, (g) analysis of the specimen by the laboratory; and, (h) reporting of the results by the laboratory.

These studies will be addressed by individual primary care 
physicians and others in the practices affiliated with ASPN 
using investigative strategies established in cooperation with CDC. Specific activities include the development
of protocols and survey forms, data analysis and creation of interventions to improve the total testing process in
primary care physicians' practices. 

CDC will: (1) Collaborate in questionnaire development for profiling ASPN clinicians and practices, problem identification,
and results analysis; (2) collaborate in the development and implementation of surveillance for specific types
of laboratory problems occurring in the pre- and post-analytic phases of the testing process. This includes collaborating
on card questionnaire development, data analysis, and writing summaries of the results; (3) collaborate in the development
and implementation of focused surveillance for problems occurring in the analytic phase of the testing process.
CDC will assist with card questionnaire development, data analysis, and writing summaries of the results; (4) collaborate
in the development and implementation of a patient-oriented sentinel method. CDC will assist with questionnaire
development, results analysis, and writing summaries of the results; (5) collaborate in the development of recommendations
for improving the total testing process in ASPN practices. CDC will also collaborate in developing the methods for
testing these recommendations and measuring changes in quality of the testing process. This will include developing
specific recommendations for quality improvement interventions, assisting with developing measurement tools,
analyzing results, and writing summaries of the results; (6) assist ASPN staff with presentations (including visuals,
materials, etc.) of the progress towards achieving objectives at each of the annual ASPN convocations. CDC staff
will also assist in the presentations at the annual ASPN convocations; and (7) assist ASPN staff in the preparation
of manuscripts related to the activities in this project. 

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to priority area 22 improving surveillance and data systems by the Year 2000.

WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

.) 


Authority 


This program is authorized under section 317(k)(3) of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(3), as amended.


Eligible Applicant 


Assistance will be provided only to the Ambulatory Sentinel Practice Network (ASPN). No other applications are solicited.

The program announcement and application kit have been sent to ASPN. 
ASPN is a non-profit organization of primary health care practitioners in the United States and Canada. ASPN's goal
is to increase and refine the primary care knowledge base by studying the problems that occur in the primary care setting.

ASPN is the most appropriate organization to conduct the work under this cooperative agreement because:

1. It is more cost effective to utilize the services of ASPN since the clinicians and the laboratories in this program
are already members of an organized network. To obtain a listing of clinicians and establish a new network would require
additional time (years) and funds. 
2. ASPN has established methods for routinely collecting and reporting data from its membership. The systems, staff,
and other resources are in place, available to be used for this proposed project. Patient records are accessible to
ASPN for follow-up and investigative purposes. 
3. ASPN clinicians have participated in a replication of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) National
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey which allows for comparisons of ASPN practices with a national sample. 
4. The majority of in-office laboratory testing takes place in a primary care setting. ASPN is the only national, primary
care, practice-based research network operating in the United States at the present time. 
5. Although other smaller primary care, practice-based research networks have been established in the United States,
ASPN has the most diverse geographic distribution which enhances the generalizability of the data collected in this
study. 
6. The composition of the ASPN network members includes a significant number of rural practices, a feature not present
in other practice-based research networks operating in the United States at the present time. 
7. The ASPN network services approximately 350,000 active patients. As laboratory errors are considered to be statistically
rare events, the large number of patients seen in the network greatly augments the power of the studies. 
8. ASPN has an established reporting rate of 93-98 percent. This is markedly higher than what one would expect
to be able to achieve outside of a practice-based research network. The high reporting rate is due to monitoring and
follow-up protocols used by the research support staff with ASPN. The high reporting rate makes the data collection
more efficient and complete. 
9. The ASPN network contains a small number of practices in Canada. This small subset of the network can be used as an
internal control to assess changes in the practice of laboratory medicine in the United States compared to Canada.

10. All ASPN network physicians are required to endorse and support the participation of their practices by recording
and reporting accurate data about patients collaboratively with other ASPN practices. Accurate and current data
are paramount in this project. 
11. There is no other known provider which can provide this type of investigative project.

SUMMARY:

 Part K, Chapter K (Administration for Children and Families) of the Statement of Organization, Functions and Delegations

KB, the Executive Secretariat Office 56 FR 42335 as last amended, August 20, 1993 and Chapter KK, the Office of Financial
Management. Specifically, to transfer the functional responsibility of the audit liaison function from Chapter
KB, the Executive Secretariat Office to KK, the Office of Financial Management.



The changes are as follows: 1. Amend KB.20 Functions. Delete paragraph B in its entirety and replace it with the following:

B. The Executive Secretariat Office ensures that issues requiring the attention of the Assistant Secretary, Principal
Deputy Assistant Secretary, Deputy Assistant Secretaries and/or executive staff are addressed on a timely and coordinated
basis; facilitates decisions on matters requiring immediate action including White House, congressional and secretarial

Accounting Office on ACF operations and personnel.

The Office directs and manages the ACF Equal Employment Opportunity and Civil Rights program and provides direction
and leadership on equal employment opportunity and civil rights policies and programs for ACF. Immediate oversight
is provided by a staff under the direction of an EEO Manager. It plans, develops and evaluates programs and procedures
designed to eliminate discrimination in employment, training, incentive awards, promotion and career opportunities.
The Equal Employment Manager reports to the Executive Secretariat, is located within the Immediate Office of the
Assistant Secretary, and has responsibility for coordinating and implementing the Equal Employment Opportunity
and Affirmative Action program for ACF in accordance with departmental policies and procedures.

2. Amend Chapter KK.00 Mission to delete it in its entirety and replace it with the following:

KK.00 Mission. The Office of Financial Management advises the Assistant Secretary for Children and Families
on financial management matters. It provides leadership and direction on budget development and budget execution.
It develops, administers and coordinates financial and budgetary policies, processes and controls necessary to

business activity, including grant awards, financial monitoring, resolution of audit findings, disallowances
and appeals. It serves as audit liaison with the General Accounting Office and the Department's Office of Inspector
General.

3. Amend Chapter KK.20 Functions. Paragraph F to delete it in its entirety and replace it with the following:

F. Division of Audit Resolution and Grant Oversight oversees the implementation of established ACF, departmental
and federal financial and grants management policies and guidelines. The Division oversees, monitors, and coordinates
the resolution of audit findings and processes audit findings for certain ACF programs. It serves as audit liaison
with the General Accounting Office and the Department's Office of Inspector General. The Division reviews, analyzes,
and responds to program, regional offices and grantee requests for interpretation of financial and grants management
policies and guidelines. The Division reviews, analyzes and prepares a recommended response for the Director or
Assistant Secretary for Children and Families regarding regional or program office consultations regarding disallowances,
suspensions or terminations. It provides analysis, supportive material, and recommends action on grantee requests
for reconsideration of disallowances or other grant actions; analyzes audit findings and assigns action to the appropriate
ACF official; monitors audit resolution activity to ensure compliance with OMB and Department resolution time frames;
and reviews resolution actions to ensure compliance with ACF, departmental and other federal regulations, policies
and guidelines.

The Division is responsible for monitoring debt collection activities and disposition of assets, and provides all
claims (debts) collection activities of former Community Services Administration (CSA) grantees. It serves as
the ACF liaison with GAO, HHS Audit Agency, and ASMB on grant matters; assists in grant hearings held by the Department

to affirm that nisin preparation is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as an antimicrobial agent in reduced cholesterol
liquid whole eggs.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (secs. 201(s) and 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 321(s) and 348(b)(5)) and the
regulations for affirmation of GRAS status in  170.35 (21 CFR 170.35), notice is given that M. G. Waldbaum Co.,

statement is not required and this petition results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding
of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the

SUMMARY:

 The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)

includes approximately $47.9 million for discretionary grants to 
provide outpatient early intervention services including primary 
care services with respect to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
disease. These grants are awarded under the provisions of 
subpart II and subpart III of part C of title XXVI of the Public

Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act of 1990, Public 
Law 101-381 (42 U.S.C. 300ff-51-300ff-67). 



The PHS is committed to achieving the health promotion and 
disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led 
national activity for setting health priorities. This grant 
program is related to the following priority areas: increase the 
proportion of HIV-infected persons who are tested; increase the 
proportion of primary health care providers who provide age-appropriate HIV counseling; and increase the proportion
of family 
planning and primary health care providers who provide a 
comprehensive HIV program. Potential applicants may obtain a 
copy of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report; Stock No. 017-001-00474-0) or Healthy People 2000 (Summary

Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402-9325 (telephone 202-783-3238). 

The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant

mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of 
the American people.

formally established as the Minimum Data Set (MDS) for 
BPHC, will be submitted every 6 months. (Approved under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act, OMB No. 0915-0158.) 


Criteria for Evaluation 


New and Competing Continuation Applications 


In its review of applications for new and competing continuation 
projects, BPHC will consider: 
 The need in the community, based on the 2-year period 
preceding the proposed grant period, for additional 
preventive and primary care services to those at risk for 
HIV infection, including women, children, and minorities, 
and to persons with HIV infection; barriers to meeting 
those needs within the existing service provider system; 
and other information (e.g., epidemiological and health 
resources data) that makes a compelling case for the 
grant requested as specified in Section 2653 of the PHS 
Act. 
 The applicant's ability to describe its role within the 
community in addressing the unmet needs for delivery of 
HIV primary care services to the targeted populations. 
 The degree to which the proposed budget is appropriate to 
the program plan and the degree to which coordination 
with other funding sources is documented. 
 Comprehensiveness of the existing, plus proposed, scope 
of counseling and testing, referral, primary care 
prevention, diagnostic and treatment services, and 
optional outreach, case management, or eligibility 
assistance services provided by the applicant; and 
development of mechanisms to assure continuity of primary 
care for persons living with HIV infection. 
 Extent to which actions taken assure effective 
collaboration with city/county/State health department 
HIV prevention activities supported by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, and with State Care 
Consortia funded under Section 2613 of the PHS Act; 
extent to which efforts are consistent with priorities of 
the HIV Planning Council in the cities funded under Title 
XXVI of the PHS Act, and with programs funded by other 
PHS agencies. 
 The adequacy and completeness of the program evaluation 
plan, and the relationship of the evaluation plan to the 
goals and objectives of the proposed program, so that 
effectiveness can be measured.

Other Grant Information 


The Grant Program to Provide Outpatient Early Intervention 
Services with Respect to HIV Disease has been determined to be a 
program which is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 
12372, as implemented by 45 CFR Part 100. Executive Order 12372 
allows States the option of setting up a system for reviewing 
applications from within their States for assistance under 
certain Federal programs. The application packages to be made 
available under this notice will contain a listing of States 
which have chosen to set up a review system and will provide a 
State-point-of-contact (SPOC) in the State for the review. 
Applicants (other than federally-recognized Indian tribal 
Governments) should contact their SPOCs as early as possible to 
alert them to the prospective applications and receive any 
necessary instructions on the State process. For proposed 
projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to 
contact the SPOC of each affected State. The due date for State 
process recommendations is 60 days after the application deadline 
date. The BPHC does not guarantee to accommodate or explain 
State process recommendations it receives after that date. 
This program is subject to the Public Health System Reporting 
Requirements. Reporting requirements have been approved by the 
Office of Management and Budget_0937-0195. Under these 
requirements, the community-based nongovernmental applicant must 
prepare and submit a Public Health System Impact Statement 
(PHSIS). The PHSIS is intended to provide information to State 
and local health officials to keep them apprised of proposed 
health services grant applications submitted by community-based 
nongovernmental organizations within their jurisdictions. 
Community-based nongovernmental applicants are required to submit 
the following information to the head of the appropriate State 
and local health agencies in the area(s) to be impacted no later 
than the Federal Application receipt due date: 
a. A copy of the face page of the application (SF-424). 
b. A summary of the project (PHSIS), not to exceed one page, 
which provides: 
(1) A description of the population to be served. 
(2) A summary of the services to be provided. 
(3) A description of the coordination planned with the 
appropriate State or local health agencies. Grants 
will be administered in accordance with HHS 
Regulations in 45 CFR Part 92 for State and local 
governments, or 45 CFR Part 74 for other grantees. 
The OMB Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number for this 
program is 93.918.

Request for applications.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA),
in collaboration with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for a new HIV/AIDS Mental Health Services Demonstration
Program.




Because of the complexity of this program, a cooperative agreement mechanism is being utilized to allow for substantial
Federal programmatic participation in the conduct of the program, and to facilitate communication and coordination
in the overall implementation and evaluation of the program. The program will include cooperative agreements for
services demonstration projects to provide mental health services to people affected by and living with HIV/AIDS
and a coordinating center which, in conjunction with the services demonstration projects, will design and implement
the overall evaluation of the HIV/AIDS Mental Health Services Demonstration Program. A steering committee will
be established to facilitate coordination and cooperation among the services demonstration projects and the coordinating
center, and to oversee the cooperative agreements.

The HRSA Bureau of Health Resources Development (BHRD) and the NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) also
will provide funding support for certain aspects of these cooperative agreements, will recommend reviewers for
the review of applications, will participate on the steering committee, and will otherwise be involved in the implementation
of the HIV/AIDS Mental Health Services Demonstration Program.

This notice consists of three parts:



Part I

 covers information on the legislative authority and the applicable regulations and policies related to the HIV/AIDS
Mental Health Services Demonstration Program.



Part II

 describes the purpose, goals and scope of the program and discusses eligibility, availability of funds, period of
support and the receipt date for applications.



Part III

 describes special requirements of the program, the application process, the review and award criteria and lists
contacts for additional information.

Part I_Legislative Authority and Other Applicable Regulations and Policies



Cooperative Agreements awarded under this RFA are authorized under Sections 520B (42 U.S.C. 290bb-33), 520
(42 U.S.C. 290bb-31), 501 (42 U.S.C. 290aa), 405 (42 U.S.C. 284), and 464R (42 U.S.C. 285p) of the PHS Act and 42
U.S.C. 300ff-28.

Federal regulations at Title 45 CFR parts 74 and 92, generic requirements concerning the administration of grants,
are applicable to these awards.

Cooperative Agreements must be administered in accordance with the 

PHS Grants Policy Statement

 (Rev. April 1, 1994).

The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number for this program is 93.215.

Interim and final progress reports and financial status and expenditure reports will be required and specified to
cooperative agreement awardees in accord with PHS Grant Policy requirements.



Healthy People 2000:

 The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of 

Healthy People 2000,

 a PHS-led activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This Request for Applications
(RFA), 

HIV/AIDS Mental Health Services Demonstration Program,

 is related to the priority of HIV/AIDS infection. Potential applicants may obtain a copy of 

Healthy People 2000

Summary Report:

 Stock No. 017-001-00473-1) through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office,
Washington, DC 20402-9325 (Telephone: 202-783-3238).



Promoting Nonuse of Tobacco:

 Studies have clearly established that the use of tobacco products increases mortality and morbidity, not only for
the primary users of these products but for those in close proximity to the user. Statistics published by the National
Cancer Institute indicate that cigarette smoking and chewing of tobacco are responsible for as many as 1,500 deaths
per day in the United States. Recent studies conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that prolonged
exposure to second-hand smoke significantly increases the probability of developing heart and lung disease. Therefore,
the CMHS strongly encourages all awardees to provide smoke-free project and work environments.

A number of the goals of this program are consistent with the President's Health Care Reform initiative (e.g., providing
quality mental health services, reducing the number of unnecessary inpatient and outpatient medical visits, and
increasing productive work capacity as a result of receiving these services) and support the DHHS Secretary's themes
of fostering independence through empowering the people, preventing future problems, and improving services to
our customers.



Part II_Programmatic Purpose, Goals and Scope, Eligibility and Application Receipt Date





Services Demonstration Projects:

 CMHS will award competitive cooperative agreements under Section 520B of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act to develop
or expand programs to provide mental health services for individuals, their families and others who experience serious
psychological reactions as a result of HIV/AIDS antibody testing, and to provide mental health services for people
with HIV/AIDS. The services demonstration projects will be responsible for an evaluation that includes collection
of both process and outcome data and that will document the extent to which the objectives set forth in the application
have been met.

The services demonstration projects will also participate in the development of an overall evaluation of the HIV/AIDS
Mental Health Services Demonstration Program by the coordinating center, as described below.



Coordinating Center:

 CMHS will award one competitive cooperative agreement to a recipient which, in conjunction with the services demonstration
projects, will design and implement the overall evaluation of the HIV/AIDS Mental Health Services Demonstration
Program. This will include evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of the different approaches or models used
for organizing and providing the mental health services. The coordinating center will also provide the overall coordination
and management of the program data.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940324-2-00064 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940324-2-00042 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Applicants should address the development of an infrastructure that includes the following:
 Relationships with or a plan to build relationships with a variety of other non-HIV/AIDS health, mental health,
and support service providers such as, State Mental Health or Substance Abuse Block Grant Programs, maternal and
child health services, primary health care services, financial and other resource supports, legal services, spiritual
services, and governmental and private programs.
 Relationships with or a plan to build relationships with other programs for people with HIV/AIDS, such as,
the CDC Counseling and Testing Program, the HRSA Ryan White C.A.R.E. Act Program (Title I EMAs, Title II States and
their consortia, Title III Early Intervention providers, and Title IV Pediatric Projects), NIH-supported treatment
and research programs, etc.
 An appropriate system for determining the eligibility of people with HIV/AIDS for financial or other resource
assistance.
 Reimbursement for mental health services provided through Federal, State, local, or nongovernmental programs
of support, e.g., Medicaid reimbursement.
 Training for individuals providing the services described in the application.
Funding preference will be given to services demonstration project applicants that are based at, or have relationships
with, entities providing comprehensive health services to people who are infected with HIV. For the purposes of this
program, comprehensive health services include services such as those described above in the ``Specific Mental
Health Services'' and ``Additional Project Elements'' sections.


Evaluation:

 The evaluation should include collection of both process and outcome data that will document the extent to which the
objectives set forth in the application have been met by the project. Process evaluations examine the extent to which
the project has been implemented as designed. Outcome evaluations assess the extent to which the projects have achieved
the desired effects at the individual level as well as the group and community level. The evaluation should examine:
the implementation of HIV/AIDS specific mental health services and additional project elements at the project and
client levels; the type and frequency of services provided to the individual clients; the characteristics and needs
of recipients of the services; and the outcome of services.
Services demonstration projects will be expected to participate in the development of an overall evaluation of the
HIV/AIDS Mental Health Services Demonstration Program that would be implemented by the coordinating center. The
services demonstration project plans may have to be refined in light of the overall program evaluation plan. The services
demonstration projects must agree to cooperate with CMHS and the coordinating center on the design and implementation
of the overall program evaluation plan.
Applicants should budget 15-20 percent for the evaluation activities, and include travel for at least two participants
to attend up to four meetings in the Washington, D.C. area or at a services demonstration project site for each year
of the project period (4 years).


B. Applications for the Coordinating Center Funding


The coordinating center, in conjunction with CMHS and the services demonstration projects, will, using input from
the services demonstration projects, design and implement the overall evaluation of the HIV/AIDS Mental Health
Services Demonstration Program including: 1) A description and evaluation of the various models created under this
program in an effort to determine which models might be replicated and integrated into HIV/AIDS health care delivery
systems nationally; and 2) an analysis of changes in client outcomes.
The coordinating center will assist the services demonstration projects by providing overall evaluation coordination,
including data management and analysis, training in common procedures, and distribution of necessary materials
to all projects. Specifically, the coordinating center will work with CMHS and the services demonstration projects
in the planning phase to: 1) Provide advice regarding the evaluation personnel needs at the services demonstration
project level; 2) develop criteria for compatible computer equipment; 3) recommend to the steering committee common
outcome measures; and 4) develop common data collection elements. It is anticipated that these tasks will be coordinated
through a series of meetings of the steering committee to commence immediately following issuance of the Notices
of Grant Award.
The coordinating center will develop and maintain a common data repository, containing common data files needed
by the services demonstration projects. It is the intention of CMHS that the data be made available to the larger mental
health and HIV/AIDS community as soon as feasible, in accordance with steering committee recommendations and in
accordance with participant protection policy.
The coordinating center will also provide ongoing technical assistance on the data collection and evaluation issues
to the services demonstration projects as needed. The coordinating center budget should be consistent with the purpose
of the program, and should reflect the level of effort anticipated to carry out the proposed tasks.
The steering committee, working with the coordinating center, will prepare reports for submission to the project
officer. An annual progress report will be prepared by the steering committee.

Applicants for the coordinating center should present a plan for how best to meet the overall responsibilities described
above and the goals of the HIV/AIDS Mental Health Services Demonstration Program. In addition, previous relevant
experience in data collection and evaluation, as well as facilities and resources available to complete the project,
should be described.



Eligibility: 

Applications may be submitted by public and nonprofit private entities, such as community mental health centers,
community-based organizations providing HIV/AIDS care and related services, State and local health departments,
universities, colleges, hospitals, and alternative health and mental health care entities that serve medically
disenfranchised populations. Entities may apply for either or both types of award (services demonstration project
and coordinating center). Entities staffed largely by women and minorities are especially encouraged to apply.


Availability of funds: 

It is estimated that approximately $1.2 million total (direct and indirect costs) will be available in FY 94 and that
additional funding up to a total of $3.4 million may be available through further collaboration with other agencies
for services demonstration projects. It is anticipated that 8-12 services demonstration projects will be
awarded under this Request for Applications (RFA) in FY 94. Actual funding levels will depend upon the availability
of funds at the time of the award. It is expected that an additional $700,000 total (direct and indirect costs) will
be available for a coordinating center.



Period of Support: 

Support may be requested for an initial period of up to 4 years. Annual awards will be made subject to continued availability
of funds and progress achieved.



Application Receipt and Review Schedule: 

The schedule for receipt and review of applications under this announcement is as follows:






Applications must be received by the published application receipt date. An application received after the deadline
may be acceptable if it carries a legible proof-of-mailing date assigned by the carrier and the proof-of-mailing

This subsection applies to services demonstration project applicants only.



Intergovernmental Review (E.O. 12372): 

Applications for services demonstration projects, submitted in response to this announcement are subject to the
intergovernmental review requirements of Executive Order 12372, as implemented through DHHS regulations at 45
CFR Part 100. E.O. 12372 sets up a system for State and local government review of applications for Federal financial
assistance. Applicants (other than federally recognized Indian tribal governments) should contact the State's
Single Point of Contact (SPOC) as early as possible to alert them to the prospective application(s) and to receive
any necessary instructions on the State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant
is advised to contact the SPOC of each affected State. A current listing of SPOCs is included in the application kit.
The SPOC should send any state process recommendations to the following address: Director, Office of Evaluation,
Extramural Policy, and Review, Center for Mental Health Services, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 18C-07, Rockville,
MD 20857, Attn: Spoc.

The due date for State process recommendations is 

no later than 60 days

 after the deadline date for the receipt of applications. The CMHS does not guarantee to accommodate or explain SPOC
comments that are received after the 60-day cut-off. This subsection applies to the services demonstration project
applicants only.



Role of Federal Staff in Cooperative Agreements:

 The Cooperative Agreement mechanism includes substantial post-award Federal programmatic participation in the
conduct of the project. It is anticipated that CMHS staff participation in this program will be substantial. In addition
to the general project officer function of monitoring the conduct and progress of the services demonstration projects
and making recommendations about continuance of the project, CMHS staff will be active participants in planning
and implementing the HIV/AIDS Mental Health Services Demonstration Program through participation on the steering
committee, promoting exchange of relevant information among the services demonstration projects, and participating
in and/or providing support services for training, evaluation, and data collection. CMHS staff will also monitor
the function and activities of the coordinating center, assuring that progress is satisfactory, and required reporting
is timely. A program representative from CMHS, BHRD and NIMH will participate on the steering committee, each with
a single vote.



Application Procedures:

 All applicants must use application form PHS 5161-1 (Rev. 7/92), which contains Standard Form 424 (face page).
The following information should be typed in Item Number 10 on the face page of the application form:

Review Process: 

Applications submitted in response to this RFA will be reviewed for technical merit in accordance with established
PHS/SAMHSA peer review procedures for grants.

Applications that are accepted for review will be assigned to an Initial Review Group (IRG) composed primarily of
non-Federal experts. Notification of the IRG recommendation will be sent to the applicant upon completion of the
initial review. In addition, the IRG recommendations on technical merit of applications will undergo a second level
of review by the appropriate advisory council whose review may be based on policy considerations as well as technical
merit. Applications may be considered for funding only if the advisory council concurs with the IRG recommendation
for approval.



Review Criteria: 

The following criteria will be used in the technical merit review of services demonstration project applications.
The points noted in parentheses for each criterion indicate the maximum number of points the reviewers may assign
to that criterion. These points will be used to calculate a raw score for each application. The raw score will be converted
to the official priority score.

 adequacy of documentation of unmet need, including a description of special population(s) to be served, if
applicable, and the availability of and access to the current mental health delivery system by people affected by
and living with HIV/AIDS (30)

 adequacy and appropriateness of the goals and objectives, and approach, including the specific mental health
services to be provided and the additional project elements that assure the development of an infrastructure (25);

 appropriateness of the proposed project in terms of (1) budget, (2) management plan, (3) personnel, (4) time
frame, (5) resources, and (6) adequacy, availability, and accessibility of facilities (20)

 appropriateness of the proposed evaluation design and methodology (15)

 experience of the applicant in delivering mental health services (10)

The following criteria will be used in the technical merit review of the coordinating center applications. The points
noted in parentheses for each criterion indicate the maximum number of points the reviewers may assign to that criterion.
These points will be used to calculate a raw score for each application. The raw score will be converted to the official
priority score.

<DOCTITLE>Mental Health Care Provider Education in HIV/AIDS </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Center for Mental Health Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Request for applications.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Center For Mental Health Services (CMHS), of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA),
is interested in supporting a limited number of proposals to train both traditional and nontraditional mental health
care providers to address the psychological and the neuropsychiatric sequelae of HIV/AIDS. 




Since 1986, first the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), and now CMHS, have provided support for a program
to develop model educational approaches to train mental health care providers in neuropsychiatric and psychosocial
aspects of HIV/AIDS. The focus has been on training traditional mental health care providers (psychiatrists, psychologists,
nurses, social workers and marriage and family counselors), other first line providers of mental health services
(e.g., medical students, primary care physicians), and nontraditional providers (e.g., the clergy and other spiritual
providers, alternative health care workers, counselors). 


The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) supports a similar program, the National AIDS Education
and Training (AETC) Centers Program, which consists of a network of 17 centers geographically distributed throughout
the U.S.A., the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. This program emphasizes training primary care providers on the clinical
aspects of HIV management; however, multiple AETCs offer training for allied health care providers. 

This notice consists of three parts: 



Part I

 covers information on the legislative authority and the applicable regulations and policies related to the Mental
Health Care Provider Education in HIV/AIDS program. 



Part II

 describes the programmatic goals and scope of the program and discusses eligibility, availability of funds, period
of support and receipt date for applications. 



Part III

 describes special requirements of the program, the application process, the review and award criteria and provides
contacts for additional information.

Part I_Legislative Authority and Other Applicable Regulations and Policies



Grants awarded under this RFA are authorized under section 303(a)(1) of the Public Health Service Act, (42 U.S.C.
242a).

Federal regulations at Title 45 CFR parts 74 and 92, generic requirements concerning the administration of grants,
are applicable to these awards.

Grants must be administered in accordance with the PHS Grants Policy Statement (Rev. April 1, 1994).

The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number for this program is 93.244.

Interim and final progress reports and financial status and expenditure reports will be required and specified to
awardees in accord with PHS Grants Policy requirements.

Healthy People 2000: The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention
objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity for setting priority areas. This Request for Applications
(RFA), Mental Health Care Provider Education in HIV/AIDS, is related to the priority of HIV/AIDS. Potential applicants
may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report: Stock No. 017-001-00474-0; or Summary Report:
Stock No. 017-001-00473-1) through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office,
Washington, D.C. 20402-9325 (Telephone: 202-783-3238).

Promoting Non-use of Tobacco: Studies have clearly established that the use of tobacco products increases mortality
and morbidity, not only for the primary users of these products but for those in close proximity to the user. Statistics
published by the National Cancer Institute indicate that cigarette smoking and chewing of tobacco are responsible
for as many as 1,500 deaths per day in the United States. Recent studies conducted by the Environmental Protection
Agency indicate that prolonged exposure to second-hand smoke significantly increases the probability of developing
heart and lung disease. Therefore, the CMHS strongly encourages all grantees to provide smoke-free project and work
environments.

This program supports one of the tenants of health care reform that appropriate and adequate care be provided by trained
providers. It also supports the HHS Secretary's themes of fostering independence through empowering the people,
preventing future problems, and improving services to our customers.



Part II_Programmatic Goals and Scope, Eligibility and Application Receipt Date



The goal of this program is to enhance the Nation's ability to have an impact upon the HIV/AIDS epidemic by training
the traditional mental health care providers and other health care workers who often are first-line providers of
mental health services, such as medical students, primary care physicians, and the clergy and other spiritual providers.

Applicants will be expected to propose a comprehensive training program that addresses the needs of traditional
providers (psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, social workers and marriage and family counselors), other first
line providers of mental health services (e.g., medical students, primary care physicians), and nontraditional
providers (e.g., the clergy and other spiritual providers, alternative health care workers, counselors). Training
programs proposed must target at least 5 provider groups. The program must address the neuropsychiatric and the psychosocial
aspects of HIV/AIDS; coping with HIV/AIDS; and approaches to prevent the spread of HIV infection.

Applicants are expected to explore the programs offered by their local HRSA AETCs and other health care provider educators
and, where appropriate, establish linkages.

<DOCTITLE>Substance Abuse Prevention Demonstration Grants for High Risk Youth Populations </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), HHS.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Availability of funds and request for applications.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) announces the availability of support for projects that demonstrate
and evaluate comprehensive strategies to prevent and/or reduce the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs (ATOD),
including inhalants and steroids, among youth at high risk for such behaviors. 



Since its inception, an important component of CSAP's mission has been to direct its efforts toward youth at high risk
for using ATOD. To this end, CSAP has funded a number of projects to demonstrate the effectiveness of various preventive
interventions to reduce the use of ATOD, and to change the behavior and attitudes of high risk youth about ATOD. In this
Announcement, four related but distinct efforts (program priority areas) are proposed: 

 High Risk Youth (Module A) 
 Female Adolescents (Module B) 
 Alcohol and Other Drug-Related Violence Among High Risk Youth (Module C) 
 Replications of Model Programs for the Prevention of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drug (ATOD) use Among High
Risk Youth (Cooperative Agreements) (Module D) 


It should be noted that support for three of these program priority areas (High Risk Youth, Female Adolescents, and
AOD-Related Violence Among High Risk Youth) will be in the form of prevention demonstration grants, while the fourth
(Replications) will provide support for cooperative agreements. Compared with demonstration grant programs,
cooperative agreements involve substantially greater involvement on the part of the Federal funding agency in the
conduct of the project. 


Any single project for which support is requested under this announcement may be addressed to only one of the above
program priority areas. Applicants seeking support for more than one project, whether in the same priority area or
in different priority areas, must submit a separate and different application for each project. 




Eligibility: 

Applications may be submitted by public organizations, such as units of State or local governments or eligible agencies
of the Federal government, and by private nonprofit organizations such as community-based organizations, universities,
colleges, and hospitals. 


In accordance with section 517(b)(3) of the Public Health Service Act, applications from community-based organizations
will be given special consideration by CSAP in its award decision-making process. 




Target Population: 

High Risk Youth: Youth who experience multiple risk factors are considered to be at high risk for alcohol and other
drug use. Section 517(g) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act identifies the following groups of youth who are likely
to be at high risk. 


Youth under the age of 21 who: (a) Are children of substance abusers; 

(b) Are victims of physical, sexual, or psychological abuse; 

(c) Have experienced chronic failure in school; 

(d) Have dropped out of school; 

(e) Have become pregnant; 

(f) Are economically disadvantaged; 

(g) Have committed a violent or delinquent act; 

(h) Are experiencing mental health problems; 

(i) Have attempted suicide; 

(j) Have experienced long-term physical pain due to injury.

The PHS Act (in section 517(b)(1)) specifies that priority be given to substance abuse prevention projects directed
at children of substance abusers, latchkey children, children at risk of abuse or neglect, preschool children eligible
for services under the Head Start Act, children at risk of dropping out of school, children at risk of becoming adolescent
parents, and children who do not attend school and who are at risk of being unemployed. CSAP will therefore give special
consideration in its award decision-making process to projects addressing these populations and their prevention
needs. 




Conceptual Framework: 

Based on research and knowledge gleaned from CSAP's previous demonstration projects, CSAP expects applicants to
propose a comprehensive prevention approach that is conceptualized, implemented, and evaluated in a logical manner.
To ensure comprehensiveness, CSAP strongly recommends that applicants use a risk/protective factor approach,
an approach that delineates factors that appear to be correlated with the use of ATOD among children and youth (risk
factors) and that appear to protect youth from ATOD use (protective factors). These risk and protective factors can
be organized according to six major life areas or ``domains''_the individual, family, school, peer group, neighborhood/community,
and society. Each domain represents an important sphere of influence in the lives of children and youth. 

To ensure that the demonstration is based in a logically sound framework, CSAP strongly recommends that applicants
use the logic model, a model that articulates the links between the specific risk and protective factors that have
been identified and are to be addressed, the specific project objectives, the proposed intervention strategies,
and the anticipated outcomes. 


CSAP strongly encourages applicants to use the risk/protective factor approach and the logic model. However, applicants
may propose alternative frameworks and will be given fair and due consideration, so long as the applicant provides
a clear description of any alternative frameworks, the alternative frameworks are comprehensive and logical, and
the applicant offers a rationale for their selection over the risk/protective factor approach and/or the logic model.


Guidelines for using the risk/protective factor approach and the logic model for ATOD prevention programs targeting
high risk youth populations are included as part of the complete application kit. 

This notice consists of four parts: 



Part I 

covers information on the legislative authority and applicable regulations and policies of the Substance Abuse
Prevention Demonstration Grants for High Risk Youth Populations Program. 


Part II 

is a summary of the application receipt date, estimate of funds available, anticipated number of awards, period of
support, and project start dates. 



Part III 

describes the four programmatic priority areas (Modules A-D) under which CSAP is inviting applications. 




Part IV 

provides additional guidance related to the application process and requirements, review criteria, award decision
criteria, and contacts for additional information. 



Part I_Legislative Authority and Other Applicable Regulations and Policies

have been thoroughly documented (for example, see Boyle, 1993). Moreover, data presented in leading medical journals
(for example, New England Journal of Medicine, June 10, 1993) and reported widely in the press, associate environmental
exposure to tobacco smoke (passive smoking) with increased rates of cancer and other pulmonary diseases among people
of all ages and with increased rates of asthma among children. Further, scientific evidence supports the connection
between the use of smokeless tobacco products, such as chewing tobacco and snuff, and cancer of the mouth, jaw and throat.


Critical questions now facing public health experts concern the most effective methods for preventing youth from
using tobacco products in the first place and for preventing and/or reducing infants' and children's exposure to
smoke in both public and private environments. A combined approach involving public policy, media awareness, and
prevention education strategies appears to be a promising way to address this serious problem; however, careful
development, implementation, and evaluation of specific tobacco use prevention strategies is required to establish
their efficacy. 

The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention recognizes that its target populations are vulnerable to a variety of preventable
health and social problems, including substance abuse. Therefore, CSAP believes that preventative education concerning
use of tobacco products must be a priority for grantees. Further, CSAP encourages all grantees to provide smoke-free
programs and work environments. 

Health Care Reform: The Public Health Service is committed to furthering the aims of Health Care Reform. By preventing
and/or reducing the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs among youth, prevention programs can enhance the overall
health status of participants. As a consequence, ATOD prevention programs can contribute to a reduction in health
care costs related to the medical illnesses, disorders, and conditions associated with ATOD. 

Secretarial Themes for the Fiscal Year 1995 Legislative Program: In a Special Message For All Health and Human Service
(HHS) Employees, the HHS Secretary articulated three key priorities to support a Department-wide continuous improvement
process. These priorities are: fostering independence through empowering the people served, preventing future
problems, and improving services to customers through modern management approaches. Each of the four demonstration
programs proposed in this Announcement supports the Secretary's priorities. By addressing alcohol, tobacco, and
other drug use and related health and social problems among high risk youth, these programs hold substantial promise
for reducing future public health problems among the target population. In addition, the programs seek to empower
communities, including youth, to identify particular ATOD problems facing their communities and to design interventions
to address them. Further, these proposed programs encourage applicants to consider enhancements to service delivery
systems, such as increasing access and coordination of programs, thereby supporting the Secretary's emphasis on
improving service to customers.

Subject to the availability of funds in future fiscal years, CSAP may reissue this announcement and publish future
receipt dates and a notice of availability of funds in the Federal Register

. Because the President's 1995 budget request proposes to consolidate SAMHSA's categorical substance abuse prevention
demonstrations, certain aspects of this program could change. Therefore, applicants are strongly encouraged to
verify the availability and terms of funding for new awards for this program.

Part III_Program Priority Areas 



Module A: High Risk Youth 





Introduction: 

CSAP will provide support in the high risk youth priority area for projects that will demonstrate and assess the effectiveness
of comprehensive strategies to prevent and/or reduce the use of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs (ATOD), including
inhalants and steroids, among youth at high risk for such behaviors. 

This program priority area takes several major steps forward from CSAP's earlier High Risk Youth Demonstration Grants
Program. Specifically: All programs in this priority area are to include strategies for the prevention and reduction
of tobacco and alcohol use among high risk youth in addition to strategies for the prevention of use of any other drugs
that may be included or emphasized in the program. 

It strongly recommends a multiple risk factor approach for designing prevention programs. With the understanding
that substance use is a function of multiple factors in multiple risk factor domains (viz., the individual, the family,
the school, the peer group, the neighborhood/community, and society), a multiple risk factor approach is considered
necessary to respond comprehensively and effectively to the problem of substance use among youth. 

The program further differs from its predecessor in that applicants are asked to involve youth and others in the community
both in identifying the relevant risk factors for ATOD use that are to be addressed and in selecting appropriate interventions
to address these risk factors. 

It also requires all programs that serve youth 12 years of age and over to ascertain the effectiveness of their intervention
strategies in reducing the incidence and prevalence of alcohol, tobacco, and/or other drug use. Programs serving
youth 12 years and over are required to obtain incidence measures in addition to assessing the effectiveness of the
intervention strategies in reducing the risk factors or enhancing the protective factors on which the project is
focused. This will be the first time CSAP will be receiving data on common outcome variables, specifically on the incidence
and reduction of use for alcohol and tobacco and other drugs. These common outcomes will be generated by programs using
culturally tailored strategies and addressing different combinations of risk factors. 

It also tests the hypothesis that factors that place youth at risk for ATOD use may also place them at risk for engaging
in violent acts. 

The high risk youth priority area also has a special interest in effective strategies that are designed to positively
influence youth by the time they reach 8th grade. Recent studies lead us to believe that it is important to intervene
with prevention programs prior to 8th grade because the inception of substance use frequently occurs at about this
age. CSAP also has a special interest in youth residing in public housing. 



Program Goals and Objectives: 

One of CSAP's most fundamental program goals is the prevention of ATOD use among high risk youth. This implies the elimination
of the problems associated with such use, such as engaging in acts that interfere with the achievement, maintenance,
and restoration of optimal health at the individual, family, and community levels. As part of its mission to decrease
the incidence and prevalence of ATOD use and resulting problems, CSAP is dedicated to identifying and disseminating
strategies that prevent or delay the use of alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, and other drugs among children
and youth. 

To fulfill this goal, CSAP has established the following outcome objectives to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the projects supported under this Announcement: 

1. To decrease the incidence of ATOD use among high risk youth by 

(a) Identifying and reducing factors in the individual, the family and significant others, the school, the peer group,
the neighborhood/community, and society that place youth at high risk for ATOD use; 

(b) Enhancing factors in the individual, the family and significant others, the school, the peer group, the neighborhood/community,
and society that may strengthen youth resiliency and protect youth from using alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs.


2. To delay and reduce the consumption of alcoholic beverages, and the use of tobacco products and other drugs among
high risk youth.

<PARENT> FR940324-2-00044 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Recommended Approach: CSAP invites applications that address, at a minimum, the following questions: 

1. What combination of strategies is most effective in improving family management practices and/or establishing
a healthy family environment for various racial/ethnic/gender populations? Which risk factors and risk factor
domains must be addressed? 

2. What combination of strategies is most effective in increasing bonding/commitment to school for populations
differing with respect to age, gender and race/ethnicity? Which risk factors and risk factor domains must be addressed?


3. Which combination of strategies is most effective (and hence, which risk factors and risk factor domains must be
addressed) in decreasing the influence and association of drug-using peer groups on members of the target population
and/or to increase the association and influence of non-drug-using peer groups on the target population? For whom
are they effective? 

4. What combination of strategies is most effective in increasing a negative attitude toward alcohol, tobacco, and
other drug use by: (a) The target population; or (b) the peer group; or (c) the family; or (d) the school; or (e) the community?
Which risk factors and risk factor domains must be addressed? 

These questions are in addition to the ATOD-specific questions listed in the Outcome Evaluation section of part IV.


All applications are to address the prevention and reduction in use of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products and
other drugs. Also applicants are strongly encouraged to develop policies that promote nonuse of tobacco products
by staff, clients, and visitors at project sites.

Module B: Female Adolescents 





Introduction: 

Through its High Risk Youth initiative, CSAP has sought to develop model projects that demonstrate successful techniques
to alter the behaviors and attitudes toward, and prevent and/or reduce the use of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs
(ATOD), including inhalants and steroids, among youth at high risk for such behavior. 

CSAP recognizes that female adolescents are at great risk for ATOD use and other related negative outcomes, and present
a unique challenge to individuals and organizations that seek to provide outreach and prevention services to them.
Female adolescents (ages 10 to 21) may use ATOD for different reasons than males, have different needs and problems
associated with their use of ATOD, and require different intervention strategies to successfully prevent and decrease
their ATOD use. 

While we know that gender differences in ATOD use exist, we know very little about what exactly these differences are.


We know that interventions designed for males_such as using confrontational strategies_may not be effective for
females. We do not know nearly enough, however, about how to design effective interventions for females.

What factors place female adolescents at risk for ATOD abuse, sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) including HIV/AIDS,
early pregnancy/childbirth and single parenting, school dropout and delinquency, and poverty and un/under-employment?
What strategies can be devised that will address these factors, and that will successfully reach out to young women
not often targeted by traditional school, social service or medical programs? What prevention strategies will result
in changes in attitudes and behaviors of young women with respect to their ATOD use and related problems, and how can
we measure such outcomes? 

This Announcement will support demonstration programs that seek to answer questions such as those above, and to develop,
implement, document, evaluate, and disseminate information about comprehensive strategies to address and respond
to the unique needs of female adolescents. 



Program Goals and Objectives: 

The overriding goal of this program priority area is to demonstrate strategies that decrease ATOD use among female
adolescents and promote optimal health at the individual, family, and community levels. More specifically, the
goals are: 

1. 

Primary Prevention: 

To decrease (and delay) the incidence of ATOD use among female adolescents by: 

(a) Identifying and specifying methods to reduce factors in the individual, family and/or significant others, school,
peer group, neighborhood/community, and society/media that increase young women's vulnerability to initiating
ATOD use; and 

(b) Enhancing factors in the individual, family and/or significant others, school, peer group, neighborhood/community
and society/media that strengthen young women's resiliency and protect them against using alcohol, tobacco, and
other drugs. 

2. 

Secondary Prevention: 

To decrease the prevalence of ATOD use among female adolescents by providing appropriate early intervention strategies
to female adolescents who have already initiated ATOD use or who have engaged in other problem behaviors which are
associated with ATOD use, such as early sexual activity, truancy, or running away from home. 

3. To decrease the incidence and prevalence of negative outcomes associated with ATOD use among female adolescents
by addressing risk factors that significantly contribute to these outcomes, especially childhood sexual and physical
abuse. Related negative outcomes include early pregnancy and parenthood; HIV transmission and AIDS, and other sexually-transmitted
diseases; adolescent mental disorders, including eating disorders, depression, and suicidal behaviors; school
dropout; involvement in prostitution, delinquency, or violent behaviors that may lead to criminal justice involvement;
and homelessness. 



Target Population: 

Where appropriate, applicants are encouraged to target the following populations who, traditionally, have been
underserved: (a) Female adolescents, ages 10-21, not normally targeted by traditional school, social service
or medical programs, such as young women who have dropped out of school or female adolescents in the work force. 

(b) Female adolescents who have been involved with the criminal/juvenile justice system; 

(c) Female adolescents with HIV/AIDS or other STDs, or those at especially high risk for these diseases; 

(d) Female adolescents with disabilities; 

(e) Female adolescents who are lesbian or bisexual; 

(f) Female adolescents who have a current or past 
history of physical/sexual abuse or incest. 

The applicant must clearly document that the target group chosen is at high risk for ATOD use by specifying the relevant
risk factors.

<TEXT>
 

Although applicants may target female adolescents aged 10-21, provisions must be made in the data collection
plan to disaggregate data for participants aged 12-21. Collecting data on females aged 12-21 will allow
for comparisons with other SAMHSA programs targeting females. 

In identifying female adolescents who are ``at risk'' for ATOD use, CSAP proposes this framework for considering
risk (See Resnick, 1993): 

Risk factors are: (1) Those environmental forces that have a negative impact on the individual by producing an increased
vulnerability to ATOD use. These include family dysfunction, including childhood physical/sexual abuse and incest;
high risk neighborhoods/environments; and poverty. 

(2) Those visible indicators of problems in individuals, which represent the onset of potentially negative behaviors
related to ATOD use and other negative outcomes. These may often be found in public records, and include poor school
performance and involvement with child protective services, such as out-of-home placement in the foster care system.


Risk factors for the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs may be found in six domains: The individual, the family,
the school, peer groups, the neighborhood/community, and society. 

Primary prevention efforts for ATOD use should identify female adolescents who are affected by multiple risk factors
(environmental forces and visible indicators). Secondary prevention efforts should target female adolescents
who may have already initiated ATOD use or have engaged in other problem behaviors such as early sexual activity, truancy,
or running away from home. 

Recommended Approach: CSAP encourages applicants to develop comprehensive programs that will address one or more
of the following questions: 

1. What combination of strategies is most effective in improving the self-image, including body image, and the 
generalized self-esteem and self-efficacy of female adolescents? 

2. What combination of strategies is most effective in developing the competencies or life skills of female adolescents
in such areas as intra/interpersonal communications and problem-solving? 

3. Which combination of strategies is most effective in improving the family functioning and strengthening the families
of female adolescents, and increasing adolescents' levels of parenting skills so that they will be prepared to parent
effectively and appropriately when they have children? 

4. What combination of strategies is most effective in combatting the long-lasting effects of sexual abuse/assault?


5. What combination of strategies is most effective in promoting healthy life styles and life skills (e.g., negotiation,
conflict-handling, self-assertion) among female adolescents? 

These questions are in addition to the ATOD-specific questions listed in the Outcome Evaluation section of Part IV.


Applicants are asked to involve representatives of youth and others in the community to: (1) Identify the risk factors
for ATOD use that are to be addressed in the project and (2) select the appropriate interventions. 

Successful interventions should also impact not only on ATOD use, but on other negative outcomes associated with
ATOD use. Related negative outcomes include adolescent pregnancy and parenting; 

HIV/AIDS and other sexually-transmitted diseases; adolescent mental disorders, including eating disorders and
depression; suicide; violent acts and criminal justice involvement; and homelessness. CSAP is especially interested
in programs which will address physical/sexual abuse, teen pregnancy, and HIV/AIDS and STDs, in addition to ATOD
use.

Module C: Alcohol and Other Drug-Related Violence Among High Risk Youth 





Introduction and Background:

 CSAP announces the availability of funds to support projects that demonstrate and evaluate comprehensive strategies
to prevent alcohol and other drug-related (AOD-related) violence among or affecting youth aged 6 to 14. Under this
program priority area, applicants should propose prevention demonstrations directed to youth who are at high risk
for becoming witnesses, victims, or perpetrators of violent acts associated with the use of alcohol and other drugs
(AOD). 

For the purpose of this Announcement, CSAP defines violence as a public health, social, and economic issue that affects
people of all races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic classes with enormous consequences to all Americans. CSAP recognizes
that substance abuse is both correlated with and causes violence and that, in turn, violence give rise to substance
abuse. Thus, substance abuse and violence are inextricably intertwined. Violence may be understood as any act that
causes psychological, emotional, or physical harm to individuals and/or communities, or that causes damage to property.
In this context, violence arises from substance use and abuse, the trade in illicit substances, racism, misogyny,
homophobia, among other factors, and results in homicide; assaults, including rape and sexual assault; spouse abuse
and battering; child physical and sexual abuse; child neglect; suicide; and vandalism and other forms of property
destruction. This broad CSAP definition of violence illustrates the fact that violence affects its victims, witnesses,
and perpetrators. 

CSAP recognizes that violence is linked to a host of social and health problems that plague many communities; however,
the Center is particularly concerned with the relationship of violence to the use and abuse of alcohol and other drugs.

<TEXT>
 

The Center seeks to identify those strategies that will be effective in preventing and/or reducing AOD-related violence
among or affecting youth, ages 6 to 11 and 12 to 14. CSAP wishes to fund prevention programs that include strategies
targeting risk/protective factors in the individual, family, school, peer group, neighborhood/community, and
society. 

Because AOD-related violence is a highly complex problem, effective prevention of it requires a comprehensive,
community-based approach. Community-based initiatives offer advantages over more individually-focused strategies
by encouraging the various segments of the community to accept an active role in AOD prevention. Further, the community-based
approach emphasizes that a wide range of environmental factors influence youth who become involved with AOD-related
violence. Therefore, efforts predicated on this approach avoid the error of developing programs based on a conceptual
framework that blames the victim. 

This demonstration grant program differs from its predecessor, the High Risk Youth Demonstration Grant Program,
in two significant ways: (1) It encourages applicants to examine risk factors that are common to both AOD use/abuse
and AOD-related violence, and (2) it asks applicants to involve all appropriate segments of the community in the prevention
effort targeted to high risk youth. Applicants are expected already to have established a community coalition capable
of addressing risk factors in multiple domains. Members of the community, including youth, should be involved in
identifying relevant risk/protective factors and in designing interventions to address them. 

Program Goals and Objectives: The overall goal of this program priority area is to demonstrate strategies that will:
(1) prevent or reduce those factors that place youth aged 6-14 at risk for AOD-related violence, and (2) reduce
the incidence and prevalence of AOD-related violent acts and of AOD use among the target population. 

To achieve these goals, CSAP encourages applicants to design projects that will positively influence the target
population by: 

1. Increasing children's and youth's communication and other social and life skills, including conflict-handling
skills.

2. Promoting youth bonding/commitment to school, church, and/or community.

3. Improving communication and other necessary skills among participants' parents to reduce the level of family
conflict and domestic violence.

4. Increasing school policies, procedures, and staff attitudes that promote school bonding/commitment.

5. Linking children and youth with positive community role models.

6. Organizing media awareness and media advocacy initiatives to address inappropriate portrayal of AOD and violence.




Target Population:

 In keeping with CSAP's emphasis on primary prevention and early intervention, the target population for this program
is youth. Children experience developmental challenges requiring them to master age-specific tasks; their particular
needs and the approaches appropriate to meet those needs vary significantly from age to age. This program, therefore,
divides the target population into two sub-populations: children and youth aged 6 to 11, and youth aged 12 to 14. 

Within both sub-populations, youth may experience factors or conditions that increase their vulnerability to AOD
use and to being witnesses, victims, or perpetrators of AOD-related violence. These risk factors can be organized
according to six domains: The individual, family/significant others, school, peer group, neighborhood/community,
and society. Youth who experience risk factors in multiple domains are considered to be at ``high risk.''

Recommended Approach: CSAP invites applications that will permit CSAP to answer questions such as, but not limited
to, those identified here: 

1. What combination of strategies is effective in developing communication, social, and life skills among youth
at risk for becoming witnesses, victims, and/or perpetrators of AOD-related violence? 
2. Which combination of strategies is effective in improving family functioning to reduce levels of family violence
and AOD use? 
3. What combination of strategies is effective in promoting and sustaining the involvement of youth at risk for AOD-related
violence in positive, pro-social activities? 
4. What strategies are effective in promoting a community-based approach to identifying and addressing the AOD-related
problems in the target population? 
5. Which strategies are suitable and effective in AOD-related violence prevention with sub-sets of youth (for example,
by age, gender, race/ethnicity/culture) as well as with their families, schools, peers, and communities? 
6. What strategies are effective in changing the behavioral norms that support violence in communities experiencing
high rates of AOD use? 

These questions are in addition to the ATOD-specific questions listed in the Outcome Evaluation section of part IV.


CSAP strongly recommends that applicants propose to implement comprehensive, community-based prevention strategies
that address multiple risk and/or protective factors in three or more domains. Applicants may choose to target one
or both of the designated sub-populations of high risk youth; that is, applicants may propose programs for 6 to 11 year
olds and/or 12 to 14 year olds. 

Applicants should design interventions to influence not only alcohol and other drug use and AOD-related violence,
but also such associated conditions and outcomes as lack of neighborhood structure, lack of positive role-models,
school drop-out, and vandalism. 

Programs are asked to address risk factors outside the individual that can precipitate, precede, or co-exist with
AOD use and AOD-related violence. Applicants are particularly encouraged to design prevention projects that involve
significant persons in the youthful participant's family and social network, especially siblings. 

At the same time that programs should be comprehensive, they should also take into account the particular needs of
individual program participants. Strategies should be developmentally appropriate. 

Strategies must also be tailored to meet the cultural, linguistic, gender, and ethnic characteristics of program
participants. 

In order to ensure a community-based approach, applicants are requested to demonstrate that they have in existence
a coalition consisting of community members who are willing and able to address relevant risk/protective factors.
Representatives of the community, including youth, should be involved in identifying the relevant risk/protective
factors and in developing the strategies to address them. 

Applicants are encouraged to consider implementing improvements in the way services are delivered in their community
to ensure that the local service delivery system can support the multifaceted, community-based prevention approach
recommended for AOD and AOD-related violence prevention. For example, applicants should consider the need and appropriateness
of linking and coordinating services through formal or informal agency and organizational agreements.

CSAP recommends that vigorous recruitment and innovative strategies for retaining participants be an integral
part of the proposed project. Applicants are requested to discuss how they will accomplish this in their applications.


Youth at high risk for AOD use may also be at risk for HIV/AIDS. As appropriate and feasible, applicants are urged to
consider this ancillary problem of substance use in designing their interventions. 

Award Criterion: Consistent with HHS policy, in addition to the award criteria listed in part IV of this 

Federal Register

 Notice, CSAP will give consideration to applications from Historically Black Colleges and Universities in making
funding decisions under this priority area.

Module D: Replications of Model Programs for the Prevention of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drug Use Among High Risk
Youth (Cooperative Agreements) 





Introduction: 

CSAP announces the availability of Cooperative Agreement Awards to support projects that demonstrate and evaluate
strategies to replicate one of twelve identified models of High Risk Youth Substance Abuse Prevention. Utilizing
Cooperative Agreement Awards to support replication projects will ensure coordination of a national effort to increase
knowledge about the mechanics of demonstration project replication. Through extensive technical assistance and
consultation, this mechanism will facilitate efforts to standardize and integrate information forwarded to, and
derived from ongoing program efforts. 



Definition of Replication: 

All projects identified in this Announcement as ready for replication (referred to as ``replicant'' projects) are
CSAP funded High Risk Youth projects that have demonstrated promising strategies in altering the behaviors and attitudes
toward and preventing and/or reducing the use of alcohol and other drugs (AOD) among youth at high risk for such behaviors.
The identified replicant projects are a representative sample of the most promising projects that were chosen based
on specific criteria. Criteria for choosing these projects is described in this module under ``Recommended Approach.''


This replication effort is a pilot project to determine whether, and to what extent, the identified promising models
may be:

 




Part A. 

Replicated by entities other than the original developers of the demonstration; or 



Part B. 

Replicated by the original developers of the demonstration.




Although CSAP has stressed the importance of demonstrating project replicability, until now it has not provided
funding specifically for a replication initiative. This replication is a pilot project and, as such, is limited by
the scope and range of identified projects. Subject to the results of this effort, CSAP expects that future replication
initiatives may be more inclusive with respect to expanding the identified replicant population as well as with other
aspects, such as introducing a wider range of variables that may be incorporated into the replication. 

CSAP recognizes the difficulty inherent in reproducing an existing project regardless of who developed it and would
prefer to define replication in a broad enough sense to give applicants some flexibility in their approach to this
effort. For purposes of this announcement, replicability may be defined as reproducing original projects as closely
as possible in all aspects, or as reproducing an identified project and adapting it in some respects to meet particular
needs of an applicant. For example, the applicant might wish to determine if an urban-developed project could, with
appropriate alterations in interventions, be successfully reproduced in a suburban or rural area. In making the
choice to alter a project for replication purposes, the applicant should carefully examine the circumstances, resources,
evaluation, etc., of the chosen project, and be able to present a logical case for linking the final choice of the project
being replicated to expected outcomes.

<DOCNO> FR940324-2-00088 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940324-2-00044 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Therefore, at this time, CSAP is not inviting applications that propose to change the cultural group or age group of
the target population, although such an adaptation might provide some interesting outcomes. Because of its nature
as a pilot project and because of the limited number of applications to be funded, introducing too many variables into
this current effort would be counter-productive. The instruction regarding cultural groups is not relevant to all
the identified replicant projects, as some of them are multicultural. 


CSAP will accept applications which propose to reproduce the identified projects in their entirety, unless advised
by the replicant project that replicating all components would not be practicable within the context of the replication.


CSAP legislation did not require the original replicant projects to address tobacco use prevention. However, replications
will be expected to address tobacco use prevention if the replicant project addressed this issue. 

This initiative should increase CSAP's knowledge of the mechanics of demonstration project replication_its costs,
pitfalls and probability of success_as well as increase knowledge in the general area of preventing ATOD use and abuse
by high risk youth. CSAP invites applications that will provide information regarding: 

1. Whether interventions and techniques that have been promising in modifying ATOD use under a given set of circumstances
can be as or more promising with a change in circumstances, e.g., a different administering agency, a different geographical/demographic
area, different personnel, etc. 

2. How minor alterations in program objectives or implementation will affect replicability and outcomes. 

3. How the general replication process may be effected and evaluated both from CSAP's standpoint and the standpoint
of the organizations implementing the replications. This Announcement requires, in addition to the outcome evaluation,
a process evaluation that includes an evaluation of the overall replication process as well as other areas generally
addressed in a process evaluation. 



Program Goals and Objectives:

 CSAP's overriding program goal is the elimination of ATOD use among high risk youth and of the problems associated
with such use that interfere with the achievement, maintenance, and restoration of optimal health at the individual,
family, and community levels. As part of its mission to decrease the incidence and prevalence of ATOD use and the resulting
problems, CSAP is dedicated to identifying and disseminating strategies that prevent or delay the use of alcoholic
beverages, tobacco products, and other drugs among youth. The identification of effective replication models will
add to this knowledge. If CSAP can demonstrate that promising interventions and strategies can be replicated in diverse
areas and, ultimately, among diverse populations, and if CSAP can determine the effectiveness of these promising
approaches, the field of ATOD prevention will have been advanced and youth will be better served. 



Recommended Approach:

 CSAP subjected all of its High Risk Youth grantees' projects to a multi-level screening process, the criteria for
which included comprehensiveness, theoretical foundation, empowerment of served populations, cultural appropriateness,
strength of evaluation design, accessibility to the target population, coordination, and overall readiness for
replication. The selected projects represent a spectrum of completion that includes projects now in their fourth
year, as well as projects which are completed and no longer receive CSAP funding. Through this process, CSAP has identified
the replicable projects listed in the matrix that follows. Abstracts for each of the identified projects have been
included in the complete application kit. 

All of the identified grantees have been contacted and have agreed to be included in the replication effort. They have
developed manuals describing their projects and containing information regarding their specific aims, target
population(s), approach/methods, project management and implementation plans, project staffing and organization,
staff skill levels (including job descriptions), financial resources required, participant protection plans,
and an overview of their perceptions of what the necessary ingredients are to effectively replicate the project.
High Risk Youth Replicant manuals are available to potential applicants through the National Clearinghouse on Alcohol
and Drug Information (NCADI), 1-800-729-6686. CSAP suggests that organizations who anticipate
applying to replicate any of the 12 following projects look first at the abstract(s), and then obtain and examine carefully
the applicable manual(s) from NCADI. If, after scrutinizing the information prepared by potential replicants,
applicants desire additional information, they may call the project they wish to replicate. Replicant organizations
will participate in Technical Assistance Workshops sponsored by CSAP. These workshops are planned to take place
within a 60-day period following publication of this announcement. 


Upon award of a Cooperative Agreement to replicate a project, a grantee may obtain further technical assistance and
training from the replicant agency. Upon request of the applicant (in the application budget), provision will be
made in the individual awards for projects funded to reimburse the replicant agency for such assistance. Negotiations
will be conducted directly between the grantee and the replicant agency. It is strongly recommended that the applicant
discuss such technical assistance with the replicant agency prior to writing the application in order to provide
an accurate estimate of the required cost.

CSAP will accept applications that attempt to replicate an identified model with as much fidelity as possible, regarding
comprehensiveness, targeted domains, setting, target population, demographics, level of staff expertise, etc.
Applicants wishing to adapt a project to specific needs in their area may do so, but should provide sufficient justification
for proposed changes.

Applicants are expected to provide a logical rationale for choosing a particular project for replication, that is,
linking this choice to an identified need for such a project in their area and proposed outcomes for the target population.

It is important that applicants understand that they are proposing not only to replicate an existing project, but
that this project is, as well, a high risk youth project. Consequently they must be prepared to address: a. Outcomes
to assess the impact of the interventions to be delivered on participating youth,

b. The process of implementing and conducting a project targeted to a high risk youth population, and

c. The process of implementing and conducting the project as a replication.

Questions that need to be addressed that pertain to High Risk Youth participant outcomes may be found in Module A, under
Recommended Approach. For this effort, CSAP invites applications that will, additionally, address the following
replication-specific questions: 

 Does the fidelity with which projects are replicated affect participant outcomes and the overall success
of the project as a replication? In what respects?

 How can lessons learned from the replicants' implementation process be applied to improve a like project?

 What impact did the availability of ancillary services and resources have on: (a) The success of the replicant
project; and (b) how closely the applicant's available resources must parallel those of the replicant in order to
conduct a successful project?

 How can the impact of such intangibles as combinations of personnel attributes and characteristics on the
success of the replicant project be measured; and how can this information be used in developing a replication? 



Evaluation:

 All applications must include a plan for documenting program implementation and performance, particularly with
regard to the replication process (process evaluation), and for measuring results (outcome evaluation), as outlined
in part IV of this notice. It is important to note that the replication requires an evaluation that exceeds the usual
evaluation requirements. The evaluation design should provide for evaluating outcomes with respect to the effect
of the intervention on participants, just as it would in any other High Risk Youth project. The process evaluation,
however, requires a two-part approach. On one level, the process evaluation would parallel the process evaluation
in the replicant project. On an additional level, data would need to be collected to ascertain how the project worked
as a replication. All applications, in their process evaluation design, should pay particular attention to documenting
implementation as it relates to the replication process.

It is the purpose of this effort to replicate promising interventions, and assess their effectiveness. Regardless
of the evaluation design of the original replicant project, the evaluation plan for this application should be rigorous
and should be designed to answer the specific questions detailed in the High Risk Youth priority area (Module A, Recommended
Approach), and in the Evaluation section of part IV of this notice.

Evaluation: 

This Announcement requires more rigor in the conceptualization, design and implementation of projects and in their
evaluation than the previous High Risk Youth Demonstration Grant Program. The goal is to achieve and document measurable
reductions in ATOD use incidence, prevalence, and related negative consequences among appropriately aged high
risk youth populations, in addition to assessing the effectiveness of specified intervention strategies in reducing
the risk factors, or enhancing the protective factors on which the project is focused.
CSAP will support only applicant projects that have a well developed and comprehensive evaluation plan. The evaluation
plan must be conceptually and procedurally integrated with the overall project, and must have both an outcome evaluation
component and a process evaluation component (discussed below).
Since the purpose for issuing this Announcement is to reduce the incidence and prevalence of ATOD use and its related
negative consequences and to assess the effectiveness of specified intervention strategies with selected high
risk youth populations, instruments should be used which will provide periodic measures of all delineated indicators.
Applicants must specify the means to be used to collect these data. Applicants are required to collect baseline data,
yearly progress report data, end of project data, and follow-up data on all indices.
The evaluation plan must present a sound methodology for the collection, storage, analysis, and interpretation
of data. The evaluation plan must utilize psychometrically sound measures and instruments for data collection.
Applicants must describe the selection of instruments to be used and must provide information about their normative
properties, including the appropriateness of their use for the culture(s) under study. The presented evaluation
methods, measures and instruments must be sensitive and relevant to the target groups of the community with respect
to age and gender distribution, reading level, and culture. The evaluation plan must also present a time-line for
carrying out all evaluation procedures.
The evaluation plan must be designed and carried out by a professional who is highly experienced in comparative evaluation
methodology, independent of the project, and able to work closely with the grantee.
A range of from fifteen to twenty-five percent of the funds available may be used for the evaluation component.

Process Evaluation 



Process evaluation is a quantitative and qualitative description of a project that documents its evolution from
inception through implementation and completion. The purpose of the process evaluation is to document what happened
in the project and what was learned, what barriers existed to inhibit implementation, what was done to overcome these
barriers, and what should be done differently in future projects. A process evaluation should also document the context
for the project, that is, how the program fit into the community and interacted with the existing relevant human service
programs and resources that were available to serve the target population. The use of resources and the acceptability
and appropriateness of the program activities for the target population to meet the project objectives should also
be addressed. Formal and on-going linkages between project objectives and program interventions should be developed
to ensure feedback and appropriate project modifications. 



Outcome Evaluation 



The purpose of the outcome evaluation is to determine the effectiveness of the intervention, and applicants must
propose an evaluation design which will allow this determination to be made. Outcome evaluation assesses whether
the project was effective in achieving its goals, objectives and activities. The plan to generate, process and analyze
data should be detailed and clearly articulated. For the purposes of this grant program, the outcome evaluation must:
(a) Identify the specific factors to be addressed according to the terms of the model selected to conceptualize the
program; 

(b) Specify the proposed interventions to be implemented detailing frequency and intensity of exposure of each 
intervention proposed, per member of target population; 

(c) Specify the desired outcomes in relation to both the identified factors (generally these are intermediate outcome
measures), and the selected interventions; 

(d) Identify the instruments for measuring the factors to be addressed and for monitoring changes related to desired
outcomes and submit copies of any non-standard instruments; 

(e) Specify the indicators of ATOD use to be monitored; 

(f) Identify the instruments to be used for gathering those 
measurements related to ATOD indicators; 

(g) Describe the plan for data collection, data processing and data analysis. 

The outcome evaluation design should be as rigorous as possible. Whenever feasible, the outcome evaluation design
should employ a time series design that allows for comparisons within and between control or matched comparison groups.
For capturing changes at the community level, a pre-post with repeated measures design, for community indicators,
is acceptable. For measuring changes at the individual/group level, control or comparison groups, utilizing either
random assignment or matched comparison, should be used. However, if an applicant chooses another design without
the use of a randomized control or matched comparison group, the applicant must describe the alternate design in detail
and explain the method for determining the effectiveness of the intervention. If the target group(s) is to be randomly
selected, indicate the method for randomization of target and control group. If a matched comparison group is to be
used, detail the method for matching the groups. In all cases, applicants must include a discussion of plans to deal
with attrition, accretion, and other threats to internal and external validity. All applicants must also collect
baseline data, yearly progress report data, and end of project data on all indices. In accordance with the age guidelines
provided in the Modules, these data should be designed to answer questions that include, but are not limited to, the
following: (Additional questions specific to each priority area are included in the Recommended Approach section
of each module).

1. What measurable changes have occurred as a result of the combination of intervention strategies regarding the
number of new users in the target population, compared to the control/comparison group, for each of the following
substances:

 Alcoholic beverages;

 All types of tobacco products; and

 Other drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, crack/cocaine, inhalants, steroids, heroin, etc.?

2. What measurable changes have occurred as a result of the combination of intervention strategies regarding the
number of users in the target population, compared to the control/comparison group, who have used each of the following
substances in the past month:

 Alcoholic beverages; 
 All types of tobacco products; and 
 Other drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, crack/cocaine, steroids, inhalants, heroin, etc.?

3. What measurable changes have occurred as a result of the combination of intervention strategies regarding the
amount of regular use of alcoholic beverages, all types of tobacco products, and other drugs such as marijuana, cocaine,
crack/cocaine, steroids, inhalants, heroin, etc., by the users in the target population, as compared to the control/comparison
group?

4. What measurable changes have occurred as a result of the combination of intervention strategies regarding the
numbers of the target population compared to the control/comparison group, who disapprove of the use of alcoholic
beverages, tobacco products, and other drug use? 

5. What measurable changes have occurred as a result of the combination of intervention strategies regarding participants'
and control/comparison groups' perceptions of harm associated with ATOD use? 

6. What measurable changes have occurred as a result of the combination of intervention strategies regarding the
target population's, compared to the control/comparison group's, self-reported involvement in physical fighting,
victimization, assault injuries, aggressive behavior, carrying and usage of weapons, and activities that bring
youth in contact with the juvenile/criminal justice system? 

Grantees will be required to collect uniform baseline and yearly data on some indicators using standardized instruments
common to all grantees. Details regarding the specific instruments, data collection and analysis, aggregation
to group, and procedures for transmitting the results to CSAP will be provided at the first grantee meeting following
award. OMB clearance will be obtained for these instruments. 

Substance abuse and related problems have frequently been measured through surveys and archival indicator data.
CSAP encourages applicants to make use of such available data in their communities, such as crime statistics and Drug
Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) data. 



CSAP Cross-Site Evaluation: 

In addition to the requirement for individual project evaluation, CSAP is planning to conduct a cross-site evaluation
of the High Risk Youth Demonstration Grant Program. All applicants must provide written assurance that they will
cooperate fully in the conduct of the cross-site evaluation. 



Review Process: 

Applications accepted for review will be assigned, at the central receipt point (Division of Research Grants, NIH),
to an Initial Review Group (IRG) composed primarily of non-Federal experts. Applications will be reviewed by the
IRG for technical merit in accordance with established PHS/SAMHSA peer review procedures for grants. Notification
of the IRG's recommendation will be sent to the applicant upon completion of the initial review. In addition, the IRG
recommendations on the technical merit of applications will undergo a second level of review by the appropriate advisory
council, whose review may be based on policy considerations as well as technical merit. Applications may be considered
for funding only if the advisory council concurs with the IRG's recommendation for approval.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Availability of the Agency Draft Recovery Plan for White Irisette for Review and Comment</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of document availability and public comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of an agency draft recovery
plan the white irisette (

Sisyrinchium dichotomum

). This rare perennial herb grows on circumneutral soils on a few scattered mountain slopes in western North Carolina
and northern South Carolina. Only seven populations of white irisette are currently known to exist. The Service solicits
review and comments from the public on this draft plan.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Restoring endangered or threatened animals or plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining members
of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery effort,
the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States. Recovery
plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, established criteria for recognizing
the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures
needed.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) (Act), requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that a public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.

The primary species considered in this draft recovery plan is white irisette (

Sisyrinchium dichotomum

). The areas of emphasis for recovery actions are mountain slopes with circumneutral soils in Polk and Rutherford
Counties, North Carolina, and Greenville County, South Carolina. Habitat protection, reintroduction, and preservation
of genetic material are major objectives of this recovery plan.



Public Comments Solicited



The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to approval of the plan.



Authority



The authority for this action is Section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f).

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Land Management, Interior, Susanville District Office, California, [CA-020-5101-10-B039;
CACA-31406, NVN-57250].



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement is published in accordance with the regulations
under Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1501.7. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Susanville District
will, together with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) direct the preparation of a joint Environmental
Impact Statement and Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR) for a proposed 345 kilovolt electric power transmission
line. The joint EIS/EIR is to be prepared by a third party contractor. The BLM will be the lead Federal agency, and with
the CPUC as the lead California State agency will produce this joint EIS/EIR to satisfy the requirements of the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), respectively. The following
Federal agencies have indicated that they will participate as cooperating agencies in the preparation of the EIS/EIR.
U.S. Forest Service (Modoc and Toiyabe National Forests); Department of Defense (Sierra Army Depot); U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service; Bureau of Indian Affairs (Sacramento Area Office); Bonneville Power Administration.



The EIS/EIR will assess the environmental impacts of the approval, construction, operation and maintenance of a
345,000 volt (345KV) electric power transmission line approximately 160 miles long, running from the vicinity of
Alturas, California through Modoc, Lassen, and Sierra Counties, California, through Washoe County, Nevada to the
vicinity of Reno, Nevada. The project has been proposed by the Sierra Pacific Power Company of Reno, Nevada, and is
referred to as the Alturas Intertie. The project would affect Federal, State and private lands. Possible alternatives
to the project include: (1) Project and route alternatives presented in the proponent's application; (2) no action
or project denial(s) alternative; (3) approval of one or more of the proposed alternative projects; (4) any reasonable
project and route alternatives identified as a result of the scoping; and (5) combinations of any of the above.

The National Environmental Policy Act requires the BLM to take into account the environmental impacts that could
result from a major Federal action. The CPUC is required to consider the same potential impacts of a proposed action
within the State of California under the California Environmental Quality Act. The EIS/EIR we are preparing will
give the BLM and the CPUC the information needed to make a decision based on understanding of environmental consequences
and take actions that protect, restore and enhance the environment. NEPA (and CEQA) also requires us to discover and
address concerns the public and other governmental agencies may have about a proposed project. This process is called
``scoping''. The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EIS/EIR on the important environmental
issues, and to separate those issues that are not significant and do not require detailed study. the EIS/EIR will also
evaluate possible alternatives to the project, or portions of the project, and make recommendations on how to avoid
or lessen environmental impacts of the project.

The purpose of this notice is to invite members of the public, affected Federal, State, and local agencies, any affected
Indian tribes, the proponent of the action, and other interested persons to participate in the scoping process for
this project by providing written and verbal comments or recommendations concerning the issues to be analyzed in
the EIS/EIR.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Bureau of Land Management Susanville District Manager will be responsible for issuing the Record of Decision
for public (BLM) land, and the Forest Supervisors for the Modoc National Forest and the Toiyabe National Forest will
be responsible for issuing Records of Decision for National Forest System lands.



Sierra Pacific Power Company (SPPCo) of Reno, Nevada, has submitted right-of-way applications to the Bureau of Land
Management and the United States Forest Service for the purpose of constructing, operating and maintaining a 345KV
electric power transmission line from Alturas to Reno. Permits would also be needed from the California Public Utilities
Commission and the Public Service Commission of Nevada. SPPCo proposes to buld this line to provide increased reliability
and electric power capability to the Reno/Lake Tahoe area. The line would tap into a Bonneville Power Administration
electric transmission line north of Alturas, CA, and run approximately 160 miles south to tie into the existing SPPCo
electric power grid near Reno, NV. The proposed route generally parallels U.S. Highway 395 from Alturas to the vicinity
of Wendel, CA, then runs east of Honey Lake and Herlong, CA, then south in the vicinity of Highway 395 again to the Reno
area. This proposed route parallels the proposed Tuscarora gas pipeline route for much of the distance between Alturas
and Herlong. The proposal includes the construction of two new electrical substations, one northwest of Alturas
and one near Bordertown, Nevada. The existing SPPCo North Valley Road substation, near McCarran Blvd. in Reno, would
be improved to allow a tie-in by the new 345KV line. SPPCo proposes to build the powerline using tubular steel H-Frame
structures, made of a steel which will weather to a dark brown color. The structures would support six non-reflective
(``non-specular'') stranded aluminum/steel conducting wires (one inch in diameter), arranged in three pairs of
two wires, plus two steel ``shield'' wires which protect the line from lightning strikes. The shield wires would be
3/8
'
' diameter stranded steel wires with fiberoptic cables inside the wires for SPPCo transmission operational
communications.

The proposed line route would follow existing dirt and paved roads to the extent possible. New road construction would
be limited as much as possible, and there are likely to be areas where the structures would be installed using helicopters.

<DOCTITLE>Tongue River Railroad Co.; Construction and Operation of Additional Rail Line in Rosebud and Big Horn Counties, MT</DOCTITLE>


In the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) served July 17, 1992, the Commission's Section of Environmental
Analysis (SEA) addressed the Tongue River Railroad Company's (TRRC's) proposal to construct and operate a 41-mile
rail line from Ashland to Decker, Montana (the Extension). The proposed rail line would serve as an extension to TRRC's
already-approved but not yet built 89-mile rail line from Miles City to Ashland, Montana. 
In the DEIS, SEA preliminarily concluded that because of the environmental impacts associated with TRRC's proposed
route, the Four Mile Creek Alternative would be environmentally preferable should the Commission decide to grant
TRRC's construction application. However, based on comments to the DEIS, SEA's further investigation, TRRC's alignment
changes to the proposed route, and a more comprehensive Mitigation Plan, SEA now believes that the Four Mile Creek
Alternative would have more adverse consequences on the environment than TRRC's current proposed route. Generally,
when a substantial change is made to the approach a Federal agency has taken in a DEIS, the rules of the Council on Environmental
Quality implementing the National Environmental Policy Act require the preparation of a Supplement to the DEIS [40
CFR 1502.9(c)]. Because SEA no longer believes that the Four Mile Creek Alternative would be the environmentally
preferable route if the Commission grants TRRC's application, SEA has prepared this Supplement to the DEIS (Supplement).

The ``no build'' alternative has been carefully considered by SEA. This alternative would be environmentally neutral
since construction and operation of the proposed Extension and the related environmental impacts would not occur.
Because TRRC already has obtained Commission authority to construct and operate a rail line between Miles City and
Ashland, TRRC would be able to serve new mines in the project area even if the Commission denied the proposed Extension.
Moreover, with the ``no build'' alternative, the present movement of coal from the Decker mines would be unaffected
because the Burlington Northern Railroad is already providing service to these mines via an alternate route. In sum,
the ``no build'' alternative would preserve the environmental status quo. 
SEA invites comments on the Supplement. SEA specifically requests comments on (1) the environmental preferability
of TRRC's current proposed route versus the Four Mile Creek Alternative; (2) the ``no build'' alternative; and (3)
any other feasible alternatives. These comments should provide as much substantive information and supporting
evidence as possible. 
SEA will consider all comments to this Supplement and the prior comments to the DEIS before issuing a Final Environmental
Impact Statement (FEIS). The FEIS will take into account all the comments received during the entire environmental
review process and include SEA's final environmental recommendations to the Commission. The Commission will then
consider the FEIS and the entire environmental record in making its decision in this proceeding. 
Send an original and 10 copies of comments referring to 
Finance Docket No. 30186 (Sub No. 2) to: Dana White, Section of Environmental Analysis, room 3214, Interstate Commerce
Commission, Washington, DC 20423. Questions regarding this Supplement or requests for copies of the Supplement
should be directed to Ms. White or Elaine K. Kaiser, Chief, Section of Environmental Analysis at (202) 927-6214.
TDD for hearing impaired: (202) 927-5721. 
Also, a copy of the comments should be sent to TRRC's representative: Mr. Thomas Ebzery, Village Center I, suite 165,
1500 Poly Drive, Billings, MT 59102.

licensee) to partially withdraw its May 8, 1991, application as supplemented by letters dated March 6, 1992, and January
28, 1993, for proposed amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF-38 for the Waterford Steam Electric
Station, Unit 3, located in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana.

The amendment revised the Technical Specifications (TSs) by revising the fuel oil amounts to the feed and storage
tanks for the emergency diesel generators, clarifying the testing for the interconnecting piping, and revising
the specific gravity of the fuel oil.

The Commission had previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 26, 1991, (56 FR 29274) as revised April 14, 1993, (58 FR 19478). However, by supplemental letter dated March
6, 1992, the licensee partially withdrew the proposed change pertaining to the revised frequency of testing of the
diesel generator.

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated May 8, 1991, as supplemented
by letters dated March 6, 1992, (which partially withdrew the application for license amendment), and January 28,
1993. The above documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the University of New Orleans Library,
Louisiana Collection, Lakefront, New Orleans, Louisiana 70122.

<DOCTITLE>Georgia Power Co., et al.; Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License </DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Commission) has issued Amendment No. 132 to Facility Operating License
No. NFP-5 issued to Georgia Power Company, et al. (the licensee), which revised the Technical Specifications
for operation of the Edwin I. Hatch Nuclear Plant, Unit 2, located in Appling County, Georgia. The amendment is effective
as of the date of issuance. 

The amendment modified the Technical Specifications (TS) to permit an increase in the allowable leak rate for the
main steam isolation valves (MSIVs) and deleted the TS requirements for the MSIV leakage control system. 

The application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as
amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required
by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment.


Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity for Hearing in connection with this action was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on November 5, 1993 (58 FR 59081). No request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this
notice. 

The Commission has prepared an Environmental Assessment related to the action and has determined not to prepare an
environmental impact statement. Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission has concluded that the
issuance of this amendment will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 9780).


For further details with respect to the action see: (1) The application for amendment dated October 1, 1993, as revised
January 6, 1994, and supplemented February 3, 1994, (2) Amendment No. 132 to License No. NPF-5, (3) the Commission's
related Safety Evaluation, and (4) the Commission's Environmental Assessment. All of these items are available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,
DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at Appling County Public Library, 301 City Hall Drive, Baxley,
Georgia 31513.

<DOCTITLE>Carolina Power and Light Co.; Issuance of Amendment Materials License No. SNM-2502</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has issued Amendment No. 10 to Materials License No. SNM-2502
held by the Carolina Power and Light Company for the receipt and storage of spent fuel at the H.B. Robinson Independent
Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI), located on the H.B. Robinson Steam Electric Plant Unit 2 site, Darlington
County, South Carolina. The amendment is effective as of the date of issuance.

The amendment deletes the requirement to inspect the interior of the Horizontal Storage Module (HSM) at the ISFSI
located at the H.B. Robinson Steam Electric Plant, Unit 2 site, as requested by the licensee by letter dated November
1, 1993.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 72.56, the Commission has determined that the granting of the amendment is authorized by law and
will not endanger life or property or the common defense and security and is otherwise in the public interest.

The amendment complies with the standards of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's
rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules
and regulations in 10 CFR chapter I, which are set forth in the exemption and license amendment. Prior public notice
of the amendment was not required since the amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration and does
not present a genuine issue as to whether the health and safety of the public will be significantly affected.

The Commission has determined that the issuance of the amendment will not result in any significant environmental
impact and that, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(c)(11), an environmental assessment need not be prepared in connection
with issuance of the amendment.

For further details with respect to this action, see: (1) Amendment No. 10 to Materials License No. SNM-2502,
and (2) the Commission's letter to the licensee dated March 17, 1994, and (3) the request for amendment dated November
1, 1993. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman
Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC, and at the Local Public Document Room at the Nuclear Information Depository,
Hartsville Memorial Library, 220 N. Fifth Street, Hartsville, South Carolina 29550.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Stock Exchange, Incorporated; Application for Unlisted Trading Privileges
in an Over-the-Counter Issue and To Withdraw Unlisted Privileges in an Over-the-Counter Issue</DOCTITLE>


March 17, 1994.


On March 11, 1994, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX''), submitted an application for unlisted trading privileges
(``UTP'') pursuant to section 12(f)(1)(C) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') in the following over-the-counter
(``OTC'') security, 

i.e.

, a security not registered under section 12(b) of the Act.




The above-referenced issue is being applied for as a replacement for the following security, which forms a portion
of the Exchange's program in which OTC securities are being traded pursuant to the granting of UTP.
The CHX also applied to withdraw UTP pursuant to section 12(f)(4) of the Act for the following issue:




A replacement issue is being requested due to lack of trading activity.


Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit, on or before April 7, 1994, written comments, data, views and arguments
concerning this application. Persons desiring to make written comments should file three copies with the Secretary,
Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549.
Commentators are asked to address whether they believe the requested grant of UTP as well as the withdrawal of UTP would
be consistent with section 12(f)(2), which requires that, in considering an application for extension or withdrawal
of UTP in an OTC security, the Commission consider, among other matters, the public trading activity in such security,
the character of such trading, the impact of such extension on the existing markets for such security, and the desirability
of removing impediments to and the progress that has been made toward the development of a national market system.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule
Change Relating to Filing Requirements for Use of Mutual Fund Rankings and Elimination of Sunset Provisions in Pre-Filing
Requirements of Advertising and Government Securities Rules</DOCTITLE>


March 17, 1994.


On February 7, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'')
 a proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and rule 19b-4 thereunder.
 The proposed rule change amends Article III, section 35 of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice
 and section 8 of the NASD Government Securities Rules
 to: (1) Require filing of advertisements and sales literature relating to investment companies; (2) made the pre-filing
requirement of Article III, subsection 35(c)(2) of the Rules of Fair Practice and in subsection 8(c)(1)(B) of the
Government Securities Rules permanent; and (3) properly reference the ``Advertising Regulation Department''
throughout Article III, section 35 of the Rules of Fair Practice and the Government Securities Rules. 








Notice of the proposed rule change, together with the substance of the proposal, was provided by issuance of a Commission
release (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33603, February 8, 1994) and by publication in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 7282, February 15, 1994). One comment letter favoring the proposed rule change was received. This order approves
the proposed rule change. 
As the number of mutual funds has increased substantially in recent years, so has the number of mutual fund ranking
entities (``Ranking Entities''). Ranking Entities, as well as mutual funds and fund affiliates, categorize and
rank mutual funds by, for example, fund type, performance over a given period of years, total return, standardized
yield calculated pursuant to Commission rules, the variations in sales charges, and risk/reward. References to
such rankings in mutual fund advertisements and sales literature have also increased substantially in recent years
as members have attempted to boost the sale of fund shares by touting the performance of various mutual funds. 
The Commission believes that it is important that the NASD review and regulate the use of ranking materials and the
development of customized rankings in order to prevent the misleading use of such rankings. The NASD, therefore,
has proposed to amend Article III, section 35(c) of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice to require that copies of mutual
fund rankings and the data on which the rankings are based be submitted to the Association's Advertising Regulation
Department for review. The proposed rule change requires members filing advertisements or sales literature for
review which use or incorporate mutual fund rankings to include in the filing a copy of the ranking or comparison.





Subsection 35(c)(1) will require that any member that files any investment company advertisements or items of sales
literature pursuant to subsection 35(c)(1) which include or incorporate rankings or comparisons of the investment
company with other investment companies, shall include a copy of the ranking or comparison used in the advertising
or sales literature. The requirements of this provision will permit the staff to immediately determine whether the
use of the ranking complies with the Guidelines, and avoid the need for the NASD staff to research the ranking or attempt
to obtain a copy of the source information in order to verify the accuracy of the material. 
The proposed rule change amends subsection 35(c)(2), which currently requires certain advertisements to be filed
by members 10 days prior to use, to require such pre-use filing for all investment company advertisements or items
of sales literature which incorporates rankings or comparisons of the investment company with other investment
companies where the ranking or comparison is not generally published or is the creation, directly or indirectly,
of the investment company, its underwriter or an affiliate.
 While the NASD is concerned about permitting ranking categories to be created by investment companies or their affiliates,
rather than by a Ranking Entity, customized ranking nonetheless may provide meaningful information to the investor.
Such filing also must include a copy of the data, ranking or comparison on which the ranking or comparison is based.





The NASD also is amending Article III, subsection 35(c)(2) of the Rules of Fair Practice and subsection 8(c)(1)(B)
of the Government Securities Rules to eliminate sunset provisions relating to collateralized mortgage obligations
(``CMOs''). This change would make the pre-filing requirement for CMO advertisements permanent. 
Finally, the NASD is modifying references to the Advertising Department to reference the Advertising Regulation
Department in Article III, Section 35 of the Rules of Fair Practice and the Government Securities Rules. 
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of section 15A(b)(6) of the Act
 because it ensures that the use of rankings of investment companies in advertising and sales literature is accurate
and presents investors with fair and meaningful data upon which to make an informed investment decision. With respect
to the proposed elimination of the sunset provisions for the prefiling of CMO advertisements, the Commission believes
that the positive regulatory benefits seen since implementation of the provision, i.e., the reduction in misleading
advertising, warrants making the prefiling requirement provision permanent. Finally, the clarifications referring
to the phrase ``Advertising Regulation Department,'' rather than ``Advertising Department'' will reduce unnecessary
confusion among NASD members. 






It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that File No. SR-NASD-93-66 be, and hereby is approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).

Consideration of Defense Articles and Defense Services Marketing License Requests for South Africa 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of State.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Public notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act, notice is hereby given that the Department of State will on a case-by-case
basis consider licenses and approvals for (1) marketing proposals to sell United States Munitions List items to South
Africa and for (2) export of the minimum basic operational and maintenance data necessary to support such proposals.
However, exports of defense articles and services subject to the United Nations arms embargo on South Africa will
not be approved while the embargo remains in force.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

South Africa is currently under a mandatory arms export embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council, and
is a proscribed destination for exports of defense articles and services pursuant to 22 CFR 126.1. However, it is contemplated
that the embargo may end once certain events take place. Because of this, the Department of State will now consider,
on a case-by-case basis, granting licenses and approvals for proposals to sell defense articles and defense services
to South Africa and to export the minimum amount of basic operations and maintenance technical data necessary to support
such proposals, so long as assurances are received that this data will be used in support of such proposals and for no
other purpose. Approvals for the export of the aforementioned technical data will only be granted if the Director,
Office of Defense Trade Controls, receives reliable assurances from the foreign end-user that it will only use the
technical data for evaluation and informational purposes related to the proposed sale, and not for any other purposes.
The Department of State will not grant licenses for the actual sale or export of defense articles and defense services
(other than for the aforementioned technical data and for exceptions in accordance with current policy as provided
for in  126.1(c)) while the U.N. arms embargo against South Africa and U.S. regulations prohibiting the export
to South Africa of defense articles and services are in force. 




Section 126.1(e) also provides that any person who knows or has reason to know of a proposal to sell or transfer to a country
referred to in  126.1, or to any person acting on its behalf, any defense articles, defense services or technical
data subject to the ITAR must immediately inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Effective immediately, this
requirement no longer applies to South Africa. However, the obligation to inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls
of actual sales or transfers to South Africa remains in place. 

The licenses and approvals subject to this policy include proposals, within the meaning of 22 CFR 126.1(e), to sell
or transfer defense articles and services. This policy also covers licenses and approvals to export the minimum basic
technical data in the form of operations and maintenance information related to a defense article or service which
is necessary to support a sales proposal. For this purpose, a proposal is defined as the communication of information
in sufficient detail to permit an intended purchaser to decide either to acquire the particular equipment in question
or to enter into a manufacturing license agreement or technical assistance agreement. This would include a presentation
which describes the equipment's performance characteristics, price, and probable availability for delivery.
This policy does not cover technical data which discloses the details of design, development, production or manufacture
of any defense item. Nor does it permit the use, with respect to articles originating in or for export to South Africa,
of any exemptions except those already permitted by  126.1 (i.e.,   123.17 and 125.4(b)(13)).
Furthermore, the requirements of  126.8, regarding proposals to foreign persons relating to significant
military equipment, remain in place. 

This action has been taken pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) and  126.7 of
the ITAR in furtherance of the foreign policy of the United States.

<DOCTITLE>Approval of Noise Compatibility Program; Wittman Regional Airport Oshkosh, WI</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings on the noise compatibility program submitted
by Winnebago County under the provisions of title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-193)
and 14 CFR part 150. These findings are made in recognition of the description of federal and nonfederal responsibilities
in Senate Report No. 96-52 (1980). On August 18, 1993 the FAA determined that the noise exposure maps submitted
by Winnebago County under part 150 were in compliance with applicable requirements. On February 14, 1994, the Administrator
approved the Wittman Regional Airport noise compatibility program. All of the recommendations of the program were
approved.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the noise compatibility program for Wittman Regional
Airport, effective February 14, 1994. 



Under section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator who has previously submitted a noise exposure map may submit to the FAA a noise compatibility program
that sets forth the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing noncompatible
land uses and prevention of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure maps.
The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local
communities, government agencies, airport users, and FAA personnel.

Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part
150 is a local program, not a federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor
with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR part 150
program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in part 150 and the Act and is limited to
the following determinations:

a. The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR part 150;

b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land
uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses;

c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against
types or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted
by the Federal Government; and

d. Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program
without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air
traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed
by law.

Specific limitations with respect to FAA's approval of an airport noise compatibility program are delineated in
FAR part 150,  150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under Federal,
state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action
or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request
may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the
FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the
program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where federal funding is sought, requests for project
grants must be submitted to the FAA Minneaposis_Airports District Office in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Winnebago County submitted to the FAA on December 29, 1992 the noise exposure maps, descriptions, and other documentation
produced during the noise compatibility planning study conducted from April 1985 through December 1992. The Wittman
Regional Airport noise exposure maps were determined by FAA to be in compliance with applicable requirements on August
18, 1993. Notice of this determination was published in the 

Federal Register 

on September 9, 1993.

The Wittman Regional Airport study contains a proposed noise compatibility program comprised of actions designed
for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion to
the year 1997. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a noise compatibility program as
described in section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on August 18, 1993 and was required by
a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other than the use of new flight procedures
for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-day period shall be deemed to be an
approval of such program.

The submitted program contained thirteen (13) proposed actions for noise mitigation on and off the Airport. The FAA
completed its review and determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR part 150 have
been satisfied. The overall program, therefore, was approved by the Assistant Administrator for Airports effective
February 14, 1994.

Outright approval was granted for all five (5) of the land use program elements. They included dedication of navigational
easements, acquisition of land, recommendations for zoning, programming of public improvements and implementation
of a public information program. The one (1) continuing program measure was also approved. It provided for future
updating of the part 150 study.

The seven (7) noise abatement measures were approved as voluntary measures. They included a runway use program, use
of departure and arrival procedures and a traffic pattern procedure.

These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Administrator on February 14,
1994. The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and the documents comprising the submittal, are
available for review at the FAA office listed above and at the administrative offices of Winnebago County.




Issued in Minneapolis, Minnesota on March 1, 1994.

ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its determination that the noise exposure maps submitted by
the city of Austin for the New Austin Airport at Bergstrom Air Force Base under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation
Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-193) and 14 CFR part 150 are in compliance with applicable requirements.
The FAA also announces that it is reviewing a proposed noise compatibility program that was submitted for the New Austin
Airport at Bergstrom Air Force Base under Part 150 in conjunction with the noise exposure maps and that this program
will be approved or disapproved on or before August 10, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA finds that the noise exposure maps submitted for the New Austin Airport at Bergstrom
Air Force Base are in compliance with applicable requirements of part 150, effective February 11, 1994. Further,
FAA is reviewing a proposed noise compatibility program for that airport which will be approved or disapproved on
or before August 10, 1994. This notice also announces the availability of this program for public review and comment.




Under section 103 of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the
Act''), an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which
depict noncompatible land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations,
and the ways in which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation
with interested and affected parties in the local community, Government agencies, and persons using the airport.

An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by the FAA to be in compliance with the requirements
of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150, promulgated pursuant to Title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility
program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing
noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses.

The city of Austin submitted to the FAA on February 11, 1994, noise exposure maps, descriptions and other documentation
which were produced during the FAR part 150 Noise Study, February 1994. It was requested that the FAA review this material
as the noise exposure maps, as described in section 103(a)(1) of the Act, and that the noise mitigation measures, to
be implemented jointly by the airport and surrounding communities, be approved as a noise compatibility program
under section 104(b) of the Act.

The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by the city of Austin.
The specific maps under consideration are Figure 10.1_1993 Existing Conditions (NEM) following page 10.2 and Figure
10.2_1998 NEM following page 10.3 in the submission.

The FAA has determined that these maps for the New Austin airport at Bergstrom Air Force Base are in compliance with
applicable requirements. This determination is effective on February 11, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport
operator's noise exposure maps is limited to a finding that the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures
contained in Appendix A of FAR Part 150. Such determination does not constitute approval of the applicant's data,
information, or plans, or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility program or to fund the implementation of that
program.

If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted
on a noise exposure map submitted under section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way
in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting
the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions
of Section 107 of the Act.These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and plannng responsibilities
of local Government.These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under Part 150 or through FAA's review
of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detailed overlaying of noise exposure contours onto
the map depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator which submitted those maps,
or with those public agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under Section 103 of the Act.
The FAA has relied on the certification by the airport operator, under  150.21 of FAR Part 150, that the statutorily
required consultation has been accomplished.

The FAA has formally received the noise compatibility program for the New Austin Airport at Bergstrom Air Force Base
also effective on February 11, 1994 Preliminary review of the submitted material indicates that it conforms to the
requirements for the submittal of noise compatibility programs, but that further review will be necessary prior
to approval or disapproval of the program. The formal review period, limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will be
completed on or before August 10, 1994.

The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR part 150,  150.33. The primary
considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviation safety,
create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing
existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses.

Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program with specific reference to these factors. All comments,
other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable.
Copies of the noise exposure maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed noise compatibility program
are available for examination at the following locations:

Notice of determination by NHTSA that nonconforming 1990 Mercedes-Benz 300CE passenger cars are eligible for importation.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the determination by NHTSA that 1990 Mercedes-Benz 300CE passenger cars not originally manufactured
to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards are eligible for importation into the United
States because they are substantially similar to a vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States and certified by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards (the U.S.-certified
version of the 1990 Mercedes-Benz 300CE), and they are capable of being readily modified to conform to the standards.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Background



Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
must be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.

Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The DOT Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG) is prepared and distributed, without charge, to fire, police, and other
public emergency response entities throughout the United States. Recently, after more than one million copies of
the 1993 edition of the ERG were distributed, several errors and omissions were discovered. While none were considered
sufficient to cause concern in regard to a potential for misdirected emergency response actions, RSPA believes it
appropriate to publish this advisory notice to alleviate concerns that have been raised. The corrections in this
notice apply to ERG's printed as of January 29, 1994. Subsequent printings of the ERG have been corrected. The corrections
affect the ERG's ID Number Index, Name of Material Index, and Table of Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances.
Corrections to the ID Number Index (The Yellow-border Pages of the Guidebook) are as follows:


1. For the entry ``1058 12 LIQUEFIED NONFLAMMABLE GAS charged with nitrogen, carbon dioxide or air'', revise ``dioxide''
to read ``dioxide.''
2. For the entry ``1202 27 GASOLINE'', revise ``1202'' to read ``1203.''
3. Add the entry ``2031 44 NITRIC ACID, other than red fuming with more than 70% nitric acid'' in the appropriate alpha-numeric

4. Add the entry ``2031 44 NITRIC ACID, other than red fuming with not more than 70% nitric acid'' in the appropriate
alpha-numeric order.

5. For the entry ``2742 57 ISOBUTYL CHLOROFOMATE'', revise ``CHLOROFOMATE'' to read ``CHLOROFORMATE.''
6. Add the entry ``3077 31 HAZARDOUS WASTE, solid, n.o.s.'' in the appropriate alpha-numeric order.
7. Add the entry ``3082 31 HAZARDOUS WASTE, liquid, n.o.s.'' in the appropriate alpha-numeric order.
Corrections to the Name of Material Index (The Blue-border Pages of the Guidebook) are as follows:
1. For the entry ``GASOLINE 27 1202'', revise ``1202'' to read ``1203.''
2. Add the entry ``HAZARDOUS WASTE, liquid, n.o.s. 31 3082'' in the appropriate alphabetical order.
3. Add the entry ``HAZARDOUS WASTE, solid, n.o.s. 31 3077'' in the appropriate alphabetical order.
4. For the entry ``ISOBUTYL CHLOROFOMATE 57 2742'', revise ``CHLOROFOMATE'' to read ``CHLOROFORMATE.''
5. Add the entry ``NITRIC ACID, other than red fuming with more than 70% nitric acid 44 2031'' in the appropriate alphabetical
order.
6. Add the entry ``NITRIC ACID, other than red fuming with not more than 70% nitric acid 44 2031'' in the appropriate
alphabetical order.
7. For the entry ``TETRAETHYL DITHIOPRYOPHOSPHATE and gases, mixtures, or in solution (LC50 more than 200 ppm but
not more than 5000 ppm) 15 1703'', revise ``DITHIOPRYOPHOSPHATE'' to read ``DITHIOPYROPHOSPHATE.''

<DOCTITLE>Customer-Owned Service Lines </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>

 Research and Special Programs Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of public meeting. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) invites representatives of industry, state and local government,
and the public to an open meeting on the safety of customer-owned service lines. The purpose of this meeting is to gather
information on the extent to which lack of maintenance of customer-owned service lines raises safety concerns, and
on how to address these concerns, including the need for any legislative changes or regulatory action. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 115(b) of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (the Act, Pub. L. 102-508; October 24, 1992), requires the Department
of Transportation to conduct a review of Federal, State and local rules, policies, procedures and other measures
with respect to the safety of customer-owned natural gas service lines to determine their effectiveness. In a Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) published February 3, 1994 (59 FR 5168), RSPA defined a customer-owned service line
as a pipeline that transports gas from a service line to an exterior wall of a building or end use equipment. These lines
are commonly called ``yard lines'' of ``fuel lines.'' Similarly, ``farm taps'' are customer-owned service lines
that begin at a customer meter, usually adjacent to a gas transmission line, and run to a single consumer. 



In performing this review, the Department is to consider the extent to which lack of maintenance of customer-owned
service lines raises safety concerns. Additional factors to be considered are State and local law, including law
governing private property and rights, and State pipeline safety regulation of distribution operators; the views
of State and local regulatory authorities; available accident information; costs; and civil liability implications
of distribution operators taking responsibility for customer-owned service lines. 

The Department is also to consider whether the customer-owned service line maintenance information regulations
it is required to issue pursuant to section 115(a) of the Act sufficiently address safety risks and concerns involving
such lines. RSPA published the proposed maintenance information regulations in an NPRM on February 3, 1994 (59 FR
5168). The NPRM proposes to require operators of natural gas or petroleum gas pipelines that do not maintain their
customer-owned service lines up to building walls to advise their customers of the requirements for maintenance
of those lines, any resources known to the operator that could aid customers, and the potential hazards of not maintaining
service lines. 

To begin its review, RSPA sent out a survey to the directors of state pipeline safety offices asking for information
on the above-described matters. After careful review of the responses, RSPA determined additional information
is needed to determine if lack of maintenance of customer-owned service lines raises safety concerns and how any concerns
should be addressed, including need for legislative and regulatory changes. Accordingly, a public meeting will
be held to collect this information. RSPA will provide preliminary results from its survey at this meeting. 

RSPA is seeking comment on any of the above-described matters and, in particular, is requesting comment on the following
questions:

(1) Are distribution and transmission operators in favor of assuming responsibility over customer-owned service
lines? If not, why not? 

(2) What will be the costs of requiring operators to maintain all customer-owned service lines? 

(3) What are the civil liability implications of operators being required to maintain these lines? If operators were
required to maintain customer-owned service lines, would this requirement conflict with state and local laws? 

(4) What is the accident history of customer-owned lines in terms of incidents, injuries, fatalities, and property
damage? 

What alternatives are there to regulations requiring operators to maintain customer-owned lines? 

(5) What methods are being used, and to what extent, to inform customers of how to maintain customer-owned service
lines, and the hazards of not maintaining these lines? Are these methods effective in addressing the safety risks
of these lines? 

(6) What are the safety concerns raised by lack of maintenance on customer-owned lines? 

Interested persons are invited to attend the meeting and present oral or written statements on the matters set for
the meeting. Any person who wishes to speak should notify Marvin Fell at the above address. Please estimate the time
that will be needed to speak. RSPA requests the right to limit the time of each speaker, if necessary, to ensure that
everyone who requests an opportunity to speak is given one. Interested parties that are not scheduled to comment will
have an opportunity to comment only after approval of the meeting officer.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Authority





The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), Department of Commerce, serves as the
President's principal adviser on telecommunications and information policy. NTIA's functions were codified as
part of the Telecommunications Authorization Act of 1992, Public Law No. 102-538, 106 Stat. 3533, 47 U.S.C.
901-04 (1993).



The National Endowment for Children's Educational Television was established by The Children's Television Act
of 1990, Public Law No. 101-437, 104 Stat. 996 (1990) (codified at 47 U.S.C. 394 (1991)).



Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA)

Program Description





NECET Background





NECET funds are intended to support the creation and production of children's television programming that is specifically
directed toward the development of fundamental intellectual skills. In so doing, NECET's efforts are intended to
supplement children's educational programming that is funded by other governmental entities.



Congress directed that NECET be administered by the Secretary of Commerce. The Secretary, in turn, has delegated
this responsibility to the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information, who serves as the Administrator
of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).



The Children's Television Act of 1990 stipulates that, during the first two years following project completion,
NECET-funded programming may be offered for distribution only to noncommercial public television stations. After
the initial two-year period, NECET-funded programming may be made available to commercial media as well, including
broadcast television networks and stations, and cable television networks and systems. The 1990 Act authorizes
the Secretary of Commerce, under certain circumstances, to modify some aspects of these distribution requirements.



Through the 1990 Act, Congress sought to ensure that commercial television entities would have at their disposal
a growing pool of high-quality programming appropriate for a children's audience that would be available at an affordable
cost. Accordingly, the 1990 Act authorizes the Secretary to offer NECET-funded programs to commercial television
stations and cable television systems at a rate designed to encourage these entities to air such programming.




NECET Objectives





For the FY 1994 grant round, NECET has three major objectives that applicants should consider when preparing their
submissions.

To Improve the Fundamental Intellectual Skills of Children Through the Vehicle of Television Programming. 

The term ``fundamental intellectual skills'' may be defined in a number of ways. In general, NECET interprets the
term broadly, to include those competencies and abilities that enable children to effectively understand and cope
with problems posed by the contemporary world. Such skills might include proficiency in traditional academic disciplines,
such as mathematics, science, history or reading, or they might consist of more abstract abilities, concerns or appreciations,
such as problem-solving, ethics, multiculturalism or diversity. Regardless of approach, applicants are also encouraged
to incorporate basic human development skills, such as self-esteem and pro-social behavior development, into their
proposals. Finally, since most effective educational television programming for children has an entertainment
element woven throughout it, NECET applicants are encouraged to incorporate this element into the design of their
proposals.

 

To the Extent Feasible, To Support the Development of Programming for Children Aged 6 to 8. 

Although there is a need for high-quality educational television programming for children of all ages, NECET has
concluded that the six-to-eight-year-old child is currently the most underserved by educational television programming
and is therefore deserving of special consideration for the FY 1994 grant round. According to the 1990 U.S. Census,
there are a total of 10,732,061 children in this age group. Consistent with this emphasis, projects that meet the needs
of this particular age group are more likely to be competitive and to receive funding consideration than projects
focused on other age groups. NECET, however, will not automatically reject projects designed for other age groups.
In future grant rounds, NECET may emphasize projects designed for different age levels.

 

To Encompass a Broad Range of Subject Areas Within the Overall Context of the Grant Program. 

NECET is imposing no limits on the scope of the proposals that may be submitted for funding consideration. In selecting
the goals for their projects, applicants may choose to encompass a broad array of targeted skills. Alternatively
applicants may choose to center on a single learning need.



Funding Availability



The Departments of Commerce, Justice and State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1993, Public
Law 103-121, 107 Stat. 1153 (1993), provides the Department of Commerce $1 million in assistance for the National
Endowment for Children's Educational Television under 47 U.S.C. 394 (1991), to be used for the creation and production
of television programming specifically directed toward the development of fundamental intellectual skills. Congress
has appropriated a total of $1 million for NECET for Fiscal Year 1994. NTIA anticipates that in FY 1994 NECET will fund
up to six grant awards, depending on the nature of the projects and the need of the recipients, and that NECET awards
will range from $50,000 to $300,000.



Matching Requirements



The Children's Television Act of 1990 provides that the Department of Commerce may award funds up to 75 percent of a
project's eligible costs. Due to the limitation of available funding, however, applicants are encouraged to provide
as much outside funding as possible.



Type of Funding Instrument



The funding instrument for awards made under this program will be a grant.



Eligibility Criteria



Any individual, partnership, association, joint stock company, trust, corporation (not-for-profit or for-profit),
or state or local governmental entity is eligible to submit an application for NECET funding.



Award Period



Successful applicants will have up to twenty-four months to complete their project, although the grant award period
will vary as a function of the complexity and scope of the project.



Indirect Costs



The total dollar amount of the indirect costs proposed in an application under this program must not exceed the indirect
cost rate negotiated and approved by a cognizant Federal agency prior to the proposed effective date of the award or
100 percent of the total proposed direct costs dollar amount in the application, whichever is less.



Application Forms and Kit; Selection Procedures



Preliminary Applications




A Preliminary Application (Pre-Application) is required for each proposal submitted by an applicant. The Pre-Application
consists of two parts; (1) A Standard Form 424 (SF-424) (Rev. 4-92) Application for Federal Assistance;
and (2) a narrative summary of the general nature of the proposed project, not to exceed five single-spaced pages.
An original and two copies of each complete Pre-Application is required for each project submission. No organization
or individual is permitted to submit Pre-Applications for more than three separate projects. Videotapes, audio
cassettes and other related materials are not permitted with Pre-Applications. A copy of the SF-424 and an outline
of points to be included in the Pre-Application narrative summary is contained in the National Endowment for Children's
Educational Television 

Guidelines for Preparing Applications: 1994 Grant Cycle

. This booklet may be secured by contacting the NTIA Office listed earlier.

Upon receipt, NECET Pre-Applications will be reviewed and evaluated by outside reviewers with expertise in the area
of children's television programming and by NECET staff. Criteria to be used in the evaluation of each proposal are
listed in the ``Evaluation Criteria'' section of this Notice. Written comments made by reviewers on each proposal
will not be made available to the applicant, and Pre-Application submissions will not be returned. Recommendations
regarding successful Pre-Applications will be submitted to the NTIA Administrator, who shall make a final determination
regarding successful and unsuccessful Pre-Applications. Successful and unsuccessful Pre-Applicants will be
notified by letter about their proposals in late May, 1994. Those determined to be unsuccessful Pre-Applicants will
be dropped from further consideration for the FY 1994 NECET grant cycle. Those determined to be successful Pre-Applicants
will be invited to submit Full Applications to NECET.




Full Applications



The Full Application is a comprehensive document that consists of required Federal forms, five sections of additional
information, and three exhibits. Detailed instructions for completing the Full Application are contained in the


Guidelines for Preparing Applications: 1994 Grant Cycle 

cited earlier.

In addition, those applicants requesting funds for production of a series, individual program(s), or special program(s)
are also strongly recommended to submit a half-inch VHS videocassette that represents the quality of work of which
the applicant is capable. This type may take the form of a pilot or other sample tape of the proposed project, or may be
a tape of an unrelated nature that demonstrates the creative and technical capability of the applicant. Applicants
requesting NECET funds for reproduction activities only (e.g., planning, research, development, scripting, etc.)
and/or for production of a pilot program do not need to submit a videocassette with their Full Applications. Videocassettes
will not be returned.

In general, NECET funds are available to support all of the varied tasks associated with the production of children's
television, and project eligibility is not limited to any particular stage of production or type of activity as long
as it is germane to the production of children's television programming that furthers the objectives of the 1990 Act.
Programming funded by NECET is primarily intended for general viewing by children, although it may also have value
and be used within an instructional context. In general, NECET expects to award funds for four categories of projects:



Series



To initiate new series productions, or to complete a series project already underway.



Individual Programs or Specials



To support production of new individual program(s) or special(s).



Pilot Programs




To support various pre-production activities (e.g., planning, research development, scripting, etc.) up through
and including the production of pilot program(s).



Pre-Production Projects




To support preliminary pre-production activities, such as planning, research, development and/or scripting,
that will eventually lead to production.



Evaluation Criteria



Five Evaluation Criteria will be used to evaluate all NECET Pre-Application and NECET Full Application submissions
received during the FY 1994 grant cycle. These criteria, and the weight accorded each criterion, are as follows:




Creativity (30 points)



The proposed project must display a high degree of creativity, originality and artistic imagination and, ideally,
be unique and innovative in its approach.




Clarity of Educational Objectives; Plan for Evaluating Educational Effectiveness; Indication of Developmental
Appropriateness (30 points)



Applicants must provide:

(1) A clear statement of the educational objectives of their proposal;

(2) a plan for evaluating the educational effectiveness of the proposed project; and 

(3) an indication that the proposed project is developmentally appropriate for the target audience specified in
the proposal.




Conformance With NECET Objectives (15 points)



Applicants must satisfy NECET that their project will further the three NECET objectives discussed earlier in this
Notice: 

(1) To Improve the Fundamental Intellectual Skills of Children through the Vehicle of Television Programming;

(2) To the Extent Feasible, to Support the Development of Programming for Children Aged 6 to 8; and 

(3) To Encompass a Broad Range of Subject Areas within the Overall Context of the Grant Program.



Applicant Capability (15 points) 



Applicants must indicate why NECET may be confident that they will be able to complete the proposed project in a satisfactory
manner. Applicants may demonstrate this capability in various ways, including documentation of previous experience,
presentation of a well-developed plan, and related information.




Thoroughness of Project Plan (10 points)



Applicants must provide evidence of a well-developed and sound plan for execution of their project, including a detailed
and realistic timetable and budget that accurately reflect the needs of the project.



Program Standards



Programs produced with NECET grant funding must meet broadcast-quality production and technical standards consistent
with those of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). All programs must be closed-captioned. Programming funded
by NECET may not be interrupted with commercial advertising messages for the life of the program. All NECET-funded
programming must be aired with a funding (underwriting) credit for the National Endowment for Children's Educational
Television (NECET), and any ancillary materials produced with this grant shall contain a similar credit. Such funding
credit shall be consistent with common practice for funding announcements on public broadcasting stations.



Rights, Clearances, and Distribution



NECET grant recipients are entitled to retain continuing rights to the programming that they create with NECET funding
assistance. Recipients of NECET grant funding must comply with all requirements of United States Copyright Law,
including requirements to obtain permission from owners of copyright in works of authorship and to pay any required
license fees. Accordingly, NECET requires that all completed creative works supported by NECET funding have appropriate
clearances, releases, and/or other documentation demonstrating that the organization or individual producing
the programming either has obtained rights for the use of all elements in the programs, or has itself originally created
the work. These rights and clearances apply to all elements of such programming.

NECET Applicants should note that they will need to obtain an option on any material critical to the successful completion
of their projects 

before

 they apply to NECET, unless all such material has already been cleared or is entirely original with the applicant.

and Attachments B, C, and D to this Program Announcement contain all the instructions and forms required for submittal
of applications. The forms may be reproduced for use in submitting applications. Copies of the 

Federal Register

 containing this Announcement are available at most local libraries and Congressional District Offices for reproduction.
If copies are not available at these sources they may be obtained by writing or telephoning the office listed in the
section entitled ``Contact'' at the beginning of this Announcement. 



2. Application Submission 



The date by which applications must be submitted is indicated under ``Closing Date'' at the beginning of this Announcement.

a. Applications may be mailed to: Administration For Children and Families, Division of Discretionary Grants, 370
L'Enfant Promenade, SW., 6th Floor, Washington, DC 20447. 
b. Hand delivered applications are accepted during normal working hours of 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday,

to request a legibly dated U.S. Postal Service postmark or to obtain a legibly dated receipt from a commercial carrier
or U.S. Postal Service. Private Metered postmarks shall not be acceptable as proof of timely mailing.)

<PARENT> FR940324-2-00091 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Extension of deadlines: 

ACF may extend the deadline for all applicants because of acts of God such as floods, hurricanes, etc., or when there
is a widespread disruption of the mails. However, if ACF does not extend the deadline for all applicants, it may not
waive or extend the deadline for any applicants. 



3. Intergovernmental Review 



This program is covered under Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' and 45 CFR
part 100, ``Intergovernmental Review of Department of Health and Human Services Programs and Activities.'' Under
the Order, States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance under
covered programs. 

All States and Territories except Alaska, Alabama, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Washington, American Samoa and Palau have elected
to participate in the Executive Order process and have established Single Points of Contacts (SPOCs). Applicants
from these seventeen jurisdictions need take no action regarding Executive Order 12372. Applicants for projects
to be administered by Federally-recognized Indian Tribes are also exempt from the requirements of Executive Order
12372. Otherwise, applicants should contact their SPOCs as soon as possible to alert them of the prospective applications
and receive any necessary instructions. Applicants must submit any required material to the SPOCs as soon as possible
so that the program office can obtain and review SPOC comments as part of the award process. It is imperative that the
applicant submit all required materials, if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal (or the date of
contact if no submittal is required) on the Standard Form 424, item 16a. 

Under 45 CFR 100.8(1)(2), a SPOC has 60 days from the application deadline date to comment on proposed new or competing
continuation awards. 

SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements as official recommendations. Additionally,
SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between mere advisory comments and those official State process recommendations
which they intend to trigger the ``accommodate or explain'' rule. 

When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to: Department of Health and Human Services,
Administration for Children and Families, Division of Discretionary Grants, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW., 6th Floor,
Washington, DC 20447. 

A list of the Single Points of Contact for each State and Territory is included as Appendix G of this announcement. 



4. Application Consideration 



Applications which meet the screening requirements in section 5 below will be reviewed competitively. Such applications
will be referred to reviewers for a numerical score and explanatory comments based solely on responsiveness to program
guidelines and evaluation criteria published in this announcement. Applications will be reviewed by persons outside
of the OCS unit which would be directly responsible for programmatic management of the grant. The results of these
reviews will assist the Director and OCS program staff in considering competing applications. Reviewers' scores
will weigh heavily in funding decisions but will not be the only factors considered. Applications will generally
be considered in order of the average scores assigned by reviewers. However, highly ranked applications are not guaranteed
funding since the Director may also consider other factors deemed relevant including, but not limited to, the timely
and proper completion of projects funded with OCS funds granted in the last five (5) years; comments of reviewers and
government officials; staff evaluation and input; geographic distribution; previous program performance of applicants;
compliance with grant terms under previous DHHS grants; audit reports; investigative reports; and applicant's
progress in resolving any final audit disallowances on OCS or other Federal agency grants. OCS reserves the right
to discuss applications with other Federal or non-Federal funding sources to ascertain the applicant's performance
record.

5. Criteria for Screening Applications 



All applications that meet the published deadline for submission will be screened to determine completeness and
conformity to the requirements of this Announcement. Only those applications meeting the following requirements
will be reviewed and evaluated competitively. Others will be returned to the applicants with a notation that they
were unacceptable. 



a. Initial Screening 



(1) The application must contain a completed Standard Form SF-424 signed by an official of the entity applying
for the grant who has authority to obligate the entity legally; 

(2) a budget (SF-424A); and 

(3) ``Assurances'' (SF-424B) signed by the appropriate official. 



b. Pre-rating Review 



Applications which pass the initial screening will be forwarded to reviewers for analytical comment and scoring
based on the criteria detailed in the Section below and the specific requirements contained in Part C of this Announcement.
Prior to the programmatic review, these reviewers and/or OCS staff will verify that the applications comply with
this Program Announcement in the following areas: 

(1) Eligibility: Applicant meets the eligibility requirements as specified in Part A2. 

(2) Target Populations: The application clearly targets the specific outcomes and benefits of the project to low-income
participants as defined in the DHHS Poverty Income Guidelines (Attachment A). 

(3) Grant Amount: The amount of funds requested does not exceed $12 million. 

(4) Program Focus: The application addresses the geographic scope and project requirements described in Part C of
this announcement. 



c. Evaluation Criteria 



Applications which pass the initial screening and pre-rating review will be assessed and scored by reviewers. Each
reviewer will give a numerical score for each application reviewed. These numerical scores will be supported by explanatory
statements on a formal rating form describing major strengths and major weaknesses under each applicable criterion
published in this announcement.



Part H_Post Award Information and Reporting Requirements 



Following approval of the applications selected for funding, notice of project approval and authority to draw down
project funds will be made in writing. The official award document is the Financial Assistance Award which provides
the amount of Federal funds approved for use in the project, the budget period for which support is provided, and the
terms and conditions of the award. 

In addition to the General Conditions and Special 
Conditions (where the latter are warranted) which will be applicable to grants, grantees will be subject to the provisions
of 45 CFR part 74 (generally non-governmental) or 92 (governmental) along with OMB Circulars 122 and 87, and 128 or
133. 

Grantees will be required to submit progress and financial reports (SF-269). 

Grantees are subject to the audit requirements in 45 CFR parts 74 or 92. 

By signing and/or submitting an application under this announcement, the applicant organization is providing certification
as set forth in these attachments. Attachment E_U. S. Department of Health and Human Services Certification Regarding
Drug-Free Workplace Requirements Grantees Other Than Individuals. Attachment F_Certification Regarding Debarment,
Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters_Primary Covered Transactions. 

Section 319 of Public Law 101-121, signed into law on 
October 23, 1989, imposes prohibitions and requirements for disclosure and certification related to lobbying when
an applicant has engaged in lobbying activities or is expected to lobby in trying to obtain the grant. It provides limited
exemptions for Indian tribes and tribal organizations. Current and prospective recipients (and their subtier contractors
and/or grantees) are prohibited from using appropriated funds for lobbying Congress or any Federal agency in connection
with the award of a contract, grant cooperative agreement or loan. In addition, for each award action in excess of $100,000
(or $150,000 for loans) the law requires recipients and their subtier contractors and/or subgrantees (1) to certify
that they have neither used nor will use any appropriate funds for payment to lobbyists, (2) to submit a declaration
setting forth whether payments to lobbyists have been or will be made out of nonappropriated funds and, if so, the name,
address, payment details, and purpose of any agreements with such lobbyists whom recipients or their subtier contractors
or subgrantees will pay with the nonappropriated funds and (3) to file quarterly up-dates about the use of lobbyists
if an event occurs that materially affects the accuracy of the information submitted by way of declaration and certification.
The law establishes civil penalties for noncompliance and is effective with respect to contracts, grants, cooperative
agreements and loans entered into or made on or after December 23, 1989. See Attachment H for certification and disclosure
forms to be submitted with the applications for this program. 

Attachment I indicates the regulations which apply to 
all applicants/grantees under the Discretionary Grants Program.

General Instructions



This form is designed so that application can be made for funds from one or more grant programs. In preparing the budget,
adhere to any existing Federal grantor agency guidelines which prescribe how and whether budgeted amounts should

may require budgets to be separately shown by function or activity. For other programs, grantor agencies may require
a breakdown by function or activity. Sections A, B, C, and D should include budget estimates for the whole project except
when applying for assistance which requires Federal authorization in annual or other funding period increments.
In the latter case, Sections A, B, C, and D should provide the budget for the first budget period (usually a year) and
Section E should present the need for Federal assistance in the subsequent budget periods. All applications should
contain a breakdown by the object class categories shown in Lines a-k of Section B.
