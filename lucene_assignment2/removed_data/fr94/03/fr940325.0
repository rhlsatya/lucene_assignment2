Sections 1151-56 of the FACT Act, as amended, require the Secretary to conduct an Options Pilot Program to determine
whether regulated agricultural commodity options trading can be used by producers to obtain protection from fluctuations
in the market prices of the commodities they produce and the impact of such trading on the prices of the commodities.

The delegations of authority of the Department of Agriculture are amended to delegate to the Under Secretary for International
Affairs and Commodity Programs the Secretary's authorities described above and to further delegate these authorities
to the Administrator, ASCS, and to make related conforming amendments and deletions of obsolete references.

This rule relates to internal agency management. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, notice of proposed rulemaking
and opportunity for public comment are not required, and this rule may be made effective less than 30 days after publication
in the 

Federal Register

. Further, since this rule relates to internal agency management, it is exempt from the provisions of Executive Orders
12778 and 12866.

This action is not a rule as defined by Public Law 96-354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and thus is exempt from

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>










NRC Operations Center Commercial Telephone Number Change 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations to reflect a change in the NRC Operations Center
commercial telephone and facsimile number. These amendments are necessary to inform the public of these administrative
changes to the NRC's regulations. 





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In June 1994, the NRC is scheduled to move its Operations Center from the Maryland National Bank Building in Bethesda,
Maryland, to the Two White Flint North Building in Rockville, Maryland. When this move occurs, it will be necessary
to use new telephone and facsimile numbers to reach the NRC Operations Center. For a minimum of 90 days following the
move, calls made to the old telephone number will automatically transfer to the new Operations Center. NRC licensees
shall revise their procedures and any other affected documentation to show the proper telephone and facsimile numbers
for the NRC Operations Center. This notice is being published to inform the public and NRC licensees of the commercial
telephone and facsimile number changes. 



Because this amendment deals with agency procedures, the notice and comment provisions of the Administrative Procedures
Act (APA) do not apply pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). The amendment is effective 12 noon EDT May 31, 1994. 



Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion 



The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2).
Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this
final rule. 



Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 



This final rule contains no information collection requirements and, therefore, is not subject to the requirements
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.). 



Regulatory Analysis 



A regulatory impact analysis has not been prepared for this amendment because it is an administrative action that
merely changes the telephone and facsimile numbers that are currently being used by licensees under the existing
regulations. 



Backfit Analysis 



The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this final rule because this rule does
not involve any provisions which would impose a backfit as defined in  50.109(a)(1). Therefore, a backfit analysis
is not required for this rule.

Emergency Planning and Preparedness Exercise Requirements for Nuclear Power Plants


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its emergency planning regulations in order to update the Commission's
emergency planning exercise requirements for nuclear power plants and clarify ambiguities that have surfaced in
the implementation of the regulations. These amendments also make the NRC regulations consistent with FEMA regulations.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


On August 19, 1980 (45 FR 55402), the NRC published a final rule that revised its emergency planning regulations. The
final rule became effective on November 3, 1980. On July 6, 1984 (49 FR 27733), the NRC amended 
its emergency planning regulations to relax the frequency of participation by State and local governmental authorities
in emergency preparedness exercises at nuclear power reactor sites. The amendments were based on the NRC's experience
gained in observing and evaluating emergency preparedness exercises since 1980.
Further experience has shown that the language setting forth the requirements in 10 CFR part 50, Appendix E, Section
IV.F.3 concerning full or partial participation by State or local governments in the biennial (offsite) exercise
is unnecessarily complicated. The NRC published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 on June 28, 1993 (58 FR 34539). Public comments were requested by September 13, 1993. The proposed rule did not seek
to change the requirements set forth in Appendix E, Section IV.F.3 (a), (b), and (d) but to clarify and simplify the
text of the regulation. Offsite authority responsibilities remain unchanged.
Under the proposed rule the offsite plans for each site were to be exercised biennially with full participation by
each offsite authority having a role under the plan. Further, where the offsite authority has a role under the plan
for more than one site, it would be required to participate in one exercise fully every two years and partially participate
in other offsite plan exercises in this period. The only amended requirements were those set forth in Appendix E, Section
IV.F.3(e) where the interval for an ingestion exposure pathway exercise was changed from 5 to 6 years, and Appendix
E, Section IV.F.3(c) where the requirement that all States within the plume exposure pathway emergency planning
zone (EPZ) for a given site fully participate in an offsite exercise for that site at least once every 7 years was deleted.


Public Comments


A total of 12 comment letters were received, of which 5 were from utilities, 6 were from State emergency management
agencies and one from NUMARC. All commenters generally agreed with the proposed rulemaking except for one State agency.


Comment: 

The one commentor that opposed the rule change noted that,



We do not believe, however, the NRC has substantiated its claim that the seven-year return requirement is unnecessary.
Similar arguments have surfaced in previous emergency planning issues, and our response is the same: The high level
of industry sensitivity to emergency preparedness is a direct result of comprehensive requirements for emergency
preparedness programs and exercises. Elimination of those requirements runs the risk of returning the industry
to pre-TMI levels of preparedness.

Response: 

The Commission does not agree that deleting the 7 year return frequency ``* * * runs the risk of returning
the industry to pre-TMI levels of preparedness.'' The Commission is confident that this will not occur because the
Commission has found that multi-sites states, when not fully participating in an exercise at a specific site will
usually partially participate at a significant level of activity every 2 years at that specific site in order to support
the participation of the appropriate local governments. The Commission has found that this level of exercise participation
provides adequate emergency response training for State and local governments. The Commission believes that this
rulemaking does not have an adverse impact on public health and safety because State emergency response personnel
continuously respond to actual emergencies and experience has shown that states through a combination of full and
partial participation exercises maintain an adequate level of response capability. A formal requirement for a State
to return to a specific site every 7 years to participate in an exercise has proven to be unnecessary. Nonetheless,
nothing prevents a State from returning to a specific site to participate in an exercise whenever it deems warranted.


Comment: 

Several comments suggested additional clarification to the emergency planning regulations.


Response: 

Although the Commission always appreciates suggestions on clarifying its regulations, the Commission at this time
believes that all of the suggested changes would be inappropriate to include in this rulemaking proceeding because
the suggested revisions are beyond the scope of this rulemaking.


Comment: 

Several commenters noted that the proposed wording for the ingestions pathway exercise was not consistent with the
FEMA requirement and could be interpreted differently than intended. They suggested the following requirement,
``A State should fully participate in the ingestion pathway portion of exercises at least once every six years. In
States with more than one site, the State should rotate this participation from site to site.''


Response: 

The Commission agrees with the suggested wording and has incorporated this comment in the final rule.


Discussion


The Commission finds that the current regulation has resulted in a relatively complicated description of the requirements
for exercise participation by State and local governments who have offsite planning responsibility for more than
one nuclear power plant. This final rule simplifies and clarifies this requirement. In addition, Appendix E is revised
to reflect that the interval for an ingestion exposure pathway exercise be changed from at least once every 5 years
to at least once every 6 years (FEMA's ingestion pathway exercise requirement is at least once every 6 years). The change
in the interval would match the biennial frequency required for exercises of offsite plans. Further, Appendix E is
also revised to eliminate the 7 year return frequency requirement because it has proven to be unnecessary to achieve
the underlying purpose of the rule as well as being burdensome to states which are within the plume exposure pathway
for multiple sites (FEMA does not have a return frequency requirement). Both changes assure compatibility with FEMA
requirements and thus avoid confusion among licensees and State governments. Notwithstanding elimination of the
7 year return frequency requirement, the Commission believes that offsite authorities should rotate their full
participation in exercises among sites if they are within the plume exposure pathway for more than one site.
The Commission codified the 7 year return frequency in the July 6, 1984 
(49 FR 27733), amendment to the emergency planning regulations. This amendment provides that at least once every
7 years, all States within the plume exposure pathway EPZ of a given site must fully participate in an offsite exercise
for that site. In doing so, the Commission noted that ``the final rule is not totally consistent with FEMA's final regulation
(44 CFR part 350). This inconsistency lies in the area of return frequency of multiple-site states as previously discussed.
The FEMA position on return frequency is a significant departure from the NRC's proposed regulation of July 21, 1983
(48 FR 33307). The Commission believes that more study is needed before deletion of the return frequency requirement
can be justified.''
The Commission now believes that sufficient experience has been gained in the observation and evaluation of emergency
preparedness exercises at 
nuclear power reactor sites to conclude that the 7 year return frequency should be deleted.

The Commission has found that multi-site States, when not fully participating in an exercise at a specific site will
usually partially participate at a significant level of activity every 2 years at that specific site in order to support
the participation of the appropriate local governments. The Commission has found that this level of exercise participation
provides adequate emergency response training for State and local governments. Additionally, a provision still
exists in the regulation which permits State or local government participation in any licensee's drills or exercises.
A State or local government may consider its response capability to be less than optimal because of an unusually large
personnel turnover or because there have been limited responses to real emergencies in the community. The regulation
still requires the licensees to provide for State or local government participation if they indicate such a desire.
This final revision does not have any adverse impact on public health and safety because State emergency response
personnel continuously respond to actual emergencies and experience has shown that states through a combination
of full and partial participation exercises maintain an adequate level of response capability. A formal requirement
for a State to return to a specific site every 7 years to participate in an exercise has proven to be unnecessary. This
rulemaking deletes that unnecessary, unwarranted and burdensome requirement. Nonetheless, nothing prevents
a State from returning to a specific site to participate in an exercise whenever it deems warranted. 
Lastly, this revision deletes past due dates (see section F(2) (a)) because they are now meaningless. 
FEMA concurs with the amendments in this rulemaking. 


Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability 


The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's
regulations in subpart A of 10 CFR part 51, that this rule is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the
quality of the human environment; and therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required. This regulation
updates and clarifies the emergency planning regulations relating to exercises. It does not involve any modification
to any plant or revise the need for or the 
standards for emergency plans, and there is no adverse effect on the quality of the environment. The environmental
assessment and finding of no significant impact on which this determination is based are available for inspection
at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20036. 


Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 


This final rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget approval
number 3150-0011. 


Regulatory Analysis 


The Commission has prepared a regulatory analysis on this regulation. The analysis examines the costs and benefits
of the alternatives considered by the Commission. The analysis is available for inspection in the NRC Public Document
Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20036. Single copies of the analysis may be obtained from Michael
Jamgochian, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555.
Telephone: (301) 492-3918. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 


The regulation does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The final rule updates
and clarifies ambiguities in the emergency planning regulations relating to exercises. Nuclear power plant licensees
do not fall within the definition of small business in Section 3 of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632, the Small Business
Size Standards of the Small Business Administration in 13 CFR part 121, or the Commission's Size Standards published
at 56 FR 56671 (November 6, 1991). Therefore, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b),
the Commission hereby certifies that this final rule, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities and that, therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis need not be prepared.

Backfit Analysis 


This regulation does not impose any new requirements on production or utilization facilities. The regulation deletes
the requirement that all states within the plume exposure pathway EPZ for a given site fully participate in an offsite
exercise for that specific site at least every 7 years. It also relaxes the requirement to perform an ingestion exposure
pathway exercise from every 5 years to every 6 years. These changes would permit, but do not require, licensees to change
their emergency plans and procedures. Therefore, these changes are not considered backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109
(a)(1).

a. A full participation

4

 exercise which tests as much of the licensee, State and local emergency plans as is reasonably achievable without
mandatory public participation shall be conducted for each site at which a power reactor is located. This exercise
shall be conducted within two years before the issuance of the first operating license for full power (one authorizing
operation above 5% of rated power) of the first reactor and shall include participation by each State and local government
within the plume exposure pathway EPZ and each state within the ingestion exposure pathway EPZ. If the full participation
exercise is conducted more than one year prior to issuance of an operating licensee for full power, an exercise which
tests the licensee's onsite emergency plans shall be conducted within one year before issuance of an operating license
for full power. This exercise need not have State or local government participation. 




b. Each licensee at each site shall annually exercise the onsite emergency plan. 
c. Offsite plans for each site shall be exercised biennially with full participation by each offsite authority having
a role under the plan. Where the offsite authority has a role under a radiological response plan for more than one site,
it shall fully participate in one exercise every two years and shall, at least, partially participate

5

 in other offsite plan exercises in this period. 




d. A State should fully participate in the ingestion pathway portion of exercises at least once every six years. In
States with more than one site, the State should rotate this participation from site to site. 
e. Licensees shall enable any State or local government located within the plume exposure pathway EPZ to participate
in annual exercises when requested by such State or local government. 
f. Remedial exercises will be required if the emergency plan is not satisfactorily tested during the biennial exercise,
such that NRC, in consultation with FEMA, cannot find reasonable assurance that adequate protective measures can
be taken in the event of a radiological emergency. The extent of State and local participation in remedial exercises
must be sufficient to show that appropriate corrective measures have been taken regarding the elements of the plan
not properly tested in the previous exercises. 
g. All training, including exercises, shall provide for formal critiques in order to identify weak or deficient areas
that need correction. Any weaknesses or deficiencies that are identified shall be corrected. 
h. The participation of State and local governments in an emergency exercise is not required to the extent that the
applicant has identified those governments as refusing to participate further in emergency planning activities,
pursuant to 10 CFR 50.47(c)(1). In such cases, an exercise shall be held with the applicant or licensee and such governmental
entities as elect to participate in the emergency planning process.

Section 572, Low-Income Term; Miscellaneous Nomenclature Changes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Secretary, HUD. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this final rule is to make nomenclature changes throughout title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations
to remove the term ``lower income'' and insert in its place ``low-income''. These changes will conform HUD terminology
to current practice required by recent legislation. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule will implement section 572 of the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA), Public
Law 101-625 (November 28, 1990), by making nomenclature changes throughout title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations
to reflect the new use of the term ``low-income'' instead of the term ``lower income.'' The amendments in section 572
of NAHA changed references in the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 

et seq.

) (the 1937 Act) by striking ``lower income families'' and inserting in its place ``low-income families'', and by
striking ``lower income housing'' and inserting in its place ``low-income housing.'' This rule will conform the
Department of Housing and Urban Development's regulations by removing the term ``lower income'' wherever it appears
in a context associated with the 1937 Act, and by inserting in its place the term ``low-income.'' 



Tables following the Preamble to this rule show in list format the nomenclature changes being made by this rule to the
various sections of title 24 of the Department's regulations. 

The Department has determined that this document need not be published as a proposed rule, as generally required by
the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), since this final rule merely conforms HUD regulations to reflect legislative
changes in terminology. As a rule relating to agency practice, it is exempt from the proposed rulemaking requirements
of the APA (see section 553(b)(A)). 

A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment required by the National Environmental Policy
Act (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347) is unnecessary, since this nomenclature change is categorically excluded under
HUD regulations at 24 CFR 50.20(k). 

As required by section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601), the Undersigned hereby certifies
that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it merely
makes nomenclature changes to the Department's regulations. 

This final rule was listed as item 1542 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October
25, 1993 (58 FR 56402, 56431) pursuant to Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Public and Indian Housing Development_Amendment to Calculation of Total Development Cost 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. 





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule adopts as final an interim rule, published on November 29, 1993, which revised the Department's regulations
at 24 CFR parts 905 and 941 to remove donations (non-public or non-Indian housing funds) from the Department's calculation
of total development cost (TDC). The Department's experience indicated that the inclusion of donations within the
TDC of projects has created unwarranted delays in the development process, and, in some cases, has been a contributory
reason for cost increases in the low-income housing development process. 





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

1. The November 29, 1993 Interim Rule 



On November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62522), HUD published an interim rule to remove donations (non-public or non-Indian housing
funds) from the Department's calculation of total development cost (TDC). 

Before publication of the November 29, 1993 interim rule, the regulations for HUD's public housing development program
and Indian housing development program (codified, respectively, in 24 CFR parts 941 and 905) provided for the inclusion
of donations (non-public or non-Indian housing funds), in calculating the total development cost (TDC). The project
TDC would then be compared to the published TDC limitations currently in effect, which could result in actual development
costs that are less than, the same as, or more than the published TDC limitations. Under this procedure, if the project
TDC exceeded 100 percent of the published TDC limitation, notwithstanding the reason for the increase over the TDC
limitation or the source of funding for the increase, the Field Office was unable to approve the project TDC without
authorization of the Regional Administrator or the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. This approval
procedure was intended to verify Field Office processing, and to ensure that the project TDC would provide modest,
non-luxury, durable housing at a reasonable cost. In actual fact, however, the TDC approval process, which did not
take into consideration that donations may be the reason for, or the source of payment of, the increase over the TDC
limits, resulted in unwarranted delays in the development process because of the amount of time it takes for the request
to move through the system. In some cases, these delays were a contributory reason for cost increases in development
of public and Indian housing. 

The amendments to be made by the November 29, 1993 interim rule, and adopted in final by this rule, permit HUD Field Offices
to calculate the project TDC relative to published TDC limitations, and to authorize housing agencies to proceed
with developments, without referral to Regional Administrators or the Assistant Secretary, where funds in excess
of TDC limits are provided through donations. Where funds in excess of TDC limits will not be provided through donations,
Field Offices must continue to seek authorization from the Regional Administrators or the Assistant Secretary.
HUD will not provide funds to housing agencies under section 5 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 in excess of TDC limitations
without such authorization. 

The specific sections in 24 CFR parts 905 and 941 amended by the November 29, 1993 interim rule, and adopted in final
by this rule, are as follows: 

Sections 905.102 and 941.103 are each amended by revising the definition of ``total development cost'' contained
in these sections to clarify that maximum total development cost excludes any donations. 

Sections 905.255 and 941.204 are amended to add a new paragraph to each section that will clarify that although donations
are not included in the project TDC calculations, donations must be included in the project development cost budget.
A new paragraph (j) has been added to  905.255 and a new paragraph (d) has been added to  941.204. Additionally,
 905.255(a)(2) is amended to clarify that the ``inclusion of all costs'' discussed in this paragraph does not
include donations. 

Additionally,  941.406 is amended to clarify that the total project cost refers to HUD funds. 



2. Public Comments 



The November 29, 1993 interim rule solicited public comments through January 28, 1994. By the expiration of the comment
period, only one comment was received. The commenter, a public housing agency, stated that it was in full agreement
with the interim rule, and supported the amendment to HUD's regulations. 

Since no other comments were received on the interim rule, and since the Department intends to make no further changes,
the Department will adopt as its final rule the November 29, 1993 interim rule.

Other Matters 


Environmental Impact



At the time of development of the November 29, 1993 interim rule, a Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to
the environment was made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. That Finding remains applicable to this final rule, and is available
for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address.



Impact on Small Entities



The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this final rule
before publication, and, by approving it, certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. The rule's major effect is on housing agencies which are state and local
governmental entities. The final rule revises the manner in which the total development cost is calculated, and in
so doing, reduces delays and costs in the development of public and Indian housing, which is beneficial to housing
agencies. 



Federalism Impact



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order No. 12612, Federalism, has
determined that this final rule will not have a substantial, direct effect on the States or their political subdivisions
or on the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power or responsibilities
among the various levels of government. The rule removes, rather than imposes, a program requirement. 



Impact on the Family



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
final rule does not have a potential significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being,
and thus is not subject to review under the Order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result
from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. 


Regulatory Agenda



This rule was listed as sequence number 1650 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October
25, 1993 (58 FR 56402, 56451) under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Justification for Final Rulemaking 


In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 does provide for exceptions from that general rule
where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied
when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1)
The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this rule for effect without first soliciting public comment,
in that prior public procedure is unnecessary because the rule relates to internal agency organization and management
and because the provisions to be removed by this rule are not required by law and are duplicative of statutory provisions
or delegations of authority that remain in effect. 


Background 


The Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. app.) was enacted to create independent and objective units to perform
various investigative and monitoring functions in several Executive agencies of the Federal Government, including
the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The Act confers broad authority upon the Inspector General
to conduct independent investigations and audits. Consistent with its statutory independence, and with the delegation
of authority to issue such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the functions, powers, and duties
of the Inspector General, separate regulations have been adopted at 24 CFR chapter XII (Ch. XII) that are applicable
only to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) within HUD. Currently, chapter XII concerns such matters as organization,
functions, and delegations of authority (part 2000), availability of information to the public (part 2002), implementation
of the Privacy Act of 1974 (part 2003), and production in response to subpoenas or demands of courts or other authorities
(part 2004). 
On September 11, 1993, the President issued Executive Order 12861, which requires each Executive department and
agency to undertake to eliminate within 3 years of the effective date of the Order not less than 50 percent of its civilian
internal management regulations that are not required by law. Part 2000 is a civilian internal management regulation
of the type referenced in the Executive Order. The Inspector General of HUD has determined that 24 CFR part 2000 is not
required by law and, in large part, duplicates the provisions of the Inspector General Act or of various published
delegations of authority that remain in force. Accordingly, this final rule eliminates part 2000 and amends parts
2002 and 2003, to the extent that those parts contain references to part 2000. (Part 2004 does not contain references
to part 2000.) 


Other Matters 


Environmental Review 


In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures in this document relate only to internal administrative procedures
that do not relate to the physical condition of project areas or building sites and, therefore, are categorically
excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The rule eliminates unnecessary regulations. There are no anticompetitive discriminatory
aspects of the rule with regard to small entities, and there are not any unusual procedures that would need to be complied
with by small entities. 


Executive Order 12612, Federalism 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions,
on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the Order. The rule is limited
to eliminating unnecessary or duplicative regulations. 


Executive Order 12606, The Family 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being and,
thus, is not subject to review under the Order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result
from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. 


Regulatory Agenda 


This rule was not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October 25, 1993 (58 FR
56402) under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Hames Valley Viticultural Area (93F-009P)



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), Treasury.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule, Treasury decision.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule establishes a viticultural area in southern Monterey County, California, to be known as ``Hames Valley.''
The petition was submitted by Mr. Barry C. Jackson of the Harmony Wine Company on behalf of Valley Farm Management,
Soledad, California, and Mr. Bob Denney & Associates, Visalia, California. The establishment of viticultural
areas and the subsequent use of viticultural area names as appellations of origin in wine labeling and advertising
will help consumers better identify the wines they may purchase, and will help winemakers distinguish their products
from wines made in other areas.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background



On August 23, 1978, ATF published Treasury Decision ATF-53 (43 FR 37672, 54624) revising regulations in 27 CFR
part 4. These regulations allow the establishment of definitive viticultural areas. The regulations allow the name
of an approved viticultural area to be used as an appellation of origin on wine labels and in wine advertisements. On
October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision ATF-60 (44 FR 56692) which added a new part 9 to 27 CFR, for the
listing of approved American viticultural areas.

Section 4.25a(e)(1), Title 27 CFR, defines an American viticultural area as a delimited grape-growing region distinguishable
by geographical features, the boundaries of which have been delineated in subpart C of part 9.

Section 4.25a(e)(2) outlines the procedure for proposing an American viticultural area. Any interested person
may petition ATF to establish a grape-growing region as a viticultural area. The petition should include:

(a) Evidence that the name of the proposed viticultural area is locally and/or nationally known as referring to the
area specified in the petition;

(b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries of the viticultural area are as specified in the petition;

(c) Evidence relating to the geographical features (climate, soil, elevation, physical features, etc.) which distinguish
the viticultural features of the proposed area from surrounding areas;

(d) A description of the specific boundaries of the viticultural area, based on the features which can be found on United
States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) maps of the largest applicable scale; and

(e) A copy of the appropriate U.S.G.S. map with the boundaries prominently marked.



Petition



ATF received a petition from Mr. Barry C. Jackson of the Harmony Wine Company to establish a viticultural area in southern
Monterey County, California, to be known as ``Hames Valley.'' Mr. Jackson submitted the petition on behalf of Valley
Farm Management, Soledad, California, and Mr. Bob Denney & Associates, Visalia, California. The Hames Valley
viticultural area is located approximately three miles west of the town of Bradley and some seven miles north of Lake
Nacimiento. It is located totally within the larger and previously established Monterey viticultural area. As stated
in the original petition and letter from the petitioner dated April 27, 1993, there are several existing vineyards
within the area that comprise approximately 630 acres planted to grapes. No wineries are currently located within
the Hames Valley area. The size of the area is about sixteen square miles or approximately 10,240 acres.

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 



In response to Mr. Jackson's petition, ATF published a notice of proposed rulemaking, Notice No. 783, in the 

Federal Register

 on October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57764), proposing the establishment of the Hames Valley viticultural area. The notice requested
comments from all interested persons by December 27, 1993. 



Comments to Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 



One comment was received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking (Notice No. 783). The comment was from Mr.
Robert H. Denney and Ms. Shelley B. Denney of Robert Denney & Associates, one of the petitioners for the establishment
of the Hames Valley viticultural area. This commenter states that the existing Monterey viticultural area covers
a vast geographic and climatic area, from the cool Salinas Valley floor area close to Monterey Bay to inland valleys
and foothills seventy miles to the south. 

According to Mr. and Ms. Denney, these southern valleys exhibit vastly different coastal influences and growing
conditions. As a result, the varieties grown, their yields, quality characteristics and flavor components vary
widely from Soledad on the north to Hames Valley on the south. 

Mr. and Ms. Denney state that, as growers and small business people, it is important to their economic well being to
be able to differentiate the wine grapes they grow in Hames Valley from those produced in the cooler regions of the Monterey
viticultural area. They further state that by being able to differentiate their grapes and, ultimately through their
own efforts, the wineries that purchase their grapes, as well as the consumer, can identify and seek out their product
for its unique character. 



Evidence That Viticultural Area Name Is Widely Known 



The name Hames Valley has been associated with this area since the latter part of the nineteenth century. The petitioner
cites Donald T. Clark, 

Monterey County Place Names

, p. 201 (1991), which states that the valley was named for John Hames who had extensive land holdings in the area. In
addition, the name Hames Valley appears on the U.S.G.S. Bradley Quadrangle, 15 minute series, map of Bradley, California,
and also appears on the U.S.G.S. 7.5 minute series map entitled Hames Valley. Additionally, the petitioner notes
that there is a creek which runs through the valley named Hames Creek.

Evidence of Boundaries 



Hames Valley is located in the eastern foothills of the Santa Lucia Range, west of the confluence of the Salinas, San
Antonio, and Nacimiento Rivers. The watershed of Hames Creek is the defining feature of the appellation. Hames Valley
is located wholly within the larger, previously approved Monterey viticultural area. A portion of the boundaries
of the Monterey viticultural area form the northern and western boundaries of Hames Valley. Swain Valley and the Salinas
River form part of the eastern boundary. The ridgeline that separates Hames Valley from the San Antonio River forms
the balance of the eastern and southern boundaries. 



Geographical Features 



Hames Valley is a small east-west oriented valley, west of the generally north-south orientation of the meandering
Salinas River. Formed by the watershed of Hames Creek, Hames Valley thrusts its way seven miles into the eastern flank
of the Santa Lucia Mountains. Hames Creek empties into the Salinas River approximately two miles downstream from
the confluence of the San Antonio and Salinas Rivers. Hames Valley is separated from the San Antonio River by a ridge
averaging 1,500 feet in elevation, the highest peak at 1,984 feet. A similar ridgeline forms the northern boundary
and separates Hames Valley from the Salinas River. 

The general topography within the valley consists of gently sloping alluvial fans and associated terraces. Drainages
are generally well defined. 



Soils 



The petitioner submitted a composite map of the Hames Valley area compiled from the Soil Survey of Monterey County,
California, U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Forestry Service, University of California Agricultural
Experiment Station (1972). According to this map, the principal soils in the area are gravelly sandy loams of the Lockwood
series. These comprise approximately 75 percent of the soil types present. Lesser amounts of Chamise shaly loams
and Nacimiento silty clay loams are also present. All current viticulture takes place in the Lockwood series soils.
Soils in the surrounding areas are also silty and shaly loams, but are located on 30 to 50 percent slopes and are of different
compositions. The preponderance of the Lockwood shaly clay loam and the geomorphology (flat, well defined valley
floor) set the Hames Valley apart from the surrounding mountainous areas. 



Climate 



With regard to climate, the petitioner submitted a study by A.N. Kasimatis, Extension Viticulturist, University
of California, Davis (August 7, 1970). The study shows that heat summation for the Hames Valley-Bradley area is generally
in the 3200 to 3500 degree-day range. This corresponds to a warm region III, similar to the King City and Paso Robles
areas. This differs from the generally cooler climate (region I/II) for the Gonzales, Soledad, and Greenfield area,
farther north. 

Regarding other climatic factors, the petitioner stated that rainfall in the Hames Valley area averages 10 to 12 inches
annually. 
The petitioner further stated that the east-west axis of the Hames Valley relative to the north-south orientation
of the Salinas Valley results in a reduced wind stress factor in the Hames Valley area. Windspeed builds up later in
the day and at reduced velocities relative to the ``wind-tunnel'' effect in the Gonzales-Soledad-Greenfield area.
This results in shorter overall exposure to wind stress, from both a time and wind velocity standpoint. 

In sum, the following factors differentiate the Hames Valley from the adjacent Salinas Valley: 

(a) An east-west axis relative to the general north-south orientation of the Salinas Valley. 

(b) A generally warmer microclimate: Region III vs. region I/II. 

(c) Higher overall elevation: 500 to 800 feet for Hames Valley, 100 to 500 feet for the Salinas Valley.

<TEXT>
 

(d) Later daily windspeed build-up and duration of wind. 
(e) More homogeneous soil profile: Hames Valley with 
one principal soil type; Salinas Valley, over 70 soil types. 
(f) Geographically distinct and separate from the 
Salinas River Valley. 


Viticultural Area Boundary 


The boundary of the Hames Valley viticultural area may 
be found on one United States Geological Survey map, 
entitled Bradley Quadrangle, 15 minute series, with a scale 
of 1:62,500. The boundary is described in  9.147. 


Executive Order 12866 


It has been determined that this rule is not a 
significant regulatory action, because it will not (1) Have 
an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or 
adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of 
the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the 
environment, public health or safety, or State, local or 
tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious 
inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken 
or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the 
budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or 
loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients 
thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the

principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


It is hereby certified that this regulation will not 
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number 
of small entities. The establishment of a viticultural 
area is neither an endorsement nor approval by ATF of the 
quality of wine produced in the area, but rather an 
identification of an area that is distinct from surrounding 
areas. This process merely allows wineries to more 
accurately describe the origin of their wines to consumers, 
and helps consumers identify the wines they purchase. 
Designation of a viticultural area itself has no 
significant economic impact because any commercial 
advantage can come only from consumer acceptance of wines 
made from grapes grown within the area. In addition, no 
new recordkeeping or reporting requirements are imposed. 
Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not 
required. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 
Pub. L. 96-511, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35, and its implementing 
regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, do not apply to this final 
rule because no requirement to collect information is 
imposed.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Cooperative Research Act of 1984 has been amended by the National Cooperative Production Amendments
of 1993 to include joint ventures for production within its coverage and redesignated as the ``National Cooperative
Research and Production Act of 1993.'' The Act now provides persons engaging in eligible joint ventures for production,
as well as persons engaging in joint research and development ventures, with the opportunity to reduce their potential
liability for damages under the antitrust laws, provided they file with the Attorney General and the Federal Trade
Commission a timely notification concerning the organization and objectives of their venture. The Attorney General
or Federal Trade Commission must then publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 that identifies the parties to the venture and describes generally the area of planned activity of the venture. The
National Cooperative Production Amendments of 1993 also impose certain reporting requirements on the Attorney
General. Due to the antitrust-related nature of these notification, publication and reporting functions, the Attorney
General has delegated her authority under the Act to the Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division.

 This final rule makes two changes to the existing 
Averaging, Banking, and Trading (ABT) regulations for 
manufacturers of heavy-duty engines, under EPA's motor vehicle 
emission control program. Beginning with the final reports due 
in 1993 for the 1992 model year engines, heavy-duty engine 
manufacturers participating in the ABT program are required to 
use credits scheduled to expire in the earliest model year before 
using credits that would expire in later model years. EPA has 
concluded that the benefits intended to be derived from the ABT 
program are more likely to be realized by this credit accounting 
method than by the credit accounting method in the existing 
regulations. Therefore, the intent of this change is to correct 
an unintended effect in the existing regulations. This action 
also extends the reporting period for final reports from 180 days 
to 270 days after the end of the model year. This extension of 
reporting time will provide manufacturers additional time to 
collect sales data for calculating ABT credits and thus improve 
the accuracy of the credit information submitted to EPA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Introduction 


The ABT program was developed to provide flexibility for 
manufacturers to use a mix of emission control technology and 
minimize the costs associated with meeting increasingly stringent 
emission standards. This flexibility in turn creates 
environmental benefit by providing incentive in the form of 
credits for the earlier introduction of cleaner engines into the 
market. In addition, environmental benefits are derived from a 
20 percent discount on all banked and traded credits. As an 
additional environmental safeguard, credit life is limited to 
assure adequate in-use overlap between credit-generating and 
credit-using vehicles. 
The Averaging, Banking, and Trading (ABT) program 
regulations promulgated on July 26, 1990 prohibit heavy-duty 
engine manufacturers from banking and withdrawing emission 
credits from the same averaging set in the same model year. See 
40 CFR 86.091-15(a)(2)(iii). According to the credit accounting 
method in the regulations, a manufacturer must first combine all 
transactions for an averaging set in a given model year. The 
manufacturer could then bank any excess credits or withdraw 
credits if there is a credit shortfall. This is similar to the 
last-in-first-out inventory accounting system (LIFO), because the 
most recently generated credits must be used first to average 
before older credits can be withdrawn from the bank. This 
provision has been a source of confusion for some members of the 
regulated industry. On May 29, 1992, the Engine Manufacturers 
Association (EMA) met with EPA to explain why its members thought 
that  86.091-15(a)(2)(iii) allowed them to both withdraw 
previously banked credits and deposit new credits in the same 
model year and averaging set. In addition, EMA suggested that 
LIFO credit accounting removed a certain amount of expected 
flexibility from the ABT program and reduced the incentives for 
earlier introduction of cleaner engine technology. EPA 
subsequently informed EMA that  86.091-15(a)(2)(iii) clearly 
provided for LIFO credit accounting, but that the Agency would 
review its previous decision and consider implementing a first-
in-first-out (FIFO) credit accounting method as suggested by EMA. 
After comparing the two credit accounting methods, EPA has 
concluded that the benefits intended to be derived from the ABT 
program are more likely to be realized under the FIFO credit 
accounting method, and that LIFO credit accounting may reduce the 
program's effectiveness in providing these benefits.

Today's action amends the credit accounting method used in 
the ABT program such that manufacturers must utilize the credits 
generated in the earliest model years before using later credits 
to cover credit needs. EPA believes that this accounting 
procedure is more likely to produce the benefits intended from 
the ABT program and will avoid the unintended reduction in 
program effectiveness that could occur under the current LIFO 
credit accounting procedure. Forcing manufacturers to average 
first with new credits from cleaner technology engines may 
actually encourage a manufacturer to continue using dirtier 
technology in the years when previously banked credits are still 
available, to avoid the loss of these banked credits through 
expiration. The current LIFO procedures could therefore have the 
unintended and adverse impact of delaying the introduction of 
cleaner technology until manufacturers have depleted their bank 
of credits. That result would be contrary to the goals of the 
ABT program. 

In addition, today's action extends the time period for 
submitting corrections to end-of-year reports from 180 days after 
the end of the model year to 270 days after the end of the model 
year. This extension will provide manufacturers a more equitable 
and reasonable time period than previously allowed for collecting 
first delivery information on their engines. 

The reasons for these changes to the ABT program are 
explained in greater detail in the preamble to the notice of 
proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published on June 10, 1993 (58 FR 
32498). 

EPA proposed these changes to the ABT program in conjunction 
with the NPRM of June 10, 1993 for the Clean Fuels Fleet 
Emissions Standards, Conversions, and General Provisions (CFF). 
EPA published a second notice on July 1, 1993 which indicated 
that a public hearing on that rule would not address the ABT 
portion of the NPRM, unless otherwise requested. No request for 
a hearing was made, and the comment period for the ABT portion 
closed on August 2, 1993. Finally, EPA also split off the ABT 
portion from the CFF rulemaking in order to expedite a final ABT 
rule. EPA will issue a separate final rulemaking for the CFF 
program. 

This preamble provides a description of today's action and 
includes a summary of the major comments received on relevant 
portions of the NPRM and EPA's responses to those comments. 



II. Public Participation 



No public hearing was requested on the proposed ABT changes, 
and no hearing was held. EPA received written comments from the 
Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC), Engine Manufacturers 
Association (EMA), Manufacturers of Emission Controls Association 
(MECA), the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the 
American Lung Association (ALA), and Michael Walsh. Comments 
have been placed in Docket No. A-92-30 (see 

ADDRESSES

 above). 
EPA has carefully reviewed all comments, and the following 
discussion addresses all major comments. 



III. Analysis of Comments 



A. Meaning of 40 CFR 86.091-15(a)(2)(iii) 



40 CFR 86.092-15(a)(2)(iii) states that: Engine families within a given averaging set may not both generate
and use like emission credits in 
the same model year. 

EMA commented that changes to this provision may not be 
necessary, because, as DDC also noted,  86.091-15(a)(2)(iii) 
does not specify that LIFO credit accounting must be used. 
However, EPA believes that  86.091-15(a)(2)(iii) clearly 
requires LIFO credit accounting. This is based on the text of 
the provision, as well as the preamble discussion of this 
provision in 55 FR 30599 on July 26, 1990. The discussion 
addresses the background and context of the provision and very 
clearly states that credits should not be both withdrawn and used 
from a given averaging set in a given model year. Both EMA and 
DDC noted that the preamble used the term ``rolling banking'' to 
refer to FIFO credit accounting. Although the term ``rolling 
banking'' does not appear in the preamble to the final rule for 
the ABT program, the term ``rolling program'' is addressed in the 
preamble and refers not to FIFO credit accounting, but to the 
three-year credit life, which is entirely independent of credit 
accounting. In any case, both EMA and DDC oppose imposition of 
LIFO accounting procedures. DDC rejected the LIFO interpretation 
on the basis that LIFO is ``illogical and inconsistent with the 
purposes of the ABT program.'' EPA is in agreement with this 
statement and highlights this point as the main reason for this 
rulemaking. 



B. Environmental Impact of the Credit Accounting Change Need for Further Study 



NRDC, MECA and ALA raised concerns on the environmental 
impact of the proposed credit accounting change, suggesting that 
EPA withhold making any such change until the agency completed a 
more thorough analysis of environmental consequences, including a 
comprehensive evaluation of the impact of the whole ABT program. 

This rulemaking only addresses two aspects of the ABT 
program_the credit accounting procedures and the timing of 
annual reports. Given the limited nature of this rulemaking, EPA 
does not believe a comprehensive evaluation of the entire program 
is necessary to determine the appropriate accounting and 
reporting requirements.

In addition, EPA believes that it has adequate information 
at this time to determine the appropriate credit accounting 
procedure. As described above, EPA has sufficient information 
now to make these determinations. Implementation of LIFO credit 
accounting has demonstrated to EPA's satisfaction that LIFO 
credit accounting does not fulfill the intention of the ABT 
program to provide engine manufacturers the flexibility and 
incentives needed to generate environmental benefits. 
Manufacturers generated credits in MY 1990 which they anticipated 
being able to use in MYs 1991-1993. At the same time, they have 
generated credits in MYs 1991 and 1992, which are valid to be 
used through MY 1996. However, because any credit usage that 
occurs in MYs 1991 and 1992 must, according to LIFO credit 
accounting, be offset first by the credits generated in MYs 1991 
and 1992, the result is that the credits which are valid until 
1996 are being withdrawn, while older credits, which are 
scheduled to expire in MY 1993, are sitting in the bank. Under 
LIFO credit accounting, if a manufacturer wanted to utilize the 
credits generated in MY 1990, they would be required to withdraw 
all the 1990 credits before generating new credits. Thus, there 
is little incentive to introduce cleaner technology until all the 
credits have been withdrawn. In addition, the PM standards are 
tightening after three model years, and manufacturers have little 
opportunity under LIFO credit accounting to both adjust to the 
1990 standard and generate credits for the 1994 standard change. 

Finally, a delay in this rulemaking would prolong the 
disincentives associated with LIFO credit accounting. 



Environmental Impact 



NRDC and MECA raised various concerns about the 
environmental impact of these changes, many of which were based 
on serious reservations about ABT programs in general. They were 
concerned that credits did not reflect real innovations in 
pollution control, but merely reflected the difference between 
certification levels and the level of the standard. Increased 
credits therefore provided no net benefit to the environment. In 
that context, they were concerned that application of these 
changes to the 1993 reports on the 1992 model year engines would 
significantly increase the number of credits available to engine 
manufacturers, and therefore ease the burden in complying with 
more stringent emissions standards applicable in model years 1994 
through 1996. This artificial extension of credit life would 
worsen air quality by allowing continued production of older, 
dirtier engines beyond that allowed without the credit accounting 
change. NRDC claimed that the proposal's theoretical arguments 
for the credit change have a weak analytical support, and do not 
support the suggested rule change.

As noted earlier, this rulemaking has a limited scope and 
EPA is therefore not revisiting many of the policy and other 
issues resolved in the rulemakings establishing the ABT program. 
This rulemaking is focused on the narrow issue of determining 
what credit accounting procedure best implements the intended 
goals of the ABT program, with the existence of an ABT program as 
a given. In that context, EPA believes that the regulatory 
changes in this rule are appropriate. A FIFO credit accounting 
provision will better serve the intended goals of the ABT program 
than the current LIFO accounting provision. In addition, EPA 
does not expect an adverse environmental impact from these 
changes, and over time believes the changes should benefit the 
environment. 

First, as was explained in the preamble to the notice of 
proposed rulemaking (58 FR 32498, June 10, 1993), FIFO is 
preferred over LIFO, because LIFO may induce manufacturers to use 
any credits in the bank before generating new credits, for fear 
of having the previously banked credits expire. Thus, LIFO may 
reduce the incentive for manufacturers to pull ahead new 
technology. On the other hand, FIFO encourages manufacturers to 
put into production new technology in order to generate new 
credits and gain experience on the overall effect of the 
technology on emissions before it is required by standards. This 
experience may lead to improved reliability when new technology 
is implemented on a wider scale. In addition, FIFO has the added 
environmental benefit of having more credits discounted, because 
credits are banked first rather than averaged first, as under 
LIFO. (Averaged credits are not discounted, while banked or 
traded credits are.) 

Second, while MECA, NRDC, and ALA claim that the increase in 
availability of credits in the 1994-1996 model years resulting 
from the switch to FIFO credit accounting is an environmental 
detriment, EPA emphasizes that the credits in question are 
credits that manufacturers have previously generated and 
therefore represent an emission reduction that has already taken 
place. Furthermore, under FIFO, credits are banked more 
frequently than under LIFO, because LIFO requires averaging 
first. Therefore, FIFO provides the additional environmental 
benefit of a 20% discount to more credits. 

One final commenter, Michael Walsh, questioned EPA's 
rationale for ``relaxing'' the ABT requirements when a stated goal 
of the program was to not undercut the purpose of the Clean Air 
Act to promote the achievement of the greatest degree of 
emissions reductions available now and in the future. In support 
of his argument, Mr. Walsh states that the ABT program has 
actually been used by manufacturers to employ engine 
modifications to meet emission standards rather than employing 
more significant pollution controls (presumably particulate 
traps). Mr. Walsh further bolsters his argument with studies 
showing the health hazards associated with oxides of nitrogen and 
particulate matter. Finally, Mr. Walsh comments that EPA has 
withheld data from the public which has denied the public a 
reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposed rule change. 

EPA has, through rulemaking, set the emission standards for 
heavy-duty engines at levels which reflect the greatest degree 
of emissions reductions available now and in the future. The 
Agency will work hard to ensure that overall emissions will not 
exceed the levels set by those standards. Indeed, the 
environmental safeguards built into the ABT program, safeguards 
which remain in effect today, are intended to ensure that overall 
emissions will not exceed the standards. EPA does not believe, 
however, that it is appropriate to dictate which emission control 
technologies manufacturers must use to meet those standards. A 
principal goal of the ABT program is to provide flexibility to 
the manufacturers to choose the most economically efficient means 
of meeting the emission standards. If manufacturers do employ 
less expensive emission control options to meet the standards, 
that is their prerogative. The overall emission levels set by 
the standards are not exceeded and, theoretically, resources have 
been allocated more efficiently. Until data is provided that 
overall emissions levels are being exceeded, EPA will assume that 
the ABT program is achieving its goals. 

As for Mr. Walsh's claim that EPA is withholding data, EPA 
asserts that it has placed in the docket all accurate data on 
which it has relied to make this decision. The only data which 
has been withheld is confidential business information (CBI) 
which EPA is statutorily prohibited from releasing; even that 
information, if it was considered by EPA in making this decision, 
has been recharacterized to avoid revealing CBI and placed in the 
docket.

C. Not Allowing Manufacturers To Use Both LIFO and FIFO Credit Accounting 




In the NPRM, EPA requested comments on whether or not the Agency should consider implementing alternative credit
accounting schemes which incorporate combinations of both LIFO and FIFO. Both EMA and DDC supported the alternative
of allowing manufacturers to choose freely between LIFO and FIFO (referred to hereafter as LIFO/FIFO). 


First, EMA and DDC claimed that LIFO/FIFO provides the maximum credit accounting flexibility, and therefore the
engine manufacturers prefer this credit accounting system. EPA believes that FIFO, in contrast with LIFO, provides
the flexibility needed to encourage manufacturers to participate fully in the program. In addition, EPA believes
that LIFO/FIFO would provide marginal additional flexibility over FIFO, and this additional flexibility would
not be warranted in light of the concerns that the Agency has regarding use of this accounting system. These concerns
are discussed later in this section. 


Second, EMA and DDC commented that the ABT program has a built-in discount that is incurred when credits are calculated.
Some engine families have more than one transient cycle conversion factor, and only one, the most environmentally-safe,
conversion factor may be used during credit calculations. EMA and DDC indicated that this calculation results in
an estimated 10-20% credit ``discount.'' EPA points out that this fact applies to all credit accounting systems
and therefore should not be considered as a reason to choose a particular accounting system. Furthermore, this ``discount''
applies only to those engine families containing multiple horsepower ratings. 


Third, EMA and DDC were also concerned that the averaging program would no longer exist under FIFO. On the contrary,
the averaging program could still be used by manufacturers when there are no previously banked credits available,
such as when a manufacturer either has no banked credits going into a model year, or in cases where the previously banked
credits do not adequately cover credit needs for that model year. Under such circumstances, manufacturers may use
the credits generated in the current model year in averaging and would not be required to take a discount on these credits.
Credit surpluses remaining after averaging has occurred could be banked for future use, with the discount taken.



Fourth, EMA and DDC commented that under LIFO/FIFO, credit life cannot be extended, as EPA fears. Although credit
life cannot be extended without the generation of new credits, EPA believes that the credit accounting system used
should not allow manufacturers to circumvent the environmental safeguards that have been put into the program. LIFO
and FIFO separately maximize the effects of different safeguards, and under LIFO/FIFO a manufacturer can use LIFO
in some years to avoid credit discounting and FIFO in others to avoid credit expiration.






NRDC, MECA, and ALA commented that EPA should not adopt the other proposed credit accounting alternatives and echoed
concerns similar to those of EPA's regarding the problems associated with allowing manufacturers to use both LIFO
and FIFO credit accounting. These concerns are: (1) The loophole created by LIFO/FIFO which could shield the manufacturers
from the full impact, and subsequently diminish the overall effectiveness, of the environmental safeguards of the
ABT program, and (2) the substantial increase in the complexity of the ABT program, which could also increase the potential
for errors in credit tracking and affect the ultimate compliance findings. 


In conclusion, EPA does not believe that LIFO/FIFO is more suitable than FIFO, because the apparent disadvantages
of LIFO/FIFO outweigh any potential advantages that have been claimed by commenters. 



D. Retroactivity 




The revised regulation changes the credit accounting provision for the 1992 model year reports. End-of-year reports
are due within 90 days after the end of the 1992 model year. Manufacturers can correct these 90 day reports within 180
days after their submission. Presumably all manufacturers submitted their 90 day reports prior to the publication
of the NPRM. Publication of the NPRM on June 10, 1993 and delays and uncertainty about the outcome of this final rule
led most manufacturers to hold off in submitting their corrections report. EPA believes that this is not a retroactive
change as it applies to a report that has not yet been submitted. Given the questions raised on EPA's authority to promulgate
a retroactive change to the ABT regulations, and the lack of any compelling reason to revise earlier reports, EPA has
decided to not make any revisions to regulations applicable to 1991 and earlier model years.

E. Other Comments Related to Credit Accounting Change 




DDC and EMA requested that EPA expedite this rulemaking to allow the use of FIFO for the final report due in 1993 on the
1992 model year, because engine manufacturers claim that they had planned their production based on the assumption
that the system in effect was essentially FIFO-based. On the other hand, NRDC commented that changing the credit accounting
system ``midstream'' for the 1992 model year, when some of the 1994 model year engines are already being produced,
is not acceptable because of the impact on air quality. EPA does not want to penalize those manufacturers who pulled
ahead technology for the purposes of generating credits for the 1994-1996 model years and has decided to apply
this change of credit accounting at the earliest possible time. In addition, these credits represent emission reductions
that have already occurred and are subject to the environmental safeguards of discounting and limited credit life.



Several comments by NRDC and MECA relate to the ABT program in general rather than to the specifics of this rulemaking.
For example, the concern was raised that credits do not necessarily represent real emission reductions, but may reflect
the shaving of safety margins. Responses to such comments are in the preamble to the final rule for ABT (55 FR 30584,
7/26/90). 


MECA also commented on the effects of this credit accounting change on the emission control manufacturers, specifically
manufacturers of oxidation catalysts. MECA summarized the environmental benefits of using this particular emission
control device and pointed out that lost revenues from decreased sales will negatively impact the amount of research
and development that can be performed by these manufacturers. Manufacturers assert that switching to FIFO removes
the disincentive to pull ahead new technology. Pull ahead provides opportunities to gain experience with new technology
before having to use the technology more widely. 



F. Extension for Corrections to End-of-Year Reports 




Although other commenters did not indicate any concerns with the reporting period extension for corrections to end-of-year
reports, NRDC commented that this extension may cause complications when rectifying compliance problems, because
any problems presumably would not be detected until nine months after the end of the model year. However, engine manufacturers
still must submit their initial end-of-year reports within 90 days after the end of the model year, and the possibilities
of any compliance problems would be most evident in this particular report. These compliance problems may be mitigated
later when all the credit-generating engines have been tracked to points of first retail sale by the submittal of this
report. EPA will have the opportunity to initiate investigations if problems appear in end-of-year reports. The
change here affects only the secondary reports, which are due after manufacturers have had more time to track engines
to the point of first retail sale. Finally, because of the uncertainty for the manufacturers of the content and timing
of this final rule, EPA will permit manufacturers to submit their revisions to the 1992 model year end-of-year reports
within 15 days after the effective date of this rule. 



IV. Final Rule Requirements 




As a result of today's action, manufacturers of heavy-duty engines participating in the ABT program will be required
to use credits scheduled to expire in the earliest model year before using credits that would expire in later model
years, beginning with reports due in 1993 for the 1992 model year. Furthermore, manufacturers will have an additional
90 days beyond the original deadline for submitting corrections to their end-of-year reports, totalling to 270 days
after the end of the year to submit the final reports. 



Display of OMB Control Numbers 




EPA is also amending the table of currently approved information collection request (ICR) control numbers issued
by OMB for various regulations. This amendment updates the table to accurately display those information requirements
contained in this final rule. This display of the OMB control number and its subsequent codification in the Code of
Federal Regulations satisfies the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.)

 and OMB's implementing regulations at 5 CFR 1320. 

The ICR was previously subject to public notice and comment prior to OMB approval. As a result, EPA finds that there
is ``good cause'' under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) to amend this
table without prior notice and comment. Due to the technical nature of the table, further notice and comment would
be unnecessary. For the same reasons, EPA also finds that there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). 



V. Changes to the Proposed Rule 

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940325-0-00035 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940325-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

No changes were made to the proposed rule. 



VI. Environmental Impact 



EPA believes that the ABT program changes implemented today 
will not interfere with the program safeguards which are designed 
to ensure that overall emissions do not increase with the 
existence of the ABT program. These environmental safeguards 
are: the limit on credit life, the restrictions on averaging 
sets, and the discounting of banked or traded credits. This 
change in credit accounting will result in having more credits 
available for use in MY 1994-1996 than previously anticipated 
under the LIFO credit accounting system.
 However, these 
credits represent emission reductions that have in fact occurred, 
and the credits themselves cannot exist longer than their limited 
credit life. 





Due to the connection between credit information and 
confidential sales information, EPA regulations on the release of 
confidential business information have restricted the public's 
opportunity to review manufacturers' submissions of credit 
generation and usage. EPA is currently discussing with 
participating manufacturers the possibility of finding and 
implementing a means of allowing the public to access enough 
information to make general assessments of the effectiveness of 
the program on a regular basis. The Engine Manufacturers 
Association concurs that it is important to provide an ongoing 
opportunity for the public to evaluate the overall progress of 
the program. EPA and EMA expect to finalize an agreement in the 
near future on the periodic release of credit data in a format 
that would be useful to the public. 



VII. Economic Impact 



The changes made today are minor adjustments to the ABT 
program to remove an unintended disincentive that may inhibit 
manufacturers from participating fully in the ABT program. The 
ABT program is intended to provide the flexibility necessary for 
heavy-duty engine manufacturers to use a mix of emission controls 
in such a way that will minimize the cost of meeting the 
established standards. These changes should help manufacturers 
reduce their costs of compliance with emission standards. 



VIII. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis 



Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order 
defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to 
result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material
way the economy, a 
sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities;

(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere 
with an action taken or planned by another agency; 

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, 
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and 
obligations of recipients thereof; or 

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set 
forth in the Executive Order. 

OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 
review. 



IX. Impact on Small Entities 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires federal 
agencies to consider potentially adverse impacts of federal 
regulations upon small entities. In instances where significant 
impacts are possible on a substantial number of these entities, 
agencies are required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility 
Analysis. 

There will not be a significant adverse impact on a 
substantial number of small business entities due to the changes 
made to the Averaging, Banking, and Trading program, because the 
heavy-duty engine manufacturers affected by these regulations are 
not small business entities. 

Therefore, as required under section 605 of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

, I certify that this 
regulation does not have a significant adverse impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 



X. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements 



The information collection requirements make no changes to 
those currently approved by the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

 
and have been assigned control number 2060-0104. 



XI. Statutory Authority 



Authority for actions promulgated in this final rule are 
granted to EPA by sections 202, 206(a)(1), 207, 208, and 301 of 
the Clean Air Act as amended. 



XII. Judicial Review 



Under section 307(b) of the Clean Air Act, EPA hereby finds 
that these regulations are of national applicability. 
Accordingly, judicial review of this action is available only by 
filing a petition for review in the United States Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit within 60 days of 
publication. Under section 307(b)(2) of the Act, the 
requirements which are the subject of today's notice may not be 
challenged later in judicial proceedings brought by EPA to 
enforce these requirements.

Subpart A_[Amended]



3. A new  86.092-15 is added to Subpart A to read as follows: 



 86.092-15 

NO

X

 and particulate averaging, trading, and banking for heavy-duty engines. 



(a)(1) Heavy-duty engines eligible for the NO

X

 and 
particulate averaging, trading, and banking programs are 
described in the applicable emission standards sections in this 
subpart. Participation in these programs is voluntary. 

(2)(i) Engine families with FELs exceeding the 
applicable standard shall obtain emission credits in a mass 
amount sufficient to address the shortfall. Credits may be 
obtained from averaging, trading, or banking, within the 
averaging set restrictions described in this section. 

(ii) Engine families with FELs below the applicable 
standard will have emission credits available to average, trade, 
bank or a combination thereof. Credits may not be used to offset 
emissions that exceed an FEL. Credits may not be used to remedy 
an in-use nonconformity determined by a Selective Enforcement 
Audit or by recall testing. However, credits may be used to allow 
subsequent production of engines for the family in question if 
the manufacturer elects to recertify to a higher FEL. 

(iii) Credits scheduled to expire in the earliest model 
year shall be used, prior to using other available credits, to 
offset emissions of engine families with FELS exceeding the 
applicable standard. 

(b) Participation in the NO

X

 and/or particulate 
averaging, trading, and banking programs shall be done as 
follows. 

(1) During certification, the manufacturer shall: 

(i) Declare its intent to include specific engine 
families in the averaging, trading and/or banking programs. 
Separate declarations are required for each program and for each 
pollutant (i.e., NO

X

 and particulate). 

(ii) Declare an FEL for each engine family 
participating in one or more of these three programs.

<TEXT>
 

(A) The FEL must be to the same level of significant 
digits as the emission standard (one-tenth of a gram per brake 
horsepower for NO

X

 emissions and one-hundredth of a gram per 
brake horsepower-hour for particulate emissions). 

(B) In no case may the FEL exceed the upper limit 
prescribed in the section concerning the applicable heavy-duty 
engine NO

X

 and particulate emission standards. 

(iii) Calculate the projected emission credits (+/) 
based on quarterly production projections for each participating 
family and for each pollutant (NO

X

 and particulate), using the 
equation in paragraph (c) of this section and the applicable 
factors for the specific engine family. 

(iv)(A) Determine and state the source of the needed 
credits according to quarterly projected production for engine 
families requiring credits for certification. 

(B) State where the quarterly projected credits will be 
applied for engine families generating credits. 

(C) Credits may be obtained from or applied to only 
engine families within the same averaging set as described in 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. Credits available for 
averaging, trading, or banking as defined in  86.090-2, may be 
applied to a given engine famil(y) (ies), or reserved as defined 
in  86.091-2. 

(2) Based on this information each manufacturer's 
certification application must demonstrate: 

(i) That at the end of model year production, each 
engine family has a net emissions credit balance of zero or more 
using the methodology in paragraph (c) of this section with any 
credits obtained from averaging, trading or banking. 

(ii) The source of the credits to be used to comply 
with the emission standard if the FEL exceeds the standard, or 
where credits will be applied if the FEL is less than the 
emission standard. In cases where credits are being obtained, 
each engine family involved must state specifically the source 
(manufacturer/engine family) of the credits being used. In cases 
where credits are being generated/supplied, each engine family 
involved must state specifically the designated use 
(manufacturer/engine family or reserved) of the credits involved. 
All such reports shall include all credits involved in averaging, 
trading or banking. 

(3) During the model year manufacturers must: 

(i) Monitor projected versus actual production to be 
certain that compliance with the emission standards is achieved 
at the end of the model year. 

(ii) Provide the end of-model year reports required 
under  86.091-23. 

(iii) Maintain the quarterly records required under 
 86.091-7(c)(8). 

(4) Projected credits based on information supplied in 
the certification application may be used to obtain a certificate 
of conformity. However, any such credits may be revoked based on 
review of end-of-model year reports, follow-up audits, and any 
other verification steps deemed appropriate by the Administrator. 

(5) Compliance under averaging, banking, and trading 
will be determined at the end of the model year. Engine families 
without an adequate amount of actual NO

X

 and/or particulate 
emission credits will violate the conditions of the certificate 
of conformity. The certificates of conformity may be voided ab 
initio for those engine families. 

(6) If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a 
reporting error occurred on an end-of-year report previously 
submitted to EPA under this section, the manufacturer's credits 
and credit calculations will be recalculated. Erroneous positive 
credits will be void. Erroneous negative credit balances may be 
adjusted by EPA. 

(i) If EPA review of a manufacturer's end-of-year 
report indicates an inadvertent credit shortfall, the 
manufacturer will be permitted to purchase the necessary credits 
to bring the credit balance for that engine family to zero, at 
the ratio of 1.2 credits purchased for every credit needed to 
bring the balance to zero. If sufficient credits are not 
available to bring the credit balance for the engine family in 
question to zero, EPA may void the certificate for that engine 
family ab initio.

(ii) If within 180 days of receipt of the 
manufacturer's end-of-year report, EPA review determines a 
reporting error in the manufacturer's favor (i.e., resulting in a 
positive credit balance) or if the manufacturer discovers such an 
error within 180 days of EPA receipt of the end-of-year report, 
the credits will be restored for use by the manufacturer. For 
the 1992 model year, corrections to the end-of-year reports may 
be submitted until May 9, 1994.

(c)(1) For each participating engine family, NO

X

 and 
particulate emission credits (positive or negative) are to be 
calculated according to one of the following equations and 
rounded, in accordance with ASTM E29-67, to the nearest 
one-tenth of a Megagram (Mg). Consistent units are to be used 
throughout the equation. 

For determining credit need for all engine families and 
credit availability for engine families generating credits for 
averaging programs only: 




Emission credits=(StdFEL) x (CF) x (UL) x (Production) x (106) 




For determining credit availability for engine families 
generating credits for trading or banking programs: 




Emission credits=(StdFEL) x (CF) x (UL) x (Production) x (106) x (0.8) 




Where: 



Std=the current and applicable heavy-duty engine NO

X

 or 
particulate emission standard in grams per brake horsepower hour 
or grams per Megajoule. 

FEL=the NO

X

 or particulate family emission limit for the engine 
family in grams per brake horsepower-hour or grams per Megajoule. 

CF=a transient cycle conversion factor in BHP-hr/mi or MJ/mi, as 
given in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. 

UL=the useful life, or alternative life as described in paragraph 
(f) of  86.090-21, for the given engine family in miles. 

Production=the number of engines produced for U.S. sales within 
the given engine family during the model year. Quarterly 
production projections are used for initial certification. Actual 
production is used for end-of-year compliance determination. 

0.8=a one-time discount applied to all credits to be banked or 
traded within the model year generated. Banked credits traded in 
a subsequent model year will not be subject to an additional 
discount. Banked credits used in a subsequent model year's 
averaging program will not have the discount restored. 





(2) The transient cycle conversion factor is the total 
(integrated) cycle brake horsepower-hour or Megajoules, divided 
by the equivalent mileage of the applicable transient cycle. For 
Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines, the equivalent mileage is 6.3 
miles. For diesel heavy-duty engines, the equivalent mileage is 
6.5 miles. When more than one configuration is chosen by EPA to 
be tested in the certification of an engine family (as described 
in  86.085-24), the conversion factor used is to be based upon 
the configuration generating the highest conversion factor when 
determining credit need and the lowest conversion factor when 
determining credit availability for banking, trading or 
averaging. 

(d) Averaging sets for NO

X

 emission credits: The 
averaging and trading of NO

X

 emission credits will only be 
allowed between heavy-duty engine families in the same averaging 
set and in the same regional category. Engines produced for sale 
in California constitute a separate regional category than 
engines produced for sale in the other 49 states. Banking and 
trading are not applicable to engines sold in California. The 
averaging sets for the averaging and trading of NO

X

 emission 
credits for heavy-duty engines are defined as follows: 

(1) For Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines: 

(i) Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines constitute an 
averaging set. Averaging and trading among all Otto-cycle 
heavy-duty engine families is allowed. There are no subclass 
restrictions. 

(ii) Gasoline-fueled heavy-duty vehicles certified 
under the provisions of  86.085-1(b) may not average or trade 
credits with gasoline-fueled heavy-duty Otto-cycle engines, but 
may average or trade credits with light-duty trucks. 

(2) For diesel cycle heavy-duty engines:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940325-0-00040 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940325-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(i) Each of the three primary intended service classes 
for heavy-duty diesel engines, as defined in  86.090-2, 
constitute an averaging set. Averaging and trading among all 
diesel cycle engine families within the same primary service 
class is allowed. 

(ii) Urban buses are treated as members of the primary 
intended service class where they would otherwise fall. 

(e) Averaging sets for particulate emission credits. 
The averaging and trading of particulate emission credits will 
only be allowed between diesel cycle heavy-duty engine families 
in the same averaging set and in the same regional category. 
Engines produced for sale in California constitute a separate 
regional category than engines produced for sale in the other 49 
states. Banking and trading are not applicable to engines sold in 
California. The averaging sets for the averaging and trading of 
particulate emission credits for diesel cycle heavy-duty engines 
are defined as follows: 

(1) Engines intended for use in urban buses constitute 
a separate averaging set from all other heavy-duty engines. 
Averaging and trading among all diesel cycle bus engine families 
is allowed. 

(2) For heavy-duty engines, exclusive of urban bus 
engines, each of the three primary intended service classes for 
heavy-duty diesel cycle engines, as defined in  86.090-2, 
constitute an averaging set. Averaging and trading between diesel 
cycle engine families within the same primary service class is 
allowed. 

(3) Otto-cycle engines may not participate in 
particulate averaging, trading, or banking. 

(f) Banking of NO

X

 and particulate emission credits: 

(1) 

Credit deposits. 

(i) Under this phase of the 
banking program, emission credits may be banked from engine 
families produced during the three model years prior to the 
effective model year of the new HDE NO

X

 or particulate emission 
standard. Credits may not be banked from engine families made 
during any other model years. 

(ii) Manufacturers may bank credits only after the end 
of the model year and after EPA has reviewed their end-of-year 
report. During the model year and before submittal of the 
end-of-year report, credits originally designated in the 
certification process for banking will be considered reserved and 
may be redesignated for trading or averaging. 

(2) 

Credit withdrawals. 

(i) After being generated, 
banked/reserved credits shall be available for use three model 
years prior to, through three model years immediately after the 
effective date of the new HDE NO

X

 or particulate emission 
standard, as applicable. However, credits not used within the 
period specified above shall be forfeited. 

(ii) Manufacturers withdrawing banked emission credits 
shall indicate so during certification and in their credit 
reports, as described in  86.091-23. 

(3) 

Use of banked emission credits. 

The use of banked 
credits shall be within the averaging set and other restrictions 
described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, and only for 
the following purposes: 

(i) Banked credits may be used in averaging, trading, 
or in any combination thereof, during the certification period. 
Credits declared for banking from the previous model year but 
unreviewed by EPA may also be used. However, they may be revoked 
at a later time following EPA review of the end-of-year report or 
any subsequent audit actions. 

(ii) Banked credits may not be used for NO

X

 or 
particulate averaging and trading to offset emissions that exceed 
an FEL. Banked credits may not be used to remedy an in-use 
nonconformity determined by a Selective Enforcement Audit or by 
recall testing. However, banked credits may be used for 
subsequent production of the engine family if the manufacturer 
elects to recertify to a higher FEL. 

(g) (1) For purposes of this paragraph (g), assume NO

X

 and 
particulate nonconformance penalties (NCPs) will be available for 
the 1991 and later model year HDEs. 

(2) Engine families paying an NCP for noncompliance of 
any emission standard may not: 

(i) Participate in the averaging program, 

(ii) Generate emission credits for any pollutant under 
banking and trading, and 

(iii) Use emission credits for any pollutant from 
banking and trading. 

(3) If a manufacturer has any engine family to which 
application of NCPs and averaging, banking, and trading credits 
is desired, that family must be separated into two distinct 
families. One family, whose FEL equals the standard, must use 
NCPs only, while the other, whose FEL does not equal the 
standard, must use emission credits only.

<DOCNO> FR940325-0-00041 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940325-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) If a manufacturer has any engine family in a given 
averaging set which is using NO

X

 and/or particulate NCPs, none of 
that manufacturer's engine families in that averaging set may 
generate credits for banking and trading. 

(h) In the event of a negative credit balance in a 
trading situation, both the buyer and the seller would be liable. 

(i) Certification fuel used for credit generation must 
be of a type that is both available in use and expected to be 
used by the engine purchaser. Therefore, upon request by the 
Administrator, the engine manufacturer must provide information 
acceptable to the Administrator that the designated fuel is 
readily available commercially and would be used in customer 
service. 

4. Section 86.092-23 is added to subpart A to read as follows: 



 86.092-23 

Required data. 


(a) The manufacturer shall perform the tests required 
by the applicable test procedures, and submit to the 
Administrator the following information: 

Provided, however, 

That 
if requested by the manufacturer, the Administrator may waive any 
requirement of this section for testing of vehicle (or engine) 
for which emission data are available or will be made available 
under the provisions of  86.091-29.

statement that the test procedure(s) used to derive the 
deterioration factors includes, but need not be limited to, a 
consideration of the ambient effects of ozone and temperature 
fluctuations, and the service accumulation effects of vibration, 
time, and vapor saturation and purge cycling. The deterioration 
factor test procedure shall be designed and conducted in 
accordance with good engineering practice to assure that the 
vehicles covered by a certificate issued under  86.091-30 will 
meet the evaporative emission standards in  86.091-10 and 
 86.091-11 in actual use for the useful life of the engine. 
Furthermore, a statement that a description of the test 
procedure, as well as all data, analyses and evaluations, is

gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled engines, a written statement 
to the Administrator certifying that the manufacturer's 
evaporative emission control systems are designed, using good 
engineering practice, to meet the standards of  86.091-10 or 
 86.091-11 (as applicable) as determined by the provisions of 
 86.091-28. Furthermore, a written statement to the 
Administrator that all data, analyses, test procedures, 
evaluations, and other documents, on which the above statement is 
based, are available to the Administrator upon request. 

(c) 

Emission data. 

(1) Emission data, including in the 
case of methanol fuel, methanol, formaldehyde and organic 
material hydrocarbon equivalent on such vehicles tested in 
accordance with applicable test procedures and in such numbers as 
specified. These data shall include zero-mile data, if generated 
and emission data generated for certification as required under 
 86.090-26(a)(3)(i) or  86.090-26(a)(3)(ii). In lieu of 
providing emission data on idle CO emissions, smoke emissions or 
particulate emissions from methanol-fueled diesel certification 
vehicles the Administrator may, on request of the manufacturer, 
allow the manufacturer to demonstrate (on the basis of previous 
emission tests, development tests, or other information) that the 
engine will conform with the applicable emission standards of 
 86.090-8 or  86.090-9. 

(2) 

Certification engines. 

Emission data on such 
engines tested in accordance with applicable emission test 
procedures of this subpart and in such numbers as specified. 
These data shall include zero-hour data, if generated, and 
emission data generated for certification as required under 
 86.090-26(c)(4). In lieu of providing emission data on idle CO 
emissions or particulate emissions from methanol-fueled diesel 
certification engines, or on CO emissions from petroleum-fueled 
or methanol-fueled diesel certification engines the Administrator 
may, on request of the manufacturer, allow the manufacturer to

certification, have been tested in accordance with the applicable 
test procedures utilizing the fuels and equipment described in 
the application for certification and that on the basis of such 
tests the vehicles (or engines) conform to the requirements of 
this part. If such statements cannot be made with respect to any 
vehicle (or engine) tested, the vehicle (or engine) shall be 
identified, and all pertinent data relating thereto shall be 
supplied to the Administrator. If, on the basis of the data 
supplied and any additional data as required by the 
Administrator, the Administrator determines that the test 
vehicles (or test engine) was not as described in the application 
for certification or was not tested in accordance with the 
applicable test procedures utilizing the fuels and equipment as 
described in the application for certification, the Administrator 
may make the determination that the vehicle (or engine) does not 
meet the applicable standards (or family emission limits, as 
appropriate). The provisions of  86.091-30(b) shall then be 
followed.

generated/required, and the NCPs in use on a similar NCP family. 
Manufacturers shall also submit how and where credit surpluses 
were dispersed (or are to be banked) and how and through what 
means credit deficits were met. Copies of contracts related to 
credit trading must also be included or supplied by the broker if 
applicable. The report shall also include a calculation of credit 
balances to show that net mass emissions balances are within 
those allowed by the emission standards (equal to or greater than 
a zero credit balance). The credit discount factor described in 
 86.091-15 must be included as required. 

(iii) The 49-state production counts for end-of-year 
reports shall be based on the location of the first point of 
retail sale (e.g., customer, dealer, secondary manufacturer) by 
the manufacturer. 

(iv) Errors discovered by EPA or the manufacturer in 
the end-of-year report, including changes in the 49 state 
production counts, may be corrected up to 180 days subsequent to 
submission of the end-of-year report. Errors discovered by EPA 
after 180 days shall be corrected if credits are reduced. Errors 
in the manufacturer's favor will not be corrected if discovered 
after the 180 day correction period allowed. 

(i) Failure by a manufacturer participating in the 
averaging, trading, or banking programs to submit any quarterly

programs to submit their end-of-year reports in the applicable 
specified time period (i.e., 90 days after the end of the model 
year) shall result in the credits not being available for use 
until such reports are received and reviewed by EPA. Use of 
projected credits pending EPA review will not be permitted in 
these circumstances. 

(k) Engine families certified using NCPs are not 
required to meet the requirements outlined above.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plan; Illinois 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On July 17, 1992, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) proposed to promulgate Volatile Organic
Compound (VOC) emission limits for coating operations at the General Motors (GM) Electro-Motive Division (EMD)
facility in LaGrange (Cook County, Illinois), as representing Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT)
for EMD's ``topcoat'' and ``final repair coating'' operations. At that time, the USEPA also proposed a compliance
date of one year from the date of final promulgation. In this rule USEPA is promulgating the emission limits and compliance
date. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On June 29, 1990, the USEPA promulgated Federal stationary source VOC control measures representing RACT for emission
sources located in six northeastern Illinois (Chicago area) counties: Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will.
55 FR 26814. The USEPA also took final rulemaking action on certain VOC rules previously adopted and submitted by the
State of Illinois for inclusion in its State Implementation Plan (SIP). 

Among the State rules that the USEPA disapproved was title 35 of the Illinois Administrative Code (35 IAC) subpart
F,  215.204(m), which established VOC limits for ``Existing Diesel-Electric Locomotive Coating Lines in
Cook County.'' The USEPA based this disapproval on its determination that the emission limits prescribed by the State
did not represent RACT for EMD's locomotive coating operations. In lieu of this State rule, the USEPA promulgated
more stringent emission limits for diesel-electric locomotive coating operations, codified at 40 CFR 52.741(e)(1)(i)(M).
The only source affected by this rule is GM's EMD facility in LaGrange, Illinois.
 
In response to the USEPA's actions, pursuant to section 307(d)(7) of the Clean Air Act (ACT), GM filed a petition for
administrative reconsideration with the USEPA Regional Administrator for Region 5.

1

 GM requested that the USEPA reconsider its decision to subject GM to a VOC limit of 3.5 pounds per gallon (lb/gal.) for
its topcoat and final repair coating operations.

2

 






On January 4, 1991 (56 FR 480), and May 31, 1991 (56 FR 24722), the USEPA announced a stay of the emission limitations
and compliance date for EMD's topcoat and final repair coating operations until the USEPA completed its reconsideration.
The USEPA also stated in those rules that the stay was to remain in effect until withdrawn by a subsequent rule, but only
if and as necessary to complete reconsideration. The USEPA further indicated that, upon taking final rulemaking,
it would publish a rule in the 

Federal Register

 notifying the public of the withdrawal of the stay. 

The USEPA also stated in the May 31, 1991, notice that if the reconsideration resulted in emissions limitations and
standards that were stricter than the applicable (on May 31, 1991) Illinois rules, the USEPA would propose a compliance
period of one year from the date of final action on the reconsideration. 

On July 17, 1992, (57 FR 31678), the USEPA proposed VOC RACT limits for EMD topcoat and repair coating operations of
3.5 lb/gal. The USEPA's analysis was based in large part on the fact that this limit was consistent with both the Control
Technique Guidelines (CTG) for miscellaneous metal parts and products; and that coatings meeting this limit were
being used successfully at the General Electric Company's (GE) Erie, Pennsylvania locomotive coating operations.
For more information about the background and substance of these proposed limits, please see the July 17, 1992, proposed
rule. 

Because the 3.5 lbs./gal. limit is more stringent than the Illinois rule in effect on May 31, 1991, the USEPA also proposed
on July 17 to provide a compliance date of one year from the date of final action on reconsideration. This one-year compliance
period was the general compliance period provided in the June 29, 1990, Federal RACT rules. Finally, the USEPA proposed
to withdraw the stay pending reconsideration.

In the July 17 notice, the USEPA established an August 17, 1992 deadline for public comment. At the request of GM, USEPA
extended the comment period to September 16, 1992, (57 FR 42536). 



Comments by General Motors 



On September 15, 1992, GM submitted comments to the USEPA on the proposal. In its comments, GM objected to the USEPA's
reliance on the information concerning the GE facility as ``data which is to a critical degree secret and completely
beyond scrutiny or verification.'' GM further stated that this information was the USEPA's sole basis for its proposal.
GM added, however, that if the USEPA decides to promulgate the 3.5 lb/gallon limits, then it should adopt the proposed
compliance date of one year from promulgation date. GM stated that this was the ``minimum period which can reasonably
be provided for compliance.'' In response to these comments, the USEPA maintains that its reliance on the GE data is
entirely appropriate. The data relied upon by the USEPA, and available in the August 1991 RACT analysis for this rule
(which is included in the rulemaking docket), include ``Specification and Properties'' sheets that indicate coating
type and use, and the maximum applied VOC content at the GE facilities (3.5 lb/gal. for all primers, topcoats and final
repair coats). Information in the RACT analysis also shows that those coatings are required to pass GE's tests for
adhesion, gloss, color and other critical properties. While the suppliers of the complying coatings used by GE are
not identified (because of claims of business confidentiality asserted by GE), the availability of these coatings
is clearly established. 

Although the GE data is compelling, the USEPA also rejects GM's claim that this was the USEPA's sole basis of its proposal.
The July 17, 1992 rulemaking notice also cites the following factors as support: (1) The CTG for miscellaneous metal
parts specifies a VOC limit of 3.5 lb/gal. as a presumptive RACT level, (2) the 

USEPA Region III issued a SIP deficiency letter to Pennsylvania finding that its 4.3 lb/gal. limit for locomotive
coatings was deficient, and needed to be changed to 3.5 lb/gal., (3) Pennsylvania has lowered its locomotive and heavy-duty
truck topcoat limit to 3.5 lb/gal. based on a finding that such coatings are available to the industries involved;
and (4) GM did not adequately support its technical arguments. 



Final Rulemaking Action 



The USEPA has reviewed GM's comments, as well as the information identified in the July 17, 1992 proposed rule, and
determined that the proposed emission limits of 3.5 lb/gal. for EMD's topcoat and final repair coating operations
constitute RACT. As stated in the USEPA's proposed rule, compliance with these limits is required no later than one
year from the date of today's promulgation. Also as proposed, the USEPA is withdrawing the May 31, 1991, stay pending
reconsideration. 

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, the USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, the USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises
and government entities with jurisdictions over populations of less than 50,000. 

This action involves only one source, EMD. EMD is not a small entity. Therefore, the USEPA certifies that this disapproval
action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

Under Executive Order 12866, this action is not ``Major.'' It has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget
for review.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Louisiana Stage II Program


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA is taking action to approve the Louisiana 
Stage II State Implementation Plan (SIP), which includes a SIP Supplement dated November 15, 1992, and State regulations
(title 33, chapter 21. Control of Emission of Organic Compounds, section 2132. Stage II Vapor Recovery Systems for
Control of Vehicle Refueling Emissions at Gasoline Dispensing Facilities, and section 6523. Fee Schedule Listing),
as a revision to the Louisiana SIP for ozone. On November 10, 1992, Louisiana submitted a SIP revision request to the
EPA to satisfy the requirement of section 182(b)(3) of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990. This SIP revision
requires owners and operators of gasoline dispensing facilities to install and operate Stage II vapor recovery equipment
in the Louisiana ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or worse. This revision applies to the Louisiana
parishes of Ascension, East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge, Iberville, Livingston, and Pointe Coupee.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under section 182(b)(3) of the CAAA, the EPA was required to issue guidance as to the effectiveness of Stage II systems.
The EPA issued technical guidance in November 1991 and enforcement guidance in December 1991 to meet this requirement.

1

 In addition, on April 16, 1992, the EPA published the ``General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990'' (General Preamble) (57 FR 13498). The guidance documents and the General Preamble interpret
the Stage II statutory requirement and indicate what the EPA believes a State submittal needs to include to meet that
requirement.




The EPA has designated the Baton Rouge and Lake Charles areas as ozone nonattainment in the State of Louisiana. The
Baton Rouge nonattainment area is classified as serious and contains the following six parishes: Ascension, 
East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge, Iberville, Livingston, and Pointe Coupee. The Lake Charles ozone nonattainment
area is classified as marginal and therefore is not required to implement a Stage II program. The designations for
ozone were published in the FR on November 6, 1991, and November 30, 1992, and have been codified in the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR). See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (November 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.300
through 81.437. Under section 182(b)(3) of the CAAA, Louisiana was required to submit Stage II vapor recovery rules
for the Baton Rouge nonattainment area by November 15, 1992. On November 10, 1992, Governor Edwin W. Edwards submitted
to the EPA, Stage II vapor recovery rules and a SIP Supplement dated November 15, 1992, which were adopted by the State
on November 10, 1992, and were published in the Louisiana Register on November 20, 1992. By today's action, the EPA
is approving this submittal. The EPA has reviewed the State submittal against the statutory requirements and for
consistency with EPA guidance. A summary of the EPA's analysis is provided below. In addition, a more detailed analysis
of the State submittal is contained in a TSD, dated September 24, 1993, which is available from the EPA Region 6 Office,
listed above.

Applicability


Under section 182(b)(3) of the CAAA, States were required by November 15, 1992, to adopt regulations requiring owners
or operators of gasoline dispensing systems to install and operate vapor recovery equipment at their facilities.
The CAAA specifies that these State rules must apply to any facility that dispenses more than 10,000 gallons of gasoline
per month or, in the case of an independent small business marketer, any facility that dispenses more than 50,000 gallons
of gasoline per month. Section 324 of the CAAA defines an independent small business marketer, which is fully set forth
in the TSD. The State has adopted the statutory definition of independent small business marketer in its regulations.
The State has adopted a general applicability requirement of 10,000 gallons per month. The State has also chosen to
exempt independent small business marketers dispensing under 50,000 gallons per month.
As more fully discussed in the EPA's Enforcement Guidance and the General Preamble (57 FR 13514), the State has provided
that the gallons of gasoline dispensed per month will be based on the average gasoline throughput for the most recent
two year period without facility shutdown, and calculated monthly. If two year data is not available, the calculation
is based on the monthly average for the most recent 12 calendar months (including only those months for which the facility
was operating). The EPA finds the applicability requirements in the Louisiana Stage II rule to be acceptable.


Implementation of Stage II


The CAAA specifies the time by which certain facilities must comply with the State regulation. For facilities that
are not owned or operated by an independent small business marketer, these times, calculated from the time of State
adoption of the regulation, are: (1) Six months for facilities for which construction began after November 15, 1990;
(2) one year for facilities that dispense at least 100,000 gallons of gasoline per month; and (3) two years for all other
facilities. The Louisiana Stage II rule time schedule sets a compliance schedule of six months after State rule promulgation,
one year after State rule promulgation, and two years after State rule promulgation, respectively for the above three
deadlines. For independent small business marketers, section 324(a) of the CAAA provides that the time periods may
be: (1) 33 percent of the facilities owned by an independent small business marketer by the end of the first year after
the regulations take effect; (2) 66 percent of such facilities by the end of the second year; and (3) 100 percent of such
facilities after the third year. Although Louisiana promulgated its Stage II regulations on November 20, 1992, five
days after the SIP was required to be submitted, the EPA believes it is appropriate to accept the State's compliance
schedule.
The EPA is approving the submitted time table for the following reasons. First, the CAAA states that the adoption date
must be used to calculate the compliance schedule for Stage II implementation at facilities. In this case, the EPA
accepts Louisiana's approach of triggering compliance dates from the date when the regulations were promulgated.
The compliance deadlines triggered by this date begin only five days after the time schedule specified by the CAAA.
The EPA considers an additional five days to be of minimal impact and will have no adverse impact on the integrity of
the program. Also, the timetable initiation date established by the State on November 20, 1992, began shortly after
adoption of the regulations. Secondly, remedying this deficiency by amending the compliance schedule would cause
further delay in the implementation of Stage II in Louisiana, in that a State revision to the Stage II rule could establish
a new and later adoption date and hence later compliance deadlines. Lastly, the Louisiana rule otherwise fulfills
the Stage II requirements, and the EPA believes it will provide substantial air quality benefits to the regulated
area. Therefore, the EPA believes it is in the public interest to approve and make enforceable this requirement at
the earliest time feasible.


Additional Program Requirements


The State requires that Stage II systems be tested and certified to meet a 95 percent emission reduction efficiency.
The EPA has indicated three acceptable methods of demonstrating a 95 percent emission reduction efficiency: (1)
A method tested and approved by the California Air Resources Board (CARB); (2) a testing program that is equivalent
to the CARB program, that will be conducted by the Program Oversight Agency (POA), or by a third party recognized by
the POA, and submitted and approved by the EPA for incorporation into the SIP; or (3) a system approved by the CARB. The
State has chosen to use a system approved by the CARB, or an equivalent certification authority approved by the administrative
authority*. The State regulations define the administrative authority* to include both the State Department of
Environmental Quality and the EPA. Thus, equivalent system certification authorities would have to be formally
approved by the EPA and could be incorporated into the SIP.
The State requires sources to verify proper installation and function of Stage II equipment through use of a liquid
blockage test and a leak test prior to system operation and every five years or upon major modification of a facility's
Stage II equipment (i.e., 75 percent or more Stage II equipment change).

<PARENT> FR940325-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

With respect to recordkeeping, the State has adopted those items recommended in the EPA's guidance and specifies
that 
sources subject to Stage II must make the following documents 
available upon request: (1) Application approval records and station operating license; (2) system installation
and testing results; (3) equipment maintenance and compliance records; (4) training certification files; and (5)
inspection records. In addition, the State has committed in its SIP supplement to maintain general station and enforcement
files, including information such as facility name, address, phone number, owner/operator names, a State assigned
reference number, date of initial compliance with the regulations, number of pumps, monthly gasoline throughput,
and State enforcement actions. The State has also established an inspection function consistent with that described
in the EPA's guidance. The State commits to conducting inspections of facilities including a visual inspection of
the Stage II equipment and of the required records and a functional test of the Stage II equipment. According to the
Supplement, the State shall inspect each facility at least one time per year. Finally, the State has established procedures
for enforcing violations of the Stage II requirements. Civil penalties may be assessed of up to $25,000 per day per
violation. The EPA finds the State's program for implementation and enforcement of the Stage II program to be consistent
with the EPA guidelines. 



Rulemaking Action



Since the EPA finds that the State has adopted a Stage II SIP in accordance with section 182(b)(3) of the CAAA, as interpreted
in the EPA's guidance, the EPA is giving notice of its intent to approve the submittal as a direct final action meeting
the requirements of section 182(b)(3). 

The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the EPA views this as a noncontroversial revision
and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will become effective May 24, 1994, unless by April 25, 1994 notice
is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn
before the effective date by publishing two subsequent documents. One document will withdraw the final action, and
another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no
such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective May 24, 1994. 

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to a SIP shall be considered in light of specific technical, economical,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 



Regulatory Process 



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAAA forbids the EPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

Union Electric Co. 

v. 

U.S. E.P.A.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)). 

This action has been classified as a table two action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published
in the FR on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived
table two and table three SIP revisions from the requirements of section three of Executive Order 12291 for a period
of two years (54 FR 2222). The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for table two and table three SIP revisions.
The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on the EPA's request. This request is still applicable
under Executive Order 12866.

Preliminary Assessment Information and Health and Safety Data Reporting; Addition of Chemicals; Stay of Certain
Reporting Requirements
 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; stay. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is staying certain provisions of a final rule which was published in the 

Federal Register

 of December 27, 1993, adding chemical substances to two model information-gathering rules: The Toxics Substances
Control Act (TSCA) Section 8(a) Preliminary Assessment Information Rule (PAIR) and the TSCA Section 8(d) Health
and Safety Data Reporting Rule. EPA received correspondence requesting clarification of the chemical identities
of certain propylene glycol ethers and esters and the removal of certain other propylene glycol ethers and esters
from the reporting requirement. EPA is staying the final rule as it relates to chemical substances under the category
propylene glycol ethers and esters in order to resolve these issues and determine those chemical substances on which
reporting will be required. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of December 27, 1993 (58 FR 68311), EPA added 24 chemical substances and two categories of substances to both the PAIR
and the section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule. Any person believing section 8(a) or 8(d) reporting required
by this rule to be unwarranted was given opportunity to provide EPA in detail the reasons for that belief. 



EPA received correspondence from several chemical companies and the Chemical Manufacturers Association's (CMA)
Propylene Glycol Ether Panel which raised questions concerning the appropriate identification of some chemicals
listed under the category propylene glycol ethers and esters and requested that certain chemical substances in this
category be removed from the rule. These substances were among those recommended for testing by the Interagency Testing
Committee (ITC) and added to the section 4(e) Priority List in its 31st Report to the EPA Administrator. Pursuant to
40 CFR 712.30(c) and 716.105(b), EPA routinely adds substances to the TSCA 8(a) and 8(d) rules when the ITC adds substances
to the section 4(e) Priority List.

To provide sufficient time for EPA and ITC member agencies to review these issues, EPA is staying the provisions of
the final rule that relate to the category propylene glycol ethers and esters. EPA will announce, via notice in the


Federal Register

, the final reporting requirements for this category when the issues have been resolved.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Memorandum Opinion and Order (

MO&O

) finalizes the spectrum allocation, service rules, and pioneer's preference decisions for the narrowband personal
communications service (PCS). This action is taken in response to eight petitions for reconsideration and clarification
of the First Report and Order (

R&O

). These rules are intended to foster introduction of this new service to the public, contribute to development of
the national information infrastructure, and provide for ubiquitous wireless access to new voice and data services.
Facilitating the introduction of these services will create new jobs and promote U.S. competitiveness in the global
telecommunications market.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a synopsis of the Commission's 

MO&O

 in GEN Docket No. 90-314 and ET Docket No. 92-100, adopted February 3, 1994, and released March 4, 1994.
The complete text of this 

MO&O

 is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center (Room 239), 1919
M Street, NW., Washington, DC, and also may be purchased from the Commission's duplication contractor, International
Transcription Service, (202) 857-3800, 2100 M Street, NW., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037.


Synopsis of MO&O


1. In the 

R&O

, 58 FR 42681 (August 11, 1993), the Commission defined PCS very broadly to encompass a wide variety of mobile and ancillary
fixed communication services, which could provide services to individuals and business, and be integrated with
a variety of competing networks. Narrowband PCS was defined as PCS services operating in the 901-902 MHz, 930-931
MHz and 940-941 MHz bands. Narrowband PCS services are expected to include advanced voice paging, two-way acknowledgment
paging, data messaging, and both one-way and two-way messaging and facsimile. Three megahertz (MHz) of spectrum
were allocated for narrowband PCS services; 2 MHz were made available for immediate licensing and 1 MHz remains to
be addressed in the future. A channel plan was adopted based on 50 kHz-wide channels with 26 channels generally available
to all interested parties. In addition, eight 12.5 kHz-wide (paging response) channels were made available only
to existing paging licensees. Three different-sized PCS service areas were adopted: Nationwide, areas based on
Major Trading Areas (MTAs), and areas based on Basic Trading Areas (BTAs). (MTAs and BTAs are defined in Rand McNally's
1992 Commercial Atlas & Marketing Guide at pages 38-39.) Eleven channels were made available on a nationwide
basis; 13 channels were made available on a MTA basis; and 10 channels, including the 8 paging response channels, were
made available on a BTA basis. Each entity was permitted to acquire up to three licenses per geographic area. Geographic-based
construction requirements were adopted that required nationwide licensees to construct 250 base stations in 5 years
and 500 base stations in 10 years; MTA licensees to construct 25 base stations or serve 25 percent of the MTA's geographic
area in 5 years and to construct 50 base stations or serve 50 percent of the MTA's area in 10 years; and BTA licensees to
construct 1 base station and initiate service in 1 year. In order for a base station to be counted toward the required
number of base stations, the base station had to serve 3,000 square kilometers (km2). Base stations that serve less
than this area had to be aggregated to form an equivalent service area. Finally, in the 

R&O

 the Commission granted Mobile Telecommunication Technologies, Inc. (Mtel) a pioneer's preference for a nationwide
50 kHz-wide channel for developing and testing ``multicarrier modulation'' technology capable of transmitting
a 24 kilobit per second simulcast signal in a single 50 kHz channel and for designing a system capable of providing a
variety of new two-way services in a single 50 kHz channel. An additional 18 pioneer's preference requests were denied.
On reconsideration, in the 

MO&O

 the Commission took the following action:

2. 

Service definition.

 PageMart, Inc. (PageMart) requested that traditional paging services be excluded from the new narrowband PCS spectrum,
arguing that the Commission provided no safeguards to ensure that the spectrum would be used for advanced messaging
and paging services. The Commission declined to amend the board definition of service adopted in the 

R&O

, stating that it would not be desirable to limit the range of services and technologies that are allowed to use these
frequencies and that the definition adopted in the 

R&O

 will allow the market to determine the mix of services and technologies that best meets the needs of the public.


3. 

Channel plan.

 PageMart requested that a greater variety in the size of channels be provided, arguing that the channel plan would
limit efficient use of this spectrum, encourage warehousing and speculation, and inhibit development of services
that require either smaller or larger channels. The Commission declined to amend the 50 kHz-based channel plan adopted
in the 

R&O

, stating that the services proposed in this docket would be best accommodated by its 50 kHz-based channel plan, with
aggregation possibilities, as adopted.


4. 

Service areas.

 Paging Network, Inc. (PageNet) requested that larger local and regional service areas be provided, arguing that
BTAs are technically unworkable, not representative of existing local paging systems, and not economically viable;
and that MTAs pose technical difficulties and are not representative of existing regional services. The Commission
responded that MTAs contain sufficient population and geographic area to support viable services and retained MTAs
for service areas. However, the Commission revised its service areas to include five large regions in addition to
BTAs, MTAs and nationwide. The Commission stated that the regions better reflect the technologies and business plans
of the parties proposing to implement large regional systems. The new five large regions are based upon aggregations
of MTAs, and each has approximately 20 percent of the nation's population. See  99.102, 

infra.

 The Commission also amended the spectrum plan to accommodate the new regional service areas, as follows:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940325-0-00055 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940325-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, the Commission amended the rules governing the paging response channels to provide that four channels
will be available on an MTA basis and four on a BTA basis. The Commission stated that designating response channels
at the MTA level as well as at the BTA level will make it easier for operators of wider area local and regional systems
to upgrade and coordinate their paging operations.

5. 

Multiple licenses.

 PageMart requested that the limit on acquisition of multiple licenses be reconsidered, arguing that some licensees
could hold 300 kHz (three 50 kHz paired channels) and that other licensees would be restricted to significantly less
spectrum because each license is for a smaller channel. PageMart also requested that the Commission clarify that
existing paging spectrum held by licensees not be counted toward the limit and that existing paging licensees be limited
to two paging response channels per geographic area. In response, the Commission clarified that licensees are limited
to a total of three licenses, excluding the response channels reserved for the upgrade of exiting paging systems and
also excluding existing paging spectrum. Additionally, the Commission clarified application of the multiple ownership
limits by defining narrowband PCS licensees as persons or entities with an ownership interest of five or more percent
in an entity holding a narrowband PCS license. The Commission agreed with PageMart that the conditions for use of the
paging response channels required clarification and thus specified that an ``existing'' paging licensee means
a paging licensee authorized under parts 22 or 90 as of June 24, 1993, that the existing paging licensee must operate
at least one base station in the MTA or BTA for which it requests a response channel, and that the response channels may
be used only for mobile-to-base transmissions. The Commission limited existing paging licensees to two response
channels per geographic area, stating that this will allow an opportunity for existing paging licensees to provide
acknowledgement and messaging capability.

6. 

Construction requirement.

 Mtel requested that a population-based construction requirement be adopted as an alternative to the geographic
coverage standard, arguing that such a standard would emphasize service to the public. In related requests, PageMart
and PageNet asked that the method for counting base stations that serve less than 3000 km

2

 be clarified so that a licensee can be certain when it has satisfied its construction obligations. In response to these
petitions, the Commission amended the construction requirements as follows. Nationwide narrowband PCS licensees
shall construct base stations that provide coverage to a composite area of 750,000 square kilometers or serve 37.5
percent of the U.S. population within five years of initial license grant date; and, shall construct base stations
that provide coverage to a composite area of 1,500,000 square kilometers or serve 75 percent of the U.S. population
within ten years of initial license grant date. Regional narrowband PCS licensees shall construct base stations
that provide coverage to a composite area of 150,000 square kilometers or serve 37.5 percent of the population of the
service area within five years of initial license grant date; and, shall construct base stations that provide coverage
to a composite area of 300,000 square kilometers or serve 75 percent of the service area population within ten years
of initial license grant date. MTA narrowband PCS licensees shall construct base stations that provide coverage
to a composite area of 75,000 square kilometers or 25 percent of the geographic area, or serve 37.5 percent of the population
of the service area within five years of initial license grant date; and, shall construct base stations that provide
coverage to a composite area of 150,000 square kilometers or 50 percent of the geographic are, or serve 75 percent of
the population of the service area within ten years of initial license grant date. The Commission stated that these
new coverage requirements eliminate the need to specify a specific number of stations and eliminate any previous
ambiguity that may have occurred for base stations serving less than 3000 km

2

. The Commission also stated that by including alternative population coverage requirements, it can better ensure
that licensees provide new and better service to the public, that such service is implemented promptly, and that the
spectrum is efficiently utilized. The BTA construction requirement was not amended.

7. 

Pioneer's preference. 

Pacific Bell, PageMart, and PageNet requested that Mtel be required to pay for its license, that Mtel be required to
build the system it proposed, that Mtel not be granted a license before other applicants, and, that Mtel be granted
a license for less than a nationwide service area. The Commission declined to require that Mtel pay for its license,
stated that Mtel's license application will be processed in due course, and affirmed Mtel's pioneer grant for a nationwide
channel. For the license that Mtel may receive as a pioneer, the Commission required Mtel to build a system that substantially
uses the design and technologies upon which its preference award was based and to hold its license for at least three
years or until the five-year construction benchmark is met, whichever occurs first. 

8. Additionally, Advanced Cordless Technologies, Inc. (ACT), Echo Group L.P. (Echo), Freeman Engineering Associates,
Inc. (Freeman), and Global Enhanced Messaging Venture (Global) requested reconsideration of the denial of their
pioneer's preference requests. ACT's petition was dismissed as untimely filed. Echo's petition was denied because:
(1) The two-way data service it proposed was initially designed for implementation in services in which its use already
is authorized; (2) Echo did not demonstrate how its proposal differs from existing or proposed two-way data services
on cellular or land mobile frequencies; (3) Echo did not demonstrate with specificity the developments for which
it is responsible; and (4) Echo did not explain how it derives its cost figures. Freeman's petition was denied because
its system is incompatible with the licensing rules. Global's petition was denied because its system does not qualify
as innovative under the Commission's rules. 

9. Accordingly, it is ordered that part 99 of the Commission's rules is amended as specified below, effective April
25, 1994. 

10. It is further ordered that the petitions for clarification or reconsideration filed by Mobile Telecommunication
Technologies, Inc., Paging Network, Inc., and PageMart, Inc. are granted in part as discussed 

supra 

and ARE DENIED in all other respects. 

11. It is further ordered that the petitions for reconsideration filed by Echo Group L.P., Freeman Engineering Associates,
Inc., and Global Enhanced Messaging Venture ARE DENIED and that the petition for reconsideration filed by Advanced
Cordless Technologies, Inc. is dismissed. 

12. It is further ordered that the licensing bureau shall impose the following conditions on the license received
by Mobile Telecommunication Technologies, Inc. (Mtel) pursuant to its pioneer's preference award: (1) Mtel shall
be required to build a system that substantially uses the design and technologies upon which its preference award
was based; and (2) Mtel must hold its license for three years or until the construction requirements applicable to
the five-year build-out period specified in  99.103 of the Commission's rules have been satisfied, whichever
occurs first. It is further ordered that the petitions filed by Pacific Bell, Paging Network, Inc., and PageMart,
Inc. addressing Mtel's pioneer's preference award are granted to this extent and, in all other respects, are denied.


13. This action is taken pursuant to sections 4(i), 7(a), 302, 303(c), 303(f), 303(g), and 303(r) of the Communications
Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i), 157(a), 302, 303(c), 303(f), 303(g), and 303(r).

5. Section 99.103 is revised to read as follows:


 99.103

Construction requirements.


(a) Nationwide narrowband PCS licensees shall construct base stations that provide coverage to a composite area
of 750,000 square kilometers or serve 37.5 percent of the U.S. population within five years of initial license grant
date; and, shall construct base stations that provide coverage to a composite area of 1,500,000 square kilometers
or serve 75 percent of the U.S. population within ten years of initial license grant date.
(b) Regional narrowband PCS licensees shall construct base stations that provide coverage to a composite area of
150,000 square kilometers or serve 37.5 percent of the population of the service area within five years of initial
license grant date; and, shall construct base stations that provide coverage to a composite area of 300,000 square
kilometers or serve 75 percent of the service area population within ten years of initial license grant date.
(c) MTA narrowband PCS licensees shall construct base stations that provide coverage to a composite area of 75,000
square kilometers or 25 percent of the geographic area, or serve 37.5 percent of the population of the service area
within five years of initial license grant date; and, shall construct base stations that provide coverage to a composite
area of 150,000 square kilometers or 50 percent of the geographic area, or serve 75 percent of the population of the
service area within ten years of initial license grant date.
(d) BTA narrowband PCS licensees shall construct at least one base station and begin providing service in its BTA within
one year of initial license grant date.
(e) In demonstrating compliance with the above construction requirements, licensees must base their calculations
on signal field strengths that ensure reliable service for the technology utilized.
(1) For the purpose of this section, the service radius of a base station may be calculated using the following formula:




d

km

 = 2.53  x  h

m



0.34

  x  p

0.17






where d

km

 is the radial distance in kilometers,
h

m

 is the antenna HAAT of the base station in meters, and
p is the e.r.p. of the base station in watts.



(2) Alternatively, licensees may use any service radius contour formula developed or generally used by industry,
provided that such formula is based on the technical characteristics of their system.

(f) Upon meeting the five and ten year benchmarks in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section, licensees shall file
a map and other supporting documentation that demonstrates compliance with the geographic area or population coverage
requirement. BTA licensees shall file a statement indicating commencement of service. The filing must be received

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Designated Ports for Listed Plants 




<AGENCY>

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (the Service) hereby amends the regulations concerning the importation, exportation,
and reexportation of plants by adding the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) ports at Mobile, AL, Savannah, GA,
Baltimore, MD, Morehead City and Wilmington, NC, Philadelphia, PA, Charleston, SC, and Norfolk, VA, as designated
ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees that are listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered
Species Act of 1973, as amended (the Act), or listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The Service is also designating the USDA port at Wilmington, NC, as a port for the exportation
of Venus flytrap (

Dionaea muscipula

) plants. The USDA has adequate facilities and personnel at these ports to qualify the ports as designated ports for
the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants under the terms of the Act and CITES. The addition of these
ports to the list of designated ports will facilitate trade and the enforcement of the Act and CITES.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (the Act), requires, among other things, that plants be imported, exported,
or reexported only at designated ports or, under certain limited circumstances, at nondesignated ports. Section
9(f) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1538[f]) provides for the designation of ports. Under section 9(f)(1), the Secretary of
the Interior (the Secretary) has the authority to establish designated ports based on a finding that such an action
would facilitate enforcement of the Act and reduce the costs of that enforcement. The United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) and the Secretary are responsible for enforcing provisions of the Act and the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) relating to the importation, exportation, and reexportation
of plants listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under CITES. 

The regulations in 50 CFR part 24, ``Importation and Exportation of Plants,'' are for the purpose of establishing
ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants. Plants that are listed as endangered or threatened
in 50 CFR 17.12 or in the appendices to CITES in 50 CFR 23.23 are required to be accompanied by documentation and may be
imported, exported, or reexported only at one of the USDA ports listed in section 24.12(a) of the regulations. Certain
other USDA ports are designated for the importation, exportation, or reexportation of specific listed plants. Section
24.12(e) of the regulations contains a list of USDA ports that are, for the purposes of the Act and CITES, designated
ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants that are not listed as endangered or threatened.
(The USDA regulations in 7 CFR 319.37 contain additional prohibitions and restrictions governing the importation
of plants through those ports.) 

In a July 21, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice (58 FR 39003), the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposed that the USDA ports at Mobile,
AL, Savannah, GA, Baltimore, MD, Morehead City and Wilmington, NC, Philadelphia, PA, Charleston, SC, and Norfolk,
VA, be listed as designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees that are listed as endangered or
threatened under the Act or CITES. The Service further proposed to designate the port at Wilmington, NC, as a port for
the exportation of Venus flytrap (

Dionaea muscipula

) plants. Finally, the Service acted to correct a typographical error in the regulations. 



Comments Submitted 



The Service's July 21, 1993, notice invited the submission of written comments regarding the proposal for a 60-day
comment period ending on September 20, 1993. Four comments were received by that date, from a lumber company, a lumber
trade association, a U.S. Senator, and a State port authority. All four commenters asked that Gulfport, MS, be added
to the list of designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees that are listed as endangered or threatened
under the Act or CITES. In addition, one of the commenters asked that the ports at Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, also
be added to that list.

The Service has consulted with the USDA regarding the addition of Gulfport, MS, Vancouver, WA, and Portland, OR, to
the list of designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees that are listed as endangered or threatened
under the Act or CITES. Those consultations were necessary to determine whether the ports possess adequate facilities
and personnel to carry out enforcement activities related to the Act and CITES. As a result of those consultations,
the Service believes that Gulfport, MS, Vancouver, WA, and Portland, OR, could be added to the list of designated ports
for the importation of logs and lumber from trees that are listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed
under CITES. However, because they were not listed in the July 21, 1993, proposed rule, Gulfport, MS, Vancouver, WA,
and Portland, OR, cannot be added to the list of designated ports in this final rule. Therefore, the Service intends
to include those three ports in a new proposed rule for publication in the 

Federal Register

. 

In this final rule, the Service has changed the order in which the ports are listed in new paragraph (e) of section 24.12.
The ports are now listed in alphabetical order, by State, in order to simplify any future amendments to the paragraph.




Requests for Public Hearing 



Section 9(f)(1) of the Act provides that any person may request an opportunity to comment at a public hearing before
the Secretary of the Interior confers designated port status on any port. Accordingly, the Service's July 21, 1993,
notice invited public hearing requests, which were required to be received by the Service on or before September 3,
1993. No such requests were received. 



Treasury Department Approval to Designate Proposed Ports 



Section 9(f)(1) of the Act also provides, in part that: 

``For the purpose of facilitating enforcement of this chapter and reducing costs thereof, the Secretary of the Interior,
with approval of the Secretary of the Treasury and after notice and opportunity for public hearing, may, by regulation,
designate ports and change such designations.'' 

Approval from the Secretary of the Treasury was obtained in accordance with these provisions. 

Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, the Service is adopting the provisions
of the proposal as a final rule with the changes discussed in this document. 



Effective Date 



The effect of this rule is to grant an exemption from 16 U.S.C. 1538(f), which generally prohibits importation of wildlife
and plants except at such ports as may be designated. Accordingly, it may be given immediate effect under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1),
which permits a rule that ``grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction'' to be given immediate effect.




Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review under Executive Order 12866. 

The Service believes that establishing the USDA ports at Mobile, AL, Savannah, GA, Baltimore, MD, Morehead City and
Wilmington, NC, Philadelphia, PA, Charleston, SC, and Norfolk, VA, as designated ports for the importation of logs
and lumber from trees listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under CITES will have a positive economic
impact. These ports are major ports of entry for logs and lumber, but they had not been designated as ports for the importation
of logs and lumber from listed trees. Before the effective date of this rule, importers wishing to import logs and lumber
from listed trees into a port on the east coast of the United States could use only Hoboken, NJ, or Miami, FL, and importers
wishing to import logs and lumber from listed trees into a U.S. port on the Gulf of Mexico could use only Brownsville
and Houston, TX, and New Orleans, LA. Establishing Mobile, AL, Savannah, GA, Baltimore, MD, Morehead City and Wilmington,
NC, Philadelphia, PA, Charleston, SC, and Norfolk, VA, as designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber
from trees listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under CITES will result in a savings in time and
transportation costs for importers of logs and lumber. 

The Service also believes that establishing Wilmington, NC, as a designated port for the exportation of Venus flytrap
plants will have a positive economic impact. The Venus flytrap occurs chiefly in North Carolina and also in South Carolina.
Before the inclusion of the Venus flytrap in appendix II of CITES became effective on June 11, 1992, exporters of the
Venus flytrap had been able to use Wilmington, NC, and other USDA ports for the exportation of their plants. After June
11, 1992, however, those exporters were required to send their plants through ports designated for the importation,
exportation, or reexportation of listed plants, with Miami, FL, and Hoboken, NJ, being the closest such ports to North
Carolina and South Carolina. Establishing Wilmington, NC, as a designated port for the exportation of Venus flytrap
will result in a savings in time and transportation costs for exporters of the plant. 

Under these circumstances, the Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic effect
on a substantial number of small entities, as described in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601).

Executive Order 12372 



This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive
Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015,

Executive Order 12778 



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. The Office of the Solicitor has
determined that the requirements of Executive Order 12778 have been satisfied. 



National Environmental Policy Act 



The Service has determined that this final rule adding designated ports under authority of the Endangered Species
Act of 1973 for the importation and exportation of plants is not a major Federal action which will significantly affect
the quality of the human environment within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969.

Final rule.







</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NMFS issues a final rule to reduce the proportion of pollock roe that may be retained onboard a vessel during a fishing
trip in the Alaska groundfish fisheries. This action is necessary to implement a statutory prohibition against the
wasteful use of pollock by stripping roe (eggs) from female pollock and discarding female and male pollock carcasses
without further processing, commonly known as pollock roe stripping, and to promote the goals and objectives of the
Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska and the FMP for the Groundfish Fisheries of the Bering
Sea and Aleutian Islands Area with respect to groundfish management off Alaska. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Fishing for groundfish by U.S. vessels in the exclusive economic zone of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and the Bering Sea
and Aleutian Islands area (BSAI) is managed by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) under the FMPs for Groundfish
of the GOA and for the Groundfish Fisheries of the BSAI. The FMPs were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) and are implemented
by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR parts 672 and 675. General regulations that also
pertain to U.S. fisheries appear at 50 CFR part 620.

This action reduces the proportion of pollock roe that may be retained onboard a vessel relative to other pollock products
on board the vessel during a fishing trip from 10 to 7 percent. A reduction in the proportion of pollock roe that may be
retained is one of several measures contained in a proposed rule, which invited comment through September 23, 1993
(58 FR 44643, August 24, 1993). The measure proposed at that time would have reduced the retainable roe proportion
specified in the regulations from 10 percent to 5 percent. Seven letters of comments were received that addressed
the retainable pollock roe proportion. They are summarized and responded to in the 

Comments Received 

section of this preamble. 

Other measures contained in the proposed rule published on August 24, 1993, would establish standard product types
and recovery rates for groundfish products. Those measures are still under review by NMFS and will be covered in a separate
final rule. 



Changes From the Proposed Rule



The proposed rule would have amended   672.20(i) and 675.20(j) of title 50 CFR to specify 0.05, rather
than 0.10, as the allowable ratio of pollock roe to the round weight equivalents of other pollock products that may
be onboard a vessel during a trip. NMFS has determined that the current 10 percent proportion of roe that is allowed
to be retained when harvesting pollock is too high, given actual proportions that resulted during the 1991, 1992,
and 1993 pollock fisheries in the BSAI, and that it should be reduced to 7 percent rather than to 5 percent as proposed.
Under a roe retention rate of 10 percent, processors could ``top off'' with amounts of pollock roe by stripping roe
from subsequent pollock catches and discarding the carcasses. 

Actual amounts of roe produced during the 1992 and 1993 pollock roe seasons show that processors typically produced
pollock roe as an ancillary product as intended by the BSAI FMP. Roe production resulted in an overall proportion of
less than 4 percent of pollock primary products. However, NMFS recognizes that this proportion represents an overall
average proportion. Although NMFS acknowledges variation in pollock production throughout a season, individual
processors may achieve higher proportions by topping off retained amounts of pollock round-weight equivalents
with additional pollock roe. To allow too high a proportion could encourage this ``topping of'' practice. 

In determining that 7 percent should be the applicable limit, NMFS reviewed 1993 roe recovery information during
the roe pollock fishing season, which was conducted between January 20 and April 15. These vessels were typically
participating under Community Development Quotas during 1993 and achieved roe recoveries during a time when roe
recovery was optimal. Data from 12 participating vessels, which produced 1,422 mt of pollock roe from 31,772 mt of
retained pollock catch, show that the average roe recovery was 0.045 during the roe pollock fishing season. The highest
average roe proportion achieved by any one vessel participating under Community Development Quotas was 0.072. The
lowest proportion achieved by one of the 12 vessels was 0.020. An allowable proportion of 0.07 (rounded to the nearest
100th) would minimize amounts of roe that might be discarded as a result of regulations, while still complying with
the intent of the Magnuson Act to prohibit roe stripping. Therefore, NMFS is implementing 0.07 as the allowable proportion
of roe as measured against other pollock products rather than 0.05 as proposed.



Response to Comments



This action responds to concerns expressed in public testimony that the previously allowed retainable roe proportion
of 10 percent does not successfully prohibit roe stripping. No additional comments to that effect were received during
the comment period provided by the proposed rule. Seven comments were received from industry participants, primarily
expressing concern that the proposed reduction to 5 percent would result in unnecessary economic loss to the industry.



Comment 1: 

The proposed reduction from 0.10 to 0.05 of allowable pollock roe that may be retained is too low and will result in substantial
economic loss. Average roe recoveries have been substantially lower than 0.10, which means that the average vessel
is not topping off its retained pollock production with pollock roe. The average vessel, therefore, is not stripping
pollock roe, and the reduction is not necessary. 



Response: 

NMFS has decided to reduce the limit to 7 percent rather than 5 percent. Seven percent is the highest average roe proportion
achieved by any one vessel for which NMFS has records during the 1993 directed fishery for roe-bearing pollock. NMFS
does not concur that substantial economic loss will result. Maintaining the existing 10 percent limit could encourage
roe stripping when the average recovery is substantially less. This would be inconsistent with the Magnuson Act,
which prohibits roe stripping. 



Comment 2: 

The proposed reduction in the amount of retainable pollock roe will discriminate against the offshore fleet.
 


Response: 

When the Council developed Amendments 14 and 19 to the FMPs for the BSAI and GOA, it considered several options for implementing
the Magnuson Act's ban on roe stripping. The Council's recommended alternative was based, in part, on the fact that
the agency's ability to regulate on shore processing is limited under the Magnuson Act. Shorebased processing facilities
may be subject to a State of Alaska policy that pollock roe stripping be eliminated to the fullest extent possible (AS
16.10.164).

The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA) has determined that this rule is necessary to promote compliance
with the Magnuson Act prohibition of stripping pollock of its roe and discarding the flesh of the pollock (16 U.S.C.
1857(1)(N)). 
The Alaska Region, NMFS, prepared a final regulatory flexibility analysis as part of the EA/RIR/FRFA prepared for
final rulemaking, which concludes that this rule will have significant effects on a substantial number of small entities.
The FRFA concludes that reducing the allowable proportion to 0.07 for retained pollock roe is superior to the 

status quo

 alternative in which the allowable proportion is 0.10. In 1992, actual roe recovery rates achieved by shore-based
and at-sea processors were 0.037 and 0.034, respectively. In 1993, the actual roe recovery rate achieved by shorebased
processors was 0.026. Some at-sea processors achieved roe recoveries of 0.072 during a time when roe maturation was
likely optimum. The recovery rate of 0.07 is not expected to be constraining and will better achieve the intent of the
Council and the Magnuson Act to prohibit pollock roe stripping. A copy of the EA/RIR/FRFA may be obtained from NMFS
(see 

ADDRESSES

This rule is not subject to review under E.O. 12866.

round-weight equivalent of pollock, as calculated from the primary pollock product onboard the vessel during the
same fishing trip as defined in this paragraph (i). Determinations of allowable retention of pollock roe will be based
on amounts of pollock harvested, received, or processed during a single fishing trip. Pollock or pollock products
from previous fishing trips that are retained onboard a vessel may not be used to determine the allowable retention
of pollock roe for that vessel.



* * * * *



(6) 

Calculation of the amount of retainable pollock roe. 

To calculate the amount of pollock roe that can be retained onboard during a fishing trip, first calculate the round-weight
equivalent by dividing the total amount of primary product onboard by the appropriate product-recovery rate. To
determine the amount of pollock roe that can be retained during the same fishing trip, multiply the round-weight equivalent
by 0.07. The result is the maximum amount of pollock roe that can be retained onboard during that fishing trip. Pollock
roe retained onboard from previous fishing trips will not be counted, for purposes of this paragraph (i)(6). If two
or more products, other than roe, are made from different fish, then round-weight equivalents are calculated separately
for each product. Round-weight equivalents are then added together, and the sum multiplied by 0.07 to determine the
maximum amount of pollock roe that can be retained onboard a vessel during a fishing trip. However, if two or more products,
other than roe, are made from the same fish, then the maximum amount of pollock roe that can be retained during a fishing
trip is determined from the primary product.

(j) 

Allowable retention of pollock roe. 

(1) For purposes of this paragraph (j), pollock roe means product comprised of pollock eggs, either loose or in sacs
or skeins. Pollock roe retained onboard a vessel at any time during a fishing trip must not exceed 7 percent of the total
round-weight equivalent of pollock, as calculated from the primary pollock product onboard the vessel during the
same fishing trip as defined in this paragraph (j). Determinations of allowable retention of pollock roe will be based
on amounts of pollock harvested, received, or processed during a single fishing trip. Pollock or pollock products
from previous fishing trips that are retained onboard a vessel may not be used to determine the allowable retention
of pollock roe for that vessel.

Natural Resource Damage Assessments 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of the Interior. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule amends the regulations for assessing natural resource damages resulting from a discharge of oil into
navigable waters under the Clean Water Act or a release of a hazardous substance under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. The Department of the Interior has previously developed two types of
natural resource damage assessment regulations: standard procedures for simplified assessments requiring minimal
field observation (the type A rule); and site-specific procedures for detailed assessments in individual cases
(the type B rule). 



This final rule revises the type B rule to comply with all but one aspect of a court order. This rule establishes a procedure
for calculating natural resource damages based on the costs of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring
the equivalent of injured resources. This rule also allows for the assessment of all use values of injured resources
that are lost to the public pending completion of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
of equivalent resources. The Department will soon issue a new proposed rule to address assessment of lost nonuse values
of injured resources.

I. Background 



A. Statutory Provisions 



The Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) (CWA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) (CERCLA) authorize natural resource trustees to recover
compensatory damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources resulting from a discharge of oil
into navigable waters or a release of a hazardous substance. CWA sec. 311(f); CERCLA sec. 107. Federal and State officials
may be designated to serve as natural resource trustees under CERCLA and CWA. CERCLA also recognizes the authority
of Indian tribes to commence actions as natural resource trustees. 

Damages may be recovered for those natural resource injuries and losses that are not fully remedied by response actions.
All sums recovered in compensation for natural resource injuries must be used to restore, rehabilitate, replace,
or acquire the equivalent of the injured natural resources. Trustee officials may also recover the reasonable costs
of assessing natural resource damages and any prejudgment interest. 

CERCLA requires the promulgation of two types of regulations for the assessment of natural resource damages resulting
either from a discharge of oil under CWA or from a release of a hazardous substance under CERCLA. CERCLA sec. 301(c).
The type A regulations provide standard procedures for simplified assessments requiring minimal field observation.
The type B regulations provide site-specific procedures for detailed assessments. Both regulations identify the
best available procedures for determining natural resource damages. Assessments performed by Federal and State
trustee officials in accordance with these regulations receive a rebuttable presumption in court. CERCLA sec. 107(f)(2)(C).
The promulgation of these regulations was delegated to the Department of the Interior (the Department). E.O. 12316,
as amended by E.O. 12580. 

The Oil Pollution Act (33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) (OPA) was signed into law on August 18, 1990. Among other things, OPA amended
the natural resource damage provisions of CWA. OPA authorized the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) to develop new natural resource damage assessment regulations for discharges of oil into navigable waters.
The Department is coordinating its rulemakings with NOAA to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that consistent
processes are established for assessing natural resource damages under CERCLA and OPA. OPA provides that until NOAA
develops its regulations, the Department's regulations may be used to assess natural resource damages under OPA.
OPA sec. 6001(b). NOAA published a proposed natural resource damage assessment rule on January 7, 1994. 59 FR 1062.




B. Regulatory History 



The Department has issued various final rules for the assessment of natural resource damages: 51 FR 27674 (Aug. 1,
1986); 52 FR 9042 (March 20, 1987); 53 FR 5166 (Feb. 22, 1988); and 53 FR 9769 (March 25, 1988). These rulemakings are
all codified at 43 CFR part 11.

<TEXT>
 

The natural resource damage assessment regulations provide an administrative process for conducting assessments
as well as technical methods for the actual identification of injuries and calculation of damages. Under the regulations,
both type A and type B, assessments consist of four major phases. 
The first phase of an assessment conducted under the regulations involves the activities that precede the actual
assessment. For example, upon detecting or receiving notification of a discharge or release, trustee officials
perform a preassessment screen to ascertain whether further assessment actions are warranted. 
The second phase involves the preparation of an Assessment Plan. The Assessment Plan, which is subject to public review
and comment, assists the involvement of potentially responsible parties (PRPs), other trustee officials, the general
public, and any other interested parties. The Assessment Plan also ensures that assessments are performed at a reasonable
cost. 
In the third phase, trustee officials conduct the work described in the Assessment Plan. The work involves three steps:
Injury Determination; Quantification; and Damage Determination. In Injury Determination, trustee officials
determine whether any natural resources have been injured. If trustee officials determine that resources have been
injured, they proceed to Quantification, in which they quantify the resulting reduction in services provided by
the resources. Finally, in Damage Determination, trustee officials calculate the monetary compensation to be sought
as damages for the natural resource injuries. 
In a type A assessment, trustee officials perform Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination
through the use of standardized procedures involving minimal field work. The Department has adopted a phased approach
to developing type A procedures for different environments. Only one type A rule has been developed to date. The existing
type A rule provides for the use of a computer model to assess damages from small releases or discharges in coastal or
marine environments. For other releases or discharges, trustee officials conduct a type B assessment, in which Injury
Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination are performed through the use of a range of alternative
scientific and economic methodologies. 
The fourth phase of every natural resource damage assessment, whether the type A or type B rule is followed, consists
of post-assessment activities such as: Preparation of a Report of Assessment; establishment of an account for damage
assessment awards; and development of a Restoration Plan for use of the awards. 


C. Judicial Review 


A party may petition the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review any regulation issued under
CERCLA. CERCLA sec. 113(a). A number of parties filed such petitions for review of the natural resource damage assessment
regulations. The type A rule was challenged in 

State of Colorado

 v. 

United States Department of the Interior

, 880 F.2d 481 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (

Colorado

 v. 

Interior

). The type B rule was challenged in 

State of Ohio

 v. 

United States Department of the Interior

, 880 F.2d 432 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

). 
The court in 

Ohio 

v.

 Interior

 upheld various challenged aspects of the type B rule but did remand three issues. The court ordered the Department
to revise the rule to reflect the statutory preference for using restoration costs as the measure of natural resource
damages. The court used the term ``restoration costs'' to encompass the cost of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing,
and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured natural resources. The court also ordered the Department to revise
the rule to allow for the recovery of all reliably calculated lost values of injured natural resources, including
both lost use values and lost nonuse values, with no specific hierarchy of methodologies required of trustee officials
in estimating those values. Use values are derived through activities such as hiking or fishing. Nonuse values are
not dependent on use of the resource. Nonuse values include existence value, which is the value of knowing that a resource
exists, and bequest value, which is the value of knowing that a resource will be available for future generations.
Finally, the court asked the Department to clarify whether the natural resource damage assessment regulations apply
to natural resources that are not actually owned by the government. 


D. Implementation of the Court Order 


The Department published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on September 22, 1989, to announce its intent to
revise the type B rule to comply with 

Ohio

 v.

 Interior

. 54 FR 39016. The Department issued a proposed rule on April 29, 1991, with comments requested by June 28, 1991. 56 FR
19752. On July 2, 1991, the Department extended the comment period to July 16, 1991. 56 FR 30367. On July 22, 1993, the
Department reopened the comment period to allow consideration of additional comments, including newly developed
information on the contingent valuation methodology (CV), the only method currently available for the express purpose
of estimating nonuse values. 58 FR 39328. The comment period was originally reopened until September 7, 1993, and
then extended until September 22, 1993. 58 FR 45877 (Aug. 31, 1993).

After reviewing the comments received in response to the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice, the Department has decided to issue a final rule addressing all aspects of the 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 remand other than the assessment of lost nonuse values. The Department is considering revising the type B rule to include
certain standards to improve the reliability of CV when used to calculate lost nonuse values. In order to ensure that
interested parties have an adequate opportunity for review and comment, the Department will soon publish the standards
in a notice of proposed rulemaking. Pending completion of that rulemaking, the Department is temporarily leaving
unchanged the remanded language of the original type B rule concerning assessment of lost nonuse values. 


E. Other Rulemakings 


CERCLA mandates biennial review and revision, as appropriate, of the natural resource damage assessment regulations.
The Department plans to publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to begin the biennial update of the type B
rule in July 1994. All aspects of the administrative process and the type B rule will be subject to review during that
update. During the biennial review, the Department will consider ways of ensuring the greatest possible consistency
between its damage assessment regulations and the damage assessment regulations being developed by NOAA. 
Further, the Department plans to publish a proposed rule to revise the type A procedure for coastal and marine environments
in compliance with 

Colorado

 v. 

Interior

 in November 1994. The Department is also developing an additional type A procedure for assessing damages in the Great
Lakes. Like the type A procedure for coastal and marine environments, the type A procedure for the Great Lakes will
incorporate a computer model. The Department expects to publish a proposed rule for the type A procedure for the Great
Lakes in August 1994. 


II. Overview of This Final Rule 


A. Measure of Damages 


The type B rule as originally published on August 1, 1986, provided that damages consisted of the lesser of the cost
of restoring the injured resources or the diminution in the value of the injured resources without restoration. In


Ohio

 v. 

Interior

, the court ordered the Department to revise the rule to reflect the statutory preference for using restoration costs
as the measure of natural resource damages. CERCLA provides that sums recovered in natural resource damage actions
may be used to restore, rehabilitate, replace, or acquire the equivalent of the injured natural resources. The court
used the simple term ``restoration'' costs as shorthand for the cost of performing any of these actions. 880 F.2d at
441. In many cases, trustee officials will likely use damage awards to fund some combination of these actions, rather
than only one. Therefore, the final rule allows trustee officials to recover the costs of restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources in all cases.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940325-0-00072 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940325-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The court recognized the Department's authority to establish

 

* * * some class of cases where other considerations_i.e. infeasibility of restoration or grossly
disproportionate cost to use value_warrant a [measure of damages other than the costs of restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources]. Id. at 459.

 

However, the Department believes that trustee officials will always perform some, albeit occasionally minor, form
of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. Even in situations
where natural recovery is the preferred action, trustee officials will nonetheless incur some costs, such as the
expense of restricting public access or taking other actions to ensure that natural recovery is not impeded. Therefore,
the final rule does not include any exceptions to the basic measure of damages. Moreover, the rule also provides trustee
officials with the discretion to add to the basic measure of damages the value of the resource services lost to the public
from the date of the discharge or release until restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of
equivalent resources has been completed. 


B. Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan 


To assist trustee officials in developing claims under the new measure of damages, the rule provides for the development
of a Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan. The Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan replaces
the Restoration Methodology Plan discussed in the original version of the rule. The Restoration and Compensation
Determination Plan is designed to focus the scope of Damage Determination. The Restoration and Compensation Determination
Plan is part of the overall Assessment Plan and, thus, subject to public review and comment. 


1. Selection of a Restoration, Rehabilitation, Replacement, and/or Acquisition Alternative 


Since damages are based on the costs of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent of
the injured resources, trustee officials need a mechanism for projecting these costs. The rule includes a procedure
for selecting a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative that can be used in this
projection. 
Under the rule, trustee officials first identify and consider a reasonable number of possible alternatives for restoring,
rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured resources. Trustee officials also estimate
those services that are likely to be lost to the public pending completion of each alternative under consideration.
Trustee officials then select one of the possible alternatives. The rule lists factors that trustee officials must
consider during the selection. The relative weight of these factors is left to the discretion of the trustee officials.
Trustee officials document their decisions in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan. 


2. Calculation of the Costs of Restoration, Rehabilitation, Replacement, and/or Acquisition of Equivalent Resources



Once the trustee officials select a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative,
they must choose the methods they intend to use to estimate the costs of implementing that alternative. To do this,
trustee officials select among the specific cost estimating methodologies provided in the rule. The rule provides
a number of criteria to guide the selection of cost estimating methodologies, including a requirement that the chosen
methodologies are reliable for the particular incident and type of damage being measured. Trustee officials include
the rationale for their selection in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan. 


3. Calculation of Compensable Value 


Under this rule, the costs of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured
resources are the basic measure of damages; however, these costs are only one component of the damages that trustee
officials may assess. Trustee officials also have the discretion to assess the value of the services that the public
lost from the date of the release or discharge until completion of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or
acquisition of equivalent resources. The final rule uses the term ``compensable value'' to encompass all of the lost
public economic values, including lost use values and lost nonuse values such as existence and bequest values. The
Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan includes a description of the valuation methodologies trustee
officials intend to use when estimating compensable value during Damage Determination.

a. 

Use values.

 The original type B rule provided a ranked list of valuation methodologies that could be used to calculate lost use
values. If the market for the injured resource was ``reasonably competitive,'' then the diminution of the market
price attributable to the discharge or release was used to estimate damages. If a market-price methodology was not
available, then the trustee officials were required to use appraisal methodologies. Only when neither market-price
nor appraisal methodologies were appropriate for the resources being assessed did the original version of the rule
allow trustee officials to use non-market-based methodologies. 
The court ruled that the hierarchy of valuation methodologies incorrectly established a strong presumption in favor
of market-price and appraisal methodologies. The proposed rule continued to rank valuation methodologies according
to reliability but allowed trustee officials to use any of the methodologies whenever they wanted, notwithstanding
the ranking. In light of potential confusion over the practical effect of the ranking in the absence of any restrictions
on trustee officials' selections, the Department has eliminated the ranking from the final rule. The final rule leaves
trustee officials free to choose any of the specified valuation methodologies. The rule provides a number of criteria
to guide the selection of valuation methodologies, including a requirement that the chosen methodologies are reliable
for the particular incident and type of damage being measured. Trustee officials include the rationale for their
selection in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan. 
b. 

Nonuse values

. Sections 11.83(b)(2) and 11.83(d)(5)(ii) of the original version of the type B rule provided that lost nonuse values
could only be assessed if trustee officials could not determine any lost use values. In the August 1, 1986, preamble
to the original type B rule, the Department provided the following explanation for this restriction:

 

Ordinarily, option and existence values would be added to use values. However, section 301(c) of CERCLA mentions
only use values. Therefore, the primary emphasis in this section is on the estimation of use values. 51 FR 27719.

 



Ohio 

v. 

Interior

 held that the Department had ``erroneously construed the statute,'' stating:

 

[S]ection 301(c)(2) requires Interior to ``take into consideration factors including, 

but not limited to

 * * * use value.'' 42 U.S.C.  9651(c)(2) (emphasis added). The statute's command is expressly
not limited to use value; if anything, the language implies that DOI is to include in its regulations other factors
in addition to use value. 880 F.2d at 464.

 

The court went on to say that the Department_

 

* * * is entitled to rank methodologies according to its view of their reliability, but it cannot base
its complete exclusion of option and existence values on an incorrect reading of the statute. Id.

 

The court instructed the Department to consider a rule that would permit trustee officials to include all reliably
calculated lost values in their damage assessments. Id. 


CV is currently the only method available for the express purpose of estimating nonuse values. CV can also be used to
calculate use values. Under the original type B rule, CV was listed as a non-market-based methodology for calculating
either lost use values or lost nonuse values. 

Ohio 

v.

 Interior

 held that the Department's decision to include CV as a best available procedure was not improper. Id. at 478. However,
the court did not require the Department to allow unlimited use of CV. Moreover, the court did not address the difference
between use of CV to calculate lost use values and use of CV to calculate lost nonuse values. 
The Department received numerous comments on the use of CV. These comments focused on use of CV to estimate lost nonuse
values rather than lost use values. In the April 29, 1991, notice of proposed rulemaking, the Department stated that
``[w]hen CVM is used to quantify use values alone, it is judged to be just as reliable as the other nonmarket valuation
methodologies.'' 56 FR 19762. Commenters did not dispute this assertion and have not provided any information to
the contrary, even though the Department specifically solicited ``reviews of CVM that address its reliability for
measuring use values'' in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice. 58 FR 39329. Thus, this final rule allows trustee officials to use CV to assess lost use values subject only
to the restrictions applicable to any of the listed methodologies for assessing lost use values. However, during
the upcoming biennial review of the type B rule, the Department will reconsider whether additional standards for
the use of CV to estimate lost use values are appropriate.

<TEXT>
 

Nonuse values, unlike use values, are not linked to behavior and, thus, are more difficult to validate externally
than use values. Therefore, the Department will soon be issuing a proposed set of standards to improve the reliability
of CV when used to estimate lost nonuse values. This final rule renumbers   11.83(b)(2) and 11.83(d)(5)(ii)
of the original rule, which restrict the assessment of lost nonuse values to cases where lost use values cannot be determined,
as new   11.83(c)(1)(iii) and 11.83(c)(2)(vii)(B), respectively. However, pending completion of
the rulemaking concerning assessment of lost nonuse values, the Department is temporarily leaving unchanged the
language of renumbered   11.83(b)(2) and 11.83(d)(5)(ii), which was remanded by 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior.


C. Resources Covered by the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Regulations


The final issue remanded by Ohio 

v. 

Interior 

concerns the scope of the resources covered by the rule. The rule as originally published incorporated the statutory
definition of ``natural resources.'' This definition encompasses any resource_



Belonging to, managed by, held in trust by, appertaining to, or otherwise controlled by the United States * * *,
any State or local government, any foreign government, or any Indian tribe, or, if such resources are subject to a trust
restriction on alienation, any member of an Indian tribe. CERCLA sec. 101(16).



The court in 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior 

noted that, although CERCLA does not authorize recovery of damages for injuries to purely private resources, the
statutory definition of ``natural resources'' is clearly not limited to resources literally owned by a government.
880 F.2d at 460. Similarly, in its oral argument in 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior, 

the Department recognized that applicability of CERCLA's natural resource damage provisions does not hinge solely
on ownership. Id. at 461. However, the August 1, 1986, preamble to the final type B rule stated that ``section 101(16)
of CERCLA clearly indicates that privately owned natural resources are not to be included in natural resource damage
assessments.'' 54 FR 27696. Therefore, the court asked the Department to clarify whether the natural resource damage
assessment regulations may be used to assess damages for injuries to any resources that are not owned by the government.
The Department never intended to suggest that the applicability of the regulations hinges solely on ownership of
a resource by a government entity. The rule is available for assessments of all natural resources covered by CERCLA,
which under the plain language of the statute includes more than just resources owned by the government. Section 11.14(z),
which was not affected by this rulemaking, incorporates the statutory definition of ``natural resource.'' The rule
does not interpret this statutory definition. This final rule does, however, add a requirement that trustee officials
prepare statements explaining the bases for their assertions of trusteeship. This statement must be included both
in the Notice of Intent to Perform an Assessment, which is sent to PRPs, and in the Assessment Plan, which is subject
to public review and comment.


D. Other Significant Issues


This final rule addresses two additional issues related to the court order:
(1) Development of a preliminary estimate of damages; and
(2) The date of promulgation of the natural resource damage assessment regulations.


1. Preliminary Estimate of Damages


Under  11.35 of the rule as originally published, the determination of the appropriate measure of damages was
made in the Economic Methodology Determination. In the Economic Methodology Determination, trustee officials
were required to estimate both the costs of restoring the injured resources and the diminution in the value of the injured
resources without restoration. The smaller value served as the measure of damages. The Economic Methodology Determination
was then used to help trustee officials develop an Assessment Plan.
Under this final rule, damages always include the costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
of equivalent resources. Therefore, the Department has eliminated the Economic Methodology Determination. However,
the Economic Methodology Determination served a function that is still relevant under the revised rule. CERCLA provides
that trustee officials may recover the costs of performing an assessment, but only if those costs are reasonable.
Under the definition of ``reasonable cost'' in  11.14(ee), which was not affected by this rulemaking, the anticipated
cost of the assessment must be expected to be less than the anticipated damage amount. Under the original rule, the
damage estimates developed during the Economic Methodology Determination helped trustee officials design their
Assessment Plans so that this standard was met. In order to continue assisting trustee officials in performing assessments
at reasonable costs in the absence of the Economic Methodology Determination, this final rule requires trustee officials
to prepare a preliminary estimate of damages before they begin the development of an Assessment Plan.

2. Date of Promulgation of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Regulations



CERCLA provides that natural resource damage claims other than those involving Federal facilities or sites on the
National Priorities List must be commenced by Federal and State trustee officials:




* * * within 3 years after the later of the following:

(A) The date of the discovery of the loss and its connection with the release in question.

(B) The date on which regulations are promulgated under section 301(c). CERCLA sec. 113(g)(1).




Neither the language nor the legislative history of CERCLA defines the date of promulgation of the natural resource
damage assessment regulations under section 301(c).



There has been considerable confusion over this statutory provision in the aftermath of 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior 

and 

Colorado 

v. 

Interior. 

The natural resource damage assessment regulations are designed to calculate a monetary damage figure for injuries
to natural resources. 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior 

and 

Colorado 

v. 

Interior 

remanded a fundamental issue, namely the measure of damages. Until the court orders are fully implemented, trustee
officials are left without a complete procedure for calculating damages consistent with the provisions of CERCLA.
Therefore, the Department has amended the rule to clarify that for the purposes of section 113(g)(1) of CERCLA, the
``date on which regulations are promulgated'' is the date on which final rules revising both the type A rule and the
type B rule in compliance with 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior 

and 

Colorado 

v. 

Interior 

are published.



III. Response to Comments



The Department received numerous comments on the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice. The Department appreciates the time and effort expended by the commenters. This notice does not address any
of the comments received concerning the use of CV to calculate lost nonuse values. Those comments will be addressed
in the Department's upcoming notice of proposed rulemaking to revise the original language of the type B rule concerning
the assessment of nonuse values.

With respect to comments outside the confines of the 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior 

remand, the Department has for now simply reproduced guidance provided in prior 

Federal Register

 notices and indicated that further clarification is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. During the upcoming biennial
review, the Department will carefully consider all of the comments submitted during this rulemaking that were beyond
the scope of the court remand. Commenters need not resubmit these comments during the biennial review.



A. General Comments Concerning this Rulemaking



1. Scope of This Rulemaking


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940325-0-00076 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940325-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Comment:

 Some commenters objected to the Department's decision to defer consideration of certain issues until the next biennial
review. These commenters stated that all matters relating to the measure of damages should be addressed in this rulemaking.




Response:

 As was explained in the April 29, 1991, notice of proposed rulemaking, the Department decided to limit this rulemaking
to the court order in light of the potentially wide-ranging issues that will be considered during the biennial review.
The Department believes that it has considered all issues within the scope of the 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 remand. 



2. Timing of This Rulemaking 





Comment:

 Several commenters expressed concern that the Department was proceeding too slowly on implementation of 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 and 

Colorado

 v. 

Interior

 and commencement of the biennial review. 



Response:

 Implementation of 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 and 

Colorado

 v. 

Interior

 and commencement of the biennial review have involved considerable, time-consuming analysis and coordination.
The Department has been proceeding, and will continue to proceed, as expeditiously as possible. 



3. Goal of This Rulemaking 





Comment:

 One commenter stated that the Department had failed to articulate clear goals for this rulemaking. This commenter
offered suggestions on possible goals, including promotion of timely, cost-effective restoration. Another commenter
requested that the Department attempt to eliminate ambiguity and vagueness from the rule in order to reduce transaction
costs. 



Response:

 Section 11.11, which was not affected by this rulemaking, states that the purpose of the regulations is to provide
standardized and cost-effective procedures for assessing natural resource damages. The Department has indicated
that the primary goal of this particular rulemaking is to revise the type B rule to comply with 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

. The Department believes that promotion of timely, cost-effective restoration and elimination of ambiguity and
vagueness are worthy objectives and has attempted to further those objectives to the extent possible within the context
of addressing the court order. The Department will consider whether additional revisions are necessary during the
upcoming biennial review. 



4. Regulatory Impact Analysis 





Comment:

 A few commenters disagreed with the Department's statement that this rulemaking is not ``major'' under Executive
Order 12291 and, thus, does not require preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis. These commenters challenged
a number of aspects of the Determination of Effects prepared for the proposed rule. 



Response:

 Executive Order 12291 has been rescinded since the Department prepared the Determination of Effects for the proposed
rule. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 and has been determined to constitute a significant
regulatory action. However, because of the difficulty of evaluating the effects of alternatives to this rule, the
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget has waived preparation of
the assessments described in sections 6(a)(3)(B) and 6(a)(3)(C) of Executive Order 12866 for the final rule. 



5. Status of Prior Unpublished Notice of Final Rulemaking 





Comment:

 A number of commenters objected to the publication of the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice on the ground that the Department had already sent a notice of final rulemaking to the Office of the Federal Register
in January, 1993, that was never published. 



Response:

 The Department acknowledges that its former Assistant Secretary-Policy, Management and Budget sent a notice of
final rulemaking to the Office of the Federal Register in January, 1993. The Department retrieved the notice from
the Office of the Federal Register before it was filed out of concern that proper procedures had not been followed in
connection with its preparation. Most notably, the notice improperly referred to and relied upon information received
outside the comment period and had not received proper Departmental clearance. The Department, therefore, believes
it was appropriate to retrieve the notice and publish the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice to reopen the comment period. 



B. Overall Damage Assessment Process 



1. Trustee Discretion 





Comment:

 A number of commenters addressed the level of discretion that the proposed rule would afford trustee officials. Many
commenters thought that trustee officials are in the best position to determine how to proceed at a specific site and
praised the flexibility of the proposed rule. On the other hand, several commenters thought that the rule would delegate
too much authority to trustee officials. These commenters stated that the language and legislative history of section
301(c) of CERCLA, through reference to ``protocols,'' ``best available procedures,'' and ``most accurate and efficient
procedures,'' require that the Department develop substantive objective standards. According to these commenters,
the proposed rule relies upon subjective standards that will lead to arbitrary and capricious results. These commenters
expressed concern that the Department was placing too much reliance on public review and comment to curb potential
abuses of discretion by trustee officials. 






</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940325-0-00077 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940325-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response:

 The Department believes the rule appropriately balances the need for objective procedures against the need for flexibility.
In order to comply with the statutory requirement to identify best available procedures for assessing natural resource
damages, the Department has developed a detailed, standardized process that incorporates a specific range of acceptable
alternative methodologies. However, the type B rule was also intended to have broad application. Natural resource
damage cases range from situations involving discrete injury of one resource caused by a small, incidental release
of a single substance to incidents involving extensive injury of multiple resources caused by large, long-term releases
of mixtures of substances. In light of the myriad of possible natural resource damage scenarios, a type B rule that
mandates a particular course of action at each stage of every assessment would generally be unusable or result in unreasonable
assessment costs. Therefore, in certain areas the rule allows trustee officials to use their best judgment. 
Although trustee officials do have some discretion, the rule imposes a number of checks on that discretion. The rule
requires trustee officials to document the rationale for their decisions. The rule also provides an opportunity
for public comment and review of trustee officials' actions, which the Department believes will ensure a significant
level of accountability for trustee officials. Also, the Department notes that all decisions made by trustee officials
will ultimately be reviewable in court. Therefore, the rule includes criteria by which courts can evaluate trustee
decisions. 


2. Public and PRP Involvement 




Comment:

 Several commenters voiced opinions about the opportunity for PRP and public participation in the assessment process.
Some commenters stated that the proposed rule would provide an appropriate level of public and PRP participation.
Other commenters thought that the Department should encourage earlier involvement of PRPs to encourage settlement
and avoid duplication of effort. A few commenters suggested that the rule be revised to clarify that trustee officials
are authorized to allow PRPs to conduct assessment work. 


Response:

 This final rule does not affect the level or timing of PRP or public participation in the natural resource damage assessment
process. The Department agrees that early participation of PRPs in the assessment process promotes amicable settlement
of natural resource damage claims but does not think that any revisions of the rule are necessary in this regard. 
Section 11.32(d) already provides trustee officials with the discretion to allow PRPs to conduct assessment work.
However, as was stated in the August 1, 1986, preamble:

 

The Department's intention has always been that the decision to allow or not to allow potentially responsible parties
to participate in the implementation of the Assessment Plan should rest solely with the authorized official, or the
lead authorized official, when appropriate. 
Furthermore, a decision to allow such participation should only be made when the authorized official believes that
a fair and accurate damage assessment will result from the potentially responsible party's participation and will
be ensured through adequate direction, guidance, and monitoring by the authorized official * * *.
The Department emphasizes that any and all actions taken by potentially responsible parties to implement an Assessment
Plan occur under the ultimate approval and authority of the authorized official acting as trustee. The potentially
responsible party functions in a strictly ministerial role. The final choice of methodologies rests solely with
the authorized official. 51 FR 27704.



Further clarification is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 


3. Separate Assessments for Each Injury 




Comment:

 Some commenters stated that the rule should encourage trustee officials to perform separate assessments for each
injury in order to facilitate settlement. 


Response:

 Natural resources are generally highly interdependent. The selection of methods to address one injured resource
will often affect the selection of methods to address other resources. Therefore, the rule leaves it to the discretion
of the trustee officials whether separate assessments should be conducted for each injury. Further clarification
is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 


4. Focus of Assessments 




Comment:

 Some commenters stated that the Department should take precautions to ensure that trustee officials do not undertake
unnecessary basic research when performing damage assessments. These commenters suggested that the Department
provide a list of sources of existing scientific data and prohibit trustee officials from performing new research
unless there are no existing data regarding the effect of the particular substance on the particular natural resources
involved. 


Response:

 As was noted in the August 1, 1986, preamble to the original type B rule:

 

General research studies are not compensable under a damage assessment performed pursuant to this rule, since it
is inappropriate that experimental research studies to advance general scientific understanding be included as
a part of a specific natural resource damage claim. 51 FR 27710.

 

Further clarification is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 


C. Resources Covered by the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Regulations 




Comment:

 There were numerous comments on the issue of the resources covered by the natural resource damage assessment regulations.
Several commenters supported the Department's proposal not to define which privately owned resources are covered
by the regulations. These commenters stated that the question of whether a particular resource is covered by the regulations
is governed by a wide variety of Federal, State, local, and tribal laws that are constantly evolving. These commenters
further stated that trustee officials are the most familiar with these laws and, therefore, are in the best position
to determine whether a particular resource is covered by the regulations. 

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940325-0-00078 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940325-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

On the other hand, several commenters thought that the regulations should include some limits on the assessment of
damages for injuries of privately owned resources in order to avoid overly broad claims and unnecessary litigation.
Some of these commenters stated that the Department had misinterpreted 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior

 and that the court did ask the Department to clarify which privately owned resources are covered by the regulations.



Response: 

The Department believes that the 

Ohio 

v.

 Interior

 court did not require or even request the Department to define precisely which privately owned resources are covered
by the natural resource damage assessment regulations. The court merely asked for clarification of whether the Department
intended the regulations to cover any non-government-owned resources.

The scope of resources covered by the natural resource damage assessment regulations is determined by section 101(16)
of CERCLA, which defines ``natural resources'' as:




[L]and, fish, wildlife, biota, air, water, ground water, drinking water supplies, and other such resources belonging
to, managed by, held in trust by, appertaining to, or otherwise controlled by the United States * * *,
any State or local government, any foreign government, any Indian tribe, or, if such resources are subject to a trust
restriction on alienation, any member of an Indian tribe.




As the court noted, this definition, which is incorporated into  11.14(z) of the rule, extends beyond resources
that are actually owned by the government. 



Use of the natural resource damage assessment regulations is not restricted to government-owned resources. Trustee
officials can use the regulations to assess damages for all natural resources covered by CERCLA. The Department believes
that no additional action is needed to comply with the court order.

Not only is development of a definition of the privately owned resources covered by the regulations not required by


Ohio 

v.

 Interior

, it is also impractical. The question of whether a trustee official can assess damages for a particular natural resource
is governed by CERCLA. However, CERCLA provides that trustee officials can only recover damages for injuries to those
resources that are related to them through ownership, management, trust, or control. These relationships are created
by other Federal, State, local, and tribal laws. In light of the diversity of these other laws, the Department believes
that the determination of whether a particular privately owned resource constitutes a natural resource under CERCLA
is best addressed on a case-by-case basis.

The Department disagrees that lack of a definition of the privately owned resources covered by the regulations will
result in overly broad claims and unnecessary litigation. This final rule requires a trustee official to prepare
a statement explaining the basis for his or her assertion of trusteeship. This statement must be included both in the
Notice of Intent to Perform an Assessment, which is sent to PRPs, and in the Assessment Plan, which is subject to public
review and comment. These opportunities for early input from PRPs and the public provide both a check on the trustee
officials' discretion and a means of resolving disputes prior to litigation. Other provisions of the regulations,
such as the requirement that only committed public uses of resources be included in compensable value, provide additional
protection against improper assertions of authority over private property.



Comment: 

There were also many comments on the Department's proposal to clarify that a trustee official's statement of his or
her basis of authority is not entitled to a rebuttable presumption. Several commenters supported this proposal.
These commenters noted that a trustee official's basis of authority is an issue of legal standing to sue rather than
an issue of assessment of damages. These commenters also stated that it was particularly appropriate not to grant
a rebuttable presumption to a trustee official's statement since the rule contained no standards for determining
which privately owned resources are covered by this rule.

On the other hand, a number of commenters thought that the rebuttable presumption should apply to a trustee official's
statement of his or her basis of authority. These commenters stated that one of the first steps that a trustee official
takes in an assessment is the determination of whether the affected resources fall under his or her trusteeship. These
commenters noted that nothing in CERCLA indicates that this rule should restrict the rebuttable presumption to certain
aspects of an assessment.



Response: 

In light of the fact that the Department has decided not to provide guidance on the scope of resources covered by the
regulations, the Department does not believe that a trustee official's statement of authority should be given a rebuttable
presumption. Section 11.31(a)(2) has been revised to clarify this point.



Comment: 

One commenter noted that in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice, the Department referred to the ``Federal, State, local, and tribal laws'' that give rise to trusteeship.
The commenter sought clarification of whether local governments could bring natural resource damage claims and
whether States could bring natural resource damage claims on behalf of local governments.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940325-0-00079 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940325-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response: 

The Department refers to local laws that may give rise to trusteeship because the statutory definition of ``natural
resource'' mentions resources belonging to, managed by, held in trust by, appertaining to, or otherwise controlled
by any local government. This rule does not address local governments' standing to sue for natural resource damages.
However, at least one court has held that a local government could not bring a natural resource damage claim, relying
in part on State law. 

Werlein 

v.

 United States

, 746 F. Supp. 887, 910 (D. Minn. 1990). 

Ohio 

v.

 Interior

 states that CERCLA allows State trustee officials to recover damages for injured resources owned by, managed by,
appertaining to, or otherwise controlled by a local government. 880 F.2d at 460 n. 43.



Comment:

 Some commenters requested that the rule be revised to require trustee officials to provide detailed statements of
authority.



Response:

 The Department believes that a trustee official's statement of authority, like all statements required under the
regulations, should be detailed enough to provide PRPs, other trustee officials, the general public, any other interested
parties, and ultimately the courts with an adequate opportunity to evaluate the statement. The level of detail may
vary depending on the resources involved. The Department does not believe that any revision of the rule is necessary.



Comment:

 A few commenters had questions about the application of the rule to specific resources. One commenter asked the Department
to clarify that a tribal trustee official has authority to assert claims for natural resource damages no matter where
the natural resources are located so long as the trustee official can establish trusteeship.



Response:

 Nothing in these regulations prevents a Federal, State, or tribal trustee official from assessing damages for injuries
to any natural resources, regardless of their location, so long as the trustee official can establish trusteeship
over the resource.



Comment:

 Other commenters raised questions about the Department's discussion of cultural and archaeological resources.
Some commenters disagreed with the Department's statement that cultural and archaeological resources do not constitute
natural resources under CERCLA. Other commenters agreed that such resources are not natural resources. However,
these commenters disagreed with the Department's statement that trustee officials are allowed to factor the loss
of archaeological and cultural attributes of a natural resource into a natural resource damage assessment through
consideration of the loss of services provided by that natural resource. These commenters stated that consideration
of archaeological and cultural services provided by a natural resource was tantamount to treating archaeological
and cultural resources as natural resources in violation of the statute. One commenter requested that the Department
clarify that an injury to an archaeological or cultural resource in and of itself is not a basis for a natural resource
damage claim.



Response:

 As was explained in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice, the Department acknowledges the confusion that has arisen as a result of multiple uses and meanings of the
term ``resource'' under different statutes. ``Archaeological'' and other ``cultural'' resources are not ``land,
fish, wildlife, biota, air, water, ground water, drinking water supplies, [or] other such resources.'' Therefore,
``archaeological'' and ``cultural'' resources do not constitute ``natural'' resources under CERCLA.

Nevertheless, although archaeological and cultural resources, as defined in other statutes, are not treated as
``natural'' resources under CERCLA, the rule does allow trustee officials to include the loss of archaeological
and other cultural services provided by a natural resource in a natural resource damage assessment. For example,
if land constituting a CERCLA-defined natural resource contains archaeological artifacts, then that land might
provide the service of supporting archaeological research. If an injury to the land causes a reduction in the level
of service (archaeological research) that could be performed, trustee officials could recover damages for the lost
service. Further clarification is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.



D. Trustee Coordination





Comment:

 There were several comments concerning trustee coordination. A number of commenters wrote in support of the trustee
coordination provisions in the rule. A few commenters thought that the rule should place greater emphasis on trustee
coordination and provide additional guidance on how trustee officials can coordinate most effectively.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940325-0-00080 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940325-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response:

 Trustee coordination is discussed in  11.32(a)(1), which was not affected by this rulemaking. Further clarification
is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 


Comment:

 Several commenters raised questions about designation of a lead authorized official. Some commenters asked the
Department to revise  11.32(a)(1)(ii)(A) to prohibit an official from an agency that is both a trustee and a
PRP from being designated as the lead authorized official. Another commenter stated that the lead authorized official
should be selected on a case-by-case basis according to which agency has the greatest interests at stake. 


Response:

 Revision of the procedures for appointing a lead authorized official contained in  11.32(a)(1)(ii)(A) is
beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 


Comment:

 One commenter questioned why the Department had raised the issue of collateral estoppel in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice. 


Response:

 The Department referred to collateral estoppel in response to a comment. The commenter thought that requiring Federal
trustee officials to use the natural resource damage assessment regulations would eliminate collateral estoppel
problems. The Department responded that revising the optional nature of the regulations was beyond the scope of this
rulemaking and, moreover, would not necessarily resolve potential collateral estoppel problems. 


E. Preliminary Estimate of Damages 




Comment:

 The commenters who addressed the issue of the preliminary estimate of damages agreed that an estimate of damages is
needed to determine the proper scope of an assessment and to ensure the reasonableness of assessment costs. Several
commenters thought that trustee officials should be required to disclose the preliminary estimate as soon as possible
to ensure that the public and the PRPs have an opportunity to comment on the reasonableness of projected assessment
costs. One commenter stated that trustee officials should be required to consult with the PRPs when developing the
preliminary estimate. 


Response:

 The Department believes that premature disclosure of the preliminary estimate might adversely affect the ability
of trustee officials to settle or litigate a natural resource damage case. Therefore, the Department has revised
the language of proposed  11.35(d)(3) to clarify that trustee officials need not disclose the preliminary
estimate until the assessment has been completed. 
Even though the preliminary estimate is not disclosed until the end of the assessment, PRPs and the general public
will still have a meaningful opportunity to comment on the reasonableness of assessment costs. Under  11.14(ee),
which was not affected by this rulemaking, the relationship between anticipated damages and anticipated assessment
costs is only one factor of reasonable costs. Another factor is whether all aspects of the assessment directly contribute
to the calculation of a monetary damage figure. The public and the PRPs need not know the preliminary estimate of damages
to comment on whether an assessment satisfies this factor of reasonableness. Moreover, after the assessment has
been completed, trustee officials are required to include the preliminary estimate in the Report of Assessment,
which will allow PRPs and courts to evaluate whether anticipated damages exceeded anticipated assessment costs.

Nothing in the rule prevents trustee officials from consulting with PRPs during the development of the preliminary
estimate. However, the Department believes that requiring trustee officials to do so could adversely affect their
ability to settle or litigate their claims. 


Comment:

 Some commenters thought that the preliminary estimate should always be completed before publication of the Assessment
Plan. Other commenters thought that the Department should provide additional guidance on when delay of preparation
of a preliminary estimate would be warranted. 


Response:

 The Department acknowledges the importance of the preliminary estimate in ensuring that the Assessment Plan is appropriately
focused. However, the Department believes that trustee officials should have discretion to delay completion of
the preliminary estimate until the end of Injury Determination if insufficient data exist upon which to base an estimate.
The Department realizes that in some cases the injuries might be so complex or the existing data might be so sparse that
any preliminary estimate of damages would be meaningless until Injury Determination is complete. The Department
does not believe that additional guidance on this topic is needed. 


Comment:

 A few commenters suggested that trustee officials be allowed to develop a range of preliminary estimates rather than
one specific estimate. These commenters expressed concern that if required to develop a specific number, trustee
officials would be likely to develop a high preliminary estimate, which would then encourage them to find damages
at least as high as the preliminary estimate, regardless of the actual damages. 


Response:

 The Department does not think that a range of preliminary estimates would provide an adequate standard for evaluating
whether assessment costs are reasonable. Also, the Department does not believe that development of a specific preliminary
estimate will encourage trustee officials to develop exaggerated damage claims, particularly since the preliminary
estimate of damages may be revised as new information becomes available. 


F. Reasonable Cost of an Assessment 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940325-0-00081 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940325-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Comment:

 A number of commenters expressed support for the existing definition of ``reasonable cost.'' However, other commenters
thought that the definition should be revised so that the reasonableness of assessment costs is determined by comparing
the cost of each component of the assessment to the anticipated damages to be determined by that component. 


Response:

 The definition of ``reasonable cost'' contained in  11.14(ee) was upheld in 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 after thorough review. Revision of the definition is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 


Comment:

 A few commenters suggested that the Department add a list of specific practices that would render assessment costs
unreasonable. 


Response:

 Section 11.15(a)(3) of the rule specifies different types of expenses that constitute reasonable costs of an assessment.
The only revision to  11.15(a)(3) that is being made in this rulemaking is a substitution of the phrase ``restoration''
with the phrase ``restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources.'' Additional
changes to  11.15(a)(3) are beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 


Comment:

 One commenter expressed concern that trustee officials might sacrifice scientific accuracy in order to meet the
standards of reasonable cost. 


Response:

 The Department believes that the rule adequately ensures scientific accuracy. Also, as discussed above, the definition
of ``reasonable cost'' contained in  11.14(ee) was upheld in 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 after thorough review. 


Comment:

 Some commenters stated that reasonable assessment costs should include attorneys' fees. A few commenters thought
that if attorneys' fees were included as recoverable assessment costs, then the Department should clarify that trustee
officials may recover only those attorneys' fees necessary for the assessment not those related to preparation and
litigation of a natural resource damage claim. One commenter expressed confusion about what the Department meant
when it stated in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice that trustee officials may recover only those costs that are associated with the actual assessment. 


Response:

 As noted in the August 1, 1986, and the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notices, the Department believes that trustee officials will generally need the assistance of an interdisciplinary
team of experts when performing natural resource damage assessments. The rule does not restrict recoverable assessment
costs to the expenses of particular types of professionals. Section 11.60(d)(2), which was not affected by this rulemaking,
provides that recoverable assessment costs are ``limited to those costs incurred or anticipated by the authorized
official for, and specifically allocable to, site specific efforts taken in the assessment of damages.'' Therefore,
if attorneys are involved in work specifically allocable to an assessment, the resulting attorneys' fees are recoverable
as assessment costs under the rule. The rule does not address the recovery of attorneys' fees incurred in litigation
over the results of the damage assessment, as opposed to those incurred during the assessment itself. 


G. Calculation of Baseline 




Comment:

 There were a variety of comments about the calculation of baseline. A number of commenters supported the Department's
proposal to revise  11.82(b)(1)(i) to clarify that baseline represents the conditions that would have existed
had the release or discharge not occurred rather than the conditions that existed prior to the discharge or release.



Response:

 As noted in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice, the definition of baseline, which was not affected by this rulemaking, is set forth at  11.14(e):



Baseline means the condition or conditions that would have existed at the assessment area had the discharge of oil
or the release of the hazardous substance under investigation not occurred.



Section 11.82(b)(1)(i) of the proposed rule inadvertently described restoration and rehabilitation actions as
actions taken to return a resource to baseline as measured by ``the services previously provided.'' Section 11.82(b)(1)(i)
of the final rule has been revised to conform with the definition in  11.14(e).

<TEXT>
 



Comment: 

A number of commenters sought additional guidance on how to determine baseline in industrial areas, particularly
how to distinguish the effects of the release or discharge in question from the effects of other conditions. 



Response: 

Sections 11.72(c) through (k), which were not affected by this rulemaking, provide considerable guidance on the
calculation of baseline. Additional clarification is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 



Comment: 

There were a few comments about the discussion in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice concerning the appropriate baseline for a river that in addition to being injured by a hazardous substance
release also regularly receives sewer overflows that do not constitute hazardous substance releases under CERCLA.
Some commenters noted that the Department stated that the effects of the sewer overflows did not render restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources pointless but did affect the baseline
condition that must be reestablished. These commenters sought additional clarification that PRPs could not be held
liable for the cost of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring fish if the sewer overflows would
kill any stocked fish. 



Response: 

Baseline conditions are those that would have existed had the release or discharge in question not occurred. In the
hypothetical case offered by the commenters, PRPs' liability for stocking fish depends on whether fish would have
existed in the river but for the release in question. If fish would not survive in the river regardless of whether the
release had occurred, then PRPs would not be liable for the cost of stocking fish. 



H. Measure of Damages 





Comment: 

There were a number of comments on the proposed measure of damages. Several commenters supported the proposal to allow
trustee officials to recover compensable value in addition to restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or
acquisition costs. However, many others thought that allowing recovery of compensable value in addition to restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition costs violated the 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior 

holding that restoration costs are the preferred measure of damages. These commenters stated that compensable value
should only be recovered when restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources
is infeasible or poses grossly disproportionate costs. 



Response: 

The Department believes that providing trustee officials with the discretion to assess compensable value is consistent
with the holding in 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior 

because it will help ensure that the public is more fully compensated for injuries to natural resources. 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior 

did hold that restoration costs are the preferred measure of damages. However, nothing in the decision prohibits
the Department from allowing trustee officials to assess compensable values in addition to restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition costs. In fact, the court explicitly stated that ``Congress intended the damage
assessment regulations to capture fully all aspects of loss.'' 880 F.2d at 463. Further, even under  11.81(b)
of the original rule, claims based on restoration costs could include damages for diminution of use values during
the recovery period. 



Comment: 

Some commenters stated that even if the Department decides to allow assessment of compensable value for CERCLA claims,
it should not allow assessment of compensable value for CWA claims. These commenters stated that unlike section 107(a)(C)
of CERCLA, which imposes liability for ``damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources,'' section
311(f)(4) of CWA merely refers to the ``costs of removal,'' which include ``any costs incurred by the Federal government
or any State government in the restoration or replacement of natural resources.'' Furthermore, these commenters
stated that nothing in the legislative history of CWA suggests that lost use values were intended to be recoverable.




Response: 

Although the specific issue raised by these commenters was not remanded by 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior 

and is not within the scope of this rulemaking, the Department believes that compensable values are recoverable under
CWA. CWA provides that damages ``shall include any costs or expenses incurred by the Federal government or any State
government in the restoration or replacement of natural resources damaged or destroyed.'' CWA sec. 311(f)(4). Similarly,
CERCLA provides that damages ``shall not be limited by the sums which can be used to restore or replace such resources.''
CERCLA sec. 107(f)(1). The court in 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior 

compared these two provisions and concluded:




These directives are in harmony: restoration is the basic measure of damages, but damages can exceed restoration
cost in some cases. 880 F.2d at 450.






Comment: 

Several commenters stated that CERCLA, 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior, 

and 

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 

v. 

SS Zoe Colocotroni, 

628 F.2d 652 (1st Cir. 1980), 

cert. denied, 

450 U.S. 912 (1981) (

Puerto Rico 

v. 

SS Zoe Colocotroni

), require inclusion of an exception from the basic measure of damages when restoration, rehabilitation, replacement,
and/or acquisition costs are grossly disproportionate to the lost value of the resource. A number of these commenters
disagreed with the Department's statements in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice that no exceptions were needed because some form of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
of equivalent resources will always be performed.

One commenter questioned the Department's statement in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice that consideration of the factors set forth in proposed  11.83(a)(3) would ensure that trustee officials
do not select inappropriate restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternatives. This
commenter observed that proposed  11.83(a)(3) addresses selection of cost estimating and valuation methodologies
rather than selection of a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. 

A number of other commenters opposed the creation of an exception for grossly disproportionate restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition costs. Some of these commenters urged the Department to use caution if such an exception
were adopted. One commenter requested that the Department bear in mind the special spiritual and cultural significance
of natural resources to Indian tribes when developing any such exception. Other commenters urged the Department
to base any such exception on a comparison of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition costs
to the total value of the resources in question rather than the values of the resources lost as a result of the injuries.




Response: 

The Department believes it is not necessary to create an exclusion from the basic measure of damages when restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition costs are grossly disproportionate to the lost value of the injured
resources. The Department agrees that when trustee officials evaluate a particular restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition alternative, they should consider the relationship between the costs of implementing
that alternative and the lost value of the resource. However, if the costs of implementing a particular alternative
do greatly exceed the lost value of the resource, trustee officials need not eliminate restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources as a basis for damages but should instead select a less costly
method of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. Therefore,
 11.83(a)(3) provides a number of factors for trustee officials to consider when selecting a restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. These factors, when considered together, protect
against the selection of an alternative that poses grossly disproportionate costs. 

As noted in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice, the Department does not agree that CERCLA, 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior, 

or 

Puerto Rico 

v. 

SS Zoe Colocotroni 

mandate an exclusion from the basic measure of damages when restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
costs are grossly disproportionate to the lost value of the injured resources. CERCLA and 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior 

grant the Department the discretion to develop exceptions to the basic measure of damages but do not require such exceptions.


Puerto Rico 

v. 

SS Zoe Colocotroni 

arose under a Puerto Rican statute, and although the case does contain dicta concerning CWA, it did not establish any
standards for damages under either CWA or CERCLA. 

Furthermore, 

Puerto Rico 

v. 

SS Zoe Colocotroni 

focused on whether damages should be based on the costs of implementing a plan to dig up and replant an oiled mangrove
forest instead of relying upon natural recovery. The court rejected the plan as ``impractical, inordinately expensive,
and unjustifiably dangerous to the healthy mangroves and marine animals still present in the area to be restored.''
628 F.2d at 676. 

This rule neither requires nor authorizes trustee officials to pursue intensive activities to restore or rehabilitate
an injured resource if such activities would be impractical, inordinately expensive, and unjustifiably dangerous.
Under the rule, trustee officials evaluate a range of alternatives, including an alternative based on natural recovery,
under a set of factors, including technical feasibility, cost-benefit considerations, cost-effectiveness, and
potential for additional injury. The rule allows trustee officials to rely upon natural recovery when appropriate.
If trustee officials decide to rely on natural recovery, they will still incur restoration, rehabilitation, replacement,
and/or acquisition costs because they will take some sort of action, such as restricting public access or monitoring,
to ensure that natural recovery is not impeded. 

In the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice, the Department inadvertently stated that consideration of the factors set forth in proposed  11.83(a)(3)
would ensure that trustee officials do not select a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
alternative that poses grossly disproportionate costs. Section 11.83(a)(3) of the rule addresses selection of
cost estimating and valuation methodologies rather than selection of a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement,
and/or acquisition alternative. The Department meant to reference the factors set forth in  11.82(d).

Comment:

 Some commenters agreed with the Department's proposal to allow trustee officials to base damages solely on restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition costs when there is no acceptable methodology for calculating
compensable value at a reasonable cost. One commenter, however, urged the Department to clarify that when trustee
officials choose to base damages solely on restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition costs,
PRPs should not be allowed to challenge these costs based on their unilateral calculation of compensable values.




Response:

 The Department has decided that a trustee official should have the discretion to base damages solely on the cost of
restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources not only when compensable
value cannot be calculated at a reasonable cost but whenever the trustee official deems it appropriate. The Department
has revised the language of  11.80(b) accordingly. The rule provides that it is within the trustee official's
discretion whether to base damages solely on restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition costs;
therefore, PRPs will not be able to use a unilateral calculation of compensable value to challenge a damage claim based
solely on restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition costs. 



I. Restoration, Rehabilitation, Replacement, and/or Acquisition of Equivalent Services Versus Resources 





Comment:

 Despite the Department's attempts to clarify the issue in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice, commenters expressed continued confusion over whether the Department intended restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition of the equivalent to focus on the resource itself, the services provided by a resource,
or both. Several commenters continued to think that the rule dealt inconsistently with this issue. 

Some commenters thought that the Department should specify that damages are based on the cost of restoring, rehabilitating,
replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent of both the services provided by a resource and the resource itself. These
commenters objected to the Department's statements that service levels provide a means of measuring restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. These commenters expressed concern
that using services alone as a measurement would result in less than complete restoration, rehabilitation, replacement,
and/or acquisition of equivalent resources because the loss of potential services might be left unaddressed. 

A few commenters offered an example of a groundwater drinking supply that previously contained hazardous substances
at concentrations significantly better than required by drinking water standards. The commenters noted that if
service levels are used to measure restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent
resources, then treating the groundwater to the point at which it meets drinking water standards might be deemed full
restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition but would fail to make the public whole. These commenters
further stated that failure to account for potential services when measuring restoration, rehabilitation, replacement,
and/or acquisition of equivalent resources would violate 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior,

 which stated that ``a trustee is not prohibited from recovering costs of restoring or replacing a natural resource
even when that resource has no documented `committed use.''' 880 F.2d at 462. 

Other commenters stated that service levels should not be viewed simply as a yardstick for, but rather as the very focus
of, restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition. These commenters thought that unless reestablishment
of baseline service levels were used as the standard for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition,
PRPs would be required to pay to replicate the exact natural resources that were injured, contrary to congressional
intent. These commenters requested that the Department state explicitly that the actual injury need not be corrected
if services can be restored through other means. Some commenters offered an example of contaminated sediment that
destroys vegetation. These commenters stated that dredging should not be required if the vegetation can be restored
through reseeding or fertilization.

A number of commenters also objected to the Department's statement that Congress did not intend to allow trustee officials
to simply restore the abstract services provided by a resource through an artificial mechanism. Some commenters
asked the Department to clarify that its concern lies with creation of an artificial resource rather than use of a manufactured
device to restore the injured resource. 



Response:

 As noted in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice, the Department did not intend to change the focus of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
of equivalent resources in this rulemaking. The Department has always intended restoration, rehabilitation, replacement,
and/or acquisition of equivalent resources to involve actions taken to return a resource to baseline. Apparent inconsistencies
in the rule arise because trustee officials need a means of measuring injury in order to determine when restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources is complete, and the concept of services
provides that means. As was stated in the August 1, 1986, preamble to the original type B rule: 




Traditionally humans have valued natural resources in monetary terms on the basis of services provided by the resources.
This method logically may be extended to valuing damages to an injured resource on the basis of changes in services.
This rule establishes the link between measured adverse changes in the condition of the resource, the injury, and
the damages through the measurement of changes in the services provided by the injured resource. 51 FR 27686. 




In other words, although it is the natural resource that trustee officials are restoring, rehabilitating, replacing,
and/or acquiring the equivalent of, such actions cause an increase in services, and that increase in services is used
to measure the level of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources.


As evidenced by the statutory provision allowing trustee officials to acquire equivalent natural resources, Congress
did not envision that trustee officials would, could, or should always replicate the exact same injured resources.
Therefore, the rule gives trustee officials the discretion to decide, based on consideration of designated factors,
how best to provide the public with natural resources that offer the same baseline level of services. Further, trustee
officials have the discretion to decide which services to consider when determining the necessary level of restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. 

The Department does not believe that using baseline service levels to measure restoration, rehabilitation, replacement,
and/or acquisition of equivalent resources fails to make the public whole. In the groundwater example offered by
the commenters, the resource may well provide a service other than that of being a drinking water supply. For example,
in the August 1, 1986, preamble to the original type B rule, the Department noted that one service provided by resources
with low baseline concentrations of hazardous substances or oil is the service of ``being able to absorb low levels
of that material without exceeding standards or without other effects.'' 51 FR 27716. Trustee officials have the
discretion to consider this and other services when determining the necessary level of restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. 

Also, the Department does not think that using baseline services to measure restoration, rehabilitation, replacement,
and/or acquisition of equivalent resources violates the 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 holding concerning committed uses. The term ``committed use,'' which applies only to calculation of compensable
values, refers to human uses of resources. The definition of ``services,'' which was not affected by this rulemaking,
includes more than just functions provided by the injured resource for humans. When determining the necessary level
of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources, trustee officials
have the discretion to consider services provided by the injured resource for another resource, regardless of whether
there is a committed human use of those services. 

Finally, the Department did not intend to suggest in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice that trustee officials may not use manufactured devices to assist the restoration of injured resources. The
Department simply meant that trustee officials should not replace injured natural resources with artificial resources.

Comment:

 There were a number of comments about whether restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of
equivalent resources should include reestablishing baseline services provided by the injured resource to other
resources (e.g., provision of a food source for fish or wildlife). Some commenters supported consideration of inter-resource
services in order to ensure complete restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent
resources. Other commenters thought that trustee officials generally should not consider inter-resource services.
These commenters stated that requiring restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent
inter-resource services would amount to requiring replication of the exact natural resource that was injured. These
commenters expressed concern that there is currently no way of accurately quantifying inter-resource service levels.
Some of these commenters suggested that inter-resource services be considered only when they have value to humans.




Response:

 Section 11.71(e), which was not affected by this rulemaking, allows trustee officials to consider inter-resource
services when quantifying an injury. Since restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent
resources is designed to correct an injury, trustee officials have the discretion to consider inter-resource services
when determining the necessary level of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent
resources. As was noted in the August 1, 1986, preamble to the original type B rule:

 


* * * The non-human services may be more important [than services used by humans] in measuring changes
in how well a wildlife habitat or marsh is supporting wildlife, controlling floods, assimilating wastes, and providing
any other services that may be important. 51 FR 27687. 




Moreover, as discussed above, prohibiting trustee officials from considering inter-resource services could violate
the 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 holding concerning committed use. J. Selection of a Restoration, Rehabilitation, Replacement, and/or Acquisition
Alternative 



Comment:

 There were numerous comments on the factors for consideration during selection of a restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. Several commenters thought that the proposed rule would afford trustee
officials the appropriate degree of discretion by providing factors for consideration but leaving the question
of how to weigh those factors up to the trustee officials. 

A number of other commenters thought that the proposed rule would provide trustee officials with too much discretion
over selection of a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. These commenters
supported the Department's proposal to require trustee officials to consider all of the listed factors. However,
these commenters stated that simply requiring consideration of the factors was inadequate. These commenters stated
that the Department should provide guidance on how trustee officials should consider and weigh the factors in order
to prevent abuses of discretion. A few commenters objected to the Department's statement that development of a post-award
Restoration Plan would curb potential abuses of discretion by a trustee official in selecting a pre-award restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative to serve as the basis of the trustee official's claim.




Response:

 Section 11.82(d) lists factors for trustee officials to consider when choosing a restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. The language of the proposed rule has been revised to require trustee
officials to consider all of the listed factors. However, in light of the wide range of possible natural resource damage
cases, the Department believes that trustee officials must have flexibility when selecting a restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. Therefore, the rule does not mandate how trustee officials should
weigh the listed factors. 

The rule provides a number of protections against potential abuses of discretion by trustee officials. Trustee officials
are required to document their rationale for selecting a particular alternative. This documentation is included
both in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan, which is subject to public review and comment, and in
the Report of Assessment, which is reviewable in court. Finally, the rule provides that the Restoration Plan, which
describes how the damages that are actually collected will be spent, is to be based on the alternatives selected in
the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan. Although the Restoration Plan is developed after damages
have been recovered, the Restoration Plan is subject to public review and comment. Therefore, trustee officials
who propose restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternatives that differ from those
used as a basis for damages will have to explain the reasons for the difference. 



Comment:

 Some commenters thought that trustee officials should be required to choose restoration, rehabilitation, replacement,
and/or acquisition alternatives that are technically feasible.

<TEXT>
 



Response:

 The rule lists technical feasibility as one of the factors that trustee officials must consider when selecting a restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. Under  11.14(qq) of the rule, an alternative
is ``technically feasible'' if it involves well-known technology and has a reasonable chance of successful completion
in an acceptable period of time. Different alternatives may possess varying degrees of feasibility. The technical
feasibility factor is designed to require an evaluation of these varying degrees of technical feasibility rather
than to establish a strict standard of feasibility for acceptable alternatives. Nevertheless, trustee officials
should not select alternatives that are infeasible. 


Comment:

 A number of commenters suggested that trustee officials should be required to choose the restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition alternative that maximized net benefits or was most cost effective. 


Response:

 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior 

recognized that cost considerations, although relevant, are not paramount under CERCLA. Therefore, the rule does
not require trustee officials to select the alternative that is most cost effective or that minimizes costs. However,
the rule does require trustee officials to consider both cost effectiveness and the relationship between costs and
benefits when selecting a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. 


When considering the relationship between costs and benefits, trustee officials should consider how each restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative would affect not only the injured resources but also
lost interim use of those resources. Total damages will depend on the sum of compensable value and restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition costs. Often there will be tradeoffs between compensable value and restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition costs. For example, a fast-paced restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition alternative may result in a lower level of interim lost use, and thus reduce associated
compensable values. However, implementation of such an alternative may result in significantly higher restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition costs. In some cases, there may be sufficient data to demonstrate
that some restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternatives result in substantially
lower total damages than others. 


In its January 7, 1994 notice of proposed rulemaking, NOAA solicited comment on whether its damage assessment regulations
under OPA should require trustee officials to explain their rationale if they select a restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition alternative that does not minimize total damages. 59 FR 1134. If NOAA does include
such a requirement in its final damage assessment regulations, the Department will consider whether a similar requirement
should be added to the Department's type B rule during the upcoming biennial review. 



Comment:

 A few commenters thought that the Department should require trustee officials to select a restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition alternative that is consistent with the response actions taken at the site. These
commenters expressed concern that without such a requirement, State trustee officials could circumvent section
121(f) of CERCLA, which requires States to bear the cost of obtaining cleanup levels beyond those selected by the United
States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



Response:

 Section 11.23(f) of the rule, which was not affected by this rulemaking, requires trustee officials to coordinate
their activities with the lead response agency. Also,  11.82(d)(4) of this final rule requires trustee officials
to consider the effects of any actual or planned response actions when selecting a restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. The Department encourages trustee officials to work closely with
EPA, the United States Coast Guard, and State response agencies. However, the Department recognizes that the purpose
of a response action may differ from that of an action to restore, rehabilitate, replace, and/or acquire the equivalent
of injured resources. Therefore, the Department does not believe that consistency with response actions should
govern the selection of a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. 


The Department does not believe that section 121(f) of CERCLA is applicable in this context. Section 121(f) addresses
whether the cost of attaining a certain cleanup level should be borne by the Federal Hazardous Substance Superfund
or by the State; it does not address PRP liability for natural resource damages.

Comment:

 Some commenters requested that trustee officials be required to provide a detailed analysis of the factors listed
in  11.82(d). 


Response:

 The Department believes that a trustee official's analysis of the factors listed in  11.82(d), like all statements
required under the regulations, should be detailed enough to provide PRPs, other trustee officials, the general
public, any other interested parties, and ultimately the courts with an adequate opportunity to evaluate the analysis.
The level of detail may vary depending on the alternatives involved. The Department does not believe that any revision
of the rule is necessary. 


Comment:

 One commenter requested that proposed  11.82(d)(10), which addressed consideration of consistency with
applicable Federal and State laws and policies, be amended to include reference to tribal laws and policies. 


Response:

 The Department agrees with the commenter and has revised the rule accordingly. As noted in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice, the Department has also decided that consideration of compliance with applicable Federal, State, and tribal
laws should be distinguished from consideration of consistency with relevant Federal, State, and tribal policies.
Therefore, the Department has revised the language of proposed  11.82(d)(10) to list these two factors separately.



Comment:

 A few commenters suggested that the Department prohibit trustee officials from considering factors other than those
listed. These commenters expressed concern that in the absence of such a prohibition, trustee officials might base
their decisions on inappropriate considerations. 


Response:

 The Department believes that in some situations there may be appropriate considerations in addition to the factors
listed in  11.82(d). Section 11.82(d) already provides that all factors considered must be relevant. The Department
does not believe that any revision of the rule is necessary. 


Comment:

 Some commenters stated that the rule should clearly authorize trustee officials to choose a natural recovery alternative
when selecting a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. Some commenters
thought that the Department should provide guidance on how trustee officials could maximize the opportunities for
natural recovery. 


Response:

 The Department believes that the rule does clearly authorize trustee officials to select a natural recovery alternative
when appropriate. In fact,  11.82(c)(2) explicitly requires trustee officials to consider a ``No Action-Natural
Recovery'' alternative. Development of additional guidance is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 


Comment:

 Some commenters thought that the rule should not discriminate among the four components of restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and acquisition of equivalent resources. Other commenters thought that the rule should not grant acquisition
of land the same status as restoration, rehabilitation, or replacement. These commenters stated that CERCLA and


Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 establish a clear preference for using restoration or replacement costs, as opposed to acquisition costs, as the
measure of damages. The commenters noted that section 107(f)(1) of CERCLA does list restoration, replacement, and
acquisition of equivalent resources as legitimate uses of collected damages but then provides that the measure of
damages shall not be limited by restoration and replacement costs. According to the commenters, these statutory
provisions indicate, and the court in 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 recognized, that amounts recovered must be spent first on feasible restoration or replacement actions and then any
excess funds are to be spent on acquisition of equivalent resources. These commenters also stated that land acquisition
does nothing to improve the condition of the injured natural resources.

Response: 

In light of the wide range of possible cases, the Department believes that the rule should provide flexibility in the
selection of a method to return an injured resource to baseline. The term ``restoration, rehabilitation, replacement,
and/or acquisition of equivalent resources'' was introduced to emphasize that trustee officials may select among
a wide range of methods. The Department does not believe that the rule should establish a preference for restoration
as opposed to acquisition of equivalent resources. CERCLA explicitly mentions use of recovered funds for restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement or acquisition of equivalent resources. The ``shall not be limited by'' language quoted
by the commenters simply provides that trustee officials may obtain damages in excess of restoration costs. The statutory
language does not require that damages be based on acquisition costs only if restoration is infeasible. Further,
the court in 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior

 did not establish any preference for restoration as opposed to acquisition of equivalent resources. In fact, the
court specifically stated that its use of the term ``restoration'' was intended as shorthand for restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, or acquisition of the equivalent of the injured resources. 880 F.2d at 441. 



Comment: 

Some commenters supported the Department's clarification that the restriction on land acquisition set forth in
proposed  11.82(d)(8) would apply only to Federal trustee officials, not State or tribal trustee officials.
Other commenters thought that the restriction should be eliminated altogether. 



Response: 

As was noted in the August 1, 1986, preamble to the original type B rule, the restriction on land acquisition by Federal
trustee officials was included:




* * * After extensive consultation with other Federal agencies. The purpose of this limitation is
to limit the acquisition of private lands for Federal management under CERCLA, by eliminating the possibility of
expanding the Federal estate without Congressional approval. 51 FR 27719.




To avoid any confusion, the Department has removed the restriction from the list of factors that all trustee officials
must consider when selecting a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative and
designated it as a separate provision. Further revision is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 



Comment: 

Some commenters requested that trustee officials be prohibited from selecting a restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition alternative that involves the purchase of contaminated land. 



Response: 

The Department anticipates that there may be situations in which it is difficult to identify available land in the
appropriate geographical region that provides services identical to those provided by the injured resources. Therefore,
the Department believes it would be inappropriate to further restrict trustee officials by requiring them to acquire
only land that is free from all contamination. 



Comment: 

Some commenters thought that if trustee officials based their damage claim on acquisition costs, they should be required
to demonstrate a clear link between the services lost and the services provided by the acquired resource. 



Response: 

The rule provides that trustee officials are to select a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
alternative that reestablishes baseline services. Therefore, any alternative based on acquisition of resources
would have to involve acquiring resources that provide services equivalent to those lost as a result of the injury.

Comment: 

One commenter expressed concern that proposed  11.82(b)(1) could be read to require trustee officials to examine
restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternatives on a resource-by-resource basis.




Response: 

The Department did not intend to require trustee officials to examine restoration, rehabilitation, replacement,
and/or acquisition alternatives on a resource-by-resource basis. To avoid any confusion, the Department has revised
the language of the proposed rule to refer to ``resources'' rather than ``resource.'' 



K. Costs of Restoration, Rehabilitation, Replacement, and/or Acquisition of Equivalent Resources 





Comment: 

A number of commenters objected to the inclusion of indirect costs as recoverable restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition costs. These commenters stated that indirect costs are not recoverable in natural
resource damage cases as a matter of law. The commenters acknowledged that courts have awarded indirect costs in response
actions; however, the commenters stated that those courts relied on the broad language of section 107(a)(4)(A) of
CERCLA, which authorizes recovery of ``all costs of removal or remedial action.'' 

Some commenters cited case law for the proposition that indirect costs are generally not recoverable. 

United States 

v. 

Rohm and Haas Company

, 2 F.3d 1265 (3d Cir. 1993) (

U.S. 

v. 

Rohm and Haas

). A few commenters stated that recoverable indirect costs should be limited to those actually caused by the release
and objected to the reference in proposed  11.83(b)(1)(ii) to recovery of costs of activities that ``support''
the selected restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. These commenters also
stated that the Department should clarify that the cost of policy formulation is not recoverable. 



Response: 

The Department believes that inclusion of indirect costs in an assessment is consistent with both 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior

 and the language and legislative history of CERCLA, which emphasize development of a damage figure that will make
the public whole. 880 F.2d at 445. Section 107(f)(1) of CERCLA contains the broad language that ``[t]he measure of
damages shall not be limited by the sums which can be used to restore or replace'' the injured resources. 

The Department agrees that PRPs are only liable for those indirect costs that are connected to a specific release or
discharge. However, the Department does not believe that revisions to the language of the proposed rule are necessary.
Furthermore, although the Department does not think that the cost of policy formulation would generally be recoverable,
there may be some cases in which certain policy formulation activities would not take place but for the occurrence
of a specific release or discharge. In those cases, and only in those cases, the costs of policy formulation could be
recoverable.

The Department does not believe that 

U.S.

 v. 

Rohm and Haas

 is relevant. The court in that case held that EPA oversight of cleanup activities conducted by PRPs did not constitute
a ``removal'' action under CERCLA, and therefore the cost of the oversight was not recoverable. The court did not address
the recoverability of indirect costs associated with government action. In fact, the court specifically stated
that ``this case does not involve the issue of whether indirect, overhead costs associated with government removal
or remedial activity at a particular facility are recoverable * * *.'' 2 F.3d at 1273. The indirect
costs recoverable under this rule are not oversight costs but rather costs that trustee officials will incur as they
undertake restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition. 


Comment:

 A few commenters sought clarification of the meaning of the following language in proposed  11.83(b)(1)(iii):



When an indirect cost rate is used * * * [s]uch amounts determined in lieu of indirect costs shall be
treated as an offset to the total indirect costs of the selected alternative before allocation to the remaining activities.
The base upon which such remaining costs are allocated should be adjusted accordingly.





Response:

 The Department acknowledges the confusion generated by these last two sentences of proposed  11.83(b)(1)(iii)
and has deleted them. 


Comment:

 Some commenters objected to the language of proposed  11.83(b)(3) limiting trustee officials to cost estimating
methodologies based on accounting practices. These commenters stated that accounting practices are generally
developed to deal with past events and that methodologies developed in other disciplines are better suited for estimating
future expenses. The commenters suggested that trustee officials be allowed to use methodologies based on ``standard
and accepted professional practices'' or simply ``standard and accepted estimating practices,'' including engineering
practices and public budgeting practices. 


Response:

 The Department did not intend to limit trustee officials to using only accounting practices. The Department has revised
the language of proposed  11.83(b)(3) to allow for the use of any standard and accepted cost estimating practices
provided that the trustee officials can document that those practices satisfy the criteria set forth in  11.83(a)(3).



Comment:

 One commenter stated that the rule should explicitly recognize the authority of trustee officials to use combinations
of different cost estimating methodologies. 


Response:

 The Department agrees that trustee officials should be allowed to use combinations of different cost estimating
methodologies, so long as the different methodologies either do not double count damages or allow any double counting
to be estimated and eliminated in the final damage calculation. The Department has revised the language of proposed
 11.83(b)(2) to make this point clear. 


Comment:

 A few commenters thought that the proposed rule provided inadequate guidance on selection and use of cost estimating
methodologies. 


Response:

 The Department believes that development of additional guidance is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 


L. Compensable Value 




Comment:

 A few commenters thought that the proposed rule provided inadequate guidance on selection and use of valuation methodologies.



Response:

 The ``Type B Technical Information Document: Techniques to Measure Damages to Natural Resources,'' which was developed
in 1987, is available through the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia
22161, (703) 487-4650. The Department is considering updating the document; however, such revision is beyond
the scope of this rulemaking. 


Comment:

 Some commenters requested that proposed  11.84(h)(3) be revised to allow State trustee officials to assess
and recover compensable value for all individuals, not just those within the State. 


Response:

 The ``scope of analysis'' provisions contained in  11.84(h)(3) have not been substantively changed by this
rulemaking. Virtually identical provisions were incorporated in  11.84(i) during the August 1, 1986, rulemaking.
This final rule merely substitutes the term ``compensable value'' for the term ``use value.'' Further clarification
is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 


Comment:

 A few commenters questioned what was meant by the term ``secondary economic impacts,'' which would be excluded from
the definition of ``compensable value'' under proposed  11.83(c)(1). 


Response:

 The Department believes that introducing the term ``secondary economic impacts'' into the regulations would create
unnecessary confusion. Therefore, the Department has revised the proposed rule to eliminate the term. Nevertheless,
the Department notes that all recoverable values must be traceable to a direct loss of services provided to the public.



M. Date of Promulgation of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Regulations 




Comment:

 There were numerous comments on proposed  11.91(e) clarifying the date of promulgation of the natural resource
damage assessment regulations for statute of limitations purposes. Several commenters supported proposed  11.91(e).
These commenters stated that clarification of the date of promulgation was necessary and within the Department's
statutory authority and technical expertise. Other commenters thought that clarification of a term in the statute
of limitations was a judicial matter beyond the Department's authority and expertise.

<PARENT> FR940325-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response: 

The Department believes that it has full authority to issue  11.91(e). Section 301(c) of CERCLA authorizes
the Department to ``promulgate regulations for the assessment of damages for injury to * * * natural
resources.'' Section 113(g)(1) of CERCLA creates a statute of limitations based on the date that those regulations
are ``promulgated.'' Since 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 and 

Colorado

 v. 

Interior

 were issued, there has been considerable confusion over the statute of limitations. Nothing in the language or legislative
history of CERCLA explicitly defines ``promulgation.'' As the agency given authority to develop procedures for
assessing natural resource damages, the Department believes it is in the best position to evaluate when regulations
establishing full procedures have been promulgated. Issuance of  11.91(e) is designed merely to clarify an
unclear statutory term and is well within the scope of the Department's expertise and statutory grant of authority.



Comment: 

Some commenters stated that the proposed clarification was consistent with Congressional intent. These commenters
noted legislative history indicating that section 113(g)(1) was added to CERCLA out of concern that the absence of
final natural resource damage assessment regulations had impaired the ability of trustee officials to pursue claims.
According to these commenters, trustee officials are just as handicapped after 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 and 

Colorado

 v. 

Interior

 as they were when section 113(g)(1) was passed because those cases invalidated a crucial aspect of the regulations,
namely the measure of damages. 
Other commenters stated that the proposed clarification could not be consistent with Congressional intent because
it would allow the statute of limitations to be tolled indefinitely. These commenters disagreed with the Department's
statement in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice that 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 and 

Colorado

 v. 

Interior

 left trustee officials without a measure of damages. These commenters stated that 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 established restoration costs as the measure of damages. 


Response: 

The Department believes that proposed  11.91(e) is completely consistent with Congressional intent. 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 did not overturn the regulations in their entirety; however, it did remand an extremely critical component of the
regulations, namely the measure of damages. Although 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 held that restoration costs are the preferred measure of damages, the court also acknowledged that the Department
has considerable authority and discretion to shape the specific scope of the measure of damages. Thus, until the Department
revises the regulations, no valid measure of damages exists. 
Section 11.91(e) does not allow the statute of limitations to be tolled indefinitely, it merely ensures that trustee
officials are not barred from bringing suit before they have the benefit of complete procedures for assessing natural
resource damages. The legislative history of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) indicates
that section 113(g)(1) was added to CERCLA because Congress believed that so long as trustee officials lacked procedures
for assessing natural resource damages they were handicapped in their ability to bring suit. In the absence of a valid
damage formula, the very goal of the natural resource damage assessment regulations, namely the derivation of a monetary
damage figure, cannot be fully realized. 


Comment: 

Some commenters stated that the proposed clarification of the date of promulgation was incorrect as a matter of law
and common sense. The commenters cited dictionaries and case law for the proposition that the date of promulgation
is the date on which a signed rule is first made public or is published, not when it has cleared judicial hurdles. 

United States

 v. 

City of Seattle

, No. C90-395WD, slip op. (W.D. Wash. Jan. 28, 1991) (

U.S.

 v. 

Seattle

); 

American Petroleum Institute

 v. 

Costle

United Technologies Corp

. v. 

Occupational Safety and Health Administration

, 836 F.2d 52, 54 (2d Cir. 1987) (

UTC

 v. 

OSHA

). 


Response: 

The Department believes that the cases cited by commenters for the proposition that ``promulgation'' occurs when
a regulation is first made public are inapposite. 

API

 v. 

Costle

 involved the interpretation of a provision of the Clean Air Act that prohibited the inclusion of documents in a rulemaking
docket after the date of promulgation. 609 F.2d at 22. Noting that the statutory provision was designed to ensure adequate
opportunity for public review and to prevent post hoc rationalizations, the court held that the date of promulgation
was the date the final rule was first released to the public as opposed to the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

. Id. at 23-24.

UTC

 v. 

OSHA

 involved the statute of limitations period for filing a challenge to an OSHA standard. 836 F.2d at 53. The statute provided
that any challenges to a standard issued by OSHA had to be brought within 60 days after the standard was promulgated.
Id. OSHA regulations defined ``the date of issuance'' as the time of filing in the Office of the Federal Register but
did not define ``promulgation.'' Nevertheless, OSHA argued that the date of promulgation should also be the date
of filing with the Office of the Federal Register. The court noted that Congress, by using two different terms, must
have intended the date of issuance to differ from the date of promulgation. Id. Therefore, the court held that the date
of promulgation was the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

. Id. at 54. 
Neither 

API

 v. 

Costle

 nor 

UTC

 v. 

OSHA

 purport to define ``promulgation'' for all purposes. In fact, the cases reveal that the definition of ``promulgation''
can vary, depending on Congressional intent. The cases also do not address the specific question of the effect of a
judicial remand on the date of promulgation for statute of limitation purposes. Further, the court in 

UTC

 v. 

OSHA

 recognized an agency's authority to determine when its regulations had been promulgated, stating that ``[t]he agency
is certainly entitled to adopt a definition of `promulgated', and it may well have the power to equate `promulgated'
with `issued', if it chooses to.'' Id. at 53. The problem in that case was that the agency had not issued a regulation
defining ``promulgation.'' 


U.S.

 v. 

Seattle

 involved a motion to dismiss a natural resource damage case on statute of limitations grounds. The defendant had argued
that the statute of limitations began to run on August 1, 1986, the date the original type B rule was published. In an
unpublished opinion, the court denied the motion to dismiss and held that the statute of limitations did not begin
to run until both type A and type B rules had been promulgated. Slip op. at 1. Because the case had been filed within three
years of March 20, 1987, the date the original type A rule was published, the court did not need to reach, and did not address,
the issue of the effect of 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 and 

Colorado

 v. 

Interior

 on the date of promulgation. 
However, in light of existing case law, the Department has decided that it would be more appropriate to base the date
of promulgation on the date of publication of final rules complying with 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 and 

Colorado

 v. 

Interior

 rather than the date of effectiveness of those final rules. The Department has revised the rule accordingly. 


Comment:

 A few commenters noted that section 113(a) of CERCLA provides that any challenge to regulations issued under the statute
must be brought within 90 days of promulgation. These commenters stated that if the natural resource damage assessment
regulations had not been promulgated, the court in 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 would not have had jurisdiction. 


Response:

 The Department does not dispute that the court in 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 had jurisdiction under section 113(a) of CERCLA. However, the Department does not believe that determination of
the date of promulgation for purposes of section 113(a) is necessarily dispositive of the issue of the date of promulgation
for purposes of section 113(g)(1). 


Comment:

 A few commenters expressed concern that the Department has a conflict of interest because issuance of the proposed
clarification of the date of promulgation would preserve the Department's ability to pursue its own natural resource
damage claims. 


Response:

 The Department does not believe that it has allowed its duties as a Federal trustee agency to prejudice the development
of the natural resource damage assessment regulations. The Department has striven to develop regulations that are
fair to not only trustee officials and the general public but also PRPs. Moreover, the Department notes that it is not
only a trustee agency but frequently a PRP in natural resource damage cases.

N. Judicial Review of an Assessment 




Comment:

 There were a number of comments concerning judicial review of assessments performed in accordance with the rule.
Some commenters supported the Department's statement in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice that the rebuttable presumption attaches only to those assessments that are performed in accordance with
the entire rule. 
Other commenters disagreed, stating that the different components of the rule are not inextricably intertwined
and that trustee officials need the flexibility to decide which aspects of the rule are appropriate for a particular
assessment. These commenters stated that the language of section 107(f) of CERCLA, which grants a rebuttable presumption
to assessments performed ``in accordance'' with the rule, allows trustee officials to obtain a rebuttable presumption
for any portion of an assessment that is in accordance with the rule. These commenters thought that if trustee officials
assessed one component of damages following the rule and another component without following the rule they should
still be able to obtain a rebuttable presumption for the component that was assessed in accordance with the rule. 


Response:

 The Department's statement that the rebuttable presumption attaches only to those assessments performed in accordance
with the entire rule was not intended to suggest that trustee officials would lose the rebuttable presumption if they
supplemented the damage claim assessed under the rule with additional claims assessed without following the rule.
The rule provides both an overall administrative process for development and review of documentation as well as a
range of alternative methodologies for the actual determination and quantification of injury and damages. In order
to obtain a rebuttable presumption, a trustee official must follow the entire administrative process set forth in
the rule. If the trustee official has followed the administrative process, the rebuttable presumption attaches
to those components of the damage claim that were calculated through the use of the methodologies described in the
rule. However, trustee officials are not required to use all of the listed methodologies in order to obtain a rebuttable
presumption. 
For example, if trustee officials decide not to use the rule to assess damages for injury to a particular resource,
they need not follow those portions of the rule that describe the methodologies for determining injury to such a resource.
In that case, the trustee officials could still obtain a rebuttable presumption for damages for injury to other resources
that were calculated using methodologies described in the rule. Similarly, if trustee officials decide not to use
the rule to assess damages for a particular element of lost use of an injured resource, they need not follow those portions
of the rule that describe methodologies for calculating compensable value for such an element. In that case, the trustee
officials could still obtain a rebuttable presumption for damages for other elements of lost use that were calculated
using methodologies described in the rule. 


Comment:

 One commenter disagreed with the Department's statement that CERCLA does not grant a rebuttable presumption to assessments
performed by tribal trustee officials. This commenter stated that when SARA was passed, Congress intended to grant
tribes the same authority as States in the area of natural resource trustee activities. The commenter further stated
that under established case law concerning the Federal government's fiduciary responsibility to tribes, any ambiguity
in the statute concerning tribes' right to the rebuttable presumption must be construed in favor of the tribes. 
On the other hand, a few commenters agreed with the Department's statement that CERCLA does not grant a rebuttable
presumption to tribal assessments. However, these commenters expressed concern that the Department's statement
in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice that assessments performed jointly by Federal and tribal trustee officials or by State and tribal trustee
officials would qualify for a rebuttable presumption. These commenters thought that such an interpretation would
circumvent the language of the statute. 


Response:

 Section 11.91(c) of the rule was revised in 1988 to reflect the SARA amendment to CERCLA granting a rebuttable presumption
to natural resource damage assessments performed by State trustee officials. In the preamble to that rule, the Department
stated that SARA did not extend the rebuttable presumption to assessments performed by tribal trustee officials.
53 FR 5167. The Department went on to state that ``Federal trustees and Indian tribes can work closely together in assessments,
and such assessments would qualify for a rebuttable presumption.'' Id. at 5168. Further clarification of this issue
is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.

Comment:

 There were several comments about the applicability of the rebuttable presumption to assessment costs. Some commenters
stated that CERCLA provides a rebuttable presumption only for the actual damage assessment performed in accordance
with this rule not for the costs of performing the assessment. Other commenters thought that trustee officials who
comply with this rule, including the standards for reasonable costs, should be granted a rebuttable presumption
that their damage assessment costs are recoverable. 


Response:

 Section 11.91(c), which was not affected by this rulemaking, provides that when trustee officials perform an assessment
in accordance with this rulemaking, the assessment receives a rebuttable presumption. The Department believes
that the determination of whether it is reasonable to incur a particular assessment cost is an integral component
of a damage assessment. The rule contains specific provisions to guide trustee officials in determining whether
to incur a particular assessment cost, including a definition of reasonable assessment costs that was specifically
upheld in 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior

. Therefore, the Department believes that trustee officials that comply with this rule, including the standards
for determining reasonable assessment costs, should be granted a rebuttable presumption that their assessment
costs are reasonable and, thus, recoverable. 


Comment:

 Some commenters thought that the Department should clarify that judicial review of an assessment is limited to the
data in the administrative record. These commenters stated that, in the absence of such a clarification, PRPs would
refuse to disclose any of their data until formal judicial discovery begins but would demand that trustee officials
make all of their data available for public review and comment as early in the assessment process as possible. These
commenters expressed concern that such a result would put trustee officials at a significant disadvantage in natural
resource damage litigation. 


Response:

 Clarification of the data that will be admitted in a natural resource damage case is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.



O. Use of Collected Damages 




Comment:

 Some commenters stated that trustee officials should be required to spend all collected damages on implementation
of the same restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative that was selected in the
Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan as the basis for the damage claim. These commenters thought that
without such a requirement, trustee officials would have little incentive to perform accurate assessments. There
were suggestions that trustee officials be required to notify or obtain permission from the court or the PRPs before
implementing a final Restoration Plan that differs significantly from the Restoration and Compensation Determination
Plan. 


Response:

 The Department does not believe that the rule should explicitly require collected damages to be spent on implementation
of the same restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative selected in the Restoration
and Compensation Determination Plan. Section 11.93(a) provides that upon award of natural resource damages, trustee
officials must prepare a Restoration Plan describing how the awarded funds will be used. Section 11.93(a) states
that the Restoration Plan shall be based on the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan. The Restoration
Plan is intended to be a detailed description of the implementation of the alternative selected in the Restoration
and Compensation Determination Plan. However, the Department recognizes that there may be unforeseen changes in
the condition of the natural resources between the time the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan is prepared
and the time trustee officials actually collect damages. Also, the amount of damages ultimately collected may differ
from the amount of damages claimed. Finally, the actual cost of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring
the equivalent of the injured resources may differ from the estimated cost. Therefore, trustee officials may need
to revise the alternative selected in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940325-0-00096 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940325-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Department does not believe that absence of a requirement that trustee officials implement the same exact alternative
selected in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan will eliminate trustee officials' incentive to
conduct accurate assessments. The Restoration Plan is subject to public review and comment, and trustee officials
who propose restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternatives that differ from those
used as a basis for damages will have to explain the reasons for the difference. The Department believes that making
the draft Restoration Plan available for public review and comment should provide interested parties with adequate
notice of proposed changes from the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan. 


Comment: 

A few commenters requested guidance on determining when restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
of equivalent resources is complete. Some commenters suggested that trustee officials provide PRPs with a certification
when restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources is essentially completed
so that PRPs will not remain liable indefinitely. 


Response: 

Section 11.73(a) provides that the recovery period is the time until baseline services have been reestablished.
The Department does not believe it is necessary to require trustee officials to provide PRPs with a certification
when restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources is essentially completed.
The extent of a PRP's continuing liability after damages have been collected depends on the terms of the judgment or
settlement agreement. Additional clarification is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 


Comment: 

Some commenters stated that any portion of collected damages that is not spent to restore, rehabilitate, replace,
and/or acquire the equivalent of the injured resources or to supply lost uses should be returned to the PRPs. These
commenters disagreed with the Department's statement in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice that such a requirement was unnecessary because there should never be excess funds after completion of restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. These commenters noted that because
damages are based on estimated costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent
resources and estimated compensable values, there will be excess funds whenever trustee officials overestimate
costs or compensable values. 


Response: 

The Department believes that revision of the regulations to address the disposition of any excess damage recoveries
is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 


Comment: 

One commenter asked the Department to recognize the right of co-trustees to spend collected damages on implementation
of different Restoration Plans. 


Response: 

Nothing in the rule prohibits co-trustees from implementing different Restoration Plans. Additional clarification
of this issue is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 


P. Miscellaneous Comments 


1. Funding of Tribal Assessments

<DOCNO> FR940325-0-00097 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940325-0-00016 </PARENT>

Comment: 

One commenter asked the Department to acknowledge that its fiduciary responsibility to tribes extends to natural
resource damage assessments involving tribal resources. This commenter requested that the Department develop
funding mechanisms for natural resource damage assessments involving tribal resources. 



Response: 

Discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 



2. Quality Assurance Plans 





Comment: 

Several commenters stated that the rule should be revised to eliminate the requirement that trustee officials adopt
quality assurance plans that conform with EPA guidance. These commenters thought that EPA guidance on quality assurance
is poorly suited for natural resource damage assessment work. One commenter noted that the Department had incorrectly
stated that proposed  11.31(c)(4) contained a reference to EPA quality assurance guidance when in fact that
reference is contained in  11.31(c)(3) of the existing rule. 



Response: 

In the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice, the Department inadvertently suggested that proposed  11.31(c)(4) would require trustee officials
to include in their Assessment Plans quality assurance plans that complied with EPA guidance. Section 11.31(c)(4)
contains no reference to quality assurance plans. Section 11.31(c)(3), which was renumbered but not substantively
affected by this rulemaking, does require that trustee officials develop a quality assurance plan that satisfies
the requirements listed in EPA guidance, but only if that guidance is applicable. Further clarification is beyond
the scope of this rulemaking. 



3. Threat of a Release or Discharge 





Comment: 

Some commenters disagreed with the Department's statement in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice that the regulations may not be used to assess damages caused by a threat of a release or discharge. These commenters
noted that section 107(a) of CERCLA specifically establishes liability for damages from a release or a threat of a
release. Further, these commenters noted that natural resource damages include compensation for loss of use of a
natural resource. Therefore, these commenters thought that if a threat of a release results in the loss of use of a natural
resource, then trustee officials should be able to assess and bring a claim for natural resource damages. 



Response: 

Section 11.10, which was not affected by this rulemaking, provides that these regulations are only available for
the assessment of damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. Although section
107(a) of CERCLA does refer to a release or a threat of a release, section 107(a)(4)(C) refers to damages for injury
to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources ``resulting from such a release.'' Also, section 301(c) of CERCLA
authorizes the Department to develop regulations for assessment of ``damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss
of natural resources resulting from a release of oil or a hazardous substance.'' Therefore, the rule may only be used
when there has been an actual release or discharge, as opposed to a threat of a release or discharge, and actual injury
to, destruction of, or loss of a natural resource, as opposed to simply a reduction in use of a resource. Further clarification
is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 



4. Coordination With Response Activities 





Comment: 

Some commenters thought that the rule should provide additional guidance on coordination of natural resource damage
assessment activities with response activities. A few commenters stated that trustee officials should be required
to participate in the remedial planning process. One commenter supported coordination of natural resource damage
assessment activities and response activities but urged trustee officials to bear in mind the paramount need for
rapid and effective cleanup. One commenter suggested that the On-Scene Coordinator be allowed to contact just one
Federal trustee agency and one State trustee agency and that the contacted trustee agencies be required to notify
all other trustee agencies. 



Response: 

The August 1, 1986, preamble to the original type B rule contains considerable discussion of the relationship between
response actions and natural resource damage assessments. 51 FR 27681, 27692-93. Further clarification of
the issue is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.

5. Injuries Caused by Response Activities 





Comment: 

One commenter asked the Department to clarify that State trustee officials are not allowed to recover damages for
injuries caused or aggravated by State-ordered cleanup activities if those injuries were reasonably avoidable.
Another commenter interpreted the rule to prohibit recovery of damages for any injuries that trustee officials could
have reasonably avoided. 



Response: 

Section 11.15(a)(1)(ii), which was not affected by this rulemaking, provides that PRPs are liable for any increase
in injuries that is reasonably unavoidable as a result of response actions taken or anticipated. As was stated in the
August 1, 1986, preamble to the original type B rule,




* * * The Department believes that any response actions undertaken by government agencies should
strive to avoid additional injury to natural resources whenever possible. Damages from such ``reasonably unavoidable''
increases in injury resulting from response actions by governmental agencies are not excluded from damage actions,
because they are indirectly due to the discharge or release and thus included under section 301(c) of CERCLA. 51 FR
27698.




Therefore, if government response activities cause an increase in injuries, trustee officials can only recover
damages for the increase if it was reasonably unavoidable. Section 11.15(a)(1)(ii) deals solely with liability
for increases in injuries caused by response actions. Section 11.14(jj), which was not affected by this rulemaking,
defines ``response'' as removal or remedial actions as defined in sections 101(23) and 101(24) of CERCLA. 



6. Limitations on Liability 





Comment: 

A few commenters believed that the rule should clarify the application of various statutory limitations on liability,
including the ceilings set forth in section 107(c) of CERCLA and the provision in section 107(f)(1) that excludes
natural resource damages if those damages and the release that caused those damages occurred wholly before the enactment
of CERCLA. 



Response: 

The Department notes that   11.15(b) and 11.24(b)(1), which were not affected by this rulemaking, already
incorporate the ceilings on damages set forth in section 107(c) of CERCLA and the limitation on damages set forth in
section 107(f)(1) of CERCLA. Any further clarification of these provisions is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.




7. Timing of the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan 





Comment: 

Some commenters thought that the information needed to determine the required level of restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources would not be available at the time that the Assessment Plan
is made available for public comment and review; therefore, the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan
should not be prepared until after Injury Determination and Quantification have been completed. Other commenters
expressed concern that allowing preparation of the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan to be delayed
would lead trustee officials to perform unnecessary and unfocused assessment work during Injury Determination
and Quantification. Therefore, the commenters suggested that trustee officials be required to use their best efforts
to prepare the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan at the same time as the rest of the Assessment Plan.




Response: 

The Department believes that early preparation of the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan is advisable
to ensure that the costs of assessments are reasonable. The definition of ``reasonable cost,'' which was not affected
by this rulemaking, includes a requirement that Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination
bear a well defined relationship to each other. The Assessment Plan, which includes the Restoration and Compensation
Determination Plan, is designed to coordinate Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination.
Therefore, the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan should be prepared as early as possible. In most
cases, trustee officials should be able to develop an initial Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan based
on estimates of the extent and nature of the injuries and then make revisions as needed. Section 11.32(e)(1) of the
rule, which was not affected by this rulemaking, authorizes trustee officials to modify any part of the Assessment
Plan at any stage of the assessment as new information becomes available. 

However, the Department recognizes that selection of a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
alternative depends in part upon the extent and nature of the injuries, which will not be fully known at the outset of
an assessment. Therefore, there may be cases where even a preliminary attempt to evaluate restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition alternatives would be meaningless unless Injury Determination or Quantification
had begun. In these cases, premature preparation of the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan could temporarily
misdirect Injury Determination and Quantification. Therefore, the rule provides that in those cases where existing
data are insufficient to develop a Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan at the time that the rest of the
Assessment Plan is prepared, the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan may be developed later. Nevertheless,
the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan must always be developed before completion of Quantification
in order to ensure that Quantification is correlated with Damage Determination.

The Department believes that it is unnecessary to add a requirement that trustee officials use their ``best efforts''
to prepare the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan along with the rest of the Assessment Plan. Nevertheless,
the Department emphasizes that trustee officials should only delay development of the Restoration and Compensation
Determination Plan when existing data are insufficient to develop even a rough estimate of the extent of the injuries.
Further, if trustee officials do delay development of the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan, they
should complete the Plan as soon as they obtain sufficient information. 



National Environmental Policy Act, Regulatory Flexibility Act, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Executive Orders
12866, 12630, 12778, and 12612 



The Department has determined that this rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment. Therefore, no further analysis pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National
Environmental Policy Act (43 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) has been prepared. 

The Department certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small
entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.). The rule provides technical procedural guidance for the assessment of damages to natural resources. It does not
directly impose any additional cost. As the rule applies to natural resource trustees, it is not expected to have an
effect on a substantial number of small entities. 

It has been determined that this rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval
by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.). 

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 and has been determined to constitute a significant
regulatory action. However, because of the difficulty of evaluating the effects of alternatives to this rule, the
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget has waived preparation of
the assessments described in sections 6(a)(3)(B) and 6(a)(3)(C) of Executive Order 12866 for the final rule. 

It has been determined that this rule does not have takings implications under Executive Order 12630. The Department
has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that this rule meets the applicable standards provided in sections
2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. It has been determined that this rule does not have federalism implications
under Executive Order 12612.

8. Section 11.35 is revised to read as follows:


 11.35 

Assessment Plan_preliminary estimate of damages.


(a) 

Requirement. 

When performing a type B assessment pursuant to the requirements of subpart E of this part, the authorized official
shall develop a preliminary estimate of: the anticipated costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or
acquisition of equivalent resources for the injured natural resources; and the compensable value, as defined in
 11.83(c) of this part, of the injured natural resources, if the authorized official intends to include compensable
value in the damage claim. This preliminary estimate is referred to as the preliminary estimate of damages. The authorized
official shall use the guidance provided in this section, to the extent possible, to develop the preliminary estimate
of damages.
(b) 

Purpose. 

The purpose of the preliminary estimate of damages is for reference in the scoping of the Assessment Plan to ensure
that the choice of the scientific, cost estimating, and valuation methodologies expected to be used in the damage
assessment fulfills the requirements of reasonable cost, as that term is used in this part. The authorized official
will also use the preliminary estimate of damages in the review of the Assessment Plan, as required in  11.32(f)
of this part, to ensure the requirements of reasonable cost are still met.
(c) 

Steps. 

The preliminary estimate of damages should include consideration of the ability of the resources to recover naturally
and, if relevant, the compensable value through the recovery period with and without possible alternative actions.
The authorized official shall consider the following factors, to the extent possible, in making the preliminary
estimate of damages:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940325-0-00102 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940325-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) The preliminary estimate of costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent
resources should include consideration of a range of possible alternative actions that would accomplish the restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of the equivalent of the injured natural resources.
(i) The preliminary estimate of costs should take into account the effects, or anticipated effects, of any response
actions.
(ii) The preliminary estimate of costs should represent the expected present value of anticipated costs, expressed
in constant dollars, and should include direct and indirect costs, and include the timing of those costs. The provisions
detailed in   11.80-11.84 of this part are the basis for the development of the estimate.
(iii) The discount rate to be used in developing the preliminary estimate of costs shall be that determined in accordance
with the guidance in  11.84(e) of this part.
(2) The preliminary estimate of compensable value should be consistent with the range of possible alternatives for
restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources being considered.
(i) The preliminary estimate of compensable value should represent the expected present value of the anticipated
compensable value, expressed in constant dollars, accrued through the period for the restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources to baseline conditions, i.e., between the occurrence
of the discharge or release and the completion of the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
of the equivalent of the injured resources and their services. The estimate should use the same base year as the preliminary
estimate of costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. The
provisions detailed in   11.80-11.84 of this part are the basis for the development of this estimate.
(ii) The preliminary estimate of compensable value should take into account the effects, or anticipated effects,
of any response actions.
(iii) The discount rate to be used in developing the preliminary estimate of compensable value shall be that determined
in accordance with the guidance in  11.84(e) of this part.
(d) 

Content and timing. 

(1) In making the preliminary estimate of damages, the authorized official should rely upon existing data and studies.
The authorized official should not undertake significant new data collection or perform significant modeling efforts
at this stage of the assessment planning phase.
(2) Where possible, the authorized official should make the preliminary estimate of damages before the completion
of the Assessment Plan as provided for in  11.31 of this part. If there is not sufficient existing data to make
the preliminary estimate of damages at the same time as the assessment planning phase, this analysis may be completed
later, at the end of the Injury Determination phase of the assessment, at the time of the Assessment Plan review.
(3) The authorized official is not required to disclose the preliminary estimate before the conclusion of the assessment.
At the conclusion of the assessment, the preliminary estimate of damages, along with its assumptions and methodology,
shall be included in the Report of the Assessment as provided for in  11.91 of this part.
(e) 

Review. 

The authorized official shall review, and revise as appropriate, the preliminary estimate of damages at the end of
the Injury Determination and Quantification phases. If there is any significant modification of the preliminary
estimate of damages, the authorized official shall document it in the Report of the Assessment.

are restored, rehabilitated, replaced, and/or the equivalent have been acquired to baseline levels shall be estimated.
The time estimated for recovery or any lesser period of time as determined in the Assessment Plan shall be used as the
recovery period for purposes of  11.35 and the Damage Determination phase,   11.80 through 11.84,
of this part. 

(1) In all cases, the amount of time needed for recovery if no restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
of equivalent resources efforts are undertaken beyond response actions performed or anticipated shall be estimated.
This time period shall be used as the ``No Action-Natural Recovery'' period for purposes of  11.82 and  11.84(g)(2)(ii)
of this part. 

(2) The estimated time for recovery shall be included in possible alternatives for restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources, as developed in  11.82 of this part, and the data
and process by which these recovery times were estimated shall be documented.

13. Section 11.80 is revised to read as follows: 



 11.80 

Damage Determination phase_general. 



(a) 

Requirement. 

(1) The authorized official shall make his damage determination by estimating the monetary damages resulting from
the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance based upon the information provided in the Quantification
phase and the guidance provided in this Damage Determination phase. 

(2) The Damage Determination phase consists of  11.80_general;  11.81_Restoration and Compensation
Determination Plan;  11.82_alternatives for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
of equivalent resources;  11.83_cost estimating and valuation methodologies; and  11.84_implementation
guidance, of this part. 

(b) 

Purpose. 

The purpose of the Damage Determination phase is to establish the amount of money to be sought in compensation for injuries
to natural resources resulting from a discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance. The measure of damages
is the cost of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of the equivalent of the injured natural
resources and the services those resources provide. Damages may also include, at the discretion of the authorized
official, the compensable value of all or a portion of the services lost to the public for the time period from the discharge
or release until the attainment of the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent
of the resources and their services to baseline. 

(c) 

Steps in the Damage Determination phase. 

The authorized official shall develop a Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan, described in  11.81
of this part. To prepare this Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan, the authorized official shall develop
a reasonable number of possible alternatives for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
of equivalent resources and select, pursuant to the guidance of  11.82 of this part, the most appropriate of
those alternatives; and identify the cost estimating and valuation methodologies, described in  11.83 of
this part, that will be used to calculate damages. The guidance provided in  11.84 of this part shall be followed
in implementing the cost estimating and valuation methodologies. After public review of the Restoration and Compensation
Determination Plan, the authorized official shall implement the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan.


(d) 

Completion of the Damage Determination phase. 

Upon completion of the Damage Determination phase, the type B assessment is completed. The results of the Damage Determination
phase shall be documented in the Report of Assessment described in  11.90 of this part.

14. Section 11.81 is revised to read as follows: 



 11.81 

Damage Determination phase_Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan. 



(a) 

Requirement. 

(1) The authorized official shall develop a Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan that will list a reasonable
number of possible alternatives for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent
resources and the related services lost to the public associated with each; select one of the alternatives and the
actions required to implement that alternative; give the rationale for selecting that alternative; and identify
the methodologies that will be used to determine the costs of the selected alternative and, at the discretion of the
authorized official, the compensable value of the services lost to the public associated with the selected alternative.


(2) The Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan shall be of sufficient detail to evaluate the possible alternatives
for the purpose of selecting the appropriate alternative to use in determining the cost of restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources for the injured natural resources and the services those
resources provided, and, where relevant, the compensable value of the services lost to the public through the completion
of the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources and their services
to the baseline. 

(b) The authorized official shall use the guidance in   11.82, 11.83, and 11.84 of this part to develop
the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan. 

(c) The authorized official shall list the methodologies he expects to use to determine the costs of all actions considered
within the selected alternative and, where relevant, the compensable value of the lost services through the recovery
period associated with the selected alternative. The methodologies to use in determining costs and compensable
value are described in  11.83 of this part. 

(d) (1) The Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan shall be part of the Assessment Plan developed in subpart
B of this part. If existing data are not sufficient to develop the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan
at the time that the overall Assessment Plan is made available for public review and comment, the Restoration and Compensation
Determination Plan may be developed later, after the completion of the Injury Determination or Quantification phases.


(2) If the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan is prepared later than the Assessment Plan, it shall be
made available separately for public review by any identified potentially responsible party, other natural resource
trustees, other affected Federal or State agencies or Indian tribes, and any other interested members of the public
for a period of no less than 30 calendar days. Reasonable extensions may be granted as appropriate. 

(3) Comments received from any identified potentially responsible party, other natural resource trustees, other
affected Federal or State agencies or Indian tribes, or any other interested members of the public, together with
responses to those comments, shall be included as part of the Report of Assessment, described in  11.90 of this
part. 

(4) Appropriate public review of the plan must be completed before the authorized official performs the methodologies
listed in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan. 

(e) The Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan may be expanded to incorporate requirements from procedures
required under other portions of CERCLA or the CWA or from other Federal, State, or tribal laws applicable to restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of the equivalent of the injured resources or may be combined with
other plans for related purposes, so long as the requirements of this section are fulfilled. 

15. Section 11.82 is revised to read as follows: 



 11.82 

Damage Determination phase_alternatives for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
of equivalent resources. 



(a) 

Requirement. 

The authorized official shall develop a reasonable number of possible alternatives for the restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition of the equivalent of the injured natural resources and the services those resources
provide. For each possible alternative developed, the authorized official will identify an action, or set of actions,
to be taken singly or in combination by the trustee agency to achieve the 
restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or 
acquisition of equivalent natural resources and the services those resources provide to the baseline. The authorized
official shall then select from among the possible alternatives the alternative that he determines to be the most
appropriate based on the guidance provided in this section. 

(b) 

Steps. 

(1) The authorized official shall develop a reasonable number of possible alternatives that would restore, rehabilitate,
replace, and/or acquire the equivalent of the injured resources. Each of the possible alternatives may, at the discretion
of the authorized official, consist of actions, singly or in combination, that would achieve those purposes. 

(i) Restoration or rehabilitation actions are those actions undertaken to return injured resources to their baseline
condition, as measured in terms of the physical, chemical, or biological properties that the injured resources would
have exhibited or the services that would have been provided by those resources had the discharge of oil or release
of the hazardous substance under investigation not occurred. Such actions would be in addition to response actions
completed or anticipated pursuant to the National Contingency Plan (NCP). 

(ii) Replacement or acquisition of the equivalent means the substitution for injured resources with resources that
provide the same or substantially similar services, when such substitutions are in addition to any substitutions
made or anticipated as part of response actions and when such substitutions exceed the level of response actions determined
appropriate to the site pursuant to the NCP. 

(iii) Possible alternatives are limited to those actions that restore, rehabilitate, replace, and/or acquire the
equivalent of the injured resources and services to no more than their baseline, that is, the condition without a discharge
or release as determined in  11.72 of this part. 

(2) 

Services provided by the resources

. (i) In developing each of the possible alternatives, the authorized official shall list the proposed actions that
would restore, rehabilitate, replace, and/or acquire the equivalent of the services provided by the injured natural
resources that have been lost, and the period of time over which these services would continue to be lost.

(ii) The authorized official shall identify services previously provided by the resources in their baseline condition
in accordance with  11.72 of this part and compare those services with services now provided by the injured resources,
that is, the with-a-discharge-or-release condition. All estimates of the with-a-discharge-or-release condition
shall incorporate consideration of the ability of the resources to recover as determined in  11.73 of this part.


(c) 

Range of possible alternatives. 

(1) The possible alternatives considered by the authorized official that return the injured resources and their
lost services to baseline level could range from: Intensive action on the part of the authorized official to return
the various resources and services provided by those resources to baseline conditions as quickly as possible; to
natural recovery with minimal management actions. Possible alternatives within this range could reflect varying
rates of recovery, combination of management actions, and needs for resource replacements or acquisitions. 

(2) An alternative considering natural recovery with minimal management actions, based upon the ``No Action-Natural
Recovery'' determination made in  11.73(a)(1) of this part, shall be one of the possible alternatives considered.


(d) 

Factors to consider when selecting the alternative to pursue. 

When selecting the alternative to pursue, the authorized official shall evaluate each of the possible alternatives
based on all relevant considerations, including the following factors: 

(1) Technical feasibility, as that term is used in this part. 

(2) The relationship of the expected costs of the proposed actions to the expected benefits from the restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. 

(3) Cost-effectiveness, as that term is used in this part. 

(4) The results of any actual or planned response actions. 

(5) Potential for additional injury resulting from the proposed actions, including long-term and indirect impacts,
to the injured resources or other resources. 

(6) The natural recovery period determined in  11.73(a)(1) of this part. 

(7) Ability of the resources to recover with or without alternative actions. 

(8) Potential effects of the action on human health and safety. 

(9) Consistency with relevant Federal, State, and tribal policies. 

(10) Compliance with applicable Federal, State, and tribal laws. 

(e) A Federal authorized official shall not select an alternative that requires acquisition of land for Federal management
unless the Federal authorized official determines that restoration, rehabilitation, and/or other replacement
of the injured resources is not possible.

 11.83 

Damage Determination phase_cost estimating and valuation methodologies. 



(a) 

General. 

(1) This section contains guidance and methodologies for determining: The costs of the selected alternative for
restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources; and the compensable value
of the services lost to the public through the completion of the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or
acquisition of the equivalent of the injured resources and their services to baseline.

(2)(i) The authorized official shall select among the cost estimating and valuation methodologies set forth in this
section, or methodologies that meet the acceptance criterion of either paragraph (b)(3) or (c)(3) of this section.

(ii) The authorized official shall define the objectives to be achieved by the application of the methodologies.

(iii) The authorized official shall follow the guidance provided in this section for choosing among the methodologies
that will be used in the Damage Determination phase. 
(iv) The authorized official shall describe his selection of methodologies and objectives in the Restoration and
Compensation Determination Plan. 
(3) The authorized official shall determine that the following criteria have been met when choosing among the cost
estimating and valuation methodologies. The authorized official shall document this determination in the Report
of the Assessment. Only those methodologies shall be chosen: 
(i) That are feasible and reliable for a particular incident and type of damage to be measured. 
(ii) That can be performed at a reasonable cost, as that term is used in this part. 
(iii) That avoid double counting or that allow any double counting to be estimated and eliminated in the final damage
calculation. 
(iv) That are cost-effective, as that term is used in this part. 
(b) 

Costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources

. (1) Costs for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources are the amount
of money determined by the authorized official as necessary to complete all actions identified in the selected alternative
for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources, as selected in the
Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan of  11.81 of this part. Such costs shall include direct and
indirect costs, consistent with the provisions of this section. 
(i) Direct costs are those that are identified by the authorized official as attributed to the selected alternative.
Direct costs are those charged directly to the conduct of the selected alternative including, but not limited to,
the compensation of employees for the time and effort devoted to the completion of the selected alternative; cost
of materials acquired, consumed, or expended specifically for the purpose of the action; equipment and other capital
expenditures; and other items of expense identified by the authorized official that are expected to be incurred in
the performance of the selected alternative. 
(ii) Indirect costs are costs of activities or items that support the selected alternative, but that cannot practically
be directly accounted for as costs of the selected alternative. The simplest example of indirect costs is traditional
overhead, e.g., a portion of the lease costs of the buildings that contain the offices of trustee employees involved
in work on the selected alternative may, under some circumstances, be considered as an indirect cost. In referring
to costs that cannot practically be directly accounted for, this subpart means to include costs that are not readily
assignable to the selected alternative without a level of effort disproportionate to the results achieved. 
(iii) An indirect cost rate for overhead costs may, at the discretion of the authorized official, be applied instead
of calculating indirect costs where the benefits derived from the estimation of indirect costs do not outweigh the
costs of the indirect cost estimation. When an indirect cost rate is used, the authorized official shall document
the assumptions from which that rate has been derived. 
(2) 

Cost estimating methodologies

. The authorized official may choose among the cost estimating methodologies listed in this section or may choose
other methodologies that meet the acceptance criterion in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Nothing in this section
precludes the use of a combination of cost estimating methodologies so long as the authorized official does not double
count or uses techniques that allow any double counting to be estimated and eliminated in the final damage calculation.

(i) 

Comparison methodology

. This methodology may be used for unique or difficult design and estimating conditions. This methodology requires
the construction of a simple design for which an estimate can be found and applied to the unique or difficult design.

(ii) 

Unit methodology

. This methodology derives an estimate based on the cost per unit of a particular item. Many other names exist for describing
the same basic approach, such as order of magnitude, lump sum, module estimating, flat rates, and involve various
refinements. Data used by this methodology may be collected from technical literature or previous cost expenditures.

(iii) 

Probability methodologies

. Under these methodologies, the cost estimate represents an ``average'' value. These methodologies require information
which is called certain, or deterministic, to derive the expected value of the cost estimate. Expected value estimates
and range estimates represent two types of probability methodologies that may be used. 
(iv) 

Factor methodology

. This methodology derives a cost estimate by summing the product of several items or activities. Other terms such
as ratio and percentage methodologies describe the same basic approach.

(v) 

Standard time data methodology

. This methodology provides for a cost estimate for labor. Standard time data are a catalogue of standard tasks typically
undertaken in performing a given type of work. 
(vi) 

Cost- and time-estimating relationships (CERs and TERs)

. CERs and TERs are statistical regression models that mathematically describe the cost of an item or activity as a
function of one or more independent variables. The regression models provide statistical relationships between
cost or time and physical or performance characteristics of past designs. 
(3) 

Other cost estimating methodologies

. Other cost estimating methodologies that are based upon standard and accepted cost estimating practices and are
cost-effective are acceptable methodologies to determine the costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement,
and/or acquisition of equivalent resources under this part. 
(c) 

Compensable value

. (1) Compensable value is the amount of money required to compensate the public for the loss in services provided by
the injured resources between the time of the discharge or release and the time the resources and the services those
resources provided are fully returned to their baseline conditions. The compensable value includes the value of
lost public use of the services provided by the injured resources, plus lost nonuse values such as existence and bequest
values. Compensable value is measured by changes in consumer surplus, economic rent, and any fees or other payments
collectable by a Federal or State agency or an Indian tribe for a private party's use of the natural resources; and any
economic rent accruing to a private party because the Federal or State agency or Indian tribe does not charge a fee or
price for the use of the resources. 
(i) Use value is the value of the resources to the public attributable to the direct use of the services provided by the
natural resources. 
(ii) Nonuse value is the difference between compensable value and use value, as those terms are used in this section.

(2) 

Valuation methodologies

. The authorized official may choose among the valuation methodologies listed in this section to estimate willingness
to pay (WTP) or may choose other methodologies provided that the methodology can satisfy the acceptance criterion
in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Nothing in this section precludes the use of a combination of valuation methodologies
so long as the authorized official does not double count or uses techniques that allow any double counting to be estimated
and eliminated in the final damage calculation. 
(i) 

Market price methodology

. This methodology may be used if the natural resources are traded in the market. In using this methodology, the authorized
official should make a determination as to whether the market for the resources is reasonably competitive. If the
authorized official determines that the market for the resources, or the services provided by the resources, is reasonably
competitive, the diminution in the market price of the injured resources, or the lost services, may be used to determine
the compensable value of the injured resources. 
(ii) 

Appraisal methodology

. Where sufficient information exists, the appraisal methodology may be used. In using this methodology, compensable
value should be measured, to the extent possible, in accordance with the applicable sections of the ``Uniform Appraisal
Standards for Federal Land Acquisition'' (Uniform Appraisal Standards), Interagency Land Acquisition Conference,
Washington, DC, 1973 (incorporated by reference, see  11.18). The measure of compensable value under this
appraisal methodology will be the difference between the with- and without-injury appraisal value determined by
the comparable sales approach as described in the Uniform
