Cedar Gulch Timber Sale; Kootenai National Forest, Sanders County, MT


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; intent to prepare environmental impact statement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The USDA, Forest Service, will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to disclose the environmental effects
of timber harvest, reforestation, improvement of harlequin duck, mule deer and grizzly bear habitat, road reconstruction,
road construction, and road closure in the vicinity of Big Cedar Gulch, Orr Creek and Rock Creek drainages. The area
is located near the southwest corner of the Cabinet Mountains Wilderness, Kootenai National Forest, Cabinet Ranger
District, Sanders County, Montana. Part of the proposed project's activities are within the McKay Creek Roadless
Area (

#

676).


There are a variety of purposes for management activities in the Cedar Gulch area; the primary purposes are: (1) Repair
the unsafe and sediment producing Orr Creek road (

#

2285) by installing and improving drainage structures and turnouts and improving the road surface, (2) Improve limited
mule deer habitat by increasing the quantity and quality of browse, (3) Improve harlequin duck habitat in Rock Creek
by reducing the height of the debris jams and constructing additional debris jams, (4) Salvage dead and dying trees,
(5) Provide timber to the local economy, (6) Improve white bark pine habitat for grizzly bears. To meet Kootenai Forest
Plan standards for open road densities in the project area and surrounding area, 6.9 miles of roads presently open
at least part of the year would be closed year-round to reduce open road density to maintain or improve grizzly bear
habitat security.
This project-level EIS will tier to the Kootenai National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan)
and Final EIS (September, 1987), which provides overall guidance of all land management activities on the Kootenai
National Forest, including wildlife, timber and road management.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The project area consists of approximately 2700 acres of National Forest land located in T26N; R32W; Sections 10-15,
22-24; and T26N; R31W, Sections 7, 18; P.M.


Timber harvest is proposed on approximately 184 acres of forested land which has been designated as suitable for timber
management by the Kootenai Forest Plan. The timber harvest operations and general administration of National Forest
lands would require reconstruction of approximately 6.6 miles of existing system roads and 1.0 mile of temporary
road, and construction of approximately 0.5 mile of temporary road. About 0.6 mile of temporary road would be obliterated
after use. Also, road closures involve closing 6.9 miles of existing system roads to motorized vehicles year-round
in and adjacent to the Cedar Gulch project area. Even-aged management would be used in the majority of the areas proposed
for harvest. Seed tree, shelterwood and clearcut regeneration harvests (all with permanent reserve trees) are general
prescriptions that are to be applied. Patch clearcuts in the higher elevations are recommended for mule deer habitat
improvement and to enhance white bark pine habitat for grizzly bears. Where timber harvest is used for wildlife habitat
enhancement, prescribed burning would also occur. Logging systems include skyline and helicopter. Of the 184 acres
proposed for harvest: 25 acres are mule deer and grizzly bear habitat improvement; 95 acres are to salvage trees affected
by root rot or mountain pine beetle and improve big game browse; 32 acres are to improve big game browse while maintaining
the ponderosa pine type; and 32 acres are to improve the spring-time forage for grizzly bear and improve forage for
big game.
The decision to be made is what, if anything, should be done in the Cedar Gulch Project Area to: (a) Improve the condition
of Orr Creek road to reduce erosion and provide a safe travel way, (b) dispose of slash and reforest harvested lands,
(c) improve mule deer, harlequin duck and grizzly bear habitat, (d) provide timber to the local economy, and (e) develop
and manage the road system to facilitate removal of timber, reforest stands, and maintain access to the Engle Peak
trailhead (located at the end of Orr Creek Road) while maintaining grizzly bear security.
The Kootenai Forest Plan provides guidance for management activities within the potentially affected area through
its goals, objectives, standards and guidelines, and management area direction. The areas of proposed timber harvest,
reforestation and road construction would occur within Management Area 14 which is areas suitable for timber production
and important grizzly bear habitat.

The Forest Service will consider a range of alternatives. One of these will be the ``no action'' alternative, in which
none of the proposed activities would be implemented. Another alternative will be one which proposes no activities
in the McKay Creek Roadless area. Additional alternatives will be developed to address comments and suggestions
raised by the public. The alternatives will examine varying levels and locations for the proposed activities to achieve
the proposal's purposes, as well as to respond to the issues and other resource values.
The EIS will analyze the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of the alternatives. Past, present,
and projected activities on both private and National Forest lands will be considered. The EIS will disclose the analysis
of site-specific mitigation measures and their effectiveness.
Public participation is an important part of the analysis, commencing with the initial scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7),
which will occur March 1994 to April 1994. In addition, the public is encouraged to visit with Forest Service officials
at any time during the analysis and prior to the decision. The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments,
and assistance from Federal, State, and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested
in or affected by the proposed action. No public meetings are scheduled at this time.
Comments from the public and other agencies will be used in preparation of the Draft EIS. The scoping process will be
used to:
1. Identify potential issues.
2. Identify major issues to be analyzed in depth.
3. Eliminate minor issues or those which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental analysis, such as
the Kootenai Forest Plan EIS.
4. Identify alternatives to the proposed action.
5. Identify potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives (i.e., direct, indirect, and
cumulative effects).
6. Determine potential cooperating agencies and task assignments.
Some public comments have already been received in conjunction with Cabinet District Open House meetings in January
1994. The following preliminary issues have been identified so far:
a. What are the effects of sediment from logging activities on the fisheries within Rock Creek?
b. What effect would the proposal have on wildlife habitat and security?
c. What effect would the proposal have on the roadless character of McKay Creek Roadless Area 

#

676 and the Cabinet Wilderness?
d. What would be the effects on the visual quality of the area as viewed from Highway 200 and the Clark Fork River?
e. Are there any sensitive, threatened, or endangered plant or animal species in the area? How would this project affect
them if they are present?
f. How will this project, in conjunction with the proposed Asarco Rock Creek mine, affect grizzly bear security?
Other issues commonly associated with timber harvesting and road construction include: Effects on cultural resources,
soils, and old growth. This list may be verified, expanded, or modified based on public and internal scoping for this
proposal.

The Draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and available for public review
in September of 1994. At that time, the EPA will publish a Notice of Availability of the Draft EIS in the 

Federal Register

. The comment period on the Draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA's notice of availability appears in the 

Federal Register

. It is very important that those interested in management of the Cedar Gulch area participate at that time. To be most
helpful, comments on the Draft EIS should be as site-specific as possible. The Final EIS is scheduled to be completed
by January 1, 1995.
The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.

 v. 

NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978).

 Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement stage but that are
not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed by the courts.


City of Angoon

 v. 

Hodel,

 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.

 v. 

Harris

, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 30-day scoping comment period so that substantive comments
and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond
to them in developing issues and alternatives.
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues on the proposed action, comments should be as specific
as possible. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the
procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

The petitions were submitted pursuant to section 251 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2341). Consequently, the United
States Department of Commerce has initiated separate investigations to determine whether increased imports into
the United States of articles like or directly competitive with those produced by each firm contributed importantly
to total or partial separation of the firm's workers, or threat thereof, and to a decrease in sales or production of
each petitioning firm.
Any party having a substantial interest in the proceedings may request a public hearing on the matter. A request for
a hearing must be received by the Trade Adjustment Assistance Division, room 7023, Economic Development Administration,
U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, no later than the close of business of the tenth calendar day following
the publication of this notice.

On November 15 and 24, 1993, respectively, Lafarge and Lehigh requested a public hearing. On December 14, 1993, the
Department issued a second set of supplemental questionnaires for sales of both classes or kinds of merchandise.
Respondent submitted home market sales data for flux and responses to the Department's second set of supplemental
questionnaires on December 23 and 29, 1993, respectively. On January 3, 1994, respondent submitted certain corrections
to the cost and sales data reported in its previous questionnaire responses. 

The Department conducted verification of the cost and sales responses of LFI and LCA from January 10 through January
20, 1994, in Paris, France and Chesapeake, Virginia. 

Petitioner and respondent filed case and rebuttal briefs on February 14 and 18, 1994, respectively. On February 16,
1994, the parties withdrew their requests for a public hearing which was scheduled to take place on February 18, 1994.




Such or Similar Comparisons 



Regarding the CA cement and cement clinker class or kind of merchandise, we have determined that the products covered
by this investigation constitute two ``such or similar'' categories of merchandise: CA cement and CA cement clinker.
We made fair value comparisons on this basis. Since this investigation was initiated during a period in which certain
simplification procedures were in effect (see the preliminary determination), we conducted the home market viability
test based on the class or kind of merchandise, rather than on the such or similar category. In order to determine whether
there was a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating foreign market value
(FMV), we compared the volume of home market sales of CA cement and cement clinker to the volume of third country sales
of CA cement and cement clinker, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act, and determined that the home market
was viable for the CA cement and cement clinker class or kind. During the POI, CA cement clinker was the only product
within the cement class or kind which was imported into the United States from France. Because there were no sales of
such or similar merchandise (i.e., clinker) in the home market during the POI to compare to U.S. sales, we made comparisons
on the basis of CV (see the ``Fair Value Comparisons'' section of this notice), in accordance with section 773(a)(2)
of the Act. 

Regarding the CA flux class or kind of merchandise, we determined that the products covered by this investigation
comprise a single ``such or similar'' category of merchandise and that the home market was viable. Where there were
no sales of identical merchandise in the home market during the POI to compare to U.S. sales, we made similar merchandise
comparisons on the basis of size (i.e., degree of crushing/screening), in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the
Act (see the ``Fair Value Comparisons'' section of this notice). We made adjustments for differences in the physical
characteristics of the merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act.

Fair Value Comparisons 



To determine whether sales of CA cement and cement clinker, and CA flux from France were made at less than fair value,
we compared United States Price (USP) to the FMV, as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market
Value'' sections of this notice. We made revisions to respondent's reported data, where appropriate, based on verification
findings. For those unreported U.S. cement sales which respondent claimed were made pursuant to certain graduated
requirements contracts effective prior to the POI, but for which respondent could not provide documentary evidence
substantiating its claim, we based our analysis on best information available (BIA), in accordance with 19 CFR 353.37.
As BIA, we used the highest, non-aberrational margin calculated for any of respondent's reported U.S. sales of cement.
(See Comment 1 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section of this notice.) 



United States Price 



All of Lafarge's U.S. sales to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importation into the United states.
Therefore, we based USP on exporter's sales prices (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act. 

For ESP sales of cement, we included in our final analysis certain reported sales allegedly made under an exclusive
supply contract, using the reported, verified date of purchase order as the date of sale. (See Comment 2 in the ``Interested
Party Comments'' section of this notice.) For ESP sales of flux, we included in our final analysis certain reported
sales made under a contract which expired but which respondent claimed had been subsequently renewed prior to the
POI, but for which respondent could not provide documentary evidence substantiating that claim. For these sales,
we used the verified date of purchase order (or date of invoice where the purchase order date was unavailable) as the
date of sale. (See Comment 9 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section of this notice.) Furthermore, we excluded
certain reported flux shipments made in October 1992 pursuant to a contract effective prior to the POI, the price terms
of which were modified in November 1992. (See Comment 10 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section of this notice.)


We calculated USP based on packed or bulk, ex-U.S. warehouse or delivered prices to unrelated customers in the United
States. For sales of both classes or kinds of merchandise, we made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland
freight, foreign brokerage and handling, ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S. brokerage and handling (including
harbor maintenance and customs processing fees), unloading costs, and U.S. inland freight charges (including loading,
freight to processors' warehouses/transfer freight to warehouses, demurrage and freight to customer charges,
where applicable). For sales of CA flux, we recalculated foreign inland freight, foreign brokerage and handling,
ocean freight and U.S. inland freight expenses to correct minor clerical errors found at verification. 

For sales of both classes or kinds of merchandise, we also deducted direct selling expenses including credit and product
liability premiums. We recalculated credit expenses to account for discounts, where applicable, and to correct
minor clerical errors found at verification with respect to the reported weighted-average short-term interest
rate and the reported payment or shipment dates for certain transactions. We also recalculated credit for those sales
that had missing payment dates. For those missing payment dates, we used, as BIA, the date of the final determination
as the date of payment. In addition, we reclassified premiums for product liability insurance as direct selling expenses,
and deducted them from USP accordingly. (See Comment 15 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section of this notice.)


For sales of both classes or kinds of merchandise, we also deducted indirect selling expenses (including pre-sale
warehousing costs incurred in the United States and selling expenses incurred in France on the merchandise exported
to the United States for further manufacturing). U.S. indirect selling expenses were recalculated to exclude certain
administrative expenses which were determined to be more appropriately classified as general and administrative
(G&A) expenses. (See Comment 18 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section of this notice.) We also deducted
imputed inventory carrying costs for the period between production of the clinker/flux in France and shipment of
the finished cement/processed flux to the customer in the United States. For sales of CA cement, we recalculated inventory
carrying costs for the period between production of the clinker in France and the start of production of the finished
cement in the United States, using the verified weighted-average short-term interest rate in France for the POI.
(See Comment 4 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section of this notice.) 

For sales of CA cement, we also deducted rebates, discounts and warranty expenses, where applicable. For sales of
CA flux, we also deducted commissions, where appropriate. 

In addition, for both classes or kinds of merchandise, we made deductions, where appropriate, for all value added
in the United States pursuant to section 772(e)(3) of the Act. The value added consists of the costs associated with
further manufacturing the imported products, including a proportional amount of any profit related to further manufacturing.
We calculated profit attributable to further manufacturing in the United States by deducting from the sales price
all applicable costs incurred in producing the further manufactured products. We then allocated the total profit
proportionally to all components of cost. We deducted only the profit attributable to the value added in the United
States. In determining the costs incurred to produce the further manufactured products, we included: (1) The costs
of manufacture (COM); (2) movement and packing expenses; (3) selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses;
and (4) interest expenses.

<PARENT> FR940325-2-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

For both classes or kinds of merchandise, we relied on the submitted further manufacturing costs except in certain
instances where the costs were not appropriately quantified or valued. We reclassified certain administrative
expenses which were reported as indirect selling expenses as G&A expenses. We also recalculated financial expenses
to exclude the claimed adjustment for short-term interest income. (See Comments 18 and 19, respectively, in the ``Interested
Party Comments'' section of this notice.) 
For CA flux sales, we made an adjustment to U.S. price for the value-added tax (VAT) paid on the comparison sale in France.
In 

Federal-Mogul Corporation and The Torrington Company 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-194 (CIT October 7, 1993), the Court of International Trade (CIT) rejected our revised implementation
of the Act's instructions on taxes and prohibited us from applying a purely tax neutral margin calculation methodology.
Accordingly, we have again changed our practice, as instructed by the CIT, and adjusted USP for tax by multiplying
the home market tax rate by the U.S. price at the point in the chain of commerce of the U.S. merchandise that is analogous
to the point in the home market chain of commerce at which the foreign government applies the home market consumption
tax. 
In this investigation, the tax levied on the subject merchandise in the home market is 18.6 percent. We calculated
the appropriate tax adjustment to be 18.6 percent of USP net of adjustments reflected on the invoice at the time of sale
(which, in this case, is the point in the chain of commerce of the U.S. merchandise that is analogous to the point in the
home market chain of commerce at which the foreign government applies the home market consumption tax), and added
this amount to the USP. We also calculated the amount of the tax adjustment that was due solely to the inclusion of price
deductions in the original tax base (

i.e

., 18.6 percent of the sum of any adjustments, expenses and charges that were deducted from the tax base). We deducted
this amount from the net USP after all other additions and deductions had been made. By making this additional tax adjustment,
we avoid a distortion that would cause the creation of a dumping margin even when pre-tax dumping is zero. 


Foreign Market Value 


For CA cement and cement clinker, we based FMV on the CV data submitted for cement clinker because cement clinker was
the only such or similar product within the cement and clinker class or kind which was imported into the United States
during the POI, and there were no sales of this product in the home market or to unrelated customers in third countries
during the POI. (See the ``Such or Similar Comparisons'' section of this notice.) For CA flux, we based FMV on home market
sales prices because we found the home market to be viable for flux sales during the POI, and because the difference-in-merchandise
adjustments between the flux products sold to the United States and those sold in the home market do not exceed 20 percent.
(See Comment 12 in the ``Interested Party Comment'' sections of this notice.) 


CV-to-Price Comparisons 


We calculated CV for cement clinker based on the sum of Lafarge's cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses,
U.S. packing costs and profit. We relied on the submitted CV information, except in the following instances where
the costs were not appropriately quantified or valued: 



(1) We adjusted material costs for minor errors presented at verification. We also increased material costs for foreign
exchange losses incurred when reporting raw materials. (See Comment 21 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section
of this notice.) 
(2) We adjusted variable overhead to correct minor errors found at verification. 
(3) We did not allow the annualization of fixed costs as we had done in the preliminary determination because respondent
incorrectly reported labor costs as part of annualized fixed costs, rather than as variable costs for the POI in accordance
with the Department's instructions; and because respondent failed to provide an itemization of fixed and variable
costs that would allow us to appropriately reclassify labor costs from annualized fixed costs to POI variable costs.
As BIA, we used the fixed costs, including the labor costs, incurred during the POI. (See Comment 22 in the ``Interested
Party Comments'' section of this notice.) 
(4) We revised the COM reported to include an amount for depreciation on research and development (R&D) assets
which was not originally reported. (See Comment 20 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section of this notice.)

(5) We recalculated financial expenses to exclude the claimed adjustment for short-term interest income. (See Comment
19 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section of this notice.) 
(6) We also recalculated home market selling expenses on a class or kind basis. (See Comment 6 in the ``Interested Party
Comments'' section of this notice.)

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940325-2-00012 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940325-2-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B) (i) and (ii) of the Act we included in CV the recalculated general expenses
since these expenses were greater than the statutory minimum of ten percent of the COM. We revised respondent's reported
profit calculation to reflect verification findings. (See Comment 8 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section
of this notice.) Since this amount was greater than the statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of the COM and general
expenses, we used the recalculated profit for CV purposes. 


We deducted from CV home market direct selling expenses. We also deducted home market indirect selling expenses capped
by the amount of U.S. indirect selling expenses attributable to the cement clinker imported into the United States
and further manufactured into finished cement, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2). 


Price-to-Price Comparisons 


For sales of flux, we calculated FMV based on packed, ex-factory or delivered prices to unrelated home market customers.
We excluded from our analysis those sales made to home market customers on a test basis because they were in unusually
small quantities, rather than in the usual commercial quantities, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.46(a)(1). We also
excluded from our analysis those sales to a home market customer which were destined for a third country market. (See
Comment 16 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section of this notice.) We made deductions, where appropriate,
for rebates. We also deducted home market packing costs which were recalculated to exclude the costs of bagging and
G&A expenses. (See Comments 11 and 12 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section of this notice.) 
Pursuant to section 773(a)(4)(B) and 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we also deducted direct selling expenses including bagging
costs, credit, technical service expenses and product liability premiums. (See Comments 11, 13 and 15 in the ``Interested
Party Comments'' section of this notice.) We recalculated credit expenses to exclude VAT from the gross unit prices
and to correct minor clerical errors found at verification with respect to the credit periods reported for certain
transactions. (See Comment 14 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section of this notice.) We revised respondent's
reported technical service expense calculation, treating the verified travel expense portion of the calculation
as a direct expense and the verified salary portion as an indirect selling expense. (See Comment 13 in the ``Interested
Party Comments'' section of this notice.) In accordance with the decision in Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL


Producers of Gray Portland Cement

 v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-1239 (Fed. Cir., January 5, 1994), we made a circumstance-of-sale adjustment for post-sale home
market movement expenses, namely inland freight and loading charges. We also deducted from FMV home market indirect
selling expenses, including inventory carrying costs. The deduction for home market indirect selling expenses
was capped by the sum of U.S. indirect selling expenses and U.S. commissions attributable to the flux imported into
the United States and further manufactured, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b) (1) and (2). Where there was no U.S.
commission applicable to a particular U.S. flux sale, we offset the indirect selling expenses in the United States
with a corresponding deduction for indirect selling expenses in the home market, capped by the total indirect selling
expenses incurred on the U.S. sale in the manner described above. 
We included in FMV the amount of the VAT collected in the home market. We also calculated the amount of the tax that was
due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax base (i.e., 18.6 percent of the sum of any adjustments,
expenses, charges and offsets that were deducted from the tax base). We deducted this amount after all other additions
and deductions had been made. By making this additional tax adjustment, we avoid a distortion that would cause the
creation of a dumping margin even when pre-tax dumping is zero. 
We also made an adjustment for physical differences in the merchandise, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.57. We revised
the reported difmer amount to reflect only the verified variable COM, excluding the reported costs of bagging associated
with the home market products, and associated G&A expenses and profit. (See Comments 11 and 12 in the ``Interested
Party Comments'' section of this notice.) 


Verification 


As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we conducted verification of the information provided by Lafarge by using
standard verification procedures, including the examination of relevant sales, cost and financial records, and
selection of original source documentation.

Interested Party Comments 



Comment 1 



Petitioner argues that certain unreported U.S. CA cement sales alleged by Lafarge to have been made under graduated
requirements contracts effective prior to the POI should be included in the Department's final analysis. Petitioner
notes that at verification respondent could not provide the Department with any contemporaneous documentation
regarding the acceptance of the essential terms of sale by the customers associated with these contracts. Petitioner
contends that, despite the fact that respondent believes that these shipments were based on contracts entered into
before the POI, the Department could not verify the existence or terms of these alleged contracts. Petitioner also
maintains that respondent refused to provide the relevant data requested by the Department with regard to this issue.


Petitioner further argues that respondent never demonstrated that the alleged contracts governing these CA cement
shipments were made prior to the POI. According to petitioner, the alleged contracts cover time periods much earlier
than the POI and in fact constitute unilateral sales proposals made by Lafarge which are not evidence of a binding commitment
between the parties as to quantity and price. According to petitioner, Lafarge also has not demonstrated that these
shipments were not in excess of the quantity requirements stipulated in the alleged contracts. 

Petitioner believes that, as BIA, the Department should apply a rate of 198.10 percent, the highest margin alleged
in the petition, to account for these sales. 

Respondent maintains that for these CA cement sales the Department should use the date of the customers' acceptance
of the graduated requirements pricing proposals as the date of sale and exclude these sales from its final analysis.
Respondent believes its pricing proposals were accepted by the customers when the customers placed initial purchase
orders at the prices specified in the proposals. At the time these orders were placed, respondent claims the parties
had already orally reached an agreement with LCA regarding the percentage of their requirements they were committed
to purchase from LCA in order to qualify for each price level specified in the proposals; the orders provided confirmation
of each customer's prior acceptance of LCA's pricing proposal. Because these initial orders were dated prior to the
POI, respondent argues that the date of sale for the shipments made during the POI pursuant to these proposals also
fell outside the POI and, therefore, these shipments were properly not reported to the Department. 

Respondent notes, however, that, should the Department disagree with its reasoning and determine that the shipments
pursuant to graduated requirements contracts should be included in its analysis, there is no basis for the Department
to make adverse inferences or use ``punitive'' BIA. Respondent asserts that it fully disclosed the nature of its graduated
requirements contracts to the Department from the start of this case, and it had no reason to believe that it should
provide further information about those shipments in the form of a sales listing. Respondent further notes that it
provided a summary of the quantity and value of the shipments made during the POI under the graduated requirements
contracts in its December 29, 1993, supplemental questionnaire response, and that, at verification, Department
verifiers retained as an exhibit a listing of all the POI invoices generated under these contracts with related pricing
and other sales data. Respondent argues that, if the Department decides to include these sales in the final determination,
the sales data examined at verification should be used to allow proper analysis of these sales. 



DOC Position 



We agree with petitioner in part. Despite several requests for information in our questionnaires, Lafarge did not
provide documentation regarding customers' acceptance of the graduated requirements pricing proposals. For example,
Lafarge did not provide any of the ``initial'' orders allegedly placed pursuant to these graduated requirements
pricing proposals. In addition, respondent did not offer any indication of the date on which these ``initial'' orders
were placed for purposes of establishing date of sale for these sales. Furthermore, respondent could not provide
at verification any contemporaneous documentation or other sufficient evidence regarding acceptance of the terms
of sale by customers associated with the subject graduated requirements contracts or indicating a ``meeting of the
minds'' between the parties with respect to price and quantity, despite the Department's repeated requests for such
evidence. The POI invoices that we examined at verification that were allegedly generated pursuant to the pricing
proposals and ``initial'' orders gave no indication of association with the pricing proposals or ``initial'' orders,
and respondent provided no other documentation that would establish such a connection.

Lafarge submitted in its December 29, 1993, response sample pricing proposals associated with the graduated requirements
customers in question. At verification, we were able to examine in detail only one of those pricing proposals. This
proposal, dated January 9, 1991, was specifically for 1991 (all the prices and discounts mentioned referenced 1991
only) and was silent on the effective period of the terms it quoted. We also reviewed a letter that was dated January
20, 1994, the last day of verification, and was faxed to the respondent on that day by the customer in question. This
letter attempted to show that the January 9, 1991, pricing proposal constituted the date of the agreement regarding
the essential terms of sale for all sales made to that customer after that date. This letter also discussed renewal
of the pricing arrangement. However, not only was this letter unclear as to exactly what kind of agreement the parties
had reached pursuant to the proposal, but it also did not indicate when renewal was discussed. In accordance with the
Department's practice, the date of any such renewal would constitute a new date of sale. Also in accordance with our
practice, we required some form of documentation attesting to the date of renewal, yet no documentation apart from
the faxed letter was provided. Lafarge was also unable to provide any such documentation for the other customers in
question. 

Without some documentary evidence of a renewal prior to the POI, we cannot assume that the terms of the January 1991
pricing proposal were in effect during the POI. See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Forged
Steel Crankshafts from the Federal Republic of Germany, 52 FR 28170, 28172 (July 28, 1987) (Crankshafts from the FRG);
and Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Gray Portland Cement and Clinker from Mexico, 55 FR 29244,
29248 (July 18, 1990) (Gray Portland Cement from Mexico). Because we have no such evidence, we have determined that
the dates of sale for the shipments at issue are within the POI. Accordingly, we have included them in our final dumping
analysis. We do not think, however, that the pricing information contained in the invoice listing referred to by respondent
is appropriate for use in our dumping analysis. This data was only submitted at verification to support the reconciliation
of Lafarge's reported POI sales with its financial statements (information previously submitted in its responses).
For purposes of making CV-to-price comparisons in our dumping analysis, this listing constitutes new information
under 19 CFR 353.31(a)(i), and was therefore not timely submitted. It is not the Department's practice to accept new
information at verification, because it leaves no opportunity for petitioners to analyze the sales reporting and
provide deficiency questions, and no opportunity for petitioners to analyze and comment on these sales. In addressing
this issue previously, we have stated: 




The untimely submission of key information * * * precluded the Department from conducting a reasonable
and thorough analysis of this information prior to the verification, just as petitioners were unable to comment on
the new [information] * * * The purpose of verification is to establish the accuracy of a response rather
than to reconstruct the information to fit the requirements of the Department.

Flat Products and Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from the Netherlands, 58 FR 37199, 37203 (July 9, 1993).




Even if this listing had been submitted seven days prior to verification, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.31(a)(i),
it did not contain sufficient data for purposes of dumping analysis. Therefore, because we did not have complete sales
information on the record to properly analyze these sales, we used BIA. 

However, we do not think that use of the petition rate as BIA for these sales, as suggested by petitioner, is warranted.
In this case, we are using partial BIA because Lafarge has provided responses to our questionnaires. When we resort
to partial BIA, it is our practice to use the highest non-aberrational margin based on respondent's reported sales.
This is an adverse figure, yet is based on the respondent's calculated margins. Therefore, we have used as BIA for these
sales the highest, non-aberrational margin calculated for any of respondent's reported U.S. sales of cement. 



Comment 2 



Petitioner contends that certain reported U.S. cement sales alleged to have been made under an exclusive supply contract
dated outside the POI should be included in the Department's analysis. Petitioner argues that the Department was
unable to verify that these sales were in fact made pursuant to a Master Agreement that Lafarge claims was an exclusive
supply contract. Accordingly, petitioner maintains that respondent failed verification with respect to these
sales. Furthermore, petitioner contends that, even if the Department had been able to verify these sales, respondent
never had an exclusive supply contract with this particular customer. Petitioner asserts that the Master Agreement
is neither ``exclusive'' nor a ``contract.'' Therefore, petitioner argues that the Department should determine
that the appropriate date of sale for these particular sales is the date of invoice, which is within the POI, and the
Department should include these sales in its dumping calculation. 

Respondent maintains that the Department should consider the date of the Master Agreement as the date of sale for the
subject sales. Respondent argues that the blanket purchase orders issued by the customer prior to the POI indicates
the customer's commitment to purchase its requirements from the respondent for specific products at the specific
prices set by the Master Agreement.

DOC Position 



We agree with petitioner. In our deficiency questionnaire of December 14, 1993, the Department specifically asked
the respondent to support its assertion regarding the ``exclusivity'' of the Master Agreement. Respondent, in its
December 29, 1993, response, could neither demonstrate that the Master Agreement was ``exclusive,'' nor what quantity
of the subject merchandise the respondent was agreeing to sell. Rather, Lafarge merely stated that the customer purchased
all its requirements for certain cement products from it and that the ``volume commitment'' mentioned in the Master
Agreement had been agreed to beforehand. Since we have no documentation demonstrating that a ``meeting of the minds''
regarding both quantity and price occurred before the POI, we cannot assume, based on respondent's word, that the
Master Agreement is a requirements contract for purposes of establishing date of sale. (

See

 Crankshafts from the FRG and Gray Portland Cement from Mexico.) Accordingly, we have determined the appropriate
date of sale for these particular sales to be the date of purchase order, and we have included them in our final dumping
calculations. 



Comment 3 



Petitioner argues that the Department should reverse its preliminary determination that CA cement and CA cement
clinker constitute two such or similar categories. According to petitioner, the Department's determination was
based on the incorrect premises that: (1) CA cement is not like CA cement clinker in the purposes for which used, and
(2) in all past cases involving intermediate and finished products the Department has determined that there should
be two such or similar categories. Petitioner contends that there is no question that CA cement and CA cement clinker
constitute only one such or similar category pursuant to section 1677(16)(C) of the antidumping statute. According
to petitioner, CA cement clinker is like the CA cement it is used to produce, and the difference-in-merchandise adjustment
that would be required to make fair value comparisons between home market sales of CA cement and U.S. sales of clinker
would be well below the Department's 20 percent difmer guideline. Petitioner further argues that because there is
no data on the record for home market sales of CA cement to calculate FMV, the Department should use BIA to determine
a margin for Lafarge's sales of both CA cement and CA cement clinker. Petitioner believes that, as BIA, the Department
should use 41.23 percent, which is the lowest margin alleged in the petition. 

Respondent does not believe that there is any reason for the Department to revisit its decision that CA cement and CA
cement clinker are different such or similar categories at this late stage in the investigation. Respondent argues
that it would be unfair for the Department to penalize it for failing to report information that the Department decided
not to request. Furthermore, respondent contends that the statute does not allow the Department to use BIA when the
information at issue was never requested.

DOC Position 



We agree with respondent. It was decided early on in these investigations that CA cement and cement clinker constituted
two such or similar categories of merchandise in accordance with the definition of similar merchandise under section
771(16)(B)(ii) and (C)(ii) of the Act, which states that the component materials and uses of the products must be ``like.''
(

See

 June 15, 1993, Memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford Re Such or Similar Categories and attached
Memorandum from Stafford to Moreland). In this case, while cement and clinker may be made of similar materials, they
are not used for the same purposes. Clinker is used to make cement, and cement is used to bind things together or to create
some structure or form. Clinker requires further processing to be like cement in the purposes for which it is used.
For these reasons we have held cement and clinker to constitute different such or similar merchandise categories
in this and past cement cases. Moreover, contrary to petitioner's assertion, the component materials and uses of
products within the class or kind of merchandise subject to investigation are the determinants in establishing categories
of such or similar merchandise: The 20 percent difmer rule is not considered by the Department in establishing such
or similar categories. 



Comment 4 



Respondent maintains that in the preliminary determination the Department incorrectly deducted from the USP as
an indirect selling expense, inventory carrying costs (ICC) based on an inventory period including the time between
clinker production in France and production of the finished cement in the United States. Respondent claims that it
did not sell clinker to an unrelated party in the United States, but rather to its U.S. subsidiary for further processing
into cement. Therefore, the clinker in this case is work-in-process inventory, and the period between the production
of the intermediate clinker product and the completion of the finished cement product is part of the production period.
Respondent maintains that the Department ordinarily imputes an ICC for finished goods inventory and almost never
imputes ICC on work-in-process inventory, except for large, made-to-order goods that are produced as discrete projects.
To support its arguments, respondent cites among other cases the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value:
Dynamic Random Access Memory Semiconductors of One Megabit and Above from the Republic of Korea (58 FR 15467, March
23, 1993) (DRAMs from Korea) and Color Television Receivers from the Republic of Korea; Final Results of Antidumping
Duty Administrative Review (55 FR 26,255, June 27, 1990) (CTVs from Korea). Furthermore, citing Final Determination
of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Offshore Platform Jackets and Piles from Japan (51 FR 11788, April 7, 1986) (OPJPs
from Japan) and the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Mechanical Transfer Presses from Japan (55
FR 335, January 4, 1990) (MTPs from Japan), respondent maintains that in the rare instances in which the Department
has imputed ICC on work-in-process inventory, it classifies those costs as part of the COM, not as selling expenses.

<DOCNO> FR940325-2-00017 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940325-2-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Petitioner contends that ICC must be calculated to include the time CA cement clinker is produced in France until the
time it is further manufactured into cement in the United States. Petitioner argues that both CA clinker and cement
will be subject to the scope of any order that may be issued in this case and, therefore, CA clinker cannot be considered
work-in-process, as respondent suggests. 


DOC Position 


We agree with petitioner. The Department's general practice in all further manufacturing cases has been to begin
the inventory carrying period from the time that the product comes off of the production line. (See e.g., Final Determination
of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Stainless Steel Wire Rods from France (58 FR 68865, December 29, 1993) (Wire Rods From
France). In this case, we are calculating ICC for the imported product, which is the clinker that is further manufactured
into finished cement. We distinguish this case from that of CTVs from Korea, where the product imported into the United
States was the finished merchandise; and OPJPs from Japan and MTPs from Japan, where the products were large and made-to-order,
unlike the subject merchandise in the instant investigation; and from DRAMs from Korea, where we made no adjustment
regarding the imported merchandise only where it merely constituted parts of larger and considerably more complicated
modules. Therefore, we have imputed ICC in this case inclusive of the period between production of the clinker in France
and shipment to the first unrelated customer in the United States, and have adjusted USP accordingly. Moreover, for
the portion of the ICC costs which reflect the period between production of the clinker in France and the start of production
of the finished cement in the United States, we recalculated the reported ICC using the short-term interest rate prevailing
in France during the POI. 


Comment 5 


Respondent argues that the Department should use the U.S. warehousing costs included in the reported U.S. indirect
selling expenses for CA cement sales. Contrary to what is suggested in the sales verification report, Lafarge maintains
that the reported pre-sale warehousing costs for one warehouse are consistent with the prices shown in the warehousing
contract examined at verification, and the pre-sale warehousing costs included in the reported indirect selling
expenses were based on the actual costs incurred and paid by Lafarge, not on the per ton cost stated in the contract.



DOC Position 


We agree. Upon further examination of the documentation reviewed at verification, we noted that the verified per
unit U.S. indirect selling expenses, reported inclusive of pre-sale warehousing costs, were based on actual costs
incurred. Thus, we have deducted from USP the reported pre-sale warehousing costs as indirect selling expenses.



Comment 6 


Petitioner maintains that indirect selling expenses included in the CV of CA clinker should be recalculated to include
indirect selling expenses allocated to CA cement as shown in Exhibit 6 of petitioner's case brief because clinker
is of the same class or kind of merchandise as cement. 
Respondent argues against such a recalculation because the channels of distribution and sales process for CA clinker
differ substantially from those of CA cement. Because the CV of clinker is intended to provide a surrogate for a home
market sales price for clinker based on the costs and expenses that would be incurred in producing and selling clinker
in the home market, Lafarge appropriately included in CV only the selling expenses that would be incurred in selling
clinker. 


DOC Position 


We disagree with respondent. Section 773(e)(1)(B) of the Act provides that CV should include, among other things,
``an amount for general expenses * * * equal to that usually reflected in sales of merchandise of the
same general class or kind as the merchandise under consideration.'' We have recalculated indirect selling expenses
to include home market indirect selling expenses for cement using verified information on the record. We consider
cement indirect selling expenses to be representative of selling expenses of the general class or kind of merchandise,
i.e., all CA products sold within the home market country. 


Comment 7 


Petitioner asserts that the Department should make an adjustment to the G&A expense reported in the CV for clinker
to include the amortization of patents and trademarks which respondent had not included in the reported G&A amount.

Respondent argues that the amortization of patents and trademarks was included in the reported G&A expenses.



DOC Position 


We agree with respondent. Upon review of the verification exhibits we found that the reported depreciation costs
included the amortization of patents and trademarks. (See Exhibit 14 and Cost Verification Report at 12). 


Comment 8 


Petitioner argues that, for purposes of calculating the CV for clinker in the final determination, the Department
should use the BIA profit ratio that the Department calculated for the preliminary determination. Petitioner does
not believe the Department should use the reported profit ratio because this calculation includes data on sales of
non-subject merchandise. Petitioner argues that this profit ratio expands beyond the CA cement and cement clinker
class or kind and, therefore, should not be used. Petitioner further maintains that in past cases the Department has
consistently rejected the use of profit based on merchandise other than of the class or kind subject to investigation.

Respondent contends that the antidumping statute does not require the Department to use the profit on the ``class
or kind'' of merchandise in its CV calculations. Rather, respondent states that the statute directs the Department
to use the profit rate on the ``general class or kind,'' indicating an intent that the Department have flexibility
in choosing the appropriate profit rate, and not be limited solely to the profit on the merchandise comprising the
``class or kind.'' 


DOC Position 


We agree with respondent. In accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B), we have used the verified profit rate for all CA
products, including the subject merchandise, sold in France because it represents the profit experience on sales
of the general class or kind of merchandise in the home market. 


Comment 9 


Petitioner contends that certain reported U.S. flux sales made under an expired master order allegedly renewed prior
to the POI should be included in the Department's analysis as sales made during the POI. Petitioner argues that the
master order expired prior to the POI and was not renewed prior to the POI as respondent claims. Despite respondent's
claim that prior to the POI the parties ``evidenced a clear intent to continue the contract under the terms specified
in the expired master order'' but failed to renew the contract due to internal delays, there is no evidence on the record
to support respondent's position. Petitioner argues that implicit renewal of the contract is not legally binding
(i.e., there was no binding agreement between the parties as to any essential terms of sale at the time shipments of
CA flux were made to this customer during the POI). According to petitioner, any shipments made to this customer during
the POI were individual spot sales with dates of sale established by the date of the invoices issued for particular
shipments. 
Respondent argues that the Department should use the date of the master order as the date of sale for sales made pursuant
to this contract (which it claims was renewed prior to the POI), and exclude them from the dumping analysis in the final
determination. Although the original contract expired prior to the POI, Lafarge claims that the customer continued
to purchase from LCA after that date in accordance with the sales terms set in the original contract. Moreover, respondent
maintains that the orders placed by the customer during the POI continued to reference the purchase order numbers
from the expired master order. According to respondent, the customer indicated its intent to re-issue the master
order, but had not yet done so because of internal delays. Based on these facts, respondent maintains that the shipments
to this customer during the POI continued to be governed by the terms of the original master order even if there was no
formal written agreement to that effect. 


DOC Position 


We agree with petitioner. The effective date of the subject master order was prior to the POI. At verification, LCA
could not provide any documentation indicating renewal of the subject master order prior to the POI. Without some
documentary evidence of a renewal of the master order prior to the POI, we cannot assume, based on respondent's word,
that the essential terms enumerated in the original master order (which expired three months prior to the POI) governed
the subject flux shipments made during the POI. (See Crankshafts from the FRG and Gray Portland Cement from Mexico.)
Therefore, we have included these sales in the final determination, using the verified date of purchase order (or
date of invoice where the date of purchase order was unavailable) as the date of sale.

Comment 10 


Respondent argues that certain reported flux shipments made in October 1992 pursuant to a contract claimed to be effective
prior to the POI, but the price terms of which were modified in November 1992, should not be included in our final dumping
analysis. Respondent claims that the date of the November 1992 price modification notice should be used as the date
of sale for subsequent sales made to this customer during the POI. Therefore, respondent asserts that all shipments
made after the November price modification should be included in the Department's final dumping calculations, while
those POI shipments made prior to the November price modification should be excluded from the final determination.




DOC Position 



We agree. Respondent reported all sales/shipments of flux to the customer in question pursuant to purchase orders
issued during the POI, because (1) it was unable to locate the original master order for that customer allegedly dated
prior to the POI and (2) the original price terms changed in November 1992. At verification, although we were unable
to locate the original master agreement or blanket purchase order for the subject customer, we did find a ``change
order'' dated November 2, 1992, which stipulated a change in price terms effective on that date. We also examined invoices
issued to this customer shortly before and after the November 2 change order date. Based on our examination of these
invoices, we found that the invoices confirmed LCA's acceptance of the November 2 change order, because the price
per ton LCA charged the customer changed after that date. In accordance with these verification findings, we have
included in our final dumping analysis only those shipments made after the November 1992 price modification, using
the November 2, 1992, change order date as the date of sale for these shipments. 



Comment 11 



Respondent argues that CV should be the basis for FMV because including home market bagging costs in variable COM would
cause the difmer adjustment to exceed 20 percent. Respondent states that the bags used in the home market are not merely
packing for shipment, but rather consumer required packaging; therefore, their costs must be treated as part of COM.
Respondent argues that it would be contrary to the Department's past practice to classify these bags as packing ``incidental''
to the shipment of the merchandise. To support its arguments, respondent cites the FMV Calculations performed pursuant
to the 1992 Suspension Agreement in the antidumping duty investigation on gray portland cement and clinker from Venezuela;
Final Determination of Sales At Less Than Fair Value: Porcelain-on-Steel Cooking Ware from Taiwan (51 FR 36425, October
10, 1986) (Porcelain-on-Steel Cooking Ware from Taiwan); Final Determination of Sales At Less Than Fair Value: Certain
Stainless Steel Cooking Ware from the Republic of Korea (51 FR 42873, November 26, 1986) (Stainless Steel Cooking
Ware from Korea); and 

Washington Red Raspberry Commission 

v. 

United States 

(859 F.2nd. 898, 905 (Fed. Cir. 1988)). 

Furthermore, respondent argues that the bags used for home market packing have a number of special features unrelated
to shipment: (1) they have built-in handles that facilitate use of a crane to lift the bag into the ladle or furnace of
a steel mill; (2) they are constructed of non-permeable polymer material that protects the flux from contaminants
in the steel mill environment and can vaporize in the steel melt without toxic emissions or undesirable residues;
and (3) they come in varying sizes which allows the customer to control the amount of flux introduced into the steel
melt. Respondent claims that its home market customers specifically order the bagged product, and they willingly
pay more for it because they perceive that it provides additional value. 

In addition, respondent maintains that, because the bags are part of the merchandise purchased by home market customers
and their costs are significant relative to the overall manufacturing costs of the product, it must set prices taking
into account the SG&A and profit attributable to the bagging which are also significant. However, because the
Department does not normally include SG&A and profit in packing or difmer adjustments, respondent contends
that the Department's comparison of prices for bagged flux sold in the home market and bulk flux exported to the United
States will not account for these factors and will therefore be distortive. Therefore, respondent argues that CV
should be used instead of home market prices for purposes of calculating FMV for flux sales.

Petitioner argues that bagging costs associated with home market flux sales should not be included in the calculation
of the difmer adjustment because they represent packing costs related to shipment of the merchandise to the home market
customer, rather than variable COM. Petitioner contends that such an inclusion is contrary to Department policy
which states that the difmer adjustment is limited only to costs directly attributable to differences in the physical
characteristics of the merchandise and that in this case all physical differences in the CA flux occur before the bagging/packing
stage. Petitioner further claims that, contrary to respondent's assertion, the bagging/packing at issue is not
consumer packing which serves an advertising, promotional and educational function at the point of sale to the retail
end-user. Rather, using bags is another way of handling and shipping flux in bulk quantities. To buttress its argument,
petitioner cites Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Pads for Woodwind Instrument Keys from Italy
(58 FR 42295, August 9, 1993) (Pads from Italy), Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Industrial Phosphoric
Acid from Israel (52 FR 25440, July 7, 1987) (Phosphoric Acid from Israel); and Preliminary Determination of Sales
at Less Than Fair Value: Gray Portland Cement and Clinker from Venezuela (56 FR 56390, November 4, 1991) (Gray Portland
Cement and Clinker from Venezuela). Petitioner claims that both respondent's CA flux marketing expert in France
and petitioner's CA flux marketing expert in the United States agree that when a customer does not have a dedicated
bulk storage silo system, the CA flux must be shipped to that customer in bags. Petitioner also contends that respondent's
claims that the design of its bags adds value to the customer are not relevant to the determination of whether the bagging
costs can be deducted as a packing expense. 

Petitioner further argues that respondent's cite to the suspension agreement concerning Gray Portland Cement and
Clinker from Venezuela where the Department treated bagging costs as part of COM for purposes of calculating an FMV
at or over which a Venezuelan cement producer/exporter would have to sell in the United States is not relevant because
calculation of a difmer adjustment was not at issue in that investigation. Petitioner points out that in the Venezuelan
cement investigation the Department made fair value comparisons of bulk cement sold to the United States with cement
sold in Venezuela in 50 to 100 pound sacks, but did not make a difmer adjustment for packing/bagging. Instead, it adjusted
for home market bagging costs by deducting them from FMV and adding the U.S. packing costs to FMV pursuant to its normal
practice. 

In addition, petitioner notes that the normal packing adjustment in this case would include all fixed costs as well
as variable costs of bagging/packing and thus would not distort fair value comparisons as would the inclusion of only
variable bagging/packing costs in the difmer adjustment, as respondent suggests. According to petitioner, any
claimed price distortions attributable to SG&A and profit associated with bagging/packing will be minimal
because Lafarge subcontracts these services (

i.e.

, the fees it pays to subcontractors would cover fixed costs such as G&A expenses, and any selling costs would be
included in normal circumstance-of-sale adjustments). Petitioner concludes that, even if packing costs are included
in the difmer adjustment, the Department should still use the home market sales data submitted by Lafarge after the
preliminary determination rather than CV for fair value comparisons because the U.S. and home market flux products
sold during the POI are comparable and the 20 percent difmer guideline is not an inflexible rule. 



DOC Position 



We agree with petitioner in part. At verification, respondent explained that flux is placed in special bags pursuant
to customer orders because home market customers do not have the appropriate facilities for handling and measuring
flux for use in their steel production process. Bagged flux is not sold from inventory. Flux can be sold in bulk form
without the specialty bags, and is sold as such to the United States and the majority of third country markets. The fact
that customers (in the home market or otherwise) have the choice to buy the flux without the special bagging strongly
suggests that the bagging is not an integral part of the product covered by the scope of the investigation and, therefore,
should not be considered part of variable COM and included in the difmer adjustment. This is in contrast to the situation
in 

Washington Red Raspberry Commission 

v. 

United States, 

where the subject merchandise [raspberries] would be unrecognizable and completely unusable without the containers
in which it was sold. 

Characterizing the bagging costs as variable COM as suggested by respondent is not justifiable in this case. Respondent
has not been able to explain to our satisfaction how bagging costs contribute to differences in the physical characteristics
of the merchandise, as directed by 19 CFR 353.57. (See also the Department's July 29, 1992 Policy Bulletin (No. 92.2),
which states that any difmer adjustment must be tied to such differences.) 

The 1986 less than fair value determinations cited by respondent are inapposite. Stainless Steel Cooking Ware from
Korea reflected our prior practice regarding the inclusion of difference in consumer packing in making difmer adjustments,
which was changed in the 1992 Policy Bulletin cited above. Likewise, in Porcelain-on-Steel Cookware from Taiwan,
we merely said that consumer packaging was not a cost incidental to shipment. We did not say that it constituted an integral
physical part of the merchandise under investigation. 

As noted above, in difmer analysis, we focus only on the differences in physical characteristics of the merchandise.
The merchandise in this instance is CA flux. Bagging does not change the physical characteristics of flux and, therefore,
it was not included in the difmer calculation. In the FMV Calculations performed pursuant to the Suspension Agreement
in Venezuelan cement, we were not examining the differences in the physical characteristics per se of the subject
merchandise. Therefore, respondent's reliance on Venezuelan cement is inapposite.

We also do not consider bagging costs as representative of normal packing costs. Rather, it appears to us that Lafarge
could not sell the flux to the home market customers without incurring these special bagging costs. While we agree
with petitioner that Pads from Italy is applicable here (in that difmer adjustments are based on the variable cost
of manufacture only), petitioner's reliance on Phosphoric Acid from Israel is misplaced, because the bagging for
flux is clearly distinguishable from the drums used for packing (and accounted for in packing costs) in Phosphoric
Acid from Israel. Therefore, we do not consider bagging in this case to be a pre-shipment expense, but rather a condition
of sale. For these reasons, we have treated these bagging costs as direct selling expenses, rather than as part of variable
COM or packing for purposes of the final determination. (See March 9, 1994, Memorandum from V. Irene Darzenta to Richard
W. Moreland Re. Treatment of Bagging Costs Associated with Home Market Sales of Flux.) Because the difmer that resulted
from exclusion of these costs from variable COM was less than 20 percent, we used the reported, verified home market
flux sales as the basis for FMV and deducted bagging costs as direct selling expenses from FMV accordingly. 



Comment 12 



Petitioner states that the difmer adjustment is also incorrect because respondent included fixed costs (i.e., G&A)
and profit in its calculation. Petitioner asserts that if the Department includes bagging in the difmer adjustment,
it should recalculate the amount of the difmer to include only variable costs. Finally, petitioner maintains that
the reported packing expenses, inclusive of bagging costs, should be adjusted to avoid double- counting G&A
expenses. 



DOC Position 



For the reasons stated in the DOC Position to Comment 11 above and in accordance with the Department's normal methodology,
we have recalculated the difmer adjustment to exclude bagging costs and include only variable COM. However, upon
further review of the documentation examined at verification, we note that the G&A expenses included in the reported
packing expenses were not double-counted. Notwithstanding this fact, we have also excluded from the packing adjustment
the reported G&A expenses. 



Comment 13 



Petitioner believes that the claimed adjustment for home market technical service expenses should be denied or reduced.
Petitioner maintains that the Department should deny the claimed direct adjustment for home market technical service
expenses, because these expenses cannot be directly tied to specific sales made during the POI. According to petitioner,
services such as those provided by respondent for purposes of determining new uses for a product in future production
aimed at increasing future sales levels constitute goodwill or sales promotion, and as such are not directly related
to the sales under consideration. Petitioner also argues that technical service expenses attributable to test sales
made during 1992 that are considered to be outside of the ordinary course of trade should be excluded from the adjustment;
however, because the Department did not verify data that would permit their exclusion, the Department should deny
the adjustment in toto. Nonetheless, if the Department determines that an adjustment is warranted, petitioner urges
that it should only deduct the reported travel expenses and not the reported salary expenses comprising respondent's
technical service expense calculation because salaries are considered fixed costs which are incurred whether or
not the services are provided. 

Respondent contends that technical service expenses should be treated as direct selling expenses in accordance
with past Department and court decisions. Respondent notes that the technical services performed by LFI in France
consist of visits to customers to review and help analyze the customers' test data and to work with the customer to make
more efficient use of flux in its steel operations. Lafarge emphasizes that the customer needs to know from the time
he makes his purchase that LFI's technical staff will be available to provide this analysis for him on an on-going basis.
According to respondent, these types of services are not provided by LCA in the United States because LCA's U.S. flux
customers perform this technical service using their own personnel. Respondent argues further that an adjustment
for technical service salaries is appropriate where the technical service personnel provide functions that the
customer would otherwise have to perform himself. 



DOC Position 



We agree with respondent in part. Lafarge provides the technical support to its home market customers because they
have not yet developed the systems required to perform these services themselves. Without Lafarge's technical support,
the customers cannot analyze and make appropriate adjustments in their steel production processes to optimize performance
of CA flux in their operations. Given the nature of the steelmaking industry, it is reasonable to believe that, while
these technical service expenses could not be directly tied to specific sales of flux, they would not otherwise have
been incurred but for the sale of flux. 

It is the Department's practice to allow, as a direct selling expense, claims for services rendered in assisting the
customer in solving problems with products purchased during the POI to the extent that the variable costs can be segregated
from the fixed costs. In general, variable technical service costs include travel expense, while fixed technical
service costs include salaries. (See e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Brass Sheet and Strip
from Italy, 52 FR 816, January 9, 1987; and Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Antifriction Bearings
(Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany, 54 FR 18992, May 3, 1989.)
Therefore, in accordance with our practice, we have treated travel expenses associated with technical services
as direct selling expenses, and we have treated salary expenses as indirect selling expenses and deducted them from
FMV accordingly. We made no adjustment to these amounts for expenses related to test sales that may have been made in
1992, because we did not have sufficient information on the record to allow us to do so accurately.

Comment 14 


Petitioner claims that the adjustment for home market credit expenses should be denied or reduced. Petitioner believes
that an adjustment for this expense should not be permitted because, of the sales verified, over one-quarter had incorrect
shipment/payment dates. If the Department allows this expense, petitioner argues that it should be recalculated
exclusive of VAT because Lafarge did not incur any credit expense for payment of the VAT. 

Respondent maintains that the Department should not deny or reduce home market credit expenses. It argues that the
errors found at verification with respect to shipment/payment dates were minor and clerical in nature, and do not
have a significant effect on the Department's analysis. According to respondent, by extending credit, Lafarge agrees
to forego immediate payment of the total invoice amount which includes the price for the goods and applicable VAT taxes.
It, therefore, loses the interest that could have been earned on the total invoice amount. Respondent asserts that
the foregone interest represents the opportunity cost of extending credit. Respondent further asserts that, because
this opportunity cost includes foregone interest on VAT, the foregone interest on VAT must be included in the credit
adjustment. 



DOC Position 



We disagree in part with both petitioner and respondent. We have determined that a credit adjustment in general is
warranted in this case. The errors found at verification with respect to the credit period reported for two home market
transactions were clerical and minor in nature and related to sales made either out of the ordinary course of trade
or to a third country which we have excluded from our analysis. (

See

 the ``Foreign Market Value'' section of this notice.) However, we have also determined that there is no statutory
or regulatory basis for including VAT in the credit adjustment. While there may be an opportunity cost associated
with extending credit on the payment of invoice value inclusive of VAT, that fact alone is not a sufficient basis for
the Department to make an adjustment. We note that virtually every expense associated with less than fair value comparisons
is paid for at some point after the cost is incurred. Accordingly, for each post-service payment, there is also an opportunity
cost. Thus, to allow the type of adjustment suggested by respondent would imply that in the future the Department would
be faced with the impossible task of trying to determine the opportunity cost of every freight charge, rebate, and
selling expense for each sale reported in respondent's database. This exercise would make our calculations inordinately
complicated, placing an unreasonable and onerous burden on both respondents and the Department. (See e.g., Final
Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sulfur Dyes, Including Sulfur Vat Dyes, from the United Kingdom, 58
FR 3253, January 8, 1993.) Consequently, we have recalculated home market credit expenses to exclude the VAT included
in the gross unit prices used in the original calculation. 



Comment 15 



Petitioner argues that home market product liability costs are indirect rather than direct selling expenses because
they are not directly related to sales made during the POI. Respondent disagrees, stating that these premiums are
directly related to sales because the premium is assessed on sales value. According to respondent, each additional
sale results in an additional product liability premium expense. 



DOC Position 



Because these premiums are assessed based on sales value, we have determined that these expenses are characteristic
of direct expenses. We note that the U.S. product liability premium rates reported for U.S. sales of flux and cement
were also based on sales value. Therefore, we have treated both home market and U.S. product liability expenses as
direct selling expenses for purposes of the final determination, and have adjusted FMV and USP accordingly. 



Comment 16 



Petitioner claims that those sales made to a home market customer that were destined for export should not be included
as home market sales in the Department's analysis. Petitioner states that the Department verified that Lafarge knew
that certain sales of CA flux were to be exported to a third country at the time of sale to the home market customer. Accordingly,
petitioner argues that these sales should not be included in the Department's FMV calculation.

DOC Position 


We agree and have excluded these sales from our analysis. 


Comment 17 


Petitioner believes that for purposes of calculating profit related to the value added in the United States, U.S.
brokerage and handling (including merchandise processing and harbor maintenance), U.S. unloading, U.S. loading
and U.S. freight to processors costs, where applicable, should be attributed to the COM of CA clinker and flux in the
United States because these expenses are incurred only after the product has arrived in the United States. Petitioner
further believes that certain U.S. selling expenses (e.g., credit, warranty, indirect selling expenses, inventory
carrying costs and product liability expenses) should also be included as part of U.S. further manufacturing costs.

Respondent does not believe that the Department should consider these charges and expenses to be part of U.S. further
manufacturing costs, as petitioner requests. Lafarge contends that petitioner's argument is inconsistent with
the antidumping statute and was put forth by petitioner solely to increase the profit allocated to further manufacturing
and, as a result, the adjustment to USP. 


DOC Position 


We disagree with petitioner. Because U.S. brokerage and handling, and U.S. unloading and loading costs, are incurred
on the imported merchandise prior to the commencement of further manufacturing in the United States, we find that
they do not form part of the value added in the United States. Regarding the costs of freight to processors' warehouses
associated with flux sales, we find that they do form part of the costs of further manufacturing the imported flux in
the United States because these costs are incurred to transport the imported flux to and among the processors' warehouses
for further manufacture. For U.S. cement sales, however, such transfer freight costs represent costs incurred to
transport the already further manufactured clinker (i.e., the finished cement) to the warehouses from which the
finished product is ultimately sold to U.S. customers. No freight to processors costs are incurred on U.S. cement
sales because the further processing occurs at Lafarge's plant which is located at the U.S. port of importation. Regarding
U.S. selling expenses, these expenses are incurred to sell both the imported and further manufactured products.
Therefore, adding these expenses to U.S. further manufacturing costs, as petitioner suggests, would disproportionately
increase the U.S. value added for purposes of calculating profit. (See e.g., Wire Rods from France.) Of the expenses
at issue, we have only included costs of freight to processors associated with U.S. flux sales as part of U.S. value
added in our final profit calculation. 


Comment 18 


Petitioner claims that the Department should recalculate respondent's U.S. indirect selling and G&A expenses
for both cement and flux sales. Petitioner argues that, based on the Department's instructions, LCA's administration
costs should have been reported as G&A (rather than indirect selling expenses), allocated based on cost of sales
and included in the U.S. COM. According to petitioner, the Department should reduce the reported indirect selling
expenses and the corresponding ESP cap. 
Respondent maintains that LCA's calculation correctly assigned its administrative expenses to its operations.
According to Lafarge, because LCA's administrative staff supports LCA's sales operations as well as factory operations,
a portion of LCA's administrative expenses should be considered sales administration and treated as an indirect
selling expense. Respondent notes, however, that it would not object if the Department reduces the amount of administrative
expenses assigned to the products under investigation under petitioner's proposal. Respondent contends that if
the Department accepts petitioner's argument that U.S. indirect selling expenses and G&A should be recalculated,
it should revise petitioner's calculations to use the correct, verified figures. 


DOC Position 


We agree with petitioner on the need to reclassify LCA's administrative expenses. Because these expenses are more
appropriately characteristic of G&A expenses, we have reclassified them from indirect selling to G&A expenses
based on verified data on the record. 


Comment 19 


Petitioner argues that no offset to financial expenses should be allowed for the short-term interest income claimed
by Lafarge for purposes of calculating clinker CV and clinker and flux further manufacturing costs. Petitioner contends
that the Department was unable to verify that the interest income reported was short-term in nature. Nor could the
Department verify whether the reported interest income was related to the manufacture of the subject merchandise,
according to petitioner. 
Respondent asserts that the Lafarge corporate policy is not to invest in assets which produce other than short-term
interest income. Accordingly, respondent maintains that all interest income earned by respondent's parent company
Lafarge Coppee was short-term in nature, and an offset to interest expense should be allowed for the entire reported
short-term interest income amount. 


DOC Position 


We agree with petitioner. The Department normally allows an offset to financial expenses for interest income earned
on short-term investments of working capital related to the production of the subject merchandise. The Department
does not offset interest expense with interest income earned on long-term investments related to activities unrelated
to the manufacturing process. Because we were unable to verify the nature of the interest income reported, we have
disallowed the financial expense offset claimed by Lafarge. 


Comment 20 


Petitioner notes that the Department discovered at verification that the depreciation of R&D assets was not
included in the R&D expenses reported for purposes of calculating clinker CV. Petitioner states that the Department
should include this depreciation in the reported R&D expenses.

DOC Position 


We agree and have adjusted the R&D expenses reported for purposes of calculating clinker CV to reflect the inclusion
of depreciation for R&D assets. We note that this adjustment also affected the total reported COM of the imported
clinker and flux used in the calculation of U.S. value added profit. 


Comment 21 


Petitioner asserts that exchange rate gains and losses should be added to raw material costs for purposes of calculating
clinker CV. According to petitioner, during verification the Department discovered that Lafarge had not reported
the foreign exchange gains and losses related to the importation of raw materials used to produce the subject merchandise.



DOC Position 


We agree, based on our findings at verification, that Lafarge did not report these foreign exchange gains and losses.
Accordingly, we have added these gains and losses to the reported raw material costs for purposes of calculating clinker
CV for the final determination. We note that this adjustment also affected the total reported COM of the imported clinker
and flux used in the calculation of U.S. value added profit. 


Comment 22 


Petitioner argues that, because LFI repeatedly refused to separately report its labor costs and classify them according
to Department practice as variable costs for purposes of calculating clinker CV and total flux and clinker COM used
in the calculation of U.S. value added profit, the Department must resort to BIA to determine these costs. As BIA, petitioner
asserts that the Department should not annualize any fixed costs but rather use only the fixed costs reported for the
POI. Petitioner argues that this is a reasonable BIA methodology given the Department's inability to break out the
labor costs from fixed costs and properly treat the labor costs as variable costs. 
Respondent contends that LFI's labor costs have the characteristics of fixed costs since the number of workers working
at LFI's plants is generally constant and the total pool of labor costs tends not to vary with production levels. LFI
also asserts that labor costs are distorted by fluctuations in monthly production volumes as a result of plant shut-downs
for maintenance. According to respondent, the use of fixed costs for the POI would distort the Department's CV and
further manufacturing cost calculations. LFI states that, under the logic of the preliminary determination, fixed
labor costs should be based on the reported annual period. 


DOC Position 


We agree with petitioner. Lafarge normally records labor costs for clinker and flux as a fixed cost. Respondent followed
its normal accounting system for the response and reported labor as a fixed cost for the year 1992. This methodology
differs from the Department's normal practice where labor is considered a variable cost and as such would be reported
on a weighted-average basis for the POI. 
In the preliminary determination the Department accepted the annualization of fixed costs because LFI claimed that
periodic shut-down expenses incurred for maintaining its furnaces created significant aberrations in monthly
production costs. In order to eliminate the effect of these distortions, we allowed LFI to report fixed costs on an
annual weighted-average basis. 
However, it was not until verification that the Department first discovered that labor costs were included in the
reported annualized fixed costs. The Department's Section D and E questionnaires for clinker and flux identified
direct and indirect labor as costs that should be reported as variable costs for response purposes. The questionnaires
also specifically requested that LFI itemize the expenses included in fixed and variable costs. LFI did not itemize
its variable or fixed costs or otherwise identify how it treated its labor costs in response to the Department's requests.
Because LFI was not responsive to the Department's requests for information and incorrectly classified labor costs
as fixed costs, and since there was no information on the record to permit the accurate reclassification of labor costs,
we have disallowed the annualization of fixed costs and have used only the reported fixed costs for the POI as BIA for
purposes of the final determination. 


Suspension of Liquidation 


In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation
of all entries of CA cement and cement clinker from France and to begin the suspension of liquidation of all entries
of CA flux from France that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication
of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated margin amount by which
the FMV of the subject merchandise exceeds the USP, as shown below. The less than fair value margins for CA cement and
cement clinker are as follows:

ITC Notification 



In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the International Trade Commission (ITC) of our determinations.
As our final determinations are affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring,
or threaten material injury to, the U.S. industry within 45 days. 

If the ITC determines that material injury or threat of material injury does not exist, the proceedings will be terminated
and all securities posted as a result of the suspension of liquidation will be refunded or cancelled. However, if the
ITC determines that such injury does exist, we will issue an antidumping duty order directing Customs officers to
assess an antidumping duty on CA cement, cement clinker and flux from France entered or withdrawn from warehouse,
for consumption on or after the date of suspension of liquidation. 



Notification to Interested Parties 



This notice serves as the only reminder to parties subject to 
administrative protective order (APO) in these investigations of their responsibility covering the return or destruction
of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Failure to comply is a violation
of the APO. 

These determinations are published pursuant to section 735(d) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673d(d)) and 19 CFR 353.20(a)(4).

Fair Value Comparisons 



Based on the data provided by the petitioner, there is reason to believe that the merchandise is being, or is likely
to be, sold at less than fair value. The margins alleged by petitioners are listed below. If it becomes necessary at
a later date to consider the petitions as a source of best information available (BIA) in any of the investigations,
we may review more thoroughly all of the bases for USP and FMV in determining BIA. 






Initiation of Investigations 
 



We have examined the petition on pipe fittings from France, India, Israel, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand (manufacturer:
AST), the United Kingdom, and Venezuela and have found that it meets the requirements of section 732(b) of the Act.
Therefore, we are initiating antidumping duty investigations to determine whether imports of pipe fittings from
France, India, Israel, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand (manufacturer: AST), the United Kingdom, and Venezuela
are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value. 



ITC Notification 



Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the International Trade Commission (ITC) of this action and we have
done so. 



Preliminary Determination by the ITC 




The ITC will determine by April 14, 1994, pursuant to 
section 733(a)(1) of the Act, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of pipe fittings from France,
India, Israel, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand (manufacturer: AST), the United Kingdom, and Venezuela are materially
injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. Pursuant to section 733(a)(2) of the Act, a negative ITC
determination will result in the respective investigation being terminated; otherwise, the investigations will
proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits. 

This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b).

10. Benefits for 100 Percent Export-Oriented Units 
11. Benefits Provided by Export-Processing Zones




We are not including the following programs which are alleged to be benefitting producers of the subject merchandise
in India. (For a more detailed discussion, see the Memorandum to Barbara R. Stafford from Team dated March 21, 1994,
on file in the Central Records Unit of the Main Commerce Building.) 



1. Regional Incentives



Petitioner alleges that new projects and industries in ``backward'' states may be eligible for subsidies from the
Government of India (``GOI'') or the state government. According to petitioner, the subsidies include federal and
state tax benefits and fixed-capital investment subsidies. However, petitioner has not provided any information
that the producers of pipe fittings are located in these ``backward'' states. 



Rebates Under the Cash Compensatory Support Program



The Cash Compensatory Support Program (``CCS'') was established in 1966 by the GOI to rebate indirect taxes on exported
merchandise. Petitioner argues that although the GOI suspended the program effective July 3, 1991, producers/exporters
of pipe fittings may be receiving residual benefits.

We verified in the 1990 Administrative Review of the Countervailing Duty Order on Certain Iron-Metal Castings from
India that the GOI terminated cash rebates on exports made after July 2, 1991 (

see

 the December 13, 1993 government verification report on file in Room B-099 of the Main Commerce Building).

Because we consider the countervailable benefit from this program to occur at the time the benefit is earned, 

i.e.

, at the time of export, and not when a company applies for or receives the benefit (see section 355.48(b)(7) of the Department's
proposed regulations in Countervailing Duties; notice of proposed rulemaking and Request for Public Comments,
54 FR 23366 (May 31, 1989); and Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Steel Wire Rope from India,
56 FR 46292, 46294 (September 11, 1991)), the producers of pipe fittings could not have benefitted from this program
during the period of investigation. 



3. Reduced Freight Rates



Petitioner alleges that the cost of delivery for steel is reduced for customers located in remote areas of India. However,
petitioner has not provided sufficient information concerning the nature of this program or information indicating
that the producers of pipe fittings are located in ``remote areas.'' 



Israel



1. Grants under the Encouragement of Capital Investments Law of 1959 (``ECIL'')

2. Other Benefits Under ECIL



a. Section 42_Preferential Accelerated Depreciation 

b. Section 46_Tax Benefits

c. Section 24_Preferential Loans

d. Interest Subsidy Payments



3. Long-Term Industrial Development Loans

4. Exchange Rate Risk Insurance Scheme

5. Labor Training Grants

6. Industrial Research and Development Grants

7. Special Export Financing Loans

8. Export Incentives



a. Exception from wharfage fee and indirect taxes

b. Provision of funds for transportation of goods to Eilat Harbor





We are not including the following programs which are alleged to be benefitting producers of the subject merchandise
in Israel. (For a more detailed discussion, see the Memorandum to Barbara R. Stafford from Team dated March 14, 1994,
on file in the Central Records Unit of the Main Commerce Building.) 



1. Partial Tax Exemption Under ECIL



Petitioner alleged that manufacturers of pipe fittings may have received partial tax exemptions under ECIL. However,
this program was determined in a previous case to be terminated. See Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination
of Oil Country Tubular Goods from Israel, 52 FR 1649 (January 15, 1987). Petitioner provided no new information to
indicate that residual benefits are being received or that the program has been re-enacted.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:






Authority: 

Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended; section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C.
1854).




In a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated February 11, 1994, the Governments of the United States and the Democratic
Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka agreed to amend and extend their bilateral textile agreement through June 30, 1995.

In the letter published below, the Chairman of CITA directs the Commissioner of Customs to amend the current restraint
period to begin on January 1, 1994 and extend through June 30, 1995 and establish a six-month period for July 1, 1993
through December 31, 1993. The limits for Categories 334/634, 335/835, 340/640, 340-Y/640-Y, 341/641,
347/348/847, 347-T/348-T/847-T, 351/651 and 635 for the period July 1, 1993 through December 31,
1993 will be filled upon opening. Goods shipped in excess of these limits are being charged to the corresponding limits
for the January 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995 period. Also, the visa arrangement is being amended to no longer require
a 347-T/348-T/847-T visa for goods produced or manufactured in Sri Lanka and exported from Sri Lanka.

 

A description of the textile and apparel categories in terms of HTS numbers is available in the CORRELATION: Textile
and Apparel Categories with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (see

March 22, 1994.




Commissioner of Customs,


Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229.




Dear Commissioner: This directive amends, but does not cancel, the directive issued to you on June 22, 1993 by the Chairman,
Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. That directive concerns imports of certain cotton, wool
and man-made fiber textile products and silk blend and other vegetable fiber apparel produced or manufactured in
the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the twelve-month period which began on July 1, 1993 and extends
through June 30, 1994. 

Effective on March 28, 1994, you are directed, pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated February 11,
1994 between the Governments of the United States and the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, to amend the
current restraint period to begin on January 1, 1994 and extend through June 30, 1995 at the levels listed below. The
sublimit for Categories 347-T/348-T/847-T and the limit for Category 361 shall be eliminated.




 



Textile products in Categories 360, 435, 611 and 840 which have been exported to the United States prior to January
1, 1994 shall not be subject to this directive.

Textile products in Categories 360, 435, 611 and 840 which have been released from the custody of the U.S. Customs Service
under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1448(b) or 1484(a)(1) prior to the effective date of this directive shall not be denied
entry under this directive.



Under the terms of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854), and the Arrangement Regarding
International Trade in Textiles done at Geneva on December 20, 1973, as further extended on December 9, 1993; pursuant
to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated February 11, 1994 between the Governments of the United States and
the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka; and in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 11651 of
March 3, 1972, as amended, you are directed to prohibit, effective on March 28, 1994, entry into the United States for
consumption and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of cotton, wool and man-made fiber textile products and
silk blend and other vegetable fiber apparel in the following categories, produced or manufactured in Sri Lanka and
exported during the six-month period beginning on July 1, 1993 and extending through December 31, 1993, in excess
of the following levels of restraint:









Goods exported in excess of the limits established for the July 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993 period shall be charged
to the period January 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995.


You are directed to deduct the following amounts from the charges made to the following categories for the period beginning
on January 1, 1994 and extending through June 30, 1995. These same amounts shall be charged to the corresponding categories
for the period beginning on July 1, 1993 and extending through December 31, 1993.






Also, you are directed to deduct 385,234 dozen from the charges made to Categories 347/348/847 for the period January
1, 1994 through June 30, 1995. This same amount shall be charged to Categories 347-T/348-T/847-T
for the July 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993 period.


You are directed to amend further the directive dated September 1, 1988 to no longer require a part-category visa for
347-T/348-T/847-T for goods produced or manufactured in Sri Lanka and exported from Sri Lanka on
and after March 28, 1994. Goods exported during the period March 28, 1994 through April 27, 1994 shall not be denied
entry if visaed as 347-T/348-T/847-T.

In carrying out the above directions, the Commissioner of Customs should construe entry into the United States for
consumption to include entry for consumption into the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that these actions fall within the foreign
affairs exception of the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1).

Sincerely,

ACTION: 

Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy (DOE), Chicago Field Office, through the Dallas Support Office, announces that it intends
to award a grant to Oklahoma State University (OSU)/International Ground Source Heat Pump Association (IGSHPA).
The proposed award meets the criteria in 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(B) in addition to the type of factors listed in 10 CFR
600.14(d). The financial assistance is for support of the Geothermal Heating and Cooling Teleconference '94 and
'95.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Geothermal Heating and Cooling Teleconference '94 and '95 are the most significant national teleconferences
concentrating on the use of ground source heat pumps as an energy efficient method of heating and cooling buildings.
The primary target audiences for these teleconferences are school buildings, residences and government buildings.
These buildings have unique needs for heating, cooling and water heating. Advances in ground source heat pump efficiency
and installation techniques, as well as reductions in installation costs, make the cost of this technology comparable
with those of competitive heating and cooling technologies, while operating costs and energy usage are demonstrably
lower. This is especially important for institutional and government facilities faced with budget constraints
and increasing utility expenditures. These teleconferences, which will include successful case studies and interviews
with designers, technical experts and representatives of the various targeted audiences, will provide information
on a economical, energy efficient and environmentally beneficial method for heating and cooling facilities. DOE's
mission of increasing energy efficiency in the institutional, residential and governmental sectors will be advanced
through participation in the teleconference. The DOE anticipates providing funds in the amount of $30,000 for each
of the two teleconferences over a project period of 24 months.

Responsible Accounting Officers: ARMIS USOA Report (FCC Report 43-02)_Corrections and Clarification of
Certain Tables, Instructions and Specifications


The purpose of this letter is to advise the carriers that file ARMIS USOA Report (FCC Report 43-02) that we are
making minor corrections to the report for the 1993 reporting year. These changes are to the Reporting Procedures
Section, Report Definition_Forms and Instructions Section, and the Automated Report Specifications Section.
Additionally, on January 31, 1994, the Commission adopted a Report and Order in CC Docket No. 89-360 incorporating
the accounting for income taxes set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS-109). The Report and Order adds three new accounts to Part
32 of the Rules so that carriers can adopt SFAS-109 for federal accounting purposes in a revenue neutral manner.
These new accounts will be added to the ARMIS Report in 1994. The Report and Order does, however, give the carriers the
option of adopting the SFAS-109 accounting changes in 1993. Since some carriers may decide to adopt SFAS-109
in 1993, we believe that the following guidance is needed on how to report this action in their 1993 ARMIS reports.
For the 1993 ARMIS reporting purposes, amounts recorded in the new Account 1437, Deferred Tax Regulatory Asset, should
be added to the balance in Account 1439, Deferred Charges, and reported on the appropriate row for Account 1439, and
amounts recorded in new Accounts 4341, Net Deferred Tax Liability Adjustments, and 4361, Deferred Tax Regulatory
Liability, should be added to the balance in Account 4370, Other Jurisdictional Liabilities and Deferred Credits-Net,
and reported on the appropriate row for Account 4370. In addition, the balances of Accounts 1437, 4341 and 4361 should
be disclosed in a footnote to the appropriate ARMIS reports, e.g., ARMIS Reports 43-01, 43-02 and 43-03.
The corrections to the Reporting Procedures and Report Definition Sections along with the descriptions thereof
are contained in Attachment A, and the corrections to the Automated Report Specifications Section are contained
in Attachment B.
This letter and attachments are issued under Section 0.291 of the Commission's Rules. Applications for review under
Section 1.115 of the Commission's Rules must be filed within 30 days from the date of public notice of this letter.
If you have any questions, contact Kenneth M. Ackerman or Virginia Brockington at (202) 634-1861.

Notice. 
 


 
 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This is a notice of the Presidential declaration of a major disaster for the State of Maryland (FEMA-1016-DR),
dated March 16, 1994, and related determinations. 
 


 
 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Notice is hereby given that, in a letter dated March 16, 1994, the President declared a major disaster under the authority
of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 

et seq

.), as follows: 
 


 
 
 

I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of Maryland, resulting from ice storms on February 8-18,
1994, is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant a major disaster declaration under the Robert T. Stafford
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford Act''). I, therefore, declare that such a major disaster
exists in the State of Maryland. 
 
In order to provide Federal assistance, you are hereby authorized to allocate from funds available for these purposes,
such amounts as you find necessary for Federal disaster assistance and administrative expenses. 
 
You are authorized to provide reimbursement for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and the repair of
public utilities under the Public Assistance program in the designated areas. Other assistance under Public Assistance
may be added at a later date, if warranted. Since information regarding other damages in the State of Maryland is still
being gathered, you may modify the event description and/or time period after additional information has been obtained,
if warranted. Consistent with the requirement that Federal assistance be supplemental, any Federal funds provided
under the Stafford Act for Public Assistance will be limited to 75 percent of the total eligible costs. 
 


 
 

The time period described for the implementation of section 310(a), Priority to Certain Applications for Public
Facility and Public Housing Assistance, 42 U.S.C. 5153, shall be for a period not to exceed six months after the date
of this declaration. 
 
Notice is hereby give that pursuant to the authority vested in the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
under Executive Order 12148, I hereby appoint Jack Schuback of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to act as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for this declared disaster. 
 
I do hereby determine the following areas of the State of Maryland to have been affected adversely by this declared
major disaster: 
 


 
 

Calvert, Caroline, Charles, Dorchester, St. Mary's and Talbot Counties for reimbursement for debris removal, emergency
protective measures, and the repair of public utilities under the Public Assistance program.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The attached bulletins inform agencies of the establishment of a special actual subsistence expense ceiling for
official travel to Augusta (Richmond County), Georgia and Oshkosh (Winnebago County), Wisconsin. The Secretary
of Transportation (DOT) requested establishment of the increased rates to accommodate employees who perform temporary

the escalation of lodging rates during the annual Masters Golf Tournament in Augusta, or the annual Experimental
Aircraft Association Convention and Show in Oshkosh.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Administrator of General Services, pursuant to 41 CFR 301-8.3(c) and at the official request of the Secretary
of Transportation, has increased the maximum daily amount of reimbursement that may be approved for actual and necessary
subsistence expenses for official travel to Augusta (Richmond County), Georgia for travel during the period April
4 through April 10, 1994, and to Oshkosh (Winnebago County), Wisconsin for travel during the period July 28 through
August 3, 1994. The attached GSA Bulletins FTR 12 and 13 are issued to inform agencies of the establishment of these

March 17, 1994.


To: Heads of Federal agencies
Subject: Reimbursement of higher actual subsistence expenses for travel to Augusta (Richmond County), Georgia



1. 

Purpose.

 This bulletin informs agencies of the establishment of a special actual subsistence expense ceiling for official
travel to Augusta (Richmond County), Georgia, due to the escalation of lodging rates during the annual Masters Golf
Tournament held there. This special rate applies to claims for reimbursement covering travel during the period April
4, 1994, through April 10, 1994.
2. 

Background.

 The Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) (41 CFR chapters 301-304) part 301-8 permits the Administrator of
General Services to establish a higher maximum daily rate for the reimbursement of actual subsistence expenses of
Federal employees on official travel to an area within the continental United States. The head of an agency may request
establishment of such a rate when special or unusual circumstances result in an extreme increase in subsistence costs
for a temporary period. The Secretary of Transportation (DOT) requested establishment of such a rate for Augusta
to accommodate employees who perform temporary duty there and experience a temporary but significant increase in
lodging costs due to the escalation of lodging rates during the annual Masters Golf Tournament. These circumstances
justify the need for higher subsistence expense reimbursement in Augusta during the designated period.
3. 

Maximum rate and effective date.

 The Administrator of General Services, pursuant to 41 CFR 301-8.3(c), has increased the maximum daily amount
of reimbursement that may be approved for actual and necessary subsistence expenses for official travel to Augusta
(Richmond County), Georgia for travel during the period April 4, 1994, through April 10, 1994. Agencies may approve
actual subsistence expense reimbursement not to exceed $210.00 ($184.00 maximum for lodging and a $26.00 allowance
for meals and incidental expenses) for travel to Augusta (Richmond County), Georgia, during this time period.

Administration for Native Americans: Availability of Financial Assistance

 Administration for Native Americans (ANA), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Department of Health
and Human Services, (HHS).

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Announcement of availability of competitive financial assistance to assist eligible applicants in assuring the
survival and continuing vitality of their Native American languages.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Administration for Native Americans (ANA) announces the availability of fiscal year 1994 funds for Native American
Language projects. Financial assistance provided by ANA is designed to assist applicants in designing projects
which will promote the survival and continuing vitality of Native American languages.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

A. Introduction and Purpose 



The program announcement states the availability of fiscal year 1994 financial assistance to eligible applicants
for the purpose of assisting Native Americans in assuring the survival and continuing vitality of their languages.
Financial assistance awards made under this program announcement will be on a competitive basis and the proposals
will be reviewed against the evaluation criteria in this announcement. 

The Congress has recognized that the history of past policies of the United States toward Indian and other Native American
languages has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of Native American languages that have survived over the
past five hundred years. Consequently, the ``Native American Languages Act'' was enacted (Title I, Pub. L. 101-477)
to address this decline. 

This legislation invested the United States government with the responsibility to work together with Native Americans
to ensure the survival of cultures and languages unique to Native America. This law declared that it is the policy of
the United States to ``preserve, protect, and promote the rights and freedom of Native Americans to use, practice,
and develop Native American languages.'' While the Congress made a significant first step in passing this legislation
in 1990, it served only as a declaration of policy. No program initiatives were proposed, nor any funds authorized
to enact any significant programs in furtherance of this policy. 

In 1992, Congressional testimony provided estimates that of the several hundred languages that once existed, only
about one hundred and fifty-five (155) languages are still spoken or remembered today. However, only 20 are spoken
by persons of all ages, 30 are spoken by adults of all ages, about 60 are spoken by middle-aged adults, and 45 are spoken
only by the most elderly. 

In response to this testimony, the Congress passed P.L. 102-524, ``the Native American Languages Act of 1992''
(the Act) to assist Native Americans in assuring the survival and continuing vitality of their languages. Passage
of the Act is an important second step in attempting to ensure the survival and continuation of Native American languages,
as it provides the basic foundation upon which the Tribal nations can rebuild their economic strength and rich cultural
diversity. 

While the Federal government recognizes that substantial loss of Native American languages has occurred over the
past several hundred years, the nature and magnitude of the status of Native American languages will be better defined
when eligible applicants under the Act have completed language assessments. 

The Administration for Native Americans (ANA) believes that responsibility for achieving self-sufficiency rests
with the governing bodies of Indian tribes, Alaska Native villages, and in the leadership of Native American groups.
This belief supports the ANA principle that the local community and its leadership are responsible for determining
goals, setting priorities, and planning and implementing programs which support the community's long range goals.

Therefore, since preserving a language and ensuring its continuation is generally one of the first steps taken toward
strengthening a group's identity, activities proposed under this program announcement will contribute to the social
development of a native community and significantly contribute to its path toward self-sufficiency. 

The Administration for Native Americans recognizes that eligible applicants must have the opportunity to develop
their own language plans, technical capabilities and access to the necessary financial and technical resources
in order to assess, plan, develop and implement programs to assure the survival and continuing vitality of their languages.
ANA also recognizes that potential applicants may have specialized knowledge and capabilities to address specific
language concerns at various levels. This program announcement reflects these special needs and circumstances.




B. Proposed Projects To Be Funded in FY 1994 



The purpose of this announcement is to invite single year or up to thirty-six month proposals from eligible applicants
to undertake any one of the identified purposes, as appropriate to the applicant. Planning Grants, funded under Category
I, are limited to 12 months. 

Applicants may apply for projects of up to 36 months duration under Category II, Design and/or Implementation Grants.
A multi-year project, requiring more than 12 months to develop and complete, affords applicants the opportunity
to develop more complex and in-depth projects. Funding after the first 12 month budget period of an approved multi-year
project is non-competitive and subject to availability of funds. (see Part E for further information) 



1. Category I_Planning Grants 



The purpose of the planning grants is to conduct the assessment and planning needed to identify the current status
of the Native American language(s) to be addressed and to establish community long-range language goals. These activities
must include, but are not limited to, the following: 

 Data collection, compilation and analysis to ascertain current language status through ``formal'' (e.g.,
work performed by a linguist, and/or a language survey conducted by community members) or ``informal'' (e.g., a community
consensus of the language status based on elders, tribal scholars, and/or other community members) methods; 

 Establishment of the community's long-range language goals; and 

 Acquisition of the necessary training and technical assistance to assure the achievement of the project goals.




2. Category II_Design and/or Implementation Grants 



The purpose of design/or implementation grants is to allow communities to design and/or implement, as appropriate
to the applicant, a language program or programs that will contribute to the achievement of the community's long-range
language goal(s). Applicants under Category II must be able to document that: (a) Language statistics have been collected
and analyzed, and that these statistics are current (compiled within thirty-six months prior to the grant application);
(b) that the community has established long-range language goals; and (c) that community representatives are adequately
trained to achieve the proposed project goals. 

Under Category II grants, applicants may include the purchase of specialized equipment (including audio and video
recording equipment, computers, and software) which is necessary to accomplish project objectives. The applicant
must fully justify the need for this equipment and explain how it will assist them in achieving their project objectives.


The types of activities ANA is seeking to fund under Category II grants include, but are not limited to, the following:


 Establishment and support of community Native American language projects to bring older and younger Native
Americans together to facilitate and encourage the transfer of Native American languages skills from one generation
to another; 

 Establishment of projects to train Native Americans to teach Native American languages to others or to enable
them to serve as interpreters or translators of such languages; 

 Development, printing, and dissemination of materials to be used for the teaching and enhancement of Native
American languages; 

 Establishment or support of projects to train Native Americans to produce or participate in television or
radio programs to be broadcast in Native American languages; and

Native American language grants funded by this program announcement must be transmitted to this designated repository.
Federally recognized Indian Tribes (as listed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in an October 21, 1993 

Federal Register

 notice) are not required to comply with this provision. 



C. Eligible Applicants 



The following organizations are eligible to apply for funding under this program announcement: 

 Federally recognized Indian tribes (as listed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in an October 21, 1993 

Federal Register

 notice); 

 Incorporated Non-Federally recognized Indian tribes; 

 Alaska Native villages as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANSCA) and/or nonprofit village
consortia; 

 Nonprofit Alaska Native Regional Associations with village specific projects; 

 Nonprofit Native organizations in Alaska with village specific projects;  Incorporated nonprofit
multi-purpose community-based Indian organizations; 

 Urban Indian Centers: 

 Public and nonprofit private agencies serving Native Hawaiians; 

 National or regional incorporated nonprofit Native American organizations with Native American community-specific
objectives; 

 Public and nonprofit private agencies serving native peoples from Guam, American Samoa, Palau, or the Commonwealth
of the Northern Mariana Islands (The populations served may be located on these islands or in the United States.);
and 

 Tribally Controlled Community Colleges, Tribally Controlled Post-Secondary Vocational Institutions,
and colleges and universities located in Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, Palau, or the Commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands which serve Native American Pacific Islanders.




In addition, current ANA SEDS grantees are also eligible to apply for a grant award under this program announcement.




Participating Organizations 



If a tribal organization, or other eligible applicant, decides that the objectives of its proposed Native American
language project would be accomplished more effectively through a partnership arrangement with a school, college,
or university, the applicant shall identify such school, college, or university as a participating organization
in its application. Under a partnership agreement, the applicant will be responsible for the fiscal, administrative
and programmatic management of the grant. 



D. Available Funds 



Subject to availability of funds, ANA estimates that approximately $1,000,000 is available for financial assistance
in FY 1994 under this program announcement. For Category I, Planning Grants, the funding level for a budget period
of 12 months will be up to $50,000. For Category II, Design and/or Implementation Grants, the funding level for a budget
period of 12 months will be up to $125,000. 

Each eligible applicant can receive only one grant award under this announcement. The Administration for Native
Americans will accept only one application from any one applicant. If an eligible applicant sends in two applications,
the one with the earlier postmark will be accepted for review unless the applicant withdraws the earlier application.




E. Multi-Year Projects 



This announcement is soliciting applications for project periods up to three years. Awards, on a competitive basis,
will be for a one-year budget period, although project periods may be for three years. Applications for continuation
grants funded under these awards beyond the one-year budget period, but within the three-year project period, will
be entertained in subsequent years on a non-competitive basis, subject to the availability of funds, satisfactory
progress of the grantee and determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the Government.

F. Grantee Share of Project 


Grantees must provide at least twenty (20) percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost
of the project is the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind
contributions, although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions.

The non-Federal share may include funds distributed to a tribe, including interest, by the Federal government: 
 Pursuant to the satisfaction of a claim made under Federal law; 
 From funds collected and administered on behalf of such tribe or its constituent members; or 
 For general tribal administration or tribal development under a formula or subject to a tribal budgeting priority
system, such as, but not limited to, funds involved in the settlement of land or other judgment claims, severance or
other royalty payments, or payments under the Indian Self-Determination Act (25 U.S.C. 450f et seq.) or tribal budget
priority system. 
Therefore, a project requesting $300,000 in ACF funds (based on an award of $100,000 per budget period), must include
a match of at least $75,000 (20% total project cost). An itemized budget detailing the applicant's non-Federal share,
and its source, must be included in an application. 
Applications submitted as a partnership arrangement with a school, college, or university, may use contributions
from the ``partner'' organization(s) to meet the non-Federal share, as appropriate. Applications originating
from American Samoa, Guam, Palau, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are covered under section 501(d)
of Public Law 95-134, as amended (48 U.S.C. 1469a) under which HHS waives any requirement for local matching
funds under $200,000 (including in-kind contributions). 


G. Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs 


This program is not covered by Executive Order 12372.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940325-2-00071 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940325-2-00039 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The following points should be taken into consideration by all applicants: 
 Incomplete applications and applications that do not otherwise conform to this announcement will not be accepted
for review. Applicants will be notified in writing of any such determination by ANA. 
 Complete applications that conform to all the requirements of this program announcement are subjected to
a competitive review and evaluation process. An independent review panel consisting of reviewers familiar with
Native American languages will evaluate each application against the published criteria in this announcement.
The results of this review will assist the Commissioner in making final funding decisions. 
 The Commissioner's decision will also take into account the comments of ANA staff, state and Federal agencies
having performance related information, and other interested parties. 
 As a matter of policy the Commissioner will make grant awards consistent with the stated purpose of this announcement
and all relevant statutory and regulatory requirements under 45 CFR parts 74 and 92 applicable to grants under this
announcement. 
 After the Commissioner has made decisions on all applications, unsuccessful applicants will be notified
in writing within approximately 120 days of the closing date. Successful applicants are notified through an official
Financial Assistance Award (FAA) document. The Administration for Native Americans staff cannot respond to requests
for funding decisions prior to the official notification to the applicants. The FAA will state the amount of Federal
funds awarded, the purpose of the grant, the terms and conditions of the grant award, the effective date of the award,
the project period, the budget period, and the amount of the non-Federal matching share requirement. 


I. Review Process and Criteria 


1. Initial Application Review 


Timely applications submitted under this announcement will undergo a pre-review to determine that: 
 The applicant is eligible in accordance with the Eligible Applicants Section of this announcement. 
 The application materials submitted are sufficient to allow the panel to undertake an in-depth evaluation
(All required materials and forms are listed in the Grant Application Checklist.) 


2. Determination of Ineligibility 


Applicants who are initially rejected from competitive evaluation because of ineligibility, may appeal an ANA decision
of applicant ineligibility. Likewise, applicants may also appeal an ANA decision that an applicant's proposed activities
are ineligible for funding consideration. Section 810(b) (42 U.S.C. 2991h) of the Native American Programs Act provides
for an appeals process when ANA determines that an organization or activities are ineligible for assistance. When
an applicant or the activities proposed by the applicant are rejected as ineligible, the applicant will be advised
of the appropriate appeal process. 


3. Competitive Review of Accepted Applications 


Applications which pass the pre-review will be evaluated and rated by an independent review panel on the basis of the
evaluation criteria. These criteria are used to evaluate the quality of a proposed project, and to determine the likelihood
of its success. A proposed project should reflect the purposes stated and described in the Introduction and Program
Purpose (Section A) of this announcement. The evaluation criteria are: 


(1) Current Status of Native American Language(s) Addressed and Description(s) of Existing Programs/Projects
(if any) Which Support the Language(s) Addressed. (10 Points) 


(a) The application fully describes the current status of the Native American language to be addressed; current status
is defined as data compiled within the previous thirty-six (36) months. The description of the current status minimally
includes the following information: (1) Number of speakers; (2) age of speakers; (3) gender of speakers; (4) level(s)
of fluency; (5) number of first language speakers (the Native language is the first language acquired); (6) number
of second language speakers (the Native language is the second language acquired); (7) where the language is used
(specific uses such as: home, court system, religious ceremonies, church, multimedia, school, governance activities
and other, as appropriate to applicant) (8) source of data; (formal and/or informal) and (9) rate of language loss
or gain. The application has clearly delineated the current status of the Native American language to be addressed
by the project.

(e.g., a community consensus of the language status based on elders, tribal scholars, and/or other community members).
The description should address the following: (1) Has applicant had a community language or language training program
within the last thirty-six (36) months? (2) Has applicant had a community language or language training program within
the last ten (10) years? Applicants that answer ``no'' to either question (1) or (2) should provide a detailed explanation
of what barriers or circumstances prevented the establishment or implementation of a community language program.
Applicants that answer ``yes'' to either questions (1) or (2) should describe recent language program, including:
(1) program goal(s); (2) number of program participants; (3) number of speakers; (4) age range of participants (e.g.,
0-5; 6-10; 11-18;, etc.); (5) number of language teachers; (6) criteria used to acknowledge competency
of language teachers; (7) resources available to applicant (e.g., valid grammars, dictionaries, and/or orthographics.
If there are other suitable resources, please describe); and (8) other outcomes. 


(2) Long-Range Goals and Available Resources (25 Points) 


(a) The application explains how specific Native American(s) long range community goals relate to the project. Goals
are described within the context of the applicant's current language status. The strategies described will assist
in assuring the survival and continued vitality of the Native American language(s) addressed. 
(b) The application explains how the community and existing tribal government (where one exists) intends to achieve
these goals. It clearly documents the involvement and support of the community members and languages Elders in the
planning process and implementation of the proposed project as appropriate (e.g., tribal resolutions, minutes
of Community meetings, etc.). 
(c) Available resources (other than ANA and the non-Federal share) which will assist, and be coordinated with the
project, including language Elders, and other community resources, are described. These resources may be human,
physical, or financial and may include other Federal and non-Federal resources. Reasonable assurances of commitment
are provided. If the applicant proposes to enter into a partnership arrangement with a school, college, or university,
documentation of this commitment must be included in the application. 


(3) Project Objectives, Approach and Activities (25 Points) 


The application proposes specific project objective work plans with activities related to the goal to ensure the
survival and continuing vitality of the Native American language(s). The objective work plan(s) in the application
include(s) project objectives and activities related to the long term goals for each budget period proposed which:

 Clearly indicate Tribal Government, as appropriate, and community's active involvement demonstrating
continuing participation of Native American speakers; 
 Are measurable and/or quantifiable in terms of results and outcomes; 
 Clearly relate to the community's long-range language goals which the project addresses;

the project period. 


(4) Evaluation Plan (15 Points) 


The proposed objectives will result in specific, measurable outcomes to be achieved that will clearly contribute
to the completion of the overall project and will help the applicant meet its goal to ensure the survival and continuing
vitality of the Native American language(s) 
addressed. A detailed evaluation plan is provided to measure project outcomes, including, but not limited to, a demonstration
of effective language growth (e.g., increase of ``language use''). 


(5) Replication Plan and Product Preservation Plan (10 Points) 


(a) Identify opportunities for the replication of the project or the modification of the project for use by other Native
Americans, if appropriate. If replication is not appropriate, applicant must provide reasons why replication is
inappropriate.

of cost allowability and the relevance of these costs to the proposed project. The funds requested are appropriate
and necessary for the scope of the project. 


J. Guidance to Applicants 


The following is provided to assist applicants to develop a competitive application. 


1. Program Guidance 


 The Administration for Native Americans will fund projects that present the strongest prospects for meeting
the stated purposes of this program announcement. Projects will not be funded on the basis of need alone. 
 In discussing the problems being addressed in the application, relevant historical data should be included
so that the appropriateness and potential benefits of the proposed project will be better understood by the reviewers
and decision-maker. 
 Supporting documentation, if available, should be included to provide the reviewers and decision-maker
with other relevant data to better understand the scope and magnitude of the project. 
 The applicant should provide documentation showing support for the proposed project from authorized officials,
board of directors and/or officers through a letter of support or resolution. It would be helpful, particularly for
organizations, to delineate the membership, make-up of the board of directors, and its elective procedures to assist
reviewers in determining authorized support. 
 Language preservation is defined as the maintenance of a language so that it will not decline to non-use. 

 Language vitality is defined as the active use of a language in a wide range of domains of human life. 
 Language replication is defined as the application of a language program model developed in one community
to other linguistically similar communities. 
 Language survival is defined as the maintenance and continuation of language from one generation to another
in a wide range of aspects of community life. 


2. Technical Guidance 


 Applicants are strongly encouraged to have someone other than the author apply the evaluation criteria in
the program announcement and to score the application prior to its submission, in order to gain a better sense of its
quality and potential competitiveness in the review process. 
 ANA will accept only one application under this program announcement from any one applicant. If an eligible
applicant sends two applications, the one with the earlier postmark will be accepted for review unless the applicant
withdraws the earlier application. 
 An application from an Indian tribe, Alaska Native Village or other eligible organization must be submitted
by the governing body of the applicant. 
 The application's Form 424 must be signed by the applicant's representative (tribal official or designate)
who can act with full authority on behalf of the applicant.

<DOCTITLE>Meeting of Panel/Request for Public Comment</DOCTITLE>




The third meeting of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Human Embryo Research Panel will be held April 11-12
at the Holiday Inn Bethesda, 8120 Wisconsin Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland. The meeting will begin each day at 8:30 a.m.
and end at 7 p.m. on April 11 and at 12:30 p.m. on April 12. The Panel is a group of special consultants to the Advisory Committee
to the Director (ACD), NIH, established to recommend guidelines for Federal funding of research involving the 

ex utero

 human embryo resulting from 

in vitro 

fertilization or other sources.

The NIH received a number of applications for support in this area and in the related field of parthenogenesis. However,
before proceeding with the consideration of specific human embryo research proposals for funding the NIH must address
the profound moral and ethical issues raised by the use of human embryo in research and develop guidelines to govern
the review and conduct of Federally-funded research. The Panel's charge is to consider various areas of research
involving the 

ex utero 

human embryo and provide advice as to those areas it views to be acceptable for Federal funding, areas that warrant
additional review, and areas that are unacceptable for Federal support. For those areas of research considered acceptable
for Federal funding, the Panel will recommend specific guidelines for the review and conduct of this research. Issues
related to human germ-line gene modification are not within the Panel's purview. The Panel's final report will be
presented to the ACD for review.


During part of its first and second meeting, the Panel reviewed the wide range of scientific and human health benefits
that could result from governmental support of research involving the human embryo. At the third meeting, Panel deliberations
will focus on the following issues:


The competing ethical frameworks with respect to the moral status of the human embryo. The acceptability of human
embryo research from the point of gastrulation (the beginning of the process that culminates in the formation of the
primitive streak). Issues raised by research on human embryo that will not be transferred. 


Ethically acceptable sources of human embryo or eggs, informed consent requirements, issues raised by compensation
of sperm/egg providers, and concerns regarding commercialization.


The need for additional mechanisms for the review, evaluation, and monitoring of human embryo research at local and/or
national levels.


The NIH continues to seek public comment on these and other issues raised by Federal funding of human embryo research
and encourages interested individuals and organizations to share with the Panel their views and perspectives on
these important matters. Those who wish to submit written comments of any length should forward these to Steven Muller,
Ph.D., Chair, NIH Human Embryo Research Panel, 


c/o National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Building 

#

1, room 218, Bethesda, Maryland 20892. To ensure that public input is available to the Panel during its deliberations,
written comments should be received in advance of the Panel's fourth scheduled meeting, May 4, 1994.



As with previous meetings of the Panel, an opportunity is also being provided at the April meeting for interested individuals
and organizations to make brief oral presentations to the Panel. To register to make an oral statement before the Panel,
individuals and organizations should contact Ms. Peggy Schnoor at the NIH by telephoning 301-496-1454
or by sending a facsimile message to 301-402-0280 or 301-402-1759. Oral statements must not
exceed five minutes in length, and a copy of the remarks should be forwarded to the above address one week in advance
of the scheduled presentation date. Opportunities to present statements will be determined by the order in which
requests are received.

The NIH will endeavor to provide seating for all members of the public who wish to attend the meetings. Individuals
are, however, asked to notify the NIH of their interest in attending by using the telephone or facsimile numbers listed
above. Individuals who require special accommodations are also asked to contact Ms. Schnoor at the above number.
General questions about the Panel or future meetings should also be directed to Ms. Schnoor.

2. Definitions of Terms 



For purposes of this Program Announcement the following definitions apply: 



``Training''

 is an educational activity or event which is designed to impart knowledge, understanding, or increase the development
of skills. Such training activities may be in the form of assembled events such as workshops, seminars, or programs
of self-instructional activities. 



``Technical assistance''

 is a problem-solving event generally utilizing the services of an expert. Such services may be provided on-site,
by telephone, or other communications. These services address specific problems and are intended to assist with
the immediate resolution of a given problem or set of problems. 



``State''

 means all of the States and the District of Columbia. Except where specifically noted, for purposes of this Program
Announcement it also means ``Territory.'' 



``Territory''

 refers to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the American Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau. 



``Local service providers''

 are the approximately 1,000 local public or private nonprofit agencies that receive Community Services Block Grant
funds from States to provide services to, or undertake activities on behalf of, low-income people. 



``Nationwide''

 refers to the scope of the technical assistance training on data collection projects to be undertaken with grant funds.
Proposed projects must provide for the implementation of technical assistance, training or data collection for
a significant number of States, and the local service providers who administer CSBG funds. 



Part B_Purpose 



Section 681(a)(3) of the CSBG Act authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to make grants
to States and public agencies and private nonprofit organizations, or to enter into contracts or jointly financed
cooperative arrangements with States and public agencies and private nonprofit organizations, to provide for training
and technical assistance to aid States in carrying out their responsibilities for conducting and administering
the CSBG Program. 

OCS is soliciting applications which implement these legislative mandates 

on a national basis

 and in a 

comprehensive manner.

 OCS believes that training and technical assistance needs are best identified at the State and local levels, not at
the Federal level. Therefore, funds will be provided in the form of grants. Proposed projects under this Program Announcement
must focus on one of the following program priorities: 



Priority 1_

Training and Technical Assistance: The development and implementation of a comprehensive, nationwide training
and/or technical assistance program to assist State staff and/or staff of local service providers which receive
funding under the CSBG Act, to acquire the skills and knowledge needed to administer and implement programs designed
to ameliorate the causes of poverty in the communities. Programs must include the provision of training and/or technical
assistance to State staff and/or staff of local service providers nationwide, i.e., in each of the Federal Regions,
in the most cost effective manner possible. Collaboration with State CSBG coordinators and local service providers
will be required in identifying the training and technical assistance needs of staff of local service providers.




Priority 2_

Data Collection: The design of a survey instrument, and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information
on FY 1993 CSBG Programs on a nationwide basis through a process that relies on voluntary State cooperation. The information
must be comprehensive enough and disseminated in such formats as to enable States and local service providers to improve
their planning, management, and delivery of services and to assure that the general public has a clear understanding
of those programs and their outcomes.

<TEXT>
 

Submissions which propose the use of grant funds for the development of any printed or visual materials must contain
convincing evidence that these materials are not available from other sources. OCS will not provide funding for such
items if justification is not sufficient. Approval of the development of films or visual presentations proposed
by applicants approved for funding will made part of the grant ward. 

See Part F, Section 4, for special instructions on developing a work program. 



Part C_Application Prerequisites 



1. Eligible Applicants 



Eligible applicants for Priority 1 are States, public agencies and private non-profit organizations that can demonstrate
familiarity and expertise nationwide with the training and/or technical assistance needs of community action agencies
or State CSBG administering agencies; and, for Priority 2, States, public agencies and private non-profit organizations
that can demonstrate their familiarity with the CSBG Program and their ability to collect data from States on a voluntary
basis. In order to be considered for funding, proof of non-profit status must be submitted with the application. Any
of the following is acceptable evidence: (1) Copy of the applicant organization's listing in the Internal Revenue
Service's (IRS) most recent list of tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c)(3) of the IRS Code; or (2)
a copy of the current valid IRS tax exemption certificate. 



2. Available Funds 



The amount of funds available for grant awards under this announcement in FY 94 is $271,439; $171,439 are available
for training and technical assistance activities and $100,000 for data collection activities. It is anticipated
that two grants will be made for T&TA activities and one grant will be made for data collection activities. 



3. Grant Duration 



OCS will grant funds for a maximum of 12-month project and budget periods. The application must clearly demonstrate
that the project work plan will achieve measurable results and can be successfully completed within the stated time
period. 



4. Project Beneficiaries 



Projects proposed for funding under the training and technical assistance priority area must result in direct benefits
to staffs of State or local service providers in carrying out their responsibilities under the Community Services
Block Grant Act. 



5. Sub-Contracting or Delegating Projects 



OCS will not fund any project where the role of the applicant is primarily to serve as a conduit for funds to organizations
other than the applicant. This prohibition does not bar the making of subgrants or subcontracting for specific services
or activities needed to conduct the project. However, the applicant must have a substantive role in the implementation
of the project for which funding is requested. 



Part D_Application Procedures 



1. Availability of Forms 



Attachments A, B and C contain all of the standard forms necessary for the application for awards under these OCS programs.
These forms may be photocopied for use in developing the application.

2. Application Submission 



Refer to the section entitled ``Closing Date'' at the beginning of this Program Announcement for the last day on which
applications 
should be submitted. Applications may be mailed to: 
Administration for Children and Families, 
Division of Discretionary Grants, 
6th Floor OFM/DDG, OCS-94-04, 
370 L'Enfant Promenade SW., 
Washington, DC 20447. 

Hand-delivered applications are accepted during normal working hours of 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday,
except legal holidays, on or prior to the established closing date at: 
Administration for Children and Families, Division of Discretionary Grants, OCS-94-04, 
Sixth Floor, 901 D Street SW., 
Washington, DC 20447. 

An application shall be considered as meeting the announced deadline if it is either: 

1. Received on or before the deadline date at a place specified in the Program Announcement, or 

2. Sent on or before the deadline date and received by the granting agency in time for them to be considered during the
competitive review and evaluation process. (Applicants are cautioned to request a legibly dated U.S. Postal Service
postmark or to obtain a legibly dated receipt from a commercial carrier or the U.S. Postal Service. Private 
metered postmarks are not acceptable as proof of timely mailing.) 

Applications which do not meet one of these criteria are considered late applications. The ACF Division of Discretionary
Grants will notify each late applicant that its application will not be considered in this competition. 

The ACF may extend the deadline for all applicants because of acts of God such as floods, hurricanes, etc. or when there
is a disruption of the mails. However, if the ACF does not extend the deadline for all applicants, it may not waive or
extend the deadline for any applicant. 

Applications once submitted are considered final and no additional materials will be accepted. 

One signed original application and two copies should be submitted. 



3. Intergovernmental Review 



This program is covered under Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs'' and 45 CFR
Part 100, ``Intergovernmental Review of Department of Health and Human Services Programs and Activities.'' Under
the Order, States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance under
covered programs. 

All States and Territories except Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa and Palau have elected
to participate in the Executive Order process and have established Single Points of Contact (SPOCs). Applicants
from these seventeen jurisdictions need take no action regarding E.O. 12372. 

Applicants for projects to be administered by Federally-recognized Indian Tribes are also exempt from the requirements
of E.O. 12372. Otherwise, applicants should contact their SPOCs as soon as possible to alert them of the prospective
applications and receive any necessary instructions, so that the program office can obtain and review SPOC comments
as part of the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all required materials, if any, to the SPOC
and indicate the date of this submittal (or the date of contact if no submittal is required) on the Standard Form 424A,
item 16a. 

Under 45 CFR 100.8(a)(2), a SPOC has 60 days from the application deadline date to comment on proposed new awards. These
comments are reviewed as a part of the award process. Failure to notify the SPOC can result in a delay in grant award.


SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements as official recommendations. Additionally,
SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between mere advisory comments and those official State process recommendations
which they intend to trigger the ``accommodate or explain'' rule under 45 CFR 100.10.

When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to: Department of Health and Human Services,
Administration for Children and Families, Division of Discretionary Grants, OCS-94-04, 6th Floor,
370 L'Enfant Promenade SW., Washington, DC 20447. 
A list of the Single Points of Contact for each State and Territory is included as Appendix G of this announcement. 



4. Application Consideration 



Applications which meet the screening requirements in Sections 5a and 5b below will be reviewed competitively. Such
applications 
will be referred to reviewers for a numerical score and explanatory comments based solely on responsiveness to program
guidelines and evaluation criteria published in this announcement. 

Applications will be reviewed by persons outside of the OCS unit which would be directly responsible for programmatic
management of the grant. The results of these reviews will assist OCS in considering competing applications. Reviewers'
scores will weigh heavily in funding decisions but will not be the only factors considered. Applications will be ranked
and generally considered in order of the average scores assigned by reviewers. However, highly ranked applications
are not guaranteed funding since the other factors deemed relevant may be considered including, but not limited to,
the timely and proper completion of projects funded with OCS funds granted in the past 5 years; comments of reviewers
and government officials; staff evaluation and input; geographic distribution; previous program performance
of applicants; compliance with grant terms under previous DHHS 
grants; audit reports; investigative reports; and applicant's progress in resolving any final audit disallowances
on OCS or other Federal agency grants. 

OCS reserves the right to discuss applications with other Federal 
or non-Federal funding sources to ascertain the applicant's performance record. 



5. Criteria for Screening Applications 



a. 

Initial screening. 

All applicants will receive an acknowledgement with an assigned identification number. This number, along with
any other identifying codes, must be referenced in all subsequent communications concerning the application. If
an acknowledgement is not received within three weeks after the deadline date, please notify ACF by telephone at (202)
401-9230. All applications that meet the published deadline for submission will be screened to determine completeness
and conformity to the requirements of this announcement. Only those applications meeting the following requirements
will be reviewed and evaluated competitively. Others will be returned to the applicants with a notation that they
were unacceptable.

(1) The application must contain a Standard Form 424 ``Application for Federal Assistance'' (SF-424), a budget

c. 

Evaluation criteria. 

Applications which pass the pre-rating review will be assessed and scored by reviewers. Each reviewer will give a
numerical score for each application reviewed. These numerical scores will be supported by explanatory statements
on a formal rating form describing major strengths and major weaknesses under each applicable criterion published
in this announcement. The in-depth evaluation and review process will use the following criteria coupled with the
specific requirements contained in Part B. (Note: The following review criteria reiterate collection of information

Instructions for the SF-424A


General Instructions


This form is designed so that application can be made for funds from one or more grant programs. In preparing the budget,
adhere to any existing Federal grantor agency guidelines which prescribe how and whether budgeted amounts should
be separately shown for different functions or activities within the program. For some programs, grantor agencies
may require budgets to be separately shown by function or activity. For other programs, grantor agencies may require
a breakdown by function or activity. Sections A, B, C, and D should include budget estimates for the whole project except
when applying for assistance which requires Federal authorization in annual or other funding period increments.
In the latter case, Sections A, B, C, and D should provide the budget for the first budget period (usually a year) and
Section E should present the need for Federal assistance in the subsequent budget periods. All applications should
contain a breakdown by the object class categories shown in Lines a-k of Section B.


Section A. Budget Summary, Lines 1-4, Columns (a) and (b)


For applications pertaining to a 

single

 Federal grant program (Federal Domestic Assistance Catalog number) and 

not requiring 

a functional or activity breakdown, enter on Line 1 under Column (a) the catalog program title and the catalog number
in Column (b).
For applications pertaining to a 

single

 program 

requiring

 budget amounts by multiple functions or activities, enter the name of each activity or function on each line in Column
(a), and enter the catalog number in Column (b). For applications pertaining to multiple programs where none of the
programs require a breakdown by function or activity, enter the catalog program title on each line in 

Column

 (a) and the respective catalog number on each line in Column (b).
For applications pertaining to 

multiple

 programs where one or more programs

<DOCTITLE>Finding Regarding Foreign Social Insurance or Pension System_Uruguay </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Social Security Administration, HHS. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of finding regarding Foreign Social Insurance or Pension System_Uruguay. 




FINDING: 

Section 202(t)(1) of the Social Security Act 
(42 U.S.C. 402(t)(1)) prohibits payment of monthly benefits to any individual who is not a United States citizen or
national for any month after he or she has been outside the United States for 6 consecutive months. This prohibition
does not apply to such an individual where one of the exceptions described in section 202(t)(2) through 202(t)(5)
of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402(t)(2) through 402(t)(5)) affects his or her case. 


Section 202(t)(2) of the Social Security Act provides that, subject to certain residency requirements of section
202(t)(11), the prohibition against payment shall not apply to any individual who is a citizen of a country which the
Secretary of Health and Human Services finds has in effect a social insurance or pension system which is of general
application in such country and which: 

(A) Pays periodic benefits, or the actuarial equivalent thereof, on account of old age, retirement, or death; and

(B) Permits individuals who are United States citizens but not citizens of that country and who qualify for such benefits
to receive those benefits, or the actuarial equivalent thereof, while outside the foreign country regardless of
the duration of the absence. 
The Secretary of Health and Human Services has delegated the authority to make such a finding to the Commissioner of
Social Security. The Commissioner has redelegated that authority to the Director of the Office of International
Policy. Under that authority the Director of the Office of International Policy has approved a finding that Uruguay,
beginning July 2, 1993, has a social insurance system of general application which: 

(A) Pays periodic benefits, or the actuarial equivalent thereof, on account of old age, retirement, or death; and

(B) Permits United States citizens who are not citizens of Uruguay to receive such benefits, or their actuarial equivalent,
at the full rate without qualification or restriction while outside Uruguay. 
Accordingly, it is hereby determined and found that Uruguay has in effect, beginning July 2, 1993, a social insurance
system which meets the requirements of section 202(t)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402(t)(2)). 
This revises our previous finding, published at 33 FR 
15679 on October 23, 1968, that Uruguay has in effect a social insurance system which is of general application in that
country and which meets the requirements of section 202 (t)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402(t)(2)(A)),
but not the requirements of section 202(t)(2)(B) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 402(t)(2)(B)).

action: 

Notice of Availability of a final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the proposed mineral withdrawal at Desert
National Wildlife Range, Clark and Lincoln Counties, Nevada.




</ACTION>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

The Service proposes to withdraw approximately 770,000 acres of the Desert National Wildlife Range (Range) from
entry from locatable minerals for a period of 20 years. The purpose of the proposed withdrawal is to protect the biological
and cultural resources of the Range and prevent uses that would be incompatible with the purposes of the Range. The
Range was originally established for the protection, enhancement, and maintenance of wildlife, especially the
desert bighorn sheep. Other approved purposes of the Range include conservation of biological diversity with emphasis
on endangered and threatened species and protection and maintenance of cultural resources.



This EIS provides an assessment of the affects of alternative proposals for withdrawal or exploration and development
of minerals on the Range: (A) Wildlife Range Withdrawal, (B) No Action, and (C) Limited Entry. The agencies' preferred
alternative is (A) Wildlife Range Withdrawal. A Record of Decision will be issued not sooner than 30-days following
the date of this notice.

<DOCTITLE>Clean Vessel Act Education/Information Scoping Meeting</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of meeting.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) is announcing a scoping meeting to determine the need for developing an education/information
program for the Clean Vessel Act at the national level. Funds are currently provided to States to develop education/information
programs, but the extent of overlap in developing products is not known since no overview is provided at the national
level. The meeting is to determine (1) education/information needs, (2) the extent of education/information currently
provided, (3) the role, if any, of the Service is providing education/information, and (4) priorities for accomplishing
education/information at the national level.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

One of the purposes of the Clean Vessel Act is to provide grant funds to States to educate boaters: (1) On where pumpouts
and dump stations are located so they can dispose of recreational boat sewage in an environmentally sound manner,
and (2) on the environmental benefits of using pumpouts and dump stations. Currently, Federal, State, local and marine
industry groups provide education/information to various audiences in boating, either through the Clean Vessel
Act or through other programs. However, there is no comprehensive approach to this education/information dissemination.
The extent of the education/information currently provided is not known, but indications are that education/information
is not provided to the different audiences uniformly. Some audiences are not targeted in some States, some information
is not provided in some States, and some States have not submitted education proposals under the Clean Vessel Act.
To provide for the most successful education program, all appropriate audiences should be targeted. Also, information
exchange may result in a more efficient and less costly program. Lastly, the program may benefit from generic educational
materials produced at the national level. The result would be that more pumpout and dump stations could be constructed
to better attain the goal of the Clean Vessel Act to increase water quality.



The purposes and agenda of the scoping meeting, therefore, are: (1) To determine the extend of education/information,
methods and target audiences needed, (2) to establish the extent of education/information, methods and target audiences
currently provided that is applicable to the success of the Clean Vessel Act, (3) to assess what portion of the education/information
program, if any, is most appropriately done at the national level and, (4) to prioritize the national needs, if any,
so that the most important education/information tasks can be accomplished first.

This will be a participatory meeting, with attendees requested to provide input as to education/information, methods
and target audience needs, and what products they are currently contributing to the pumpout/dump station education
program. Sample products are welcome.

<DOCTITLE>Wild Bird Conservation Act (WBCA) of 1992; Decision Concerning Petition for Suspension of Imports of African Grey
Parrots to the United States </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of a final decision on a petition. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) received a petition from the Environmental Investigation Agency to
suspend the import of African grey parrots from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Togo, and Benin to the United States under the
Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 (WBCA). The Service has reached a final decision on the petition and determines
that sufficient information exists to suspend the importation of African grey parrots (

Psittacus erithacus

 and all subspecies) from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Togo, Benin, and Guinea. Information the Service has gathered, including
the petition, supports the suspension of the import of African grey parrots under the WBCA, in the interest of conservation
of the species. However, because a statutorily mandated moratorium on importation of this species became effective
on October 23, 1993, except as allowed pursuant to regulations which the Service has promulgated, no additional prohibition
on importation of this species is necessary. The Service notes however that it is required under the WBCA to issue and
publish notice of the final decision reached on this petition. The Service will take into account its decision on this
petition in reviewing any future applications for the importation of African grey parrots from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire,
Togo, Benin, and Guinea to the United States under the WBCA. 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 23, 1992, the Wild Bird Conservation Act (WBCA) of 1992 (16 U.S.C. 4901-4916) was signed into law.
The purposes of the WBCA include promoting the conservation of exotic birds by: ensuring that all imports into the
United States of species of exotic birds are biologically sustainable and not detrimental to the species; ensuring
that imported birds are not subject to inhumane treatment; and assisting wild bird conservation and management programs
in countries of origin. 



Pursuant to Section 105(b) of the WBCA (16 U.S.C. 4904), ``Emergency Authority to Suspend Imports of Listed Species,''
the WBCA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to suspend the importation of exotic birds of any species that is
listed in any Appendix to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES,
or Convention), if the Secretary determines that: 

(A)(i) Trade in that species is detrimental to the species, 

(ii) There is not sufficient information available on which to base a judgment that the species is not detrimentally
affected by trade in that species, or

<TEXT>
 

(iii) Remedial measures have been recommended by the Standing Committee of the Convention that have not been implemented;
and 

(B) The suspension might be necessary for the conservation of the species.'' 

This final decision is based on various documents, including published and unpublished studies. Documents on which
this final decision is based are on file in the Service's Office of Management Authority, and are available on request.


On February 22, 1993, the Service received a letter from G. A. Punguse, Chief Game and Wildlife Officer for Ghana, requesting
that the United States stop African grey parrot shipments from Togo to the United States and stating that no African
grey parrot populations are found in Togo and that all of the birds exported from Togo are actually smuggled from Ghana.


On April 12, 1993, the Environmental Investigation Agency submitted a petition to the Service requesting the Secretary
to suspend imports of African grey parrots from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Togo, and Benin to the United States. 

On April 15, 1993, the Service received a letter from the CITES Secretariat in Switzerland noting that a CITES report
(Dandliker, 1992) on the African grey parrot in Ghana indicates that the majority of the specimens that are exported
from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire are in reality smuggled into C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire from Ghana and other countries. The letter
further noted that the Secretariat had corresponded with the Government of C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, expressed its concerns
that large number of birds may have been smuggled from Ghana, and recommended that C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire stop exports
of African grey parrots until populations could be surveyed. 

At the eighth meeting of the CITES Conference of the Parties in Kyoto, Japan, Resolution Conf. 8.9 was adopted. The
Resolution, entitled ``The Trade in Wild-Caught Animal Specimens,'' established a process whereby the CITES Animals
Committee would communicate primary and secondary recommendations to CITES Parties regarding species that had
been identified as high-priority species. The African grey parrot is such a species. The resolution established
a process whereby the CITES Secretariat would assess whether a Party had implemented specific recommendations;
any failure to so demonstrate would be brought to the attention of the CITES Standing Committee. The Secretariat sent
recommendations from the Animals Committee to several CITES Parties in June 1992; those that did not reply were sent
reminders in October 1992 and January 1993. Based on the report of the Secretariat to the March 1993 meeting of the CITES
Standing Committee in Washington, DC, the Standing Committee unanimously recommended to all Parties that imports
be suspended for a number of species, including the African grey parrot from Guinea. 

On April 20, 1993, the CITES Secretariat issued Notification to the Parties No. 737, which notified the Parties of
the Standing Committee's recommendation to suspend imports of 

Psittacus erithacus 

from Guinea. 

On May 7, 1993, the CITES Secretariat issued Notification to the Parties No. 746, which ``strongly recommended''
that Parties ``not accept any comparable documentation from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire for trade in specimens of African
grey parrots (

P. erithacus

), including the subspecies 

P. e. erithacus 

and 

P. e. timneh.

'' This recommendation remains in effect until the CITES Secretariat is satisfied that the government of C&ocirc;te
d'Ivoire has ``completed surveys on its wild populations of African grey parrots and based on those surveys, establishes
a management plan for sustainable international trade; and has taken appropriate measures to prevent the illegal
import of grey parrots from other countries, and to ensure that shipments of grey parrots that are exported from C&ocirc;te
d'Ivoire do not include birds that have been imported illegally.'' The Notification notes that a CITES report on the
grey parrot in Ghana indicates that the majority of 

P. erithacus

 exported from C&ocirc;te D'Ivoire are birds that are smuggled from Ghana and other countries. 

On August 25, 1993, the Service published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 44847) of receipt of the petition to suspend the import of African grey parrots from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Togo,
and Benin to the United States under the Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 (WBCA). That notice proposed suspension
of imports of African grey parrots from those countries and Guinea, and invited public comments. 

On October 23, 1993, the importation of African grey parrots as well as all other CITES-listed bird species (with some
exceptions) are prohibited, as provided by the WBCA, except as allowed pursuant to regulations which the Service
has promulgated under the WBCA (see 58 FR 60524). The Service notes however that it is required under the WBCA to issue
and publish in the 

Federal Register

 a final action on the petition, by not later than 90 days after the end of the period for public comment. Since the statutorily
mandated moratorium makes such a final action moot, and any action to suspend imports of African grey parrots from
C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Togo, and Benin to the United States would now be unnecessary, the Service instead hereby publishes
its findings and decision, and a summary of public comments received on the petition.

The African grey parrot (

Psittacus erithacus

) is a medium-sized parrot endemic to Africa. It is distributed in Central Africa from the Gulf of Guinea Islands and
the west coast east to western Kenya and northwestern Tanzania; it possibly ranges to Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania
(Forshaw, 1989). They are primarily birds of lowland forests. 


There are three subspecies recognized: 

Psittacus e. erithacus, P. e. princeps, 

and 

P. e. timneh 

(Forshaw, 1989; Howard and Moore, 1991). The nominate subspecies, 

P. e. erithacus,

 is widespread in equatorial Africa. It ranges from southeastern C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire to western Kenya and south to
northern Angola, southern regions of Zaire and to northwestern Tanzania. 

P. e. princeps,

 which some authorities believe cannot be distinguished from the nominate subspecies, is restricted to the islands
of Principe and Bioko in the Gulf of Guinea; while 

P. e. timneh

 is confined to southern Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and the westernmost parts of C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire. 



The nominate subspecies, 

P. e. erithacus

 (``Redtail''), can be distinguished from 

P. e. timneh

 (``Maroontail'') by morphological characteristics. ``Red-tailed African grey parrots'' have an all-black bill
and a bright red tail, whereas ``Maroon-tailed African grey parrots'' have a pale upper bill, a much darker maroon-red
(often with a lot of dark-brown) tail, their general body color is darker, and on average, they are about 15% smaller
in size than Red-tailed African grey parrots (Dandliker, 1992). Within the Red-tailed African grey parrots (

P. e. erithacus

), there exists a gradient in body size between western and eastern populations (Dandliker, 1992). Traders distinguish
between the ``Ghanaian Redtails'' and the ``Congo or Cameroonian Redtails.'' ``Congo Red-tailed African grey parrots''
are larger and heavier than those from the western parts of the range.
Although African grey parrots have long been popular in the pet bird trade, very little scientific data on the status,
population sizes, and demography of wild populations exists. The trade in this species has long been an issue of concern.
Between 1983 and 1989, 346,782 African grey parrots were exported from 20 African countries, including two (S&eacute;n&eacute;gal
and Togo) which are not believed to be range states (Environmental Investigation Agency 1993). In 1991, 10,651 

Psittacus erithacus

 and 3,976 

P. e. timneh

 were imported into the United States. As of September 19, 1993, 7,821 

Psittacus erithacus

 and 2,158 

P. e. timneh

 had been imported into the United States since enactment of the WBCA, under the quota established by the WBCA and published
in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 19840). 



A CITES Report (Dandliker, 1992) estimated the total population of Red-tailed African grey parrots (

P. e. erithacus

) in West Africa to be between 40,000 and 100,000 birds. The largest population of Red-tailed African grey parrots
occurs in Ghana, where the population is estimated to be between 30,000 and 80,000 birds (75%-80% of the total
West African population) (Dandliker, 1992). 



Since 1980, Ghana has prohibited the export of its African grey parrots. This ban was found to be necessary by the Ghana
Department of Game and Wildlife ``because of the large number of birds exported annually without scientific information
to determine a sustainable off-take which would ensure the survival of the species in the wild'' (Letter from G. Punguse,
1993). The recent CITES Secretariat-sponsored survey of African grey parrots in Ghana (Dandliker, 1992) concluded
that the majority of the wild populations of Red-tailed African grey parrots are found in Ghana, with a few populations
along the C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire eastern boundary with Ghana and none in Togo. The CITES report (Dandliker, 1992) found
that the majority of African grey parrots (

P. e. erithacus

) exported from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire are, in reality, birds that are smuggled into C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire from Ghana,
and 

all

 the African grey parrots exported from Togo come from Ghana. 



The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA, 1993) studied the illegal trade in African grey parrots from Ghana,
at the request of the Ghanaian Government. Statements made by traders to EIA appear to substantiate the findings of
the CITES Report concerning the illegal trade in African grey parrots from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire. Statements made
by traders to EIA also point to illegal trade in African grey parrots from Benin, which originated in Ghana. 
After a review of the petition by the Environmental Investigation Agency, the aforementioned Notifications from
the CITES Secretariat, the CITES Report (Dandliker, 1992), and information available from a recent law enforcement
investigation, the Service concludes there was substantial scientific and commercial information that the suspension
of imports of African grey parrots from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Togo, and Guinea, is warranted under the WBCA, and would
have been imposed, had the statutorily mandated moratorium not been in effect. Information related to imports of
African grey parrots from Benin was more limited but sufficient. In the 

Federal Register

 notice of August 25, 1993, the Service requested information from the public on exports or re-exports of African grey
parrots from Benin. No such information was submitted. There is no information available on which to base a judgment
that African grey parrot exports from Benin are not detrimental to the species. Information available to the Service
indicated that in Ghana, although the African grey parrot is protected from export, it has been depleted by the ``laundering''
of smuggled birds through exports of the species from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Togo, and possibly Benin. 



Pursuant to section 105(b) of the WBCA (16 U.S.C. 4904), the Service finds that a suspension in the trade of African
grey parrots from Ghana, C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Togo, Guinea, and Benin is necessary for the conservation of the species.
The Service concludes that the trade in African grey parrots from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Togo, and Guinea is detrimental
to the survival of the species in Ghana. The Service finds that there is not sufficient information available on which
to base a judgment that the species in C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Togo, Guinea, and Benin is not detrimentally affected
by trade. The Service finds that in the case of Guinea and C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, remedial measures recommended by the
Standing Committee of the Convention have not been implemented. The only reason the Service is not now imposing this
moratorium as proposed in its notice of August 25, 1993, is the fact that the moratorium is already in place, pursuant
to the WBCA and regulations in 50 CFR part 15.

Comments and Other Information Received 





Comments on the proposed decision on the petition were received from five interested persons and organizations.
Specifically, written comments were received from two individuals, one importer, one avicultural organization,
and one pet industry representative. 

No comments were received which provided the Service with additional scientific information on the status of African
grey parrots in C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Togo, Benin, or Guinea. In making this final decision the Service depended on
the information provided with the petition and, most importantly, the CITES Secretariat, including recent reports.
Since the notice of receipt of the petition and proposed action was published in the 

Federal Register

, a recent law enforcement investigation has further substantiated information contained in the CITES Secretariat-sponsored
survey of African grey parrots in Ghana, that African grey parrots are smuggled to C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire from other
African countries. 



Three commenters stated that they were concerned about the timing of the petition, in light of the statutorily mandated
moratorium that became effective on October 23, 1993. The Service agrees that the importation of African grey parrots
as well as all other CITES-listed bird species (with some exceptions) are prohibited, except as allowed pursuant
to regulations that the Service has promulgated under the WBCA (see 58 FR 60524). The Service notes however that it
is required under the WBCA to issue and publish in the 

Federal Register

 a final determination on the petition, by not later than 90 days after the end of the period for public comment. Therefore,
the Service is making a final decision on this petition; no further action is promulgated only because the statutorily
mandated moratorium makes any such action moot. 



One commenter believed that any blanket cessation of importation which might affect cooperative breeding programs
would be ill-advised and contradictory to the intent of the Wild Bird Conservation Act. The Service disagrees that
the cessation of importation of particular species from certain countries is contrary to the intent of the WBCA, if
it is in the interest of the conservation of the species. The WBCA allows the Secretary to establish, modify, or terminate
any prohibition, suspension, or quota on importation of any species of exotic bird where it is determined that the
trade in such species is detrimental to the species' survival in the wild. Furthermore, the suspension of imports
of a species from one or more countries does not impact on a person's ability to apply for approval of a cooperative breeding
program for that species. 



One commenter, although not necessarily in disagreement with the proposed action by the Service, questioned whether
the petition warranted the type of emergency relief sought in the petition in light of the tremendous pressure the
Service was under to promulgate regulations for the WBCA and staffing problems. The Service notes that the action
proposed in the notice of August 25, 1993, did not constitute emergency relief, but rather constituted compliance
with the petition review process outlined in the statute. The Service does appreciate the public's concern that promulgation
of regulations implementing the WBCA is a resource-intensive endeavor. 



One commenter questioned the appropriateness of relying upon petitions supported by incomplete documents. The
Service notes that its finding is based on various documents, including published and unpublished studies and law
enforcement investigations. The commenter noted that part of the petition submitted by the Environmental Investigation
Agency had some names blacked out. Those omissions were by the petitioner, and in no way affected the Service's findings.
The Service gathered documents during its review of the petition; these included the recent CITES Secretariat-sponsored
survey of African grey parrots in Ghana (Dandliker, 1992), CITES Notifications to the Parties, and information from
recent law enforcement investigations. 



One commenter supported the suspension of African grey parrots from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Togo, and Benin to the United
States, but asked that the Republic of Niger and other range States of African grey parrots be included. The commenter
had lived in Niger and frequently observed the parrot in its natural habitat in Niger. The commenter expressed concern
because Niger shares a border with Benin. Although the Service is concerned with the status of African grey parrots
throughout its range, the Service does not have scientific or law enforcement information available to it to assess
the status of African grey parrots in Niger to make the relevant findings. Furthermore, since Niger was not included
in the 

Federal Register

 notice of August 25, 1993 that called for public comments, the Service does not consider it appropriate to add it in
at this time. Should such information become available on Niger, or any other country, the Service will review it and
include it in its record of information on the African grey parrot. 



One commenter questioned the allegations of smuggling in the petition and the supporting information for such allegations.
The Service finds that there is sufficient supporting information to document smuggling activities involving African
grey parrots. The recent CITES Secretariat-sponsored survey of African grey parrots in Ghana (Dandliker, 1992)
showed that the majority of African grey parrots (

P. e. erithacus

) exported from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire are, in reality, birds that are smuggled into C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire from Ghana,
and it showed that all the African grey parrots exported from Togo likely come from Ghana. As an example of serious law
enforcement problems regarding the African grey parrot, a recent law enforcement investigation resulted in a California
bird importer pleading guilty to conspiring to smuggle African grey parrots into the United States. The importer
conspired to import approximately 1,478 ``Congo'' African grey parrots which had been illegally taken from their
wild habitat in Zaire, where the commercial trade in African grey parrots was banned. The parrots were smuggled from
Zaire to S&eacute;n&eacute;gal, where the exporters obtained false CITES export documents to accompany the shipments
to the United States. The CITES export documents falsely stated that the parrots originated in Guinea or C&ocirc;te
d'Ivoire, countries where the ``Congo'' African grey parrot does not occur.

One commenter disagreed with the proposed action, stating that the suspension was not warranted, and that African
grey parrots should be allowed to be imported into the United States from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Togo, and Benin. The
Service disagrees, based on the aforementioned discussion. At any rate, this suspension is now in effect independent
of this petition process. 

One commenter questioned if the suspension would affect the import of ``Timneh'' African grey parrots (

Psittacus e. timneh

) from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire. This ruling would have affected the importation of all subspecies of African grey parrots
from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, including 

Psittacus e. timneh. 

One commenter questioned if the suspension would have affected the import of captive-bred African grey parrots.
The statutorily imposed suspension on the import of all CITES-listed birds makes that question moot, as it includes
all African grey parrots. The Service will shortly propose regulations pursuant to Section 107 of the WBCA, which
will allow for approval of foreign facilities breeding exotic birds in captivity. If a foreign facility is approved
as a qualifying facility, species of exotic birds for which the facility is approved can be imported into the United
States from that facility. When those regulations are finalized, any foreign facility breeding an otherwise prohibited
species, including the African grey parrot, may apply to the Service for approval, based on the application and issuance
requirements of the relevant regulations. However, if imports from a given country are specifically prohibited,
based on a petition submitted pursuant to the WBCA, the Service would consider it very difficult for a facility in that
country to qualify as an approved breeding facility.

IV

Prohibited Conduct



(A) Defendant is prohibited from: (1) Conducting or facilitating any exchange or discussion by or between any health
care facility employees of information concerning;

(a) the current or prospective compensation paid to nurses, or

(b) the historic compensation paid to nurses unless a written log or audio or audio/visual recording of such exchange
or discussion is made; and

(2) communicating to, requesting from, or exchanging with any health care facility in Utah information concerning
the compensation paid to nurses, except nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the exchange or discussion of historic
compensation as provided in IV(A)(1).

(B) Nothing in this Final Judgment shall prohibit defendant from sponsoring, sanctioning, conducting, or publishing
a survey of information concerning the compensation paid to nurses under the following conditions:


(1) any requests for information and any dissemination of information in connection with the survey is in writing;

(2) the survey is designed, developed, conducted, or published without involvement by any representative, agent,
or employee of any health care facility in Utah, except that a representative, agent, or employee of any health care
facility may provide written data in response to a written request for information in connection with the survey;


(3) the survey includes only historic or current compensation information, and does not request or disseminate prospective
compensation information;

(4) the survey does not request actual pay rates when the only health care facilities that participated in the survey
operate in Utah; the survey may request average pay rates; 

(5) the survey only disseminates aggregate data, and either: (a) Each disseminated statistic is based on input from
at least ten (10) separately owned and operated health care facilities; or

(b) no information about a compensation practice, including a wage increase, is provided within three months of the
adoption of that practice; each disseminated statistic is based on input from at least five (5) separately owned and
operated health care facilities; and any information disseminated in such a survey is sufficiently aggregated that
recipients cannot identify the compensation paid by any survey participant;

(6) for each aggregated statistic, no individual separately owned and operated health care facility's data represents
more than twenty-five (25) percent on a weighted basis of that statistic; and

(7) representatives, agents, or employees of any health care facility in Utah do not have access to any unaggregated
data produced in response to any request for information in connection with the survey.

with the survey; and

the survey may not identify the facilities that participated in the survey, may not disseminate entry level rates
for a particular position, and may only disseminate the average pay rate for that position;

provided

Healthcare Human Resources Administration, or to any health care facility in Utah;

United States District Judge



Competitive Impact Statement


Pursuant to section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties, Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)-(h), the United States
submits this Competitive Impact Statement relating to the three proposed Final Judgments submitted for entry in
this civil antitrust proceeding.


I
Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding


On March 14, 1994, the United States filed a civil antitrust Complaint alleging that the defendants and co-conspirators
unreasonably conspired to restrain wage competition among themselves in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act,
15 U.S.C. 1.
The Complaint alleges that, from at least as early as January, 1984 and continuing through June, 1992, the defendants
and co-conspirators conspired to exchange current and prospective, nonpublic registered-nurse entry wage information
with the purpose and effect of restraining wage competition for registered nursing services in Salt Lake County,
Utah.
The conspiracy was effectuated through telephone calls and written surveys between the hospital defendants and
co-conspirators, and through meetings of the Utah Society for Healthcare Human Resources Administration (``USHHRA'')
and the Utah Hospital Association (``UHA''), both of which consist of human resource directors from the hospital
defendants. The hospital defendants agreed to exchange prospective and current compensation information. The
conspiracy had the effect of depriving registered nurses in Salt Lake County and elsewhere in Utah of the benefits
of free and open competition in the purchase of registered nursing services. In addition, the conspiracy resulted
in smaller annual increases in the registered-nurse entry wage than the hospital defendants would have paid absent
the conspiracy.
The Complaint seeks to prevent the defendants from continuing or renewing the alleged conspiracy, or from engaging
in any other conspiracy, or adopting any practice having a similar purpose of effect for a period of 5 years.

The defendants will be required to file annual reports with the Court and the Government certifying that they have
complied with the terms of section V of their respective Final Judgments. 

Entry of the proposed Final Judgments will terminate the action against all the defendants, except that the Court
will retain jurisdiction over the matter for further proceedings that may be required to interpret, enforce, or modify
the Judgment, or to punish violations of any of its provisions.

Description of the Practices Involved in the Alleged Violations



At trial, the Government would have made the following contentions: 1. The hospital defendants, St. Benedict's Hospital,
IHC Hospitals, Inc. (``IHC''), Holy Cross Hospital of Salt Lake City, Pioneer Valley Hospital, Inc., Lakeview Hospital,
Inc., Mountain View Hospital, Inc., Brigham City Community Hospital, Inc., and HCA Health Services of Utah, Inc.
d/b/a St. Mark's Hospital, provide and sell general acute-care hospital services and recruit and hire nurses. The
hospital defendants located in Salt Lake County compete with each other in recruiting and hiring nurses and purchase
approximately 75% of the registered nursing services in that County. 

2. On a regular basis, the hospital defendants telephoned one another and exchanged nonpublic prospective and current
wage and budget information for nurses. On a number of occasions, hospital defendants told each other, including
IHC, of their intent to match whatever registered-nurse entry wage IHC eventually adopted. 

3. On at least eight occasions between 1984 and 1992, some or all of the hospital defendants attended meetings organized
by USHHRA for the express purpose of exchanging nonpublic prospective and current wage and budget information about
registered nursing wages. 

4. Annually, IHC collected current and nonpublic prospective wage and budget information from the other hospital
defendants for use in a published wage survey that was distributed to the other hospitals. IHC used this information
to limit its registered-nurse wage increases. 

5. Annually, the UHA collected current and, in some years, prospective information pursuant to a survey designed
by the hospital defendants. This information was published and distributed to the hospital defendants, which use
this information to limit registered-nurse wage increases. 

6. As a direct result of these wage and budget exchanges, the hospital defendant's registered-nurse entry wages in
Salt Lake County and elsewhere in Utah were kept artificially low, and registered nurses were paid these lower wages
from 1984 through June, 1992.

Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgments



The United States and the defendants have stipulated that the Court may enter the proposed Final Judgments after compliance
with the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16 (b)-(h). Under the provisions of section 2(e)
of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(e), the proposed Final Judgments may not be entered unless
the Court finds that entry is in the public interest. Section X of each of the three proposed Final Judgments sets forth
such a finding.

The proposed Final Judgments are intended to ensure that the hospital defendants reach independent decisions about
the wages they pay registered nurses by prohibiting agreements, discussions, or other communications among competing
hospitals of current and prospective registered nursing wages, and to ensure that USHHRA and the UHA are not used as
forums or means for hospitals to exchange nonpublic prospective and current wage and budget information about registered
nursing wages.



A. Prohibitions and Obligations



The Hospital Defendants' Final Judgment enjoins the hospital defendants from entering into any agreement with any
other health care facility to fix nursing wages. It also prohibits them from discussing with any health care facility
in Utah or with any third party, prospective or current budget or nursing wage information, or the timing of wage increases,
except in very limited circumstances when the communications are solely for the purpose of recruiting or hiring a
nurse.

The Hospital Defendants' Final Judgment further prohibits the hospital defendants from developing, supervising,
or participating in a salary survey asking for current or prospective wage information concerning nurses or in which
the wage information is presented in a manner that would allow participants to determine what another health care
facility in Utah is, has been, or will be paying its nurses.

The Hospital Defendants' Final Judgment obligates each hospital defendant to file with plaintiff, on or before each
anniversary date of the Final Judgment, a statement that the defendant has complied with the terms of the Final Judgment
and has had no communications of the type prohibited under the Final Judgment.

The Hospital Defendants' Final Judgment also provides that an authorized representative of the Department of Justice
may visit the defendants' offices, after providing reasonable notice, to review their records and to conduct interviews
regarding any matters contained in the Final Judgment. The defendants may also be required to submit written reports,
under oath, pertaining to the Final Judgment.

The USHHRA Final Judgment prohibits USHHRA from conducting or facilitating any exchange or discussion by or between
any health care facility employees of information concerning the current or prospective compensation paid to nurses.
It also prohibits USHHRA from conducting or facilitating any exchange or discussion of information concerning compensation
previously paid to nurses unless a written log or audio or audio/visual recording of such exchange or discussion is
made.

The UHA Final Judgment prohibits the UHA from sponsoring or facilitating any exchange or discussion by or between
any health care facilities of information concerning the compensation paid to nurses. The UHA Final Judgment does
not, however, prohibit the UHA from sponsoring or publishing a survey of information concerning the compensation
paid to nurses if, among other things: (1) Any request for and dissemination of information is in writing, (2) the survey
includes only historic or current compensation information and does not request or disseminate prospective compensation
information, (3) the survey only disseminates aggregate data that is presented in a manner that would not allow participants
to determine what another health care facility in Utah is, has been, or will be paying its nurses, and (4) health care
facilities in Utah do not have access to unaggregated data produced in response to the survey.

The USHHRA and UHA Final Judgments have reporting and visitation provisions similar to the Hospital Defendants'
Final Judgment.

B. Scope of the Proposed Final Judgments


The Hospital Defendants' Final Judgment applies to the hospital defendants, as well as to each of their trustees,
officers, directors, agents, employees, successors, and assigns, and to all other persons in active concert or participation
with any of them who shall have received actual notice of the Final Judgment by personal service or otherwise. Moreover,
pursuant to the terms of the Final Judgment, any person who becomes a trustee, officer, director, administrator,
chief financial officer, non-clerical human resources and compensation staff member, director of nursing, or nurse
recruiter within 5 years after the entry of the Final Judgment shall be furnished a copy of the Final Judgment. 
The USHHRA and UHA Final Judgments have applicability and notification provisions similar to those of the Hospital
Defendants' Final Judgment.


C. Effect of the Proposed Final Judgments on Competition


The relief in the proposed Final Judgments is designed to ensure that hospitals in Salt Lake County establish their
registered-nurse wages independently and that registered nurses receive competitive wages. Specifically, the
injunction against exchanges of current and prospective wages and budget information and the reporting requirements
of Section IV and Section VI of the Hospital Defendants' Final Judgment are designed to eliminate restraints on wage
competition among hospitals in Salt Lake County. The injunction against conducting or facilitating the exchange
of information concerning the compensation paid to nurses and the reporting requirements of Sections IV and VI of
both the USHHRA and UHA Final Judgments are designed to preclude those organizations from being forums or means for
hospitals to exchange nonpublic prospective and current wage and budget information about registered nursing wages.
The Department of Justice believes that these proposed Final Judgments contain adequate provisions to prevent further
violations of the type described in the Complaint and to remedy the effects of the alleged conspiracy.


IV
Remedies Available to Potential Private Litigants


Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 15, provides that any person who has been injured as a result of conduct prohibited
by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages suffered, as well as costs and
reasonable attorney's fees. Entry of the proposed Final Judgments will neither impair nor assist the bringing of
such actions. Under the provisions of section 5(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(a), the Judgments have no 

prima facie 

effect in any subsequent lawsuits that may be brought against the defendants in this matter.


V
Procedures Available for Modification of the Proposed Judgments


As provided by the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, any person beliving that the proposed Final Judgments
should be modified may submit written comments to Gail Kursh, Chief, Professions and Intellectual Property Section,
U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 4th Street, NW., room 9903, Washington, DC 20001, within the
60-day period provided by the Act. These comments, and the Department's responses, will be filed with the Court and
published in the 

Federal Register

. All comments will be given due consideration by the Department of Justice, which remains free to withdraw its consent
to the proposed judgment at any time prior to entry. Section I of each of the proposed Final Judgments provides that
the Court retains jurisdiction over this action, and the parties may apply to the Court for any order necessary or appropriate
for modification, interpretation, or enforcement of the Final Judgments.


VI
Alternative to the Proposed Final Judgments


The alternative to the proposed Final Judgments would be a full trial of the case against the defendants. The Department
of Justice believes that such a trial would involve substantial cost to the United States and is not warranted since
the proposed Final Judgments provide the relief that the United States seeks in its Complaint.


VII
Determinative Materials and Documents


No materials and documents of the type described in Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15
U.S.C. 16(b), were considered in formulating the proposed Final Judgments.

Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions



General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.

The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.

Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register, 

or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.

Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue NW., room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

<USDEPT>NATIONAL COMMISSION ON INTERMODAL TRANSPORTATION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Notice of Public Hearings and Comments </DOCTITLE>
 



<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Commission on Intermodal Transportation is seeking comments and recommendations from interested
parties on how to achieve a more efficient and productive intermodal transportation system in the United States.




The Commission is charged by Congress to ``make a complete investigation and study of intermodal transportation
in the United States and internationally.'' Created by Section 5005 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency
Act of 1991, the Commission has members appointed by the President and the Congressional leadership. The Commission
is chaired by Robert D. Krebs, Chairman, President and CEO of Santa Fe Pacific Corporation. 


The Commission's legislation specifies three fundamental tasks: (1) Determine the status of, and problems related
to, intermodal transportation today; (2) identify the resources needed to enhance intermodal transportation;
and (3) make recommendations on how to achieve an efficient intermodal transportation system. The Commission will
focus on passenger and freight traffic, public and private sectors, and all modes of transportation. The Commission
will submit its findings to Congress on September 30, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Areas of Inquiry 



The following questions illustrate the type of issues the public is invited to address, but they are emphatically
not intended as a comprehensive list of issues that the Commission expects to consider. Respondents may focus on these
issues and any other specific matters that would bear upon the improvement of intermodal transportation in the United
States. 



Status of the Existing System 



 What is the status of intermodal transportation today? Where is intermodalism working? 

 What are the key intermodal bottlenecks in freight traffic? 

 What are the key intermodal bottlenecks in passenger traffic? 

 What are the best examples of efficient intermodal facilities and operations_passenger and freight? 

 How would the proposed National Transportation System (NTS) affect the development of an intermodal system?
What criteria should be used in developing an NTS? 

 How has intermodalism developed in the freight sector? Are there lessons transferable to the passenger sector?




Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Questions 



 Would modification of government structures enhance development of an efficient itnermodal transportation
system? If so, how? 

 How can institutional barriers between private (freight) and public (passenger) be reduced to enhance intermodal
planning at the local, state and national levels? 

 Are there specific legal impediments to increasing intermodal efficiency such as: outdated, inefficient,
cumbersome regulations/laws, jursidicational issues among governments, impediments to sharing resources, inconsistency
of regulations among states, and antitrust impediments to standardization? 

 Are there structural or process impediments to improving existing infrasture capacity? 

 Has ISTEA made a difference in MPO treatment of intermodal projects? 

 Do the existing intermodal planning structures at the state and local levels need additional national standards
and criteria to insure that a consistent national plan emerges from the MPO/state process? 

 What are the barriers to promoting ``seamless borders'' for international intermodal movements? 



Funding and Financial Questions 



 Is adequate funding of intermodal transportation presently available? Identify specific gaps. 

 What additional investment is required to meet the nation's needs, including access to ports, airports, and
intermodal terminals? 

 Are innovative methods and sources of financing needed to provide adequate funding for intermodal transportation?
If so, what might they include? 


 How can federal, state and local governments best leverage transportation investments to encourage intermodal
transportation? 

 Are there significant opportunities for investment by the private sector or for privatization that would
advance intermodalism? What barriers exist? 



Technology and Research Questions 



 What new technology will enhance development of an efficient intermodal transportation system? How can the
federal government encourage its introduction? 

 How can decision-support planning tools be developed for use in the public resource allocation process? 

 Are there essential intermodal R & D needs that cannot be met by the private sector alone? 

 How can the concerns of publics with special needs (elderly, handicapped, disadvantaged, etc.) be better
served by intermodal systems? 


Respondents may focus on these issues and any other specific matters that would bear upon the improvement of intermodal
transportation in the United States.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Confirmatory Order Modifying License (Effective Immediately) </DOCTITLE>


In the Matter of Allegheny General Hospital Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [Docket Nos. 030-02981, 030-00462,
030-30452; License Nos. 37-01317-01, 37-01317-02, 37-01317-03 EA 94-051]



I 


Allegheny General Hospital (Licensee), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is the holder of Byproduct/Source Material
Licenses Nos 37-01317-01; 37-01317-02; 37-01317-03 (Licenses), issued by the
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR parts 30 and 33. The Licenses authorize
the Licensee to use radioactive material under a broad scope license, possess an irradiator for calibrations of instruments,
and possess an irradiator for irradiation of blood products and biological samples. 
License No. 37-01317-01 was issued on October 25, 1956, and was due to expire on January 31, 1989, but is
currently under timely renewal pending staff action based on a licensee request to renew the license, dated December
15, 1988. License No. 37-01317-02 was issued on July 19, 1957, was renewed on March 23, 1992, and is due to
expire on March 31, 1997. License No. 37-0117-03 was issued on May 31, 1988, was recently renewed on October
4, 1993, and is due to expire on October 31, 1988. 


II 


On December 13-20, 1993, the NRC performed an inspection of licensed activities at the Licensee's facility.
During the inspection, numerous violations of NRC requirements were identified. The violations are described in
detail in a Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalties issued concurrently on this date. The violations,
which demonstrate a significant lack of management attention to, and control of, licensed activities at the facility,
included: (1) 48 examples of failure to prepare written directives prior to the administration of radioactive materials
to patients at the facility and a failure to instruct a nuclear medicine technologist in the Licensee's Quality Management
Program, as required by NRC requirements; and (2) many other violations (related to such areas as failure to maintain
security over licensed material, and violations of radiation safety requirements for irradiators, performing
required surveys, providing training to nursing staff, maintaining appropriate procedures, ensuring control
of material, and maintaining appropriate records) which collectively are indicative of a significant lack of management
attention to, and control of, licensed activities. 
The violations are of significant regulatory concern since the Licensee possesses a large broad scope license which
places a significant responsibility on the Radiation Safety Committee (RSC), as well as the Radiation Safety Officer
(RSO), to ensure that licensed activities are conducted safely and in accordance with NRC requirements. 
The Licensee's failure to maintain sufficient control of radioactive materials raises significant questions regarding
the adequacy of the Licensee's oversight of activities at its facility, as well as its ability to assure that activities
at those facilities are conducted safely and in accordance with NRC requirements. Accordingly, without independent
assessments of the Licensee's radiation safety program and a performance improvement plan, there is a substantial
question as to whether licensed activities will be adequately controlled at the Licensee's facilities. 


III 


During an enforcement conference on February 2, 1994, as well as in telephone conversations on February 4 and 9, 1994,
and March 16, 1994, between Mr. Lou Shapiro of the Licensee's staff and Dr. Ronald Bellamy of the NRC Region I staff,
the Licensee committed to retain the services of an independent consultant to perform an assessment of its radiation
safety program and to develop a performance improvement plan based upon the assessment findings. The Licensee has
consented to the terms of this Order. 
I find that Licensee's commitments are acceptable and necessary and conclude that, with these commitments and the
implementation of an appropriate performance improvement plan, the public health and safety are reasonably assured.
In view of the foregoing, I have determined that the public health and safety require that the Licensee's commitments
be confirmed by this Order. Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I have also determined, based on the Licensee's consent and on
the significant of the violations described above, that the public health and safety require that this Order be immediately
effective. 


IV


Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and
the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Parts 30 and 33, 

it is hereby ordered

, effective immediately, that licenses nos. 37-01317-01, 37-01317-02, and 37-01317-03
are modified as follows: 
A. The Licensee shall retain the services of a consultant, with extensive experience in the management and implementation
of a broad scope radiation safety program, including activities similar to those authorized under the Licensee's
program, to perform an assessment of the Licensee's radiation safety program. Within 30 days from the effective date
of this Order, the Licensee shall submit the name and qualifications of the consultant to the Regional Administrator,
NRC Region I, for approval. 
B. Within 90 days of NRC approval of the consultant selection as described under Section IV.A of this Order, the assessment
shall be completed, and a copy of the assessment report shall be submitted to the NRC within the following 15 days. The
assessment of the Licensee's radiation safety program shall include, but not be limited to, a review of:

1. The Licensee's organization, and assigned responsibilities and authorities within that organization;

2. The Licensee's program for training and retraining individuals working with NRC-licensed materials, in NRC regulations,
in the conditions of the Licenses, and in radiologically safe practices for using licensed material;

3. The Licensee's methods of approving individuals for the use of licensed materials and developing procedures for
the safe use of licensed materials;

4. The Licensee's program for training and qualifying all individuals involved in managing, supervising, inspecting
and auditing licensed activities;

5. The Licensee's program of surveillance and audits to determine compliance by individual users of licensed materials
with NRC regulations, the conditions of the NRC Licenses, and the Licensee's own procedures for the safe use of radioactive
materials;

6. The adequacy of the existing staffing within the Radiation Safety Department, to ensure that the items set forth
in Sections IV.B.2 through V.B.5 of this Order are adequately performed; and,

7. The Licensee's management of the radiation safety program, including the function of the Radiation Safety Committee
and its methods of monitoring the program to ensure that problems, when they exist, are promptly identified and effectively
corrected.

C. Within 120 days of NRC approval of the consultant selection described under Section IV.A of this Order, the Licensee
shall submit a performance improvement plan to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region I, describing its methods
of implementing the recommendations of the assessment report, or providing justification for alternate or no corrective
action, if any specific recommendations are not adopted. This plan shall include:

1. Action items completed or to be performed;

2. Schedules for, or dates of, completion of each specific action item; and

3. A system for monitoring and tracking the status and completion of the action items.

D. Upon completion of all action items, a final report shall be submitted by the Licensee to the Regional Administrator,
NRC Region I. During implementation of the performance improvement plan, the Licensee shall provide written quarterly
status reports to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region I, concerning the implementation of the plan, until such
time as all items in the performance improvement plan have been implemented and the final report issued.

The Regional Administrator, NRC Region I, may relax or rescind, in writing, any of the above conditions upon demonstration
by the Licensee of good cause.



V



Any person adversely affected by this Confirmatory Order, other than the Licensee, may request a hearing within 20
days of its issuance. Any request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
ATTN: Chief, Docketing and Service Section, Washington, D.C. 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the Director, Office
of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555, to the Assistant General Counsel for

<DOCTITLE>Northern States Power Co.; Issuance of Amendment to Materials License SNM-2506</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has issued Amendment No. 1 to Materials License No. SNM-2506
held by Northern States Power Company for the receipt and storage of spent fuel at the Prairie Island independent spent
fuel storage installation, located in Goodhue County, Minnesota. The amendment is effective as of the date of issuance.

The amendment corrects the license making administrative changes to correct an error which was made when the license
was issued. These changes do not affect fuel receipt, handling, and storage safety.

The amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),
and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and
the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. Prior public
notice of the amendment was not required since the amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration.

The Commission has determined that the issuance of the amendment will not result in any significant environmental
impact and that, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(c)(11), an environmental assessment need not be prepared in connection
with issuance of the amendment.

For further details with respect to this action, see (1) Amendment No. 1 to Materials License No. SNM-2506, and
(2) the Commission's letter to the licensee dated March 17, 1994. All of these items are available for public inspection
at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the
Local Public Document Room at the Technology & Science Department, Minneapolis Public Library, 300 Nicollet
Mall, Minneapolis, MN 55401.

<DOCTITLE>Power Authority of the State of New York; James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant</DOCTITLE>


Exemption
I


The Power Authority of the State of New York (PASNY or the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No.
DPR-59, which authorizes operation of the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (the facility or FitzPatrick).
The license provides, among other things, that the facility is subject to all the rules, regulations, and Orders of
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter in effect.
The facility is a boiling water reactor located at the licensee's site in Oswego County, New York.


II


Section III of Appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 requires the development of a program to conduct periodic leak testing of
the primary reactor containment and related systems and components, and components penetrating the primary containment
pressure boundary. The interval between local leak rate tests for containment isolation valves (Type C tests) is
specified by section III.D.3 to be no greater than 2 years.


III


By letter dated January 11, 1994, the licensee requested a schedular exemption pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a) from the
requirements of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J, section III.D.3. Specifically, the licensee requested one-time relief
from the requirement to perform Type C tests (local leak rate tests) at intervals of no greater than 2 years for the shutdown
cooling isolation valves (10MOV-17 and 10MOV-18). This one-time only delay, until the next refueling
outage currently scheduled to begin in November 1994, was requested for the performance of these leakage tests. The
licensee's request was necessitated by the extended 1991-1993 refueling outage and the length of the current
operating cycle.
The shutdown cooling valves were previously tested during the last refueling outage (Reload 10/Cycle 11). This was
an extended outage that began in November 1991 and ended in January 1993. The Type C tests on the subject valves were
performed on May 30, 1992, for the outboard isolation valve 10MOV-17, and June 5, 1992, for the inboard isolation
valve 10MOV-18. Subsequent delays in the outage resulted in these tests being performed significantly in advance
of the start of the operating cycle (more than 7 months prior to the end of the outage). As a result, the 2 year test interval
will be reached for these valves (May 30, 1994/June 5, 1994) 6 to 7 months prior to the next scheduled refueling outage.
The exemption would permit a deferral in the performance of the Type C test of the shutdown cooling isolation valves
beyond the 2-year limiting interval to the next refueling outage.

The only effective means of removing reactor core decay heat is with the shutdown cooling mode of the RHR system. This
requires both of the stated isolation valves to be in the open position. The shutdown cooling mode of the RHR system
must be removed from service for approximately 24 hours to perform a local leak rate test (Type C) of its isolation valves.
This is the time required to tag-out the system, drain the line, perform the test, refill the line, and return the system
to service. To avoid overheating the reactor coolant system with the shutdown cooling mode inoperable, one of the
following two conditions must exist:

1. The reactor needs to be shutdown for several months to permit sufficient reduction in decay heat levels for use of
an alternate shutdown cooling method without placing the plant in the refueling condition. The alternate cooling
method with the highest heat removal capacity is the Reactor Water Cleanup system in the blowdown mode. However, the
reactor must be shutdown for more than 3 months before this method can handle the decay heat load.

2. The plant needs to be in the refueling condition; i.e., reactor head removed, reactor cavity flooded up and connected
to the spent fuel pool. This permits the removal of the normal shutdown cooling system from operation and testing of
these valves.

A three week surveillance/maintenance outage is planned for spring 1994. However, the decay heat levels present
during any outage less than several months precludes the use of the alternate cooling method without placing the plant
in the refueling configuration. The exemption would preclude the need to place the plant in the refueling configuration
prior to the next scheduled refueling outage. Without the exemption, the licensee would be required to remove the
drywell and reactor heads and connect the reactor cavity to the spent fuel pool solely for the purpose of testing the
shutdown cooling isolation valves. Placing the plant in the refueling configuration would significantly lengthen
the spring 1994 outage and would require significant resources. Furthermore, placing the plant in the refueling
configuration to accommodate testing of the isolation valves would significantly increase occupational radiation
exposures. For these reasons, the licensee has determined that compliance with the regulation would result in undue
hardship and costs.



IV



Section III.D.3 of Appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 states that Type C tests shall be performed during reactor shutdowns
for refueling, at an interval not to exceed 2 years. The licensee has requested a one-time exemption from the regulations.

The operating configuration of the shutdown cooling isolation valves and the RHR system when the reactor coolant
system is pressurized (greater than 75 psig) substantially minimizes the possibility of gross leakage through these
valves. A high reactor pressure interlock, as well as plant operating procedures, assures that these isolation valves
are closed whenever reactor pressure is above 75 psig. This protects the low pressure RHR system from overpressurization.
The RHR system suction piping is designed for 450 psig. Gross leakage while the reactor is pressurized would be detected
by high pressure on the RHR suction piping or an increase in suppression pool inventory. Consequently, the maintenance
of normal operating status of the RHR system assures the absence of gross leakage through these valves.

These valves also receive an isolation signal in the event of a plant accident (reactor vessel low water level or high
drywell pressure). This assures isolation of a potential leakage path from the reactor coolant system to the reactor
building. For this path to exist, leakage through both isolation valves, and a breach of the RHR system piping would
need to occur simultaneously. Since the isolation valves are maintained closed with the reactor pressurized, it
is improbable the leakage through the valves will increase while the plant is operating. The redundant isolation
valves provide two leakage barriers which limit the pathway leakage rate to that experienced by the valve with smallest
leakage rate. For these reasons, the potential for significant leakage to the reactor building by way of the shutdown
cooling line is minimal.

The penetration included in the licensee's schedular exemption request represents only 6.4 percent of the total
``as left'' leakage at the beginning of the current operating cycle. The total ``as left'' minimum path leakage for
all penetrations was only 0.073 La and the total ``as left'' minimum path leakage for the penetration addressed in
the proposed exemption was only 0.0046 La. The replacement of both isolation valves with valves of improved design
provides added confidence that excessive leakage will not be experienced. The inboard valve 10MOV-18 was replaced
during the 1985 refueling outage and has successfully passed three out of four Type C tests performed during refueling
outages since its replacement. The outboard isolation valve 10MOV-17 was replaced with a similarly designed
new valve during the last refueling outage (1992). The limited number of valve strokes these valves are subject to
over any one operating cycle minimizes valve degradation due to wear. This provides reasonable assurance that the
requested surveillance interval expansion will not result in the Types B and C leakage rate total exceeding the 0.6
La limit of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed schedular exemption.

The 2-year interval requirement for Type C testing is intended to be often enough to preclude significant deterioration
between tests and long enough to permit the tests to be performed during routine plant outages. Leak rate testing of
containment isolation valves during plant shutdown is preferable because of the lower radiation exposures to plant
personnel. Furthermore, some containment isolation valves cannot be tested at power. For those valves that cannot
be tested during power operation, or for which testing at power would yield unnecessary radiation exposure of personnel,
the NRC staff believes the increase in confidence of containment integrity following a successful test is not significant
enough to justify the hardships and costs associated with performing the tests within the 2-year time period.



V



The Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(1), this exemption is authorized by law, will not
present undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common defense and security. The Commission
further determines that special circumstances, as provided in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), are present justifying the
exemption; namely that application of the regulation in the particular circumstance is not necessary to achieve
the underlying purpose of the rule. The underlying purpose of Section III.D.3 of Appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 is to provide
an interval short enough to prevent serious deterioration from occurring between tests and long enough to permit
testing to be performed during regular plant outages. For containment isolation valves that cannot be tested at power,
or for containment isolation valves where testing involves unreasonable risk to personnel and equipment, the increased
confidence in containment integrity following successful testing is not significant enough to justify the hardships
associated with performing the test within the 2-year interval. Specifically, any potential incremental benefit
of performing the tests within the 2-year requirement would not be sufficient to offset the increased occupational
radiation exposure associated with testing, the risk to plant safety associated with removing the primary method
of decay heat removal from service, and the undue financial burden of placing the plant in the refueling configuration
and significantly extending the length of the spring 1994 maintenance/surveillance outage. The licensee has presented
information accepted by the Commission, which gives a high degree of confidence that the components affected by this
exemption will not degrade to an unacceptable extent. Acceptable leakage limits are defined in sections III.B.3(a)
and III.C.3 of Appendix J to 10 CFR part 50.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that granting the above exemption will have no significant
impact on the quality of the human environment (March 16, 1994, 59 FR 12382).

This Exemption is effective upon issuance and shall expire prior to restart following the next FitzPatrick refueling
outage which is currently scheduled to commence in November 1994.

Cover Letter for RI 20-63, Decision About A Survivor Annuity For A Current Spouse 



Name: Address: CSA Number: 

 


Dear      : You may elect a survivor annuity for a spouse you married after retirement.
You must make you election within two years of your marriage. Your election cannot be effective sooner than nine months
after your marriage. Your annuity will be reduced to reflect the benefit payable to your spouse upon your death. 

There will be two reductions to your annuity. The first reduction will be for the regular cost of a survivor benefit.
The reduction will be eliminated should your marriage end. This reduction is currently $   
per month and it will provide a survivor benefit of $    per month. The survivor benefit will increase
with the cost-of-living. 

The second reduction is permanent (even if your marriage ends) and represents the amount your annuity would have been
reduced for the survivor benefit (plus interest) had you been married since the date of your retirement. As of    ,
this amount is $    and the monthly reduction to pay it back is $    .
The reduction is based on your life expectancy and the amount you owe. These amounts will increase each month as principal
and interest accumulates and as you age (that is on your birthday), up until the time we receive your election. Therefore,
the amount shown below as your reduced gross annuity rate may be smaller if you delay your election. 

Taken together, the reductions to provide a survivor benefit will reduce your current gross annuity of $   
to $    per month. 

We computed the above costs of the survivor benefit assuming you elect the maximum possible benefit. If you want to
provide the maximum benefit, please complete and return the enclosed election within the time limit. You may elect
a smaller survivor benefit at proportionately less cost. If you want to know the exact cost of a smaller benefit, enter
the amount you want your spouse to receive each month below and return this letter to the Office of Personnel Management,
Retirement Operations Center, ATTN: PRM-STOP, Boyers, PA 16017. 

I want to provide a monthly survivor benefit of $

XXXX

. (Specify a whole dollar amount.) 

If you are requesting information on the cost for a smaller benefit, do not complete the enclosed election at this time
because an election cannot be revoked or changed once we receive it. 

If you have not already submitted them, please furnish the following: 

*If you were married at retirement and later divorced, a complete copy of your divorce decree, and related agreements
or amendments. 

*A copy of the marriage certificate for your current spouse.

If we can be of further assistance, please let us know.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change
by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., Relating to an Extension and Expansion of a Position Limit
Hedge Exemption Pilot Program


March 18, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on February 9, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''), filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which items
have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change
from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The NASD is proposing to amend Section 3 of Appendix E (``Section 3'') to the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice (``Rules'')
to extend, until December 31, 1995, the NASD's pilot program for exemptions from equity option position limits for
certain hedged positions (``hedge exemption pilot program''). The NASD also proposes to amend section 3 of the Rules
to expand the hedge exemption pilot program to provide that the underlying hedged equity position may be comprised
of securities readily convertible into or economically equivalent to the stock underlying the corresponding hedging
options position. In addition, the NASD proposes to add a new example to the list of examples contained at the end of
section 3(a) of the Rules to illustrate the operation of the position limit hedge exemption. The text of the proposed
rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, NASD, and at the Commission.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared
summaries, set forth in section (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


On February 9, 1990, the Commission approved an NASD proposal to implement a two-year pilot program during which certain
fully hedged equity option positions would be automatically exempt from established position and exercise limits.
 Specifically, the hedge exemption pilot program provides for an automatic exemption from equity option position
limits for accounts that have established one of the four most commonly used hedged positions on a limited one-for-one
basis (i.e., the number of shares represented by one options contract). The exempted positions are: (1) Long stock
and short calls; (2) long stock and long puts; (3) short stock and long calls; and (4) short stock and short puts. Under
the hedge exemption pilot program, the largest options position (combining hedged and unhedged positions) that
may be established may not exceed twice the basic position limit.
 In addition, the hedge exemption pilot program does not change the exercise limits contained in the Rules.
 Therefore, market participants are allowed to exercise, during any five consecutive business days, the same number
of options contracts set forth as the position limit for that option, including those options positions that are hedged.






The NASD is proposing three amendments to the hedge exemption pilot program. First, because the hedge exemption pilot
program expired on February 9, 1992, the NASD is proposing to re-implement the pilot program until December 31, 1995.
In addition, in order to avoid future lapses in the hedge exemption pilot program, the NASD proposes to incorporate
this expiration date into its Rules in a new subsection (c) to section 3.

Second, the NASD proposes to amend Section 3 of the Rules to expand the hedge exemption pilot program to provide that
in addition to stock, the underlying hedged security position may be comprised of securities readily convertible
into or economically equivalent to the security underlying the corresponding hedging options position. The NASD
believes that expanding the hedge exemption pilot program in this manner is appropriate and consistent with the Act
because it would allow investors to hedge instruments that are economically equivalent to stocks more efficiently
and effectively. Specifically, because the NASD believes that the value of such a security likely will fluctuate
in tandem with the value of the security into which it is convertible or economically equivalent, the NASD believes
investors with positions in these securities should be able to hedge their positions with equity options to the same
extent that investors with long or short positions in the underlying security can.
 In addition, because the hedge exemption pilot program requires the positions in the convertible or economically
equivalent securities and the corresponding options to be fully hedged, the NASD believes that the expansion of the
pilot program will not significantly increase concerns regarding intermarket manipulations or disruptions of
either the options markets or the underlying stock market.




Third, the NASD proposes to add a new example to the list of examples contained at the end of Section 3 of the Rules to illustrate
the operation of the position limit hedge exemption. The NASD believes that this example will serve to avoid investor
confusion concerning the hedge exemption pilot program.
The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 15A(b)(6) of the Act
 in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system,
and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the NASD believes that the proposed
extension and expansion of the hedge exemption pilot program may increase the depth and liquidity of the options markets
by permitting investors to hedge greater amounts of stock than would otherwise be the case without the hedge exemption.
At the same time, the NASD represents that the higher position limits available by virtue of the hedge exemption pilot
program have not resulted in disruptions of the underlying stock markets due to restrictions in those markets and
the NASD's surveillance program. In this connection, the NASD will continue to monitor the use of the position limit
hedge exemption to ensure that NASD members are complying with the requirements of the exemption. The NASD also will
continue to monitor the market effects, if any, from the position limit hedge exemptions.




(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received by the NASD with respect to the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The NASD has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
of the Act.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change to extend the hedge exemption pilot program is consistent with
the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange,
and, in particular, the requirements of section 15A(b)(6) thereunder.
 Specifically, the Commission concludes, as it did when originally approving the hedge exemption pilot program that
providing for increased position and exercise limits for equity options in circumstances where those excess positions
are fully hedged with offsetting stock positions will provide greater depth and liquidity to the market and allow
investors to hedge their stock portfolios more effectively, without significantly increasing concerns regarding
intermarket manipulations or disruptions of either the options market or the underlying stock market.






In addition, with respect to the NASD's proposal to expand the types of securities eligible to serve as the basis for
the underlying hedge position to include convertible securities and securities economically equivalent to the
stock underlying the corresponding hedging options position, the Commission continues to believes, as it did in
approving similar proposals by the options exchanges,
 that such expansion is consistent with the Act because it will allow investors to use instruments that are economically
equivalent to stocks more efficiently and effectively for purposes of hedging their equity options positions.
 Specifically, the Commission concurs with the NASD's belief that because the value of a convertible security or a
security economically equivalent to the stock underlying a corresponding hedging options position likely will
fluctuate in tandem with the value of the security that it is convertible into or economically equivalent to, investors
with positions in such securities should be able to hedge their positions in equity options with those securities
to the same extent that investors with long or short positions in the underlying securities can. Moreover, as with
the original hedge exemption pilot program,
 the Commission believes the expansion of the pilot program in this manner likely will enhance the depth and liquidity
in the options markets. In addition, because the hedge exemption pilot program still requires the positions in the
securities and the corresponding options to be fully hedged, the Commission believes the expansion will not significantly
increase concerns regarding intermarket manipulation or disruption of either the options markets or the underlying
stock market.








With respect to the proposed example to be added to section 3 of the Rules, the Commission believes the example may serve
to avoid investor confusion concerning the hedge exemption pilot program.

The Commission also notes that before the hedge exemption pilot program can be approved on a permanent basis, the NASD
Must provide the Commission with a report on the operation of the pilot program. Specifically, the NASD must provide
the Commission with details on (1) the frequency with which the exemptions have been used; (2) the types of investors
using the exemptions; (3) the size of the positions established pursuant to the hedge exemption pilot program; (4)
what types of convertible or economically equivalent securities are being used to hedge positions and how frequently
such securities have been used to hedge; (5) whether the NASD has received any complaints on the operation of the hedge
exemption pilot program; (6) whether the NASD has taken any disciplinary action against, or commenced any investigations,
examinations, or inquiries concerning, any of its members for any violation of any term or condition of the hedge exemption
pilot program; (7) the market impact, if any, of the hedge exemption pilot program; and (8) how the NASD has implemented
surveillance procedures to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the hedge exemption pilot program.
In addition, the Commission expects the NASD to inform the Commission of the results of any surveillance investigations
undertaken for apparent violations of the provisions of the hedge exemption pilot program.

The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

 so that the hedge exemption pilot program can be re-implemented without further delay and to help avoid any potential
investor confusion concerning the availability of the hedge exemption as a result of the lapse of the pilot program.
The Commission notes that the NASD has not experienced any significant problems with the hedge exemption pilot program
since its inception and that the NASD will continue to monitor the pilot program to ensure that no problems arise. Moreover,
no adverse comments have been received by the NASD concerning the hedge exemption pilot program since its implementation.
Additionally, the proposal to expand the hedge exemption pilot program to include convertible securities and securities
economically equivalent to the stock underlying the corresponding hedging options position is substantively similar
to proposals previously approved by the Commission for the options exchanges.
 Finally, the proposed example to be added to section 3 of the Rules merely serves to clarify the operation of the hedge
exemption pilot program and is not a substantive rule change. As a result, because of the importance of maintaining
the quality and efficiency of the securities markets, the Commission believes good cause exists for approving the
extension and expansion of the NASD's hedge exemption pilot program on an accelerated basis.





IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating
to Additions to the ``List of Exchange Rule Violations and Fines Applicable Thereto Pursuant to Rule 476A''</DOCTITLE>


March 17, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on October 21, 1993, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



This proposal would revise the Rule 476A Violations List for imposition of fines for minor violations of rules and/or
policies by adding to the list Exchange Rules 304(h)(2), 345.12, 346(b) and (e), 346(f), 352(b) and (c), 440C and 472(c).






II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose


Rule 476A
 provides that the Exchange may impose a fine ranging from $500 to $2,500 on an individual, and a fine ranging from $1,000
to $5,000 on a member organization for a minor violation of certain specified Exchange rules.






The purpose of the Rule 476A procedure is to provide for a response to a rule violation when a meaningful sanction is
appropriate but when initiation of a disciplinary proceeding under Rule 476 is not suitable because such a proceeding
would be more costly and time-consuming than would be warranted given the minor nature of the violation. Rule 476A
provides for an appropriate response to minor violations of certain Exchange rules while preserving the due process
rights of the party accused through specified, required procedures. The list of rules which are eligible for 476A
procedures specifies those rule violations which may be the subject of fines under the rule and also includes a schedule
of fines.
In SR-NYSE-84-27, which initially set forth the provisions and procedures of the Rule 476A, the
Exchange indicated it would amend the list of rules from time to time, as it considered appropriate, in order to phase-in
the implementation of Rule 476A as experience with it was gained. The Exchange's regulatory divisions have amended
the list since its initial implementation to include either existing rules or newly approved ones, which are appropriate
for inclusion in this particular disciplinary process when violations occur.

The Exchange is presently seeking approval to add certain Exchange rules to the list of rules subject to possible imposition
of fines under Rule 476A procedures. The types of rules covered generally include reporting, required approvals,
record retention and conduct of accounts for which determinations of violations can be made objectively. They are
as follows:

 

Rule 304(h)(2)

_Requires member organizations to supply the Exchange with information relating to the existence of any statutory
disqualification as defined in the Act to which an approved person or any person associated with the approved person
may be subject.


 

Rule 345.12

_Requires applications (Form U-4) for all natural persons required to be registered with the Exchange to be
filed upon the candidate's employment and to be kept current. 

 Rule 346(b) and (3)_Rule 346(b) requires members, allied members and employees of member organizations to
receive prior written consent of their employer to engage in any other business activity or to be employed or compensated
by any other person. Rule 346(e) provides that persons delegated supervisory responsibilities must devote their
full time to the business of the member organization during business hours, unless otherwise permitted by the Exchange
(Rule 346.10).
 

Rule 346(g)

_Provides that no member, member organization, allied member, approved person or employee of any person in a control
relationship with a member or member organization shall be associated with any person subject to a statutory disqualification
as defined in the Act.

 

Rule 352(b) and (c)

_Prohibits a member, member organization, allied member, registered representative or officer from guaranteeing
any customer against loss in any account and from sharing in profits or losses in a customer's account.
 

Rule 440C

_States that no member or member organization should ``fail to deliver'' against a short sale until a diligent effort
has been made to borrow necessary securities to make delivery.


 

Rule 472(c)

_Requires members and member organizations to retain communications with customers and the public (

e.g., 

advertisements, research reports, sales literature) for at least three years. The communications must also contain
the name of the person who prepared the material, the name of the person approving its issuance, and be readily available
to the Exchange upon request.


2. 

Statutory Basis



The proposed rule change will advance the objectives of section 6(b)(6) of the Act in that it will provide a procedure
whereby members, allied members, employees and member organizations can be ``appropriately disciplined'' in those
instances when a rule violation is minor in nature, but a sanction more serious than a warning or cautionary letter
is appropriate. The proposed rule change provides a fair procedure for imposing such sanctions, in accordance with
the requirements of sections 6(b)(7) and 6(d)(1) of the Act.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:




(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or 
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NYSE-93-38
and should be submitted by April 15, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Aetna Series Fund Inc., et al.; Application</DOCTITLE>



March 18, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

Aetna Series Fund, Inc. (the ``Company''), Aetna Capital Management, Inc. (the ``Underwriter'') and Aetna Life
Insurance and Annuity Company (the ``Adviser'').




RELEVANT ACT SECTION: 

Order requested under section 6(c) of the Act for an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 18(f)(1), 18(g),
18(i), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c-1 thereunder.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants request an order that would permit certain investment companies to issue multiple classes of securities
representing interests in the same portfolio and assess and, under certain circumstances, waive a contingent deferred
sales charge (``CDSC'') on certain redemptions of shares.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. The Company is an open-end management investment company registered under the Act and organized as a Maryland corporation.
The Company's existing and future series are referred to as the ``Funds.'' The Adviser provides investment advisory
and administrative services to each of the Funds.
 The Underwriter acts as a principal underwriter of the Funds' shares. Each of the Funds has a single class of shares
that is currently offered to investors at net asset value without a sales load.





A. Multi Class System



1. Applicants request relief, on behalf of themselves, any entity controlling, under common control with or controlled
by the Underwriter or the Adviser that may in the future serve as a Fund's underwriter or investment adviser, and any
registered investment companies that may in the future be advised or distributed by the Adviser or Underwriter. Applicants
propose to establish a multiple class distribution system to enable each of the Funds to offer investors the option
of purchasing classes of shares that would either be subject to: (a) A conventional front-end sales load, (b) a non-rule
12b-1 service fee, (c) a rule 12b-1 distribution fee, (d) a CDSC, (e) a combination of front-end sales load,
service fee, distribution fee and/or CDSC, or (f) no sales charge. Applicants currently contemplate offering only
two classes of shares.

2. Under the proposed multi-class distribution system, the Funds would continue to offer the current shares as ``Class
A shares.'' Class A shares would be distributed with no sales charge, distribution fee, or service fee to: (i) Certain
corporate retirement plans as determined by the board of directors, (ii) salaried employees and persons retired
from salaried positions with the Adviser and its affiliates, (iii) insurance companies (including separate accounts),
registered investment companies, investment advisers and broker-dealers acting for their own account and other
institutions as determined by the board of directors, (iv) current shareholders at the time of first offering of Class
B shares as long as they maintain a shareholder account (

i.e. 

current shareholders would be eligible to make future purchases of Class A shares upon the commencement of the Multi-Class
Distribution System); and (v) any other persons, organization, or affinity groups identified by the board of directors,
eligible to acquire shares, pursuant to which the sale of shares involves minimal sales expense to the Company.

<PARENT> FR940325-2-00091 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


3. The deferred option or ``Class B shares'' will be subject to a rule 12b-1 distribution fee, non rule 12b-1 service
fee and a CDSC. Class B shares of each Fund would pay a service fee and a distribution fee pursuant to a shareholder services
plan and a 12b-1 plan. Class B shares would be sold to all other investors. 

4. The Funds may in the future establish a class of shares that is only offered to the following categories of investors
(``Institutional Class''): (a) Unaffiliated benefit plans; (b) tax-exempt retirement plans of the Adviser and
its affiliates; (c) unit investment trusts sponsored by the Adviser or its affiliates; (d) banks and insurance companies
purchasing for their own account; (e) investment companies not affiliated with the Adviser and (f) endowment funds
for non-profit organizations. The unaffiliated benefit plans must meet certain asset levels as established by the
Funds and have a separate trustee for the plan who is vested with investment discretion as to plan assets. Applicants
will exclude self-directed plans from this category. The offerees of the tax-exempt plans in category (b) will be
qualified defined contribution plans maintained pursuant to section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the ``Code'')
by the Adviser and its affiliates for the benefit of employees. The UITs in category (c) will, under current regulations,
require a separate order of exemption pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act in order to invest in shares of the Funds. The
entities in categories (d), (e) and (f) will not be affiliated with the Adviser. These offerees will have in common
the essential feature of substantial assets under management and investment decision-making by institutional
management on behalf of the entity with respect to the purchase of Institutional Class shares. Thus, these entities
could not be used as a conduit for individuals investing in Institutional Class shares, and no individual would be
the direct owner of Institutional Class shares. Investors eligible to purchase Institutional Class shares would
be sold only Institutional Class shares, rather than any other class of shares offered by the Funds. 

5. Operating expenses, which are attributable to all classes, will be allocated daily to each class of shares based
on the relative net assets in each class at the beginning of the day. Expenses that have a greater cost for one class than
another (

i.e., 

distribution fees, service fees and possible transfer agent fees, registration fees, directors fees, administrative
expenses, and legal fees and expenses) will be charged separately to each class. Accordingly, the net income attributable
to and the dividends payable on Class B shares would be lower than the net income attributable to and the dividends payable
on Class A shares. 

6. Shares of one class automatically may convert to another class with lower ongoing distribution or shareholder
service fees after a specified period of time. Shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions
paid in respect of a class would convert on a 

pro rata 

basis, determined by the ratio that the shareholder's shares converting to another class bears to the shareholder's
total shares not acquired through dividends and distributions. 

7. Applicants anticipate that each class of shares may be exchanged for shares of the same class in another Fund to the
extent that the shareholder would have been eligible to purchase the shares acquired in the exchange. The exchange
privileges will comply with rule 11a-3 under the Act. 



B. The CDSC 



1. Applicants expect that the CDSC applicable to Class B shares will be 1% for redemptions made during the first year
after purchase to .25% for redemptions made during the fourth year after purchase. The amount of the CDSC will be calculated
as the lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the net asset value of the shares at the time of
purchase or at the time of redemption. The CDSC schedule of any particular Fund or class thereof may vary. The sum of
any CDSC, front-end sales charge and asset based sales charge will not exceed the maximum sales charge permissible
under Article III, Section 26(d) of the NASD's Rule of Fair Practice. 

2. The CDSC will not be imposed on redemptions of shares derived from the reinvestment of distributions. No CDSC will
be imposed on an amount that represents an increase in the value of the shareholder's account resulting from capital
appreciation above the amount paid for shares purchased during the CDSC period. Furthermore, the CDSC will not be
imposed on redemptions of shares redeemed after a specified period after purchase. In determining whether a CDSC
is applicable, it will be assumed that a redemption is made first of shares representing capital appreciation, second
of shares derived from reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions, and finally, of other shares held
by the shareholder for the longest period of time. This will result in the charge, if any, being imposed at the lowest
possible rate. 

3. Applicants propose to waive or reduce the CDSC: (a) On redemptions following the death or disability, as defined
in section 72(m)(7) of the Code, of a shareholder, if redemption is made within one year of death or disability of a shareholder,
as relevant; (b) in connection with certain distributions from an Individual Retirement Account (``IRA''), or other
qualified retirement plan; (c) in connection with redemptions of shares purchased by active or retired officers,
directors or trustees, partners and employees of the Funds, the Underwriter or affiliated companies, by members
of the immediate families of such persons, by dealers having a sales agreement with the Underwriter, by any state,
country or city, or any instrumentality, department, authority or agency thereof and by trust companies and bank
trust departments which are holding shares in a fiduciary capacity; (d) in connection with redemptions of shares
purchased by beneficiaries of Aetna Life, disability and health insurance policies; (e) in connection with redemptions
of shares made pursuant to a shareholder's participation in any systematic withdrawal plan adopted by a Fund; (f)
for a shareholder with an account of $1 million or more; (g) in connection with redemptions effected by advisory accounts
managed by the Adviser; and (h) involuntary redemptions. 
4. If the Funds waiver or reduce the CDSC, such waiver or reduction will be applied uniformly to all offerees in the specified
class. The Funds may provide a 

pro rata 

credit, to be paid by the distributor, for any CDSC paid in connection with a redemption of shares followed by a reinvestment
effected within 365 days, or shorter, of the redemption.

Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act, that would exempt the Funds from sections 18(f)(1),
18(g) and 18(i) of the Act to permit the issuance of an unlimited number of classes. Applicants believe that the multi-class
distribution system does not raise any of the concerns that prompted the adoption of section 18 (

i.e.,

 underfunded debt, preference stocks, and convertible securities). The proposal does not involve borrowings and
does not affect the Fund's existing assets or reserves. In addition, the proposed arrangement will not increase the
speculative character of the shares of the Funds.
2. Applicants also request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of
the Act, and rule 22c-1 thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit the Funds to assess, waive, reduce or defer
a CDSC with respect to certain redemptions of shares. The applicants believe that the imposition of the CDSC on a class
of shares is fair and in the best interests of their shareholders, because the shares would have the advantage of greater
investment dollars working for them from the time of their purchase of such shares of the Funds than if a sales load were
imposed at the time of purchase.


Applicants' Conditions


Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:
1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund, and be identical in
all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the classes of shares of the Fund will relate solely
to: (a) Different expenses which the board of directors of a Fund determines to allocate to a specific class (``class
specific expenses''), which are limited to: (i) Transfer agent fees; (ii) printing and postage expenses related
to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses and proxies to current shareholders
of a specific class; (iii) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) SEC registration fees incurred
by a class of shares; (v) the expense of administrative personnel and services required to support the shareholders
of a specific class; (vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to one class of shares; and (vii) directors;
fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; (viii) other expenses that are subsequently identified
and determined to be properly allocated to a particular class of shares which shall be approved by the SEC pursuant
to an amended order; (b) expenses assessed to a class pursuant to a 12b-1 plan and shareholder services plan (c)
the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect to a Fund's rule 12b-1 distribution plan, except
as provided in condition 7 below; (d) the different exchange privileges of each class of shares; (e) the fact that only
certain classes may have a conversion feature; and (f) the designation of each class of shares of a Fund.
2. The directors of the Company, including a majority of the independent directors, shall have approved the multi-class
distribution system, prior to the implementation of the multi-class distribution system. The minutes of the meetings
of the directors of the Company regarding the deliberations of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary
to implement the multi-class distribution system will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the proposed
multi-class distribution system is in the best interests of both the Funds and their respective shareholders.
3. The initial determination of the class-specific expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class
of a Fund and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the directors of the affected
Fund, including a majority of the independent directors. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition
of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet class-specific expenses shall provide to the directors, and the directors
shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purpose for which the expenditures
were made.
4. The shareholder services plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b-1
(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b-1, except that shareholders
need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b-1.
5. On an ongoing basis, the directors of the Company, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and
otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts between or among the interests of the
classes of shares offered. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action
as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Underwriter will
be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the Adviser
and the Underwriter at their own costs will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered
management investment company.
6. Any class of shares (``Purchase Class'') with a conversion feature will convert into another class of shares (``Target
Class'') on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load,
fee, or other charge. After conversion, the Target Class shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or
service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that
in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the
conversion.

7. If a Fund implements any amendment to its rule 12b-1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b-1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by the Target Class shares under the plan, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target
Class unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. If the Purchase
Class shareholders fail to approve the proposal, the directors shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that
existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical
in all material respects to Target Class as it existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than the date
such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class. If deemed advisable by the directors to implement
the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase
Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects except that New Purchase Class will
convert into New Target Class. New Target Class or New Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief.
Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the directors reasonably
believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 5, any additional cost associated with
the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class or New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the Adviser
and the Underwriter. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target
Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and
the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement.
8. The directors of the Company will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder
servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to
time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of
shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to
the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the directors to justify any fee attributable to
that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and
approval of the independent directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.
9. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that fee payments made under
12b-1 plans relating to each respective class of shares, will be borne exclusively by that class and except that
any other class-specific expenses, including transfer agency fees relating to a particular class will be borne exclusively
by such class.
10. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes
and the proper allocation of expenses between the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Independent Examiner'')
who has rendered a report to the applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, stating that such methodology
and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner.
On an ongoing basis, the Independent Examiner, or an appropriate substitute Independent Examiner, will monitor
the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least
annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Independent
Examiner shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of
the Act. The work papers of the Independent Examiner with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds which
the Funds agree to make, will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written request for such work papers
by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the Commission, limited to the
Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director and any
Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Independent Examiner
is a ``Special Purpose'' report on the ``Design of a System'' as defined and described in SAS No. 44 of the AICPA, and
the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness''
as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards
as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.
11. The applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures
for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes of shares and the proper allocation
of expenses between such classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Independent Examiner
in the initial report referred to in condition (10) above and will be concurred with by the Independent Examiner, or
an appropriate substitute Independent Examiner, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred
to in condition (10) above. Applicants will take immediate corrective action if this representation is not concurred
in by the Independent Examiner, or appropriate substitute Independent Examiner.
12. The prospectuses of the Funds will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled
to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different levels of compensation for selling
one particular class of shares over another in a Fund.

13. The Underwriter will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular
investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to such standards.
Such compliance standards will require that all investors eligible to purchase Institutional Class shares be sold
only Institutional Class shares, rather than any other class of shares offered by the Funds.
14. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the directors
of the Funds with respect to the multi-class distribution system will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished
to the directors.
15. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares, other than the Institutional
Class, in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. The
Institutional Class will be offered solely pursuant to a separate prospectus. The prospectus for the Institutional
Class will disclose the existence of the Fund's other classes, and the prospectus for the Fund's other classes will
disclose the existence of the Institutional Class and will identify the persons eligible to purchase shares of such
class. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in
every shareholder report. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement
of operations, information related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share
data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to the classes of shares of such fund. To the extent
any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares
(other than the Institutional Class), it will disclose the expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes
of shares. Advertising materials reflecting the expenses and performance data for the Institutional Class will
be available only to investors eligible to invest in shares of the Institutional Class. The information provided
by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset values and public offering
prices will present each class of shares separately (other than the Institutional Class).
16. The applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by the application will not imply SEC
approval, authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to
its rule 12b-1 plans or shareholder services plans in reliance on the exemptive order.
17. The applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act, Investment Company
Act Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Intermarket Clearing Corporation; Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of
a Proposed Rule Change Relating to Rules Regarding Insider Trading Prohibitions</DOCTITLE>


March 17, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on January 25, 1994, The Intermarket Clearing Corporation (``ICC'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been primarily prepared by ICC. On February 25, 1994, ICC submitted an amendment to conform the proposed
rule change to comments received by ICC from the staff of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'').
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend ICC's Rules prohibiting insider trading to conform with recent
amendments to Regulation 1.59
 of the CFTC.




II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, ICC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. ICC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


The proposed rule change will amend ICC's Rules prohibiting the misuse of material, nonpublic information to conform
with recent amendments to CFTC Regulation 1.59. In general, conforming amendments to ICC's Rules are necessary because
Regulation 1.59, as amended: (1) Changes certain of the definitions that are effective for purposes of the insider
trading rules of self-regulatory organizations (``SROs''); and (2) requires SROs to adopt and maintain rules prohibiting
trading in commodity interests traded on or cleared by linked exchanges of such SROs. In addition, amendments to ICC's
Rules are necessary to ensure the conformity of references to the term ``non-public.''
Conforming references to the term ``non-public'' have been made throughout Rule 222 and reference is made in Rule
222 to the Interpretations and Policies following Rule 222. In addition, the scope of ICC's insider trading prohibition
is extended to reach any commodity interest traded on or cleared by any linked exchange of ICC.
 At present, there are no commodity interests that are traded on or cleared by any linked exchange of ICC. The definitions
of the terms ``linked exchange,'' ``material information,'' ``non-public information,'' and ``related commodity
interest'' have been amended in Interpretations and Policies .01 of Rule 222 to conform with amendments to CFTC Regulation
1.59. 




ICC believes the proposed amendments are consistent with the requirements of section 17A(b)(3)(F)
 of the Act in that the amendments will protect investors and the public interest by extending the reach of ICC's prohibitions
on the misuse of material, non-public information.




B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


ICC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


Comments concerning the proposed rule change were not and are not intended to be solicited in connection with the proposed
rule change, and none have been received by ICC.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)(i)
 of the Act and pursuant to Rule 19b-4(e)(1)
 in that it affects the interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration, and enforcement of ICC's existing
rules relating to insider trading prohibitions At any time within sixty days of the filing of such proposed rule change,
the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary
or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes
of the Act.





IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of ICC. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-ICC-94-02
and should be submitted by April 15, 1994.



For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under section 6(c) of the Act to amend prior orders that granted exemptive relief from sections 2(a)(32),
2(a)(35), 18(f), 18(g), 18(i), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c-1 thereunder.



<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order under section 6(c) of the Act amending certain prior orders so that the Funds may issue an unlimited
number of classes of shares, impose a contingent deferred sales charges (``CDSC'') on certain redemptions of shares,
and waive the CDSC in certain instances.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.


Applicants' Representations


1. Each of the existing Funds is organized as an open-end management investment company registered under the Act and
has entered into an investment advisory agreement with one of the Advisers. Each existing Fund has entered into a distribution
agreement with MLFD under which MLFD is principal underwriter for the Fund. Each future Fund will be organized as an
open-end management investment company registered under the Act, will enter into an investment advisory agreement
with one of the Advisers, and will enter into a distribution agreement with a Distributor. MLAM, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., and FAMI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MLAM, are both registered investment advisers
under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Advisers Act''). MLAM (Suisse) and MLAM U.K. also are registered
investment advisers under the Advisers Act.
 MLAM (Suisse) is subsidiary of Merrill Lynch Bank (Suisse), S.A. which is, in turn, an indirect subsidiary of Merrill
Lynch & Co., Inc., MLAM's parent. MLAM U.K. also is an indirect subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. MLFD,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of MLAM, is a registered broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.




2. Applicants received an order pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act granting an exemption from sections 2(a)(32),
2(a)(35), 18(f), 18(g), 18(i), 22(c), and 22(d) and rule 22c-1 thereunder permitting the Funds to implement
a new method of offering their shares to the public (the ``Original Order'').
 In 1991, certain of the parties to the Original Order received an order under section 6(c) to permit the payment to the
Distributor of an account maintenance fee at a maximum annual rate of 0.25% of the average daily net asset value of the
Class A shares pursuant to a plan adopted in accordance with rule 12b-1 (a ``12b-1 Plan'').
 In 1992, the Original Order was amended to delete a condition requiring the Directors/Trustees of the Funds to purchase
an equal number of Class A shares and Class B shares.
 The three previous orders are referred to collectively herein as the ``Existing Orders,'' and the relief granted
by the Existing Orders is referred to as the ``Dual Distribution System.''

3. Under the Dual Distribution System, the Funds currently may offer two classes of shares: (a) Class A shares that
are subject to a conventional front-end sales load and a rule 12b-1 fee, and (b) Class B shares that are subject
to a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') and a rule 12b-1 fee. The Funds also may waive the CDSC with respect
to certain redemptions of Class B shares.

4. The Existing Orders were granted pursuant to a number of representations and are subject to a number of conditions.
Applicants believe that certain of these representations and conditions unnecessarily restrict the operation
of the Dual Distribution System. The Existing Orders also prevent the Funds from issuing other classes of shares.
Applicants seek an exemptive order to permit them the flexibility to create new classes of shares and implement new
types of sales charge and shareholder servicing arrangements.

5. Applicants propose to establish a multiple distribution and shareholder servicing arrangement (the ``Multi-Class
System''). Under the Multi-Class System, each Fund would have the flexibility to from time to time create one or more
additional classes of shares the terms of which may differ as described in the conditions below. In addition, applicants
may offer an automatic conversion feature as described below.

6. Applicants also may enter into shareholder servicing plans with various organizations. Shareholder servicing
plans are used to compensate certain organizations for providing support services to their customers. Such services
typically would include aggregating and processing purchase and redemptions requests from a service organization's
customers, placing net purchase and redemption orders with the Funds' Distributor, processing dividend payments
on behalf of customers, periodically providing information to customers showing their share positions, and other
similar services. Although none of the Funds currently has a shareholder servicing plan, applicants are seeking
the broadest relief presently permitted so they will have the flexibility to respond to different market opportunities.

7. Applicants also seek relief to offer an automatic conversion feature. Applicants propose that one or more classes
of shares in a Fund (the ``Higher Fee Class'') (

e.g., 

a class of shares paying a rule 12b-1 fee or a non-rule 12b-1 shareholder servicing fee which is greater
than that applicable to another class of shares in the same Fund) may automatically convert to shares of another class
(the ``Lower Fee Class'') without the imposition of any additional sales charges after a certain period of time. Thereafter,
Higher Fee Class shares will be subject to the lower continuing fees, if any, applicable to Lower Fee Class shares.

8. Each time any shares convert into shares of another class, a pro rata portion of the shares purchased through the
reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid in respect of Higher Fee Class shares in the shareholder's
account also would convert into shares of the other class. The portion would be determined by the ratio that the shareholder's
shares converting into shares of the other class (excluding shares acquired through dividends and distributions)
bears to the shareholder's total shares possessing this conversion feature and not acquired through dividends and
distributions.

9. In one circumstance, it may be impossible for applicants to determine the period of time individual beneficial
owners of Higher Continuing Fee Class shares have held such shares because of intermediary retirement plan record
holders. Accordingly, applicants request the ability to treat Higher Continuing Fee Class shares that are Class
B shares purchased by certain retirement plans (the ``Retirement Plans'') as described below.

10. Funds cannot keep track of the holding periods of Class B shares held by third parties in accounts on behalf of their
individual plan participants. While a Fund's transfer agent keeps records indicating each purchase and sale transaction
effected by the plan sponsor, such data does not correlate with purchase and sale transactions effected for the benefit
of the individual plan participants. Therefore, a Fund is unable to determine the period of time an underlying beneficial
shareholder has held Class B shares for purposes of determining when an automatic conversion would occur. Furthermore,
the third party plan sponsors might not have such historical records readily accessible to be able to determine holding
periods.

11. The result is that even if a Fund followed its transfer agent's records in deciding when to convert Class B shares
held of record by Retirement Plans, some plan sponsors would be unable to allocate fairly such Lower Continuing Fee
Class Shares among the underlying accounts because there is no necessary correlation between the purchase and sale
of Class B shares at the plan level and the placing of transaction orders by the plan sponsor with the Fund.

12. Applicants will treat Class B shares owned by Retirement Plans separately for purposes of the conversion feature.
A Retirement Plan may own Class B shares in several Funds. Applicants propose that in the month in which the first share
purchased by a particular Retirement Plan has been held for the period required for conversion, all Class B shares
of all Funds held in that Retirement Plan simultaneously will be exchanged for Lower Continuing Fee Class Shares of
the appropriate Funds. The conversion period for Retirement Plans will be set at a uniform period disclosed in each
Fund's Prospectus or Statement of Additional Information and will be no longer than the maximum period applicable
to Class B shares in the Funds held by shareholders who are not Retirement Plans.

13. Applicants' modified method of conversion for Retirement Plans will apply only to shares that are outstanding
before the conversion of all Class B shares of all Funds held by a Retirement Plan. After such conversion, applicants
will not sell shares having a conversion feature to Retirement Plans unless the Fund or the Retirement Plan has adequate
record keeping systems in place to account for the length of time participants in a Retirement Plan have held their
shares. Thus, if Class B shares are sold to a Retirement Plan after the initial conversion, they will convert into Lower
Continuing Fee Class Shares in the same manner as shares held by all other Class B shareholders.

14. For administrative efficiency and to reduce a Fund's recordkeeping expenses, if after Higher Continuing Fee
Class shares would convert into Lower Continuing Fee Class shares a shareholder would still own a 

de minimis 

number of Higher Continuing Fee Class shares of a Fund, those remaining shares will simultaneously be exchanged for
Lower Continuing Fee Class shares when the other shares are so converted. A 

de minimis 

level (expressed either as a dollar amount or a number of shares) will be established for each Fund, will be uniformly
applied to all shareholders and will be disclosed in the Fund's prospectus. All accounts falling below the 

de minimis 

level will be converted.

15. The Funds will obtain opinions of counsel or rulings of the Internal Revenue Service that the conversion of shares
does not constitute a taxable event under current federal income tax law. The conversion of shares may be suspended
if an opinion of counsel or ruling with respect to the taxability of conversion is no longer available at the time of
such conversion. If conversion is suspended, higher Fee Class shares might continue to be subject to the higher rule
12b-1 or non-rule 12b-1 shareholder servicing fees for an indefinite period.

16. Before the creation of any new class of shares and once the characteristics of such proposed class have been decided,
the Expert (as defined in condition 6), or a suitable substitute Expert, will review the methodologies and control
procedures used with respect to the net asset values and dividends and distribution determinations for such new class
of shares.

17. The Funds' CDSC arrangements (including any waivers) will be identical to those described in the Existing Orders
except that instead of being limited to only Class B shares in a Fund, such CDSC arrangements may apply to more than one
class of shares in the same Fund.






18. Applicants will comply with Article III, Section 26 of the Rules of the Fair Practice of the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. in determining the maximum limitation on sales charges that may be imposed.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



Applicants believe that the granting of the relief requested will let applicants respond to competition from others
and changing customer demands while relieving the SEC and its staff of the burden of repeatedly reviewing requests
for greater flexibility in administering the Funds' distribution and shareholder servicing arrangements. Applicants
believe that the relief requested is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors
and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.



Applicants' Conditions



Applicants request an order of the SEC pursuant to section 6(c) amending the Existing Orders so that the conditions
thereto read in their entirety as follows:

1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all
respects, except as set forth below. Any differences among the terms of the various classes of shares of the same Fund
will relate solely to: (a) The impact of different 12b-1 Plan payments and non-rule 12b-1 shareholder
servicing plan payments made by a particular class of shares (and any other costs relating to the implementation of
a 12b-1 Plan or non-rule 12b-1 shareholder servicing plans) which will be borne solely by shareholders
of such class, shareholder servicing costs attributable solely to a particular class, and any incremental expenses
subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to one class which shall be approved by the SEC pursuant
to an amendment order, (b) voting rights on matters that pertain to 12b-1 Plans, or if presented to shareholders,
voting rights on matters that pertain to non-rule 12b-1 shareholder servicing plans, (c) redemption fees,
(d) exchange privileges, (e) the designation of each class of shares of a Fund, and (f) an automatic conversion feature
pursuant to which shares of one class automatically would convert into shares of another class after a period of time.

2. The Directors/Trustees of each of the Funds, including a majority of the independent Directors/Trustees, shall
have approved the Multi-Class System, including the conversion feature, prior to the implementation of the Multi-Class
System by a particular Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the Directors/Trustees of each of the Funds regarding the
deliberations of the Directors/Trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multi-Class System,
including the conversion feature, will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the proposed Multi-Class
System is in the best interests of both the Funds and their respective shareholders.

3. On an ongoing basis, the Directors/Trustees of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under
the Act and otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the
various classes of shares. The Directors/Trustees, including a majority of the independent Directors/Trustees,
shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Advisers and
the Distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the Directors/Trustees.
If a conflict arises, the Advisers and the Distributor at their own costs will remedy such conflict up to and including
establishing a new registered management investment company.

4. The Directors/Trustees of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and
non-rule 12b-1 shareholder servicing plan expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1,
as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only distribution or servicing expenditures properly attributable
to the sale or servicing of one class of shares will be used to support the rule 12b-1 fee or servicing fee charged
to shareholders of such class of shares. Expenditures not related to the sales or servicing of a specific class of shares
will not be presented to the Directors/Trustees to support rule 12b-1 fees or service fees charged to shareholders
of such class of shares. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the
review and approval of the independent Directors/Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.
5. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that costs and distributions
fees associated with any 12b-1 Plan or shareholder servicing plan relating to a particular class will be borne
exclusively by such class and except that any incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly
allocated to such class which shall be approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order will be borne exclusively by
such class.
6. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of certain classes
and the proper allocation of income and expenses between those classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'').
The Expert has rendered a report to applicants (which has been provided to the staff of the SEC) stating that such methodology
and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner.
On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations
and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that
the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic
reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect
to such reports, following request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make, will be available for inspection by the
SEC staff upon the written request for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management
or of a Regional Office of the SEC, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief
Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators.
The initial report of the Expert is a ``Special Purpose'' report on the ``Design of a System'' as defined and described
in SAS No. 44 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''), and the ongoing reports will
be ``Reports on Policies and Procedures Placed in Operation and Tests of Operating Effectiveness'' as defined and
described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be
adopted by the AICPA from time to time.
7. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset value and dividends/distributions among the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of
income and expenses among such classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the
initial report referred to in Condition 6 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute
Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in Condition 6 above. Applicants agree
to take immediate corrective action if the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur in the ongoing
reports.
8. The prospectuses of the Funds will contain a statement to the effect that a financial consultant and any other person
entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect
to one particular sales arrangement for a class of shares over another arrangement for a class of shares in the Fund.

9. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated will adopt compliance standards as to when shares of a particular
class may appropriately be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the
Funds to agree to conform to these standards.

10. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the Directors/Trustees
of the Funds with respect to the Multi-Class System will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the Directors/Trustees
as part of the materials setting forth the duties and responsibilities of the Directors/Trustees.

11. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, service fees,
sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus,
regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. The shareholder reports of such
Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to each class of shares in every shareholder
report. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations,
information related to the Fund as a whole generally. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per
class basis with respect to the classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature
describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will disclose the respective expenses
and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares. If applicants provide information for publication
in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset values and public offering prices, information for classes
of shares will be provided separately.

12. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply SEC
approval, authorization or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to 12b-1
Plans or shareholder servicing plans in reliance on the exemptive order.

13. Any automatic conversion of shares of one class into shares of another class will occur on the basis of the relative
net asset values of the shares of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After
conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms
are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower
than the asset-based sales charge and service fee in the aggregate to which they were subject prior to the conversion.

14. If a Fund implements any amendment to its 12b-1 Plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b-1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by a class of shares subject to the plan (``Subject Shares''), existing shares of another class that would
otherwise convert into Subject Shares (``Converting Shares'') will stop converting into Subject Shares unless
the holders of the Converting Shares, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The Directors/Trustees
of the Funds shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Converting Shares are exchanged or converted
into a new class of shares (``New Subject Shares''), identical in all material respects to Subject Shares as they existed
prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Subject
Shares if such holders of Converting Shares do not approve such proposal and such proposal is approved by the holders
of the Subject Shares and such material increase occurs. If deemed advisable by the Directors/Trustees of the Funds
to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Converting Shares for a new class
(``New Converting Shares''), identical to existing Converting Shares in all material respects except that New Converting
Shares will convert into New Subject Shares. New Subject Shares or New Converting Shares may be formed without further
exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the Directors/Trustees
of the Funds reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 3, any additional
cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Subject Shares or New Converting Shares shall be
borne solely by the Advisers and the Distributor. Converting Shares sold after the implementation of the proposal
may convert into Subject Shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the
Subject Shares plan and the relationship of such plan to the Converting Shares are disclosed in an effective registration
statement.

15. In the case of Funds adopting shareholder servicing plans, such plans will be adopted and operated in accordance
with the procedures set forth in rule 12b-1 (b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject
to rule 12b-1, except that shareholders will not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b-1.

16. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act (Investment Company Act
Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988)), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended.

University Cogeneration, Inc., (31-904)


University Cogeneration, Inc. (``University'') 4464 Alvarado Canyon Road, San Diego, California 92120, has filed
an application for an order declaring it not to be an electric utility company under section 2(a)(3) of the Act.
University is a California corporation and is primarily engaged in the business of designing, developing, owning,
operating and maintaining, either directly or indirectly, industrial energy projects that are qualifying facilities
(``QFs'') as defined by the Public Utility Policies Act of 1978. University wholly owns the Chula Vista Cogeneration
Project (``Project'') located at Rohr Industries in Chula Vista, California. In addition to owning the Project,
University serves as general partner in two California limited partnerships, each of which owns a QF in California.
The Project is a 9 megawatt, combined-cycle, gas-fired facility and is currently operated as a QF. Rohr Industries
(``Rohr'') serves as the steam host for the Project and purchases approximately 90% of the electric output from the
Project. The remainder of the output is sold to the San Diego Gas & Electric Company. It is stated that gross annual
sales from the Project were $4,031,852 in 1991, were $3,571,584 in 1992, and will be approximately $2,891,000 in 1993.
University states that Rohr, the steam host for the Project, has recently decreased its steam requirements, thereby
placing the Project's QF status at risk.

Monongahela Power Company, et al. (70-6179)



Monongahela Power Company (``Monongahela''), 1310 Fairmont Avenue, Fairmont, West Virginia 26554, The Potomac
Edison Company (``Potomac Edison''), 10345 Downsville Pike, Hagerstown, Maryland, and West Penn Power Company
(``West Penn''), 800 Cabin Hill Drive, Greenburg, Pennsylvania 15601 (collectively, ``Companies''), all wholly
owned public-utility subsidiary companies of Allegheny Power System Inc., a registered holding company, have filed
a post-effective amendment to their declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10 and 12(c) of the Act and Rule 50(a)(5)
thereunder. 

The County Commission of Pleasants County, West Virginia (``County Commission''), is planning to issue three new
series of pollution control revenue bonds in the aggregate principal amount of not more than $77.5 million and maturing
no later than 2020 (``Series C Bonds''). The proceeds from the Series C Bonds will be used to refund the County Commission's
Series B Pollution Control Revenue Bonds currently outstanding as follows: (i) $11.5 million principal amount of
Pollution Control Revenue Bond 6.95% (West Penn Power Company Pleasants Power Station Project), 1978 Series B, maturing
August 1, 2003; (ii) $20 million principal amount of Pollution Control Revenue Bonds 7.00% (West Penn Power Company
Pleasants Power Station Project), 1978 Series B, maturing August 1, 2008; (iii) $21 million principal amount of Pollution
Control Revenue Bonds 7.30% (The Potomac Edison Company Pleasants Power Station Project), 1978 Series B, maturing
August 1, 2008; and (iv) $25 million principal amount of Pollution Control Revenue Bonds 7.75% (Monongahela Power
Company Pleasants Power Station Project), 1979 Series B, maturing August 1, 2009 (collectively, ``Series B Bonds'').
The Series B Bonds were used to provide additional money for the installation of pollution control equipment and facilities
(``Facilities'') at Pleasants Power Station in Pleasants County, West Virginia.

The Series C Bonds will be issued under a supplemental trust indenture with a corporate trustee, approved by the Companies,
and will be sold at such time, at such interest rate and for such price as shall be approved by the Companies. However,
the interest rate for each series of Series C Bonds will not exceed the interest rate of the corresponding series of
Series B Bonds presently outstanding. Additionally, the Companies state that they will not enter into the proposed
refunding transaction unless the estimated present value savings derived from the net difference between interest
payments on the new issues of comparable securities and on the securities to be refunded is, on an after tax basis, greater
than the present value of all redemption and issuing costs, assuming an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate
used shall be the estimated after tax interest rate on the Series C Bonds to be issued.

Concurrently with the issuance of the Series C Bonds, the Companies propose to issue, through December 31, 1995, non-negotiable
promissory notes (``Pollution Control Notes'') corresponding to the Series C Bonds in respect of the principal amount,
interest rates and redemption provisions (which may include a special right of the holder to require the redemption
or repurchase of the holder of the Series C Bond at stated intervals) and having installments of principal corresponding
to any mandatory sinking fund payments and stated maturities. The Pollution Control Notes will be substituted for
and replace the promissory notes presently outstanding. The outstanding notes will be cancelled.

The Pollution Control Notes will be secured by a second lien on the Facilities and certain other properties, pursuant
to the Deed of Trust and Security Agreement dated November 1, 1977, as supplemented by a First Supplement thereto dated
August 1, 1978 as to West Penn and Potomac Edison and a First Supplemental thereto dated February 1, 1979 as to Monongahela
(``Deed''). The security interest in the Facilities and certain other property conveyed by the Deed is subject to
the lien securing each Company's first mortgage bonds. 

Payments on the Pollution Control Notes will be made to the Trustee under supplements to the existing indentures and
shall be applied by the Trustee to pay the maturing principal and redemption price of and interest and other costs on
the Series C Bonds as the same become due. Each Company also proposes to pay any trustees' fees and expenses incurred
by the County Commission. The Companies request an exception from the competitive bidding requirements of rule 50
under subsection (a)(5) thereof in connection with the issuance of the Pollution Control Notes.

The Series C Bonds may be in either coupon or registered form and will bear interest semi-annually at rates to be determined.
The Series C Bonds will be issued pursuant to supplemental indentures which provide for redemption, no-call and other
appropriate provisions to be determined. The supplemental indentures will also provide that substantially all
the proceeds of the sale of the Series C Bonds by the County Commission must be applied to the cost of the Facilities,
including the cost refunding the Series B Bonds. The Series C Bonds will be secured by the Pollution Control Notes and
will be supported by various covenants of each Company contained in the original Pollution Control Financing Agreement
dated as of November 1, 1977.


Northeast Utilities, et al. (70-8062)


Northeast Utilities (``Northeast''), 174 Brush Hill Ave., West Springfield, Massachusetts 01089, a registered
holding company, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Charter Oak Energy, Inc. (``Charter Oak'') and COE Development
Corporation (``COE Development'') (collectively, ``Applicants''), each located at 107 Selden Street, Berlin,
Connecticut, 06037-1616, have filed a further post-effective amendment under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10,
12(b), 13(b), 32, and 33 of the Act and rules 45, 53, 87, 90, and 91 thereunder to their application-declaration filed
under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b), and 13(b) of the Act and rules 45, 87, 90, and 91 thereunder.
By order dated January 24, 1994 (HCAR. 25977) (``January 1994 Order'') Charter Oak and COE Development were authorized
to engage in preliminary development activities and make investments in and finance the acquisition of exempt wholesale
generators (``EWGs'') and foreign utility companies (``FUCOs'') in the amount of $100 million through December
30, 1994. The January 1994 Order also authorized the Applicants to issue guarantees and assume the liabilities of
subsidiary companies for preliminary development activities.
The Applicants now propose to issue guarantees and assume the liabilities of subsidiary companies for development
activities, including construction and permanent financing, and contingent liabilities subsequent to operation
with regard to those EWG and FUCO projects that do not require advance approval from the Commission for the Applicants
to acquire an interest.
The Applicants have found that on occasion such guarantees and assumptions of liability may provide them with opportunities
to participate in private power opportunities on a favorable basis without expending funds. The full contingent
amount of any guarantees or assumptions of liabilities would be counted as part of the authorized development activities
limit of $100 million authorized in the January 1994 Order.
The Applicants also propose to use Charter Oak or other system company employees within a de minimis 
'limit to render services to affiliated EWGs and FUCOs. The Applicants represent that they would not use more
than 0.5% of total holding company system employees and no more than 1% of the system service company employees at any
one time for rendering services to affiliated EWGs and FUCOs.


Consolidated Natural Gas Company (70-8107)


Consolidated Natural Gas Company (``CNG''), CNG Tower, 625 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222, a registered
holding company, has filed a declaration under sections 6 and 7 of the Act and Rule 50(a)(5) thereunder.
CNG proposes on or before June 30, 1995 to issue and sell the remaining unissued balance of up to $400 million principal
amount of debt securities (``Securities'') authorized by the Commission on April 21, 1993 (HCAR No. 25800) under
a new indenture (``Indenture''). The Securities will be sold in one or more series at a price, exclusive of accrued
interest, which will be not less than 98% nor more than 101% of the principal amount and at an interest rate which will
be a multiple of 1/8, 1/10, or 1/20 of 1%. The Securities will mature in not more than thirty years from the date of issue.
CNG proposes to issue and sell the Securities either by competitive bidding, including the alternative bidding procedures
authorized by the Commission's Statement of Policy Concerning Application of Rule 50 under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935 (HCAR No. 22623, Sept. 2, 1982) or by an exception to competitive bidding under Rule 50(a)(5). In
the event Rule 50 is rescinded, CNG requests authority to be permitted to issue and sell the Securities under competitive
bidding including the alternative procedures without prior Commission approval.
The Indenture differs from CNG's current indenture (``1971 Indenture'') in eight substantial ways: (1) Setting
of terms; (2) form of security; (3) lien restrictions; (4) sale and leaseback restrictions; (5) additional debt incurrence
limitations; (6) issue and sale of subsidiaries' stock; (7) limitation of dividends; and (8) defeasance.

The proceeds from the sale of the Securities will be added to CNG's treasury fund and subsequently used to: (1) Finance,
in part, capital expenditures of CNG and CNG's subsidiaries, (2) finance the purchase of CNG's common stock in the
open market, and/or (3) acquire, retire, or redeem securities of which CNG is an issuer without the need for prior Commission
approval pursuant to Rule 42 under the Act. 
 


New England Electric System, et al. (70-8303) 
 


New England Electric System (``NEES''), a registered holding company, and its nonutility subsidiary company, New
England Electric Resources, Inc. (``NEERI''), both located at 25 Research Drive, Westborough, Massachusetts 01582,
have filed an application-declaration under sections 9(a), 10 and 12(b) of the Act and Rule 45 thereunder. 
 
NEES states that, in early 1993, it was approached by Quality Power Systems, Inc. (``QPS'') to contribute funds for
the development of certain patented technology for a low harmonic distortion uninterruptible power system (UPS).
QPS intends to develop, manufacture and market UPS and is committed to locating its manufacturing facility for UPS
in either Massachusetts or New Hampshire within the retail electric service territory of NEES's retail electric
company subsidiaries.
 
In mid 1993, NEES made a research and development grant of $250,000 to QPS to assist in the development of UPS. In return
for this grant and to encourage the continued support, QPS and New England Power Service Company (``NEPSCO), a service
company subsidiary of NEES, entered into an agreement, under which QPS gave NEPSCO the right to receive at no cost $250,000
of QPS's convertible debentures (``Debentures''). NEPSCO has assigned this right to NEERI effective January 1,
1994. The applicants state that, upon Commission authorization to receive the debentures, all rights to receive
a product grant of two UPS per year for the first four years of commercial production would terminate. 
 
The Debentures would pay quarterly interest after June 1, 1994, at the Bank of Boston base rate plus 2% and would have
a maturity of ten years from date of issuance. The Debentures would not have sinking fund provisions nor prepayment
provisions nor general voting rights. NEERI would be allowed to have one member on the Board of Directors of QPS. The
Board would have six or seven members. 
 
NEERI requests authority to exercise its right to the Debentures on or before July 1, 1994, and if it so elects, to convert
the Debentures on or before December 31, 1995 to 9.9% of the common stock of QPS (990 shares of a total of 10,000 shares,
no par value). In addition, NEERI requests the authority to invest up to an additional $100,000 in QPS on or before December
31, 1995, in the form of subordinated loans having an interest rate no lower than the Bank of Boston base rate plus 2%
and a maturity not in excess of five years. 
 
NEERI will not be directly involved in the manufacture, marketing or selling of the UPS. However, it may offer marketing
advise and consulting services to QPS and permit its name to be used as part of marketing efforts. 
 
The $250,000 grant made to QPS is currently carried on NEES's books as an investment. NEES proposes to transfer this
amount to NEERI's books and NEERI would treat it as an investment in QPS. NEES further proposes that such capital contribution
be authorized in addition to the $1 million previously authorized by Commission order dated September 4, 1992 (HCAR
No. 25621). If NEERI invests up to an additional $100,000 in QPS, NEERI may use funds from NEES provided under its existing
$1 million authority. 
 


Metropolitan Edison Company (70-8319) 
 


Metropolitan Edison Company (``Met-Ed''), 2800 Pottsville Pike, Reading, Pennsylvania 19440, an electric public-utility
subsidiary company of General Public Utilities Corporation, a registered holding company, has filed a declaration
under sections 9(a), 10 and 12(c) of the Act and Rule 42 thereunder. 
 
Met-Ed intends to issue and sell up to $100 million aggregate stated value of one or more new series of its cumulative
preferred stock, each issue having a stated value not to exceed $100 per share (``Preferred'') under Rule 52 of the
Act. Met-Ed requests authorization to acquire or redeem through the operation of such sinking fund or optional redemption
provision up to the entire amount of the Preferred to be issued and sold. 
 
Met-Ed would acquire shares of the Preferred through sinking fund and redemption provisions. Specifically, shares
of the Preferred would be redeemable, under certain conditions, at Met-Ed's option in connection with any merger
or consolidation to which Met-Ed may be a party. Any such redemption would be at a price equal to the stated value of those
shares of the Preferred being redeemed, together with accrued dividends to the date of redemption, plus a premium
of up to 100% of the dividend rate.

<TEXT>
 

The preferred would not otherwise be redeemable at the option of Met-Ed for a period ending on a date occurring up to
15 years following the date of its issuance.
Alternatively, Met-Ed may preclude redemption at its option for a period of up to 15 years if the monies for such redemption
are obtained at an effective interest rate or dividend cost less than the dividend rate of the Preferred shares being
redeemed. After the expiration of such non-redemption or non-refunding period, as the case may be, such shares would
be redeemable at Met-Ed's option. The price paid to redeem such shares would equal the stated value thereof together
with accrued dividends to the date of redemption, plus a premium of up to 100% of the dividend rate. This price would
decline annually on a straight-line basis until arriving at the stated value thereof, and thereafter be set at the
stated value of the shares being redeemed.
In addition, certain shares of the Preferred may be subject to a sinking fund. Such a sinking fund would require that,
following the expiration of a non-redemption or non-refunding period, Met-Ed annually redeem a number of shares
of Preferred equal to between 5% and 20% of the number of shares of Preferred initially issued. The price paid to redeem
such shares of the Preferred would equal the stated value thereof, together with accrued dividends to the date of redemption.
Met-Ed may also, at its option, redeem on any such date an additional equivalent amount of Preferred (sometimes referred
to as a ``double up'' option). Met-Ed may reduce or satisfy any such sinking fund redemption requirement, in whole
or in part, by the number of shares of Preferred theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired by Met-Ed (other than
pursuant to such redemption provisions) and not previously made the basis for such reduction or satisfaction.


Pennsylvania Electric Company (70-8321)


Pennsylvania electric Company (``Penelec''), 1001 Broad Street, Johnstown, Pennsylvania 15907, an electric public-utility
subsidiary company of General Public Utilities Corporation, a registered holding company, has filed a declaration
under sections 9(a), 10 and 12(c) of the Act and Rule 42 thereunder.
Penelec intends to issue and sell up to $100 million aggregate stated value of one or more new series of its cumulative
preferred stock, each issue having a stated value not to exceed $100 per share (``Preferred'') under Rule 52 of the
Act. Penelec requests authorization to acquire or redeem through the operation of such sinking fund or optional redemption
provision up to the entire amount of the Preferred to be issued and sold.
Penelec would acquire shares of the Preferred through sinking fund and redemption provisions. Specifically, shares
of the Preferred would be redeemable, under certain conditions, at Penelec's option in connection with any merger
or consolidation to which Penelec may be a party. Any such redemption would be at a price equal to the stated value of
those shares of the Preferred being redeemed, together with accrued dividends to the date of redemption, plus a premium
of up to 100% of the dividend rate.
The Preferred would not otherwise be redeemable at the option of Penelec for a period ending on a date occurring up to
15 years following the date of its issuance.
Alternatively, Penelec may preclude redemption at its option for a period of up to 15 years if the monies for such redemption
are obtained at an effective interest rate or dividend cost less than the dividend rate of the Preferred shares being
redeemed. After the expiration of such non-redemption or non-refunding period, as the case may be, such shares would
be redeemable at Penelec's option. the price paid to redeem such shares would equal the stated value thereof together
with accrued dividends to the date of redemption, plus a premium of up to 100% of the dividend rate. This price would
decline annually on a straight-line basis until arriving at the stated value thereof, and thereafter be set at the
stated value of the shares being redeemed.
In addition, certain shares of the Preferred may be subject to a sinking fund. Such a sinking fund would require that,
following the expiration of a non-redemption or non-refunding period, Penelec annually redeem a number of shares
of Preferred equal to between 5% and 20% of the number of shares of Preferred initially issued. The price paid to redeem
such shares of the Preferred would equal the stated value thereof, together with accrued dividends to the date of redemption.
Penelec may also, at its option, redeem on any such date an additional equivalent amount of Preferred (sometimes referred
to as a ``double up'' option). Penelec may reduce or satisfy any such sinking fund redemption requirement, in whole
or in part, by the number of shares of Preferred thereto fore purchased or otherwise acquired by Penelec (other than
pursuant to such redemption provisions) and not previously made the basis for such reduction or satisfaction.

Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (70-8335)


Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (``OVEC''), P.O. Box 468, Piketon, Ohio 45661, an electric public-utility subsidiary
company of American Electric Power Company, Inc. and Allegheny Power System, Inc., both registered holding companies,
has filed an application under sections 9 and 10 of the Act.
OVEC requests authority to purchase or lease 515 railcars for approximately $22.7 million. OVEC proposes to use the
railcars to deliver coal to its associate company, Indiana-Kentucky Electric Corporation's Clifty Creek Plant.
To minimize the costs associated with the railcars, OVEC also proposes to sublease the railcars to its associate companies
and, during times of non-utilization by OVEC and its associate companies, to non-affiliates. OVEC states that it
would sublease the railcars only if the revenue generated by the sublease covered all variable costs and makes a contribution
to the fixed costs of the railcars.


Central Power and Light Company, et al. (70-8345)


Central Power and Light Company, 539 North Carancahua Street, Corpus Christi, Texas 78401, Public Service Company
of Oklahoma, 212 East 6th Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74119, Southwestern Electric Power Company, 428 Travis Street,
Shreveport, Louisiana 71156, and West Texas Utilities Company, 301 Cypress, Abilene, Texas 79601 (collectively,
``Applicants''), all electric public-utility subsidiary companies of Central and South West Corporation, a registered
holding company, have filed an application under sections 9(a)(1) and 10 of the Act.
Applicants propose to lease owned unit trains and railcars to nonaffiliates through July 1, 1999. Lease terms will
cover those periods during which the Applicants do not need the unit trains and railcars for operations, and could
range for as short a time as it takes to make one trip to ten months. Any leases will provide for lease rates at or near market
rates at the time such leases are entered into.
Applicants anticipate that leases of the owned unit trains and railcars to nonaffiliates will be a small percentage
not expected to exceed an average of 50% of available unit trains and railcars for each Applicant. Rental income received
from the leasing of unit trains and railcars will be recorded as credit to fuel stock account number 151 and will go to
offset the depreciation of railcars and unit trains which is charged to this account. Any leasing income in excess
of the amount of depreciation charged to account number 151 will be credited to rental income account number 454.


Consolidated Natural Gas Company (70-8365)


Consolidated Natural Gas Company (``CNG''), CNG Tower, 625 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222-3199,
a registered holding company, has filed a declaration under sections 6(a) and 7 of the Act and Rule 50 and 50(a)(5) thereunder.
CNG proposes to issue and sell on or before June 30, 1996 up to $400 million principal amount of debentures (``Debentures'').
The Debentures will be sold in one or more series at a price, exclusive of accrued interest, which will be not less than
98% nor more than 101% of the principal amount and at an interest rate which will be a multiple of 1/8, 1/10, or 1/20 of
1%. The Debentures will mature in not more than thirty years and will be issued in accordance with the indenture between
CNG and Chemical Bank, as Trustee, dated May 1, 1971. CNG proposes to issue and sell the Debentures either by competitive
bidding, including the alternative bidding procedures authorized by the Commission's Statement of Policy Concerning
Application of Rule 50 under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (HCAR No. 22623, September 2, 1982), or
by an exception to the competitive bidding requirements under Rule 50(a)(5) through negotiated public or private
offerings. In the event Rule 50 is rescinded as proposed by the Commission in HCAR No. 25668 (November 4, 1992), CNG
requests authority to be permitted to issue and sell Debentures under competitive bidding including the aforesaid
alternative procedures without prior Commission approval.
The proceeds from the sale of the Debentures will be added to CNG's treasury fund and subsequently used for general
corporate purpose to: (1) Finance, in part, capital expenditures of CNG and CNG's subsidiaries, (2) displace roll-over
of commercial paper previously issued for working capital purposes, (3) finance the purchase of CNG's common stock
in the open market, and/or (4) acquire, retire, or redeem securities of which CNG is an issuer without the need for prior
Commission approval pursuant to Rule 42 under the Act.

Energy Initiatives, Inc., et al. (70-8369)


Energy Initiatives, Inc. (``EII''), One Upper Pond Road, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054, a non-utility subsidiary
of General Portfolios corporation (``GPC'), and GPC, Mellon Bank Center, Tenth and market Streets, Wilmington,
Delaware 19801, a non-utility subsidiary of General Public Utilities Corporation (``GPU''), and GPU, 100 Interpace
Parkway, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054, a registered holding company, have filed an application-declaration under
Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 13(b) of the Act and Rules 45, 50, 51, 90 and 91 thereunder.
By orders dated June 26, 1990 and December 18, 1992 (HCAR Nos. 25108 and 25715, respectively), EII was authorized to
engage in preliminary project development and administrative activities in connection with its investment in qualifying
cogeneration facilities (``QF'') and small power production facilities, each as defined in the Public Utility Regulatory
Policies Act of 1978, as amended (``PURPA''), and in exempt wholesale generators (``EWG''), as defined in the Act.
EII now proposes to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock (``Stock'') of a non-affiliated, privately-held
California corporation the name of which is confidential at this time but which shall be referred to as ``Cogen Corp.''
herein. Cogen Corp. is engaged exclusively in the business of owning or leasing and operating QFs and developing other
QFs and EWGs. Cogen Corp. is the wholly-owned subsidiary of a California corporation (``Parent No. 1''), which, in
turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a publicly-held Canadian corporation (``Parent No. 2'') engaged in oil and
gas exploration, development, production and sales (collectively, ``Sellers''). Upon the acquisition by EII of
the Cogen Corp. Stock, Cogen Corp. will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of EII.
In order to purchase the Stock, EII proposes to enter into a stock purchase agreement (``Stock Purchase Agreement'')
which the Sellers under which: (i) EII would agree to purchase the Stock for a total cash consideration of $80 million,
subject to adjustment under certain circumstances described below (``Purchase Price''), and (ii) GPU or EII would
enter into one or more assumption agreements (``Assumption Agreements'') under which they would agree to assume
certain contingent obligations undertaken by Parent No. 2 with respect to three of Cogen Corp.'s projects, as described
below, and indemnify Parent No. 2 against any liabilities arising thereunder.
Upon execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement, GPU would deposit into escrow cash in an amount equal to the maximum
estimated Purchase Price (including any possible ``Deferred Consideration'' as described below) (``Escrow Cash'')
and Parent No. 1 would deposit the Stock into escrow under an escrow agreement (``Escrow Agreement'') between the
parties and an independent bank or trust company acting as escrow agent (``Escrow Agent'').
Distribution of the Escrow Cash to Sellers and the Stock to EII by the Escrow Agent (``Closing'') would be expressly
conditioned upon: (i) Receipt of a Commission order authorizing the transaction; (ii) satisfaction of the requirements
of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act; (iii) receipt of the required number of necessary third-party consents to the transaction;
and (iv) certain other specified conditions.
If the Closing conditions are not satisfied by May 15, 1994, the Purchase Price is subject to increase by $15,000 per
day (``Deferred Consideration'') for each day the Closing or the termination of the Escrow Agreement is thereafter
delayed; provided, however, that either EII or Sellers may terminate the Escrow Agreement if all such conditions
are not satisfied by August 15, 1994, in which case, the Escrow Agent will refund the Escrow Cash to GPU and return the
Stock to Parent No. 2, subject, however, to payment to Sellers of any required Deferred Consideration and a ``stipulated
damage payment,'' as described below, under certain circumstances. In addition, if the third party consents with
respect to at least three QF projects (including one of either project number 1 (``Project No. 1'') or project number
2 (``Project No. 2''), which are generally described below) are not received by May 15, 1994, the Sellers may, at their
option, terminate the Escrow Agreement, and the Escrow Agent would refund the Escrow Cash to GPU and return the Stock
to Parent No. 2 without further liability to either party.

The Stock Purchase Agreement and escrow Agreement will also provide that in the event that required third party consents
with respect to at least three QF projects (including at least one of Project No. 1 or Project No. 2) are obtained, the
Closing would occur, provided the other Closing conditions are satisfied. In such event, the Purchase Price would
be reduced, based upon an agreed upon valuation of the QF projects which would be retained by Sellers (``Unsold Projects'')
and either retained in the existing entities or transferred to a separate entity (``Unsold Project Corps.'') EII
would retain until December 31, 1994 the exclusive right to continue to seek such remaining third party consents and
purchase the related Unsold Projects or the Unsold Project Corps. stock at the initially agreed upon price. After
that date, the Escrow Agreement would be terminated with respect to the Unsold Projects, the balance of the Escrow
Cash (representing the unpaid Purchase Price relating to the Unsold Projects) would be refunded to GPU and the stock
of the Unsold Project Corps. returned to Sellers. EII would then have a non-exclusive right until December 31, 1995
to purchase the Unsold Project Corps. stock or, alternatively, its interests in any of the Unsold Projects at the initially
agreed upon price. 
In addition, as noted below, in order to comply with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (``FERC's'') 50%
limitation on electric utility ownership under PURPA, it will be necessary for EII to provide for the sale, at the Closing,
or at least a 50% ownership interest in Project No. 1 since 100% of that project is currently indirectly owned by Cogen
Corp. In the event such sale cannot be so accomplished, EII's purchase of Project No. 1 at the Closing would be effectively
limited to 50% thereof and the balance of the Project No. 1 ownership would be retained by Sellers and together with
a portion ($7 million) of the $10 million Purchase Price related thereto would continue to be held by the Escrow Agent
under the Escrow Agreement or pursuant to another arrangement agreed by the parties. EII would retain an irrevocable
option or similar right to effect the sale of such remaining 50% interest within 12 months of the signing of the Stock
Purchase Agreement. If EII is unable to do so, the Project No. 1 interest would be returned to Sellers and the related
escrowed Purchase Price amount refunded to GPU. 
Accrued interest on the Escrow Cash would be payable to GPU except to the extent the Closing is delayed due solely to
the failure to satisfy a specified closing condition, in which case such accrued interest for the period of the delay
attributable to the condition failure and until the Closing would be payable to Sellers. 
Following the execution of the Stock Purchase and escrow Agreements and pending the Closing, EII and Sellers would
jointly manage Cogen Corp's. business and operations subject to certain restrictions and limitations set forth
in the Stock Purchase Agreement. EII and Sellers would share equally in Cogen Corp's. expenses incurred from March
1, 1994 until the earlier of the Closing or the date the Escrow Agreement is otherwise terminated.

GPU and EII have agreed to pay Sellers a ``stipulated damage amount'' of up to $7 million in the event the Closing does
not occur by August 15, 1994 due to the failure of a specified condition set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement, or
$5 million if EII otherwise fails or refuses to purchase the Cogen Corp. Stock, except for certain specified reasons.

Additional authorization is being herein requested for EII to issue, sell and renew from time to time through December
31, 2004 its promissory notes (``EII Notes'') to one or more commercial banks representing borrowings in the aggregate
principal amount of up to $25 million outstanding at any one time. The proceeds of such borrowings would be used to pay
a portion of the Purchase Price, and the balance of the Purchase Price would be supplied through cash capital contributions
from GPU or GPC. The EII Notes, which would be issued pursuant to loan agreements with the bank lenders who financed
Sellers' QF projects, would mature no later than December 31, 2004 and bear interest at varying rates as provided in
the loan agreements, but in any event not in excess of: (a) 250 basis points above the lending bank's prime or base rate
as in effect from time to time, (b) 400 basis points above the specified London Interbank Offered Rate, as in effect
from time to time, or (c) a negotiated fixed rate which, in any event, would not exceed 12%. The EII Notes would be prepayable
to the extent provided therein.

It is proposed that payment of principal and interest on the EII Notes, together with EII's other obligations under
the loan agreements, be unconditionally guaranteed by GPU or secured by a pledge by GPC of the EII common stock to the
bank lenders. Alternatively, GPU may enter into a support agreement with the lending banks with respect to repayment
of the EII Notes.

Project No. 1 is a 102 MW (net) natural gas fired qualifying cogeneration facility located in Florida. Project No.
1 is owned by a Florida limited partnership in which Cogen Corp. presently holds, indirectly through wholly-owned
subsidiaries, 100% of the general and limited partnership interests. In order to comply with the ownership limitations
for qualifying cogeneration facilities pursuant to the FERC's regulations under PURPA, simultaneous with its purchase
of the Stock, EII will either: (a) Sell at the Closing not less than a 50% interest in Project No. 1 to an unaffiliated
third-party which is not an electric utility affiliate, or (b) otherwise effectively limit at the Closing its acquisition
in Project No. 1 to 50% thereof, pending such sale. (As noted above, in the latter event, EII would have 12 months from
the signing of the Stock Purchase Agreement to sell such 50% interest; absent such sale, the remaining 50% Project
No. 1 interest would be retained by Sellers and the related portion of the escrowed Purchase Price refunded to GPU.)

Project No. 1 sells its entire net capacity and energy to a Florida utility under a long-term power purchase contract
and provides steam under a long-term steam sales contract to an agricultural cooperative for food processing, packaging
and cold storage.

On August 30, 1993, after completion of construction, Project No. 1 was sold to an owner-trustee and leased back to
the Project No. 1 partnership. In the event the Project No. 1 partnership elects not to extend the lease for the 5 year
option period, rent which would otherwise have been paid during the option period, equal to approximately $7 million,
will become immediately due and payable. The obligation to pay such rent in the event the lease term is not extended
has been guaranteed (``Rent Guarantee'') by Parent No. 2
 In addition to the Rent Guarantee, in connection with the sale and lease back financing Parent No. 2 has also guaranteed
until July 1, 1995 payment of any cost incurred by it that becomes necessary to correct a defect in Project No. 1's steam
turbine foundation, up to $2 million (``Foundation Guarantee''), and the payment under certain circumstances of
certain state taxes which might be deemed payable in the future in connection with Project No. 1's construction financing
(``Tax Guarantee''). In connection with EII's acquisition of the Stock, GPU and EII will enter into an Assumption
Agreement under which they would assume Parent No. 2's obligations under the Rent Guarantee, the Foundation Guarantee,
and the Tax Guarantee (as well as the Repurchase Guarantee and the Catalyst Guarantee described below) and would agree
to indemnify Parent No. 2 against any liabilities arising thereunder.

Except with respect to obligations which may arise under the Rent Guarantee, the Foundation Guarantee and the Tax
Guarantee, Project No. 1 partnership obligations under the lease and all other Project No. 1 partnership obligations
are non-recourse to Cogen Corp.

Project No. 2 is a 102 MW (net) natural gas fired qualifying cogeneration facility located in Florida. Project No.
2 is owned by a Florida limited partnership in which Cogen Corp. holds, indirectly through wholly-owned subsidiaries,
50% of the general and limited partnership interests and of which Cogen Corp. is the managing general partner. The
other 50% of the general and limited partnership interests are held, indirectly through wholly-owned subsidiaries,
by an unaffiliated privately-held diversified industrial corporation (``Investor 2'') which, among other businesses,
is engaged in natural gas supply and transportation. Investor 2, through subsidiary companies, provides a portion
of project No. 2's gas transportation services and peaking gas requirements and is project No. 2's steam host.

Project No. 2 sells its entire net capacity and energy to a Florida electric utility under a long-term power purchase
contract and provides steam to a subsidiary of Investor 2 for citrus processing under a long-term steam sales agreement.

Project number 3 (``Project No. 3'') is an 80 MW (net) natural gas fired QF located in New York. Project No. 3 is owned
by a Delaware limited partnership in which Cogen Corp. holds, indirectly through wholly-owned subsidiaries, approximately
33% of the general and limited partnership interests and of which Cogen Corp. is the managing general partner. The
balance of the partnership interests is held by an institutional insurance company, the operations and maintenance
contractor and an unaffiliated energy project developer.

Project No. 3 sells its entire net capacity and energy to a New York utility under a long-term power purchase agreement
and sells steam to an adjacent educational institution primarily for space heating under a long-term steam sales
contract.

Project number 4 (``Project No. 4'') is a 29.4 MW (net) QF located in Michigan. Project No. 4 is owned by a Michigan limited
partnership in which Cogen Corp. holds indirectly through a wholly-owned subsidiary, a 1% general partnership interest
and of which Cogen Corp. is the managing general partner. The balance of the partnership interests is held indirectly
by the local gas distribution company (`Investor 4'') which, through a separate subsidiary, is Project No. 4's gas
supplier. Cogen Corp. also leases the project site from Project No. 4's steam host and, through a subsidiary, subleases
the site to the partnership, for which it receives sublease payments from the Partnership under a sublease. Project
No. 4 sells its entire net capacity and energy to a Michigan utility and sells steam for process use to an industrial
corporation under a long-term steam sales contract.

Project Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 are operated and maintained under a contract with an unaffiliated operations and maintenance
contractors.

Project number 5 (``Project No. 5'') is a 26 MW (net) qualifying cogeneration facility located in California. Project
No. 5 is owned by a California limited partnership in which Cogen Corp. holds, indirectly through wholly-owned subsidiaries,
a 30% interest in the partnership as a general partner. The balance of the partnership interests is held by an unaffiliated
energy project developer and the financing subsidiary of a large industrial corporation.

Project No. 5 provides all of the electric energy required by its steam host, up to 4 MW, and sells the balance of its net
capacity and energy to a California utility under a long-term power purchase agreement. The steam host is an industrial
corporation which purchases steam under a long-term steam sales contract for use in certain manufacturing processes.


Project No. 5 is operated and maintained under a long-term contract with one of the partnership's general partners
which is not affiliated with Cogen Corp. 

Applicants state that Cogen Corp. also has other projects under active development (``Development Projects''),
principally: (i) A 28.5 MW gas-fired QF located in New York for which a power purchase contract with a New York electric
and gas utility has been executed and a steam sales agreement is being negotiated; and (ii) a number of other natural
gas-fired QFs or EWGs, totalling approximately 275 MW, with respect to which proposals to supply electric power have
been submitted in response to utility requests for proposals. The Applicants further state that EII will fund any
preliminary project development costs with respect to the Development Projects either through internally generated
funds or pursuant to further Commission authorization. 

Applicants also request an exception from the requirements of Section 13 of the Act so that EII, either directly or
indirectly through Cogen Corp. and/or its affiliated subsidiaries and partnerships, may provide project management,
administrative and similar services as managing general partner of the projects from time to time and to sublease
the Project No. 4 site to the Project No. 4 partnership in the manner and under such terms and conditions, including
with respect to the fees payable by each project partnership for such services, as may be provided in the related project
partnership agreements and Project No. 4 sublease. 

Moreover, the Applicants state that the amount of such management fees and sublease payments payable to EII by each
project partnership will in no way effect the rates to be paid for each project's energy and capacity by the purchasing
electric utility and thus by the utility's ratepayers, since those rates have been established based upon the purchasing
utility's ``avoided costs'' of obtaining energy and capacity which costs are unrelated to each project partnership's
operating expenses. Accordingly, GPU and EII believe that it is not necessary or appropriate for the protection of
investors or consumers that such management services or sublease arrangements be performed at cost. 

It is stated that each QF project (namely, Project No. 1, Project No. 2, Project No. 3, Project No. 4 and Project No. 5)
is now and will, following the consummation of the proposed transactions, remain a ``qualifying facility'' under
PURPA and the FERC's regulations thereunder.

 transfers, but United of Omaha reserves the right to impose a $10 fee for the thirteenth and each subsequent request
to transfer Account Value from a Subaccount made during a single Participant Year. A withdrawal Processing fee equal
to the lesser of $15 or 2% of the amount withdrawn will be imposed for the second and each subsequent partial withdrawal
request during a single Participant Year. 




United of Omaha does not anticipate any profit from these administrative charges, none of which will be increased.
United of Omaha will deduct the above charges in reliance upon and in compliance with Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act.




7. A one-time set-up fee of $30 and a quarterly asset charge equal to an annual rate of 1.50% will be deducted from Account
Value with respect to Certificates for which an optional asset allocation program has been elected. 






8. United of Omaha will deduct a charge of up to 3.5% for the aggregate premium taxes paid on behalf of a particular Contract
or from the Account Value upon a complete surrender, death of the Participant, or at annuitization, depending upon
when it is required to be paid. No charges currently are made for federal, state or local taxes, other than premium taxes.
United of Omaha may, however, deduct charges for such taxes, or the economic burden thereof, from Account B in the future.




9. No sales charges are deducted from premium payments under the Contracts. A contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'')
in the amount of up to 6% is imposed on certain full or partial surrenders during the first nine years after a Certificate's
Effective Date to cover expenses relating to the sales of the Contracts. No CDSC is assessed upon: (a) Participant's
death, (b)a corrective distribution, (c) a hardship distribution, if the Participant suffers a permanent disability
or is diagnosed as having a terminal illness, (d) the Participant's separation from service of his or her employer,
or (e) the application of a 


 Contract's proceeds to any Payout Option, with certain exceptions, for a period of at least 36 months. United of Omaha
will not increase the CDSC.



United of Omaha does not anticipate that the CDSC will generate sufficient revenues to pay the cost of distributing
the Contracts. If this charge is insufficient to cover the expenses, the deficiency will be met from the general account
assets of United of Omaha, which may include amounts derived from the charge for mortality and expenses risks. 



10. A daily charge equal to an effective annual rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets in Account B will be imposed
to compensate United of Omaha for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection with the Contracts. The
1.25% charge will not increase. Of this amount, approximately three-fourths is attributable to mortality risks,
and approximately one-fourth is attributable to expense risks. The charge may be a source of profit for United of Omaha
which will be added to its surplus and may be used for, among other things, the payment of distribution, sales and other
expenses. United of Omaha currently anticipates a profit from this charge. 



11. The mortality risk arises from United of Omaha's contractual obligation to make Annuity Payments (determined
in accordance with the annuity tables and other provisions contained in the Contracts) regardless of how long all
Annuitants or any individual Annuitant may live. This undertaking assures that neither an Annuitant's own longevity,
nor an improvement in general life expectancy, will adversely affect the periodic Annuity Payments that the Annuitant
will receive under a Contract. A mortality risk also is assumed in connection with the Death Benefit guarantee because
it could exceed the Account Value. There is no extra charge for the enhanced Death Benefit.

12. The expense risk assumed by United of Omaha is that its actual administrative costs will exceed the amount recovered
through the administrative charges.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act authorizes the Commission, by order upon application, to conditionally or unconditionally
grant an exemption from any provision, rule or regulation of the 1940 Act to the extent that the exemption is necessary
or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibit a registered unit investment trust,
its depositor or principal underwriter, from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of
all payments, other than sales loads, are deposited with a qualified bank and held under arrangements which prohibit
any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a reasonable fee, as the Commission may prescribe, for
performing bookkeeping and other administrative duties normally performed by the bank itself.

3. Applicants request exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit
the deduction from the assets of Account B of the 1.25% charge for the assumption of mortality and expense risks. Applicants
believe that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

Applicants submit that United of Omaha is entitled to reasonable compensation for its assumption of mortality and
expense risks. Applicants represent that the 1.25% mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts is consistent
with the protection of investors because it is a reasonable and proper insurance charge. The mortality and expense
risk charge is a reasonable charge to compensate United of Omaha for the risks that: Annuitants under the Contract
will live longer as a group than has been anticipated in setting the annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts; the
Account Value will be less than the Death Benefit; and administrative expenses will be greater than amounts derived
from the administrative charges.

4. Applicants represent that the 1.25% mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice
for comparable annuity contracts. This representation is based upon an analysis of publicly available information
about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels, the existence
of charge level guarantees, death benefit guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates. United of Omaha will maintain
at its administrative offices, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed
in the course of, and the methodology and results of, its comparative review.

5. Applicants acknowledge that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion
of such profit may be available to pay distribution expenses not reimbursed by the CDSC. United of Omaha has concluded
that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit Account
B, Contractowners and Participants. The basis for that conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained
by United of Omaha at its administrative offices and will be available to the Commission.

6. Account B will only invest in management investment companies which undertake, in the event they should adopt a
plan under rule 12b-1 to finance distribution expenses, to have a board of directors or trustees, a majority of whom
are not ``interested persons,'' formulate and approve any such plan.



Conclusion



For the reasons set forth above, Applicants represent that the exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the 1940 Act.





For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

<USBUREAU>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</USBUREAU>





Denial of Petition for Import Eligibility Determination



This notice sets forth the reasons for the denial of a petition submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(``NHTSA'') under section 108(c)(3)(C)(i)(II) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (``the Act''),
15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(C)(i)(II), and 49 CFR part 593. The petition, which was submitted by ICI International, Inc.
of Orlando, Florida ``ICI''), a Registered Importer of motor vehicles, requested NHTSA to determine that a 1971 Daimler
Limousine DR 420 passenger car that was not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle
safety standards is eligible for importation into the United States because it has safety features that comply with,
or are capable of being modified to comply with, those standards.

NHTSA published a notice in the 

Federal Register 

on June 30, 1993 (58 FR 30570) that contained a thorough description of the petition, and solicited public comments
upon it. One comment was received in response to this notice, from Jaguar Cars Inc. (``Jaguar''), the United States
importer of new motor cars manufactured by Jaguar Cars Ltd., the manufacturer of the 1971 Daimler Limousine. Jaguar
noted that Jaguar Cars Led. never produced a ``DR 420'' model Daimler Limousine, but that it did produce a model ``DS
420.'' ICI subsequently acknowledged that ``DS 420'' is the appropriate model designation for the vehicle that is
the subject of its petition.

In its comments, Jaguar expressed disagreement with ICI's claim that the 1971 Daimler Limousine DS 420, as originally
manufactured, complies with Standard. Nos. 103 Defrosting and Defogging Systems, 104 Windshield Wiping and Washing
Systems, 203 Impact Protection for the Driver From the Steering Control System and 205 Glazing Materials. Jaguar
further asserted that the 1971 Daimler Limousine DS 420 cannot ``be easily modified'' to comply with Standard Nos.
108 Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment, 208 Occupant Crash Protection, 209 Seat Belt Assemblies,
and 210 Seat Belt Assembly Anchorages.

ICI was given an opportunity to respond to Jaguar's comments. In its response, ICI failed to supply sufficient information
to establish that the 1971 Daimler Limousine DS 420 complies with Standard Nos. 103, 104, and 203, and can be easily
modified to comply with Standard No. 210. NHTSA requested ICI to supply this information on six separate occasions
from November 17, 1993 to January 24, 1994, but received no response to any of these requests. This has compelled NHTSA
to conclude, from the state of the record, that it cannot determine that the 1971 Daimler Limousine DS 420 is eligible
for importation. The petition must therefore be denied under 49 CFR 593.7(e).

In accordance with section 108(c)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(C)(ii), and 49 CFR 593.7(e), NHTSA
will not consider a new import eligibility petition covering this vehicle until at least three months from the date
of this notice.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Exercise Schedule and Workshop.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA),
and the Minerals Management Service (MMS), in concert with the states, the oil industry and concerned citizens, jointly
developed the National Preparedness for Response Exercise Program (PREP) to provide guidelines for compliance
with Oil Pollution Act of 1990 pollution response exercise requirements. The PREP guidelines outline the applicability,
type, frequency, and objectives of the required exercises and will aid the government and industry in meeting the
Federal requirements for pollution response exercises. This notice proposes an exercise schedule for 1995, 1996,
and 1997; solicits comments on the proposed schedule and the PREP scheduling process outlined here; solicits industry
members to lead Area exercises for 1995; and announces a workshop to be held on May 19, 1994, to discuss the proposed
schedule and the scheduling process.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Request for Comments


The Coast Guard, EPA, RSPA, and MMS encourage interested persons to comment on the PREP Area exercise schedule and
the scheduling process. The schedule and scheduling process may be revised in view of the comments. Comments will
be discussed at the scheduling workshop to be held on May 19, 1994. After the workshop, the final schedule for Area exercises
for 1995 and the tentative schedule for 1996 and 1997 Area exercises will be published by a notice in the 

Federal Register

.


Background Information


The Coast Guard, EPA, RSPA, and MMS developed the National Preparedness for Response Exercise Program (PREP) to provide
guidelines for compliance with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 pollution response exercise requirements (33 U.S.C.
1321(j)). One section of the PREP focuses on Area exercises, which are designed to evaluate the entire response mechanism
in a given Area to ensure adequate pollution response preparedness. Each Area is defined by geographical boundaries,
for which, a separate and distinct Area Contingency Plan has been developed. The goal of the PREP is to conduct 20 Area
exercises per year, with the intent of exercising most Areas of the country within a three year period.
The three year period under consideration here for Area exercise scheduling includes calendar years 1995, 1996 and
1997. The schedule consists of 20 Area exercises per year (6 government-led and 14 industry-led). Industry members
required to submit response plans are actively solicited to lead the industry-led Area exercises or participate
in the government-led Area exercises. Requests to lead or participate in an Area exercise should be made to the NSCC,
as described in 

DATES

.

Scheduling Process



The Area exercise scheduling process is as follows:

1. The NSCC, comprised of representatives of the Coast Guard, EPA, RSPA, and MMS, will meet in January of each year to
develop a proposed Area exercise schedule for the upcoming three year period. (For example, when the NSCC meets in
1995, the three years considered will be 1996, 1997 and 1998.) The information included in the proposed schedule will
be the exercise Area, the exercise quarter, whether the exercise is industry-led or government-led, and the types
of industry that will lead the exercise (vessel, marine transportation-related (mtr) facility, non marine transportation-related
facility, offshore facility or pipeline). Once developed, the proposed schedule will be published in the 

Federal Register

 in February of each year.

2. The NSCC will solicit input on this proposed schedule for each three year period. The NSCC is specifically looking
for input from On-Scene Coordinators (OSCs), Coast Guard Districts and EPA Regional Offices, the Regional Response
Teams, the states and the industry plan holders regarding the Area scheduled to be exercised, the time frame for each
exercise, the mix of the industry types selected for participation, and any federal, state or local government or
industry operational issues affecting the schedule. The NSCC is also looking for industry plan holders to lead the
Area exercises or participate in the government-led Area exercises.

3. When reviewing the proposed schedule, issues to be considered at the local Area level include:

a. Can the Area sponsor an exercise in the quarter listed? Do Area activities already scheduled preclude an exercise
from being held in this time frame? What specific dates would be appropriate for the exercise?

b. Is the industry type to be exercised in accordance with the proposed schedule appropriate for the Area? For instance,
if needed for the exercise planned, is there a pipeline or offshore platform operating in the Area? Has one specific
type of industry dominated Area exercises in the past? For example, have many or most of the Area exercises in the past
focused on vessels?

c. Should the Area receive credit for response to a major pollution incident? Was the response to this incident evaluated
in accordance with the PREP guidelines? (Only responses to major pollution incidents that have been evaluated using
the criteria for an Area exercise, as outlined in the PREP guidelines, will be considered for credit as an Area exercise.)

4. Issues to be considered at the district and regional level include:

a. Does the mix of industry types proposed for involvement in the exercises fairly represent the district or region?
Are all industry types adequately covered?

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940325-2-00229 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940325-2-00106 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

b. Are state issues being taken into consideration? Close coordination with the states is critical when reviewing
the exercise schedule and the types of industries being exercised.

c. Regional Response Teams (RRTs) should be consulted to ensure that RRT issues such as the coordination of other exercises
(for example, FEMA hazmat exercises) are taken into consideration when scheduling the Area exercises and exercise
participants.

d. Regional coordinating committees (such as the Area Industry Exercise Coordinating Committee in the Pacific Northwest)
should be consulted for input.

5. The suggested process for commenting on the schedule is as follows:

a. Coast Guard OSCs are requested to comment, on behalf of their Area Committees, to the NSCC through their respective
district offices.

b. EPA OSCs are requested to comment, on behalf of their Area Committees, to the NSCC through their respective regional
offices.

c. Industry plan holders are requested to comment directly to the NSCC as described in ``

ADDRESSES

.'' (If a regional coordinating committee is established in the region, industries are encouraged to use this committee
to coordinate industry responses for forwarding to the NSCC.)

d. Coast Guard Districts and EPA Regions are requested to comment directly to the NSCC, on behalf of their OSCs, RRTs,
and other regional organizations, as described in ``

ADDRESSES

.''

e. The states are requested to comment on the scheduling process directly to the NSCC as described in ``

ADDRESSES

.''



Selection of Industry Participants for Area Exercises



The selection process for industry participants for the Area exercises will be as follows:

1. Industry response plan holders interested in leading the Area exercises or supporting the government-led Area
exercises should submit their requests directly to the NSCC as described in ``

DATES

.'' These requests should be submitted by May 1. The NSCC will notify the districts/regions and OSCs of the industry
plan holder requests received; the districts/regions and OSCs shall notify the NSCC of requests submitted locally
for exercise participation. The NSCC will coordinate with the districts/regions and OSCs prior to the scheduling
workshop to finalize the list of potential exercise plan holders slated for exercise participation, for presentation
at the workshop.

2. In Areas where no plan holders have come forth and expressed an interest in leading or participating in the Area exercises,
OSCs will recommend industry plan holders for exercise participation to the NSCC. Some issues that will be considered
when selecting industry participants include the number of times a specific industry has conducted exercises in
the past, the operating history of industries in the Area and the perceived need for a particular industry plan holder
to be exercised. The OSCs will consult with the selected industry plan holders prior to submitting their names for
exercise participation.

3. In Areas scheduled for exercises involving pipelines or offshore facilities, the OSCs will coordinate with the
respective regulatory agency (RSPA or MMS) to select plan holders to lead or participate in these exercises.



Scheduling Workshop



A PREP scheduling workshop will be conducted by the NSCC annually in May. The workshop will focus primarily on the upcoming
year's Area exercise schedule, but will also address issues relating to the following two years of the triennial schedule.
National level industry representation is strongly encouraged at these workshops, as this will be an opportunity
for industry plan holders to comment on the schedule and address issues which may affect them and their operations.
This will also be an opportunity for the plan holders to comment on priorities for each exercise, particularly in instances
when more than one plan holder expresses an interest in leading or participating in the same exercise, or when plan
holders have been selected by the OSC for exercise participation. The workshops will be the forum for discussion and
final selection of the industry plan holders to lead the Area exercises or participate in the government-led Area
exercises. Input from the workshop will be used for finalizing the upcoming year's schedule and proposing the schedule
for the following two years.



Workshop Format and Schedule



The workshop format will consist of a presentation of the PREP Area exercise schedule listed here, followed by a question
and answer period and open discussion of the schedule and the scheduling process.

The workshop will be held on May 19, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., at the Best Western Old Colony Inn, 625 1st Street, Alexandria,
Virginia.



Final Schedule



After the workshop is completed, the NSCC will forward information received from the workshop to the Coast Guard Districts/EPA
Regions for distribution to the OSCs. The proposed final schedule will specify the exercise Area, the exercise dates,
whether the exercise is government or industry-led, the type of industry participating, and the government and industry
plan holders that will lead or participate in the exercises. The Coast Guard Districts/EPA Regions will coordinate
with the OSCs to validate the schedule and comment back to the NSCC. Comments should be provided to the NSCC as soon as
possible, but no later than August 1, to allow for timely publication of the final schedule. The Coast Guard will publish
a final schedule in the 

Federal Register

 annually in September.

for assistance needed as a result of the midwestern floods of 1993 in the States of Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota,
Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. These LEAs must be located in a county identified
in the Presidential Disaster Declarations and amendments as eligible for public assistance as a result of the midwestern
floods of 1993.



To apply, LEAs must submit applications, through their State educational agencies, for disaster assistance under
section 7(a) of Public Law 81-874 (the Impact Aid statute) to cover the costs of increased operating expenses
or reduced revenue.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under the current statutory and regulatory provisions of Public Law 81-874 (the Impact Aid statute), the Secretary
provides section 7(a) assistance to eligible LEAs that have increased costs or reduced revenue as a result of a Presidentially-declared
disaster. Under  219.21 of the current regulations, an LEA must submit its application for section 7(a) disaster
assistance to its State educational agency (SEA) and ensure that the SEA certifies and transmits the application
to the Secretary of Education on a timely basis. To be timely, the application must be transmitted by the SEA on or before
90 days after the publication of a notice in the 

Federal Register

 that the President has declared a major disaster and that the county in which the LEA is located is eligible for public
assistance. However, in an amendment to the regulatory provision in  219.21, published in this same issue of
the 

Federal Register

, the Secretary is authorized to extend the 90-day requirement, under unusual circumstances, through the publication
of a notice in the 

Federal Register

 extending the deadline.



Since the midwestern floods of 1993 affected a large part of the Midwest over a span of several months, 502 counties
in nine States were declared eligible for public assistance with application deadlines ranging from September 30,
1993 to February 3, 1994. The regulatory closing date for applications for section 7(a) assistance is 90 days from
the publication date of the Presidential declaration or amendment. The nature of this particular disaster resulted
in numerous closing dates and confusion as to applicable deadlines, even within a given State. Consequently, certain
LEAs and SEAs failed to file timely applications with the Department.

In recognition of the unusual circumstances of this specific disaster and the resultant confusion with regard to
the application deadlines, the Secretary extends the deadline for all applications for section 7(a) assistance
from LEAs covered by the Presidential disaster declarations that pertain to these floods. All other statutory and
regulatory criteria regarding section 7(a) disaster assistance remain in effect.

LEAs that have already filed certified applications through their appropriate State representative need not apply
again. Any other LEAs incurring damage from the floods in the affected eligible counties are encouraged to consider
applying. These LEAs should be aware that in order to be eligible, an LEA's minimum need for assistance must be at least
$10,000 or five percent of the LEA's operating costs for the fiscal year preceding the disaster, whichever is less.
Further, new applicants must contact their State representative regarding eligibility and application forms.
Applications must be submitted to their State representative for certification and the application must be forwarded
to this Department on or before the new closing date specified above. The designated representative for each of the
eligible States is as follows:

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Title II of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) (25 U.S.C. 1931) makes grant funds available to federally recognized
Indian tribes from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Department of the Interior, for the purpose of improving child
welfare services to Indian children and families.


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Title II of the Indian Child Welfare Act, Public Law 95-608, authorizes the utilization of funds for grants to
Indian tribes. This notice is published in exercise of authority delegated by the Secretary of the Interior to the
Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs by 209 DM 8. The BIA published in the January 13, 1994, 

Federal Register

, Vol. 59. No. 9, regulations revising 25 CFR part 23, the rules that govern the Title II ICWA grant program, and convert
the previous competitive ICWA grant award process to a noncompetitive award system for eligible federally recognized
Indian tribes. The Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs hereby announces procedures necessary for eligible Indian
tribes to apply for the FY 1994 Title II ICWA grant funds which shall be awarded noncompetitively under the revised
25 CFR part 23. The revised rules became effective on February 14, 1994. Copies of the revised 25 CFR part 23 ICWA grant
regulations may be obtained from the Area Social Workers listed in Part IV of this announcement. 




Comprehensive, three-year developmental tribal government applications for ICWA grant programs will be accepted
for the amount of funds for which the tribe is eligible. Applications received under this announcement must comply
with all applicable requirements and criteria specified in the revised 25 CFR part 23. It is imperative that applicants
carefully review all requirements detailed in this announcement relative to application contents, deadlines,
contract support funds, and other special instructions. 


It is incumbent upon the respective Area Director or Agency Superintendent to provide the necessary technical assistance
within the 60-day timeframe specified in 25 CFR 23.21(b)(1) to ensure that all eligible tribes within the area's or
agency's administrative jurisdiction access the amount of ICWA funds for which each is eligible. Should a tribe not
apply to administer an ICWA program or should their ICWA application be disapproved, the ICWA funds available to the
tribe may be reprogrammed to other Tribal Priority Allocation (TPA) program(s) with the approval of the affected
tribe. 


A total of $22,905,000 in FY 1994 ICWA funds will be available to Indian tribes nationwide for grants under Title II
of the Indian Child Welfare Act.

Part I_General Information 


A. Background 


Section 201 of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-608, 25 U.S.C. 1931) authorizes the Secretary
to make grants to Indian tribes to establish and operate on-reservation Indian child and family service programs
for the purpose of stabilizing and preventing the breakup of Indian families and, in particular, to ensure that the
permanent removal of an Indian child from the custody of his/her Indian parent or custodian shall be an action of last
resort; and to prepare and implement child welfare codes (25 U.S.C. 1902; 25 U.S.C. 1931). 


It is the policy of the BIA to emphasize and facilitate the comprehensive design, development and implementation
of Indian child and family service programs in coordination with other Federal, state, local, and tribal programs
which strengthen and preserve Indian families and Indian tribes. Thus, tribes operating BIA contracted social services
programs or related programs under the auspices of a tribal-state agreement are encouraged to design their ICWA programs/activities
to integrate with or complement existing child and family service programs. 


This announcement provides information on the FY 1994 ICWA grant application process for eligible Indian tribes,
and initiates the noncompetitive distribution of ICWA grant funds to tribes. To access FY 1994 ICWA grant funds, all
tribes, including those who have negotiated self-governance compact agreements, must submit a three-year (FY 1994-FY
1996) application and program plan. Once a tribe's application and program plan are approved by the respective Area
Director or Agency Superintendent in accordance with 25 CFR 23.43, continued annual funding of the tribe's ICWA program
for FY 1995 and FY 1996 will be contingent upon annual appropriations, receipt of a satisfactory program evaluation
from the area's social services office for the previous year of operation, and submission of an annual budget and budget
narrative justification statement in accordance with 25 CFR 23.23(b)(7). At the beginning of FY 1995 and thereafter,
the distribution of ICWA grant funds to tribal governments will coincide with the Federal Government's fiscal year
cycle. Thus, eligible Indian tribes will continuously access their recurring ICWA funds in the tribal priority allocation
(TPA) part of the tribe's budget system.

B. Eligible Applicants 



The governing body of any federally recognized Indian tribe or tribes may apply individually or as a consortium for
a grant under this announcement. A consortium is created by an agreement or association between two or more eligible
applicants. Under a consortium application, each eligible consortium applicant (tribe) must identify the amount
of ICWA funds for which it is eligible. An applicant may not submit more than one application nor be the beneficiary
of more than one grant under this grant announcement. 



C. Purpose of Tribal Government Indian Child Welfare Act Grant Programs 



The objective of every Indian child and family services program shall be to: Ensure that measures intended to prevent
the breakup of Indian families are followed in child custody proceedings; ensure that the permanent removal of an
Indian child from the custody of his/her Indian parent or Indian custodian shall be a last resort; comply with the ICWA
out-of-home placement preferences when such placements are deemed necessary; and implement procedures and practices
which reflect the unique values of Indian culture, and which promote the stability and security of Indian children,
Indian families and Indian communities. 

Tribal ICWA programs funded pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 1931 are for the specific purposes delineated in the statute and
may include the programs and activities listed at revised 25 CFR 23.22. These purposes are further defined in Public
Law 95-608 (Section 201, 25 U.S.C. 1931). During FY 1994, first-time tribal government ICWA program applicants
may expend a portion of their ICWA funds to plan, design, or develop a comprehensive, developmental tribal ICWA program.




Part II_Available Funds 



In FY 1994, eligible federally recognized Indian tribes will apply for $22,905,000 in ICWA grant funds nationwide.
However, no FY 1994 contract support funds are available for tribal government ICWA grant programs. Tribes must satisfy
and comply with the application requirements specified at revised 25 CFR part 23 in order to access their share of ICWA
funds. The ICWA grant funds will be awarded noncompetitively to eligible Indian tribes or consortiums of tribes with
approved three-year (FY 1994-FY 1996) grant applications, and will be distributed through the tribe's/agency's
tribal priority allocation budget process. 

Under a consortium application, each eligible consortium applicant (
