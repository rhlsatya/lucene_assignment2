ACTION:

 Interim rule and request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the brucellosis regulations concerning the interstate movement of cattle by changing the classification
of Texas from Class B to Class A. We have determined that Texas meets the standards for Class A status. This action relieves
certain restrictions on the interstate movement of cattle from Texas.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Brucellosis is a contagious disease affecting animals and man, caused by bacteria of the genus 

Brucella. 

The brucellosis regulations, contained in 9 CFR part 78 (referred to below as the regulations), provide a system for
classifying States or portions of States according to the rate of Brucella

 infection present, and the general effectiveness of a brucellosis control and eradication program. The classifications
are Class Free, Class A, Class B, and Class C. States or areas that do not meet the minimum standards for Class C are required
to be placed under Federal quarantine. 

The brucellosis Class Free classification is based on a finding of no known brucellosis in cattle for the 12 months
preceding classification as Class Free. The Class C classification is for States or areas with the highest rate of
brucellosis. Class B and Class A fall between these two extremes. Restrictions on moving cattle interstate become
less stringent as a State approaches or achieves Class Free status. 

The standards for the different classifications of States or areas entail maintaining: (1) A cattle herd infection
rate not to exceed a stated level during 12 consecutive months; (2) a rate of infection in the cattle population (based
on the percentage of brucellosis reactors found in the Market Cattle Identification (MCI) program_a program of testing
at stockyards, farms, ranches, and slaughter establishments) not to exceed a stated level; (3) a surveillance system
that includes testing of dairy herds, participation of all recognized slaughtering establishments in the MCI program,
identification and monitoring of herds at high risk of infection (including herds adjacent to infected herds and
herds from which infected animals have been sold or received), and having an individual herd plan in effect within
a stated number of days after the herd owner is notified of the finding of brucellosis in a herd he or she owns; and (4)
minimum procedural standards for administering the program. 


Before the effective date of this interim rule, Texas was classified as a Class B State because of its herd infection
rate and its MCI reactor prevalence rate. 


To attain and maintain Class A status, a State or area must: (1) Not exceed a cattle herd infection rate, due to field
strain 

Brucella abortus,

 of 0.25 percent, or 2.5 herds per 1,000, based on the number of reactors found within the State or area during any 12 consecutive
months, except in States with 10,000 or fewer herds; (2) maintain for 12 consecutive months an MCI reactor prevalence
rate not to exceed 0.10 percent, or one reactor per 1,000 cattle tested; (3) have an approved individual herd plan in
effect within 15 days of locating the source herd or recipient herd; and (4) maintain the specified surveillance system.



After reviewing the brucellosis program records for Texas, we have concluded that the State meets the standards for
Class A status. Therefore, we are removing Texas from the list of Class B States in  78.41(c) and adding it to the
list of Class A States in  78.41(b). This action relieves certain restrictions on moving cattle interstate
from Texas.

Immediate Action 



The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing
this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is warranted to remove unnecessary
restrictions on the interstate movement of cattle from Texas. 

Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the
public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon publication
in the 

Federal Register

. We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the 

Federal Register

. After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the 

Federal Register

. It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the
comments. 




Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 

For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.


Cattle moved interstate are moved for slaughter, for use as breeding stock, or for feeding. Changing the brucellosis
status of Texas from Class B to Class A will promote economic growth by reducing certain testing and other requirements
governing the interstate movement of cattle from the State. Cattle from certified brucellosis-free herds moving
interstate are not affected by this change. 

The groups affected by this action will be herd owners in Texas, as well as buyers and importers of cattle from the State.


There are an estimated 140,000 cattle herds in Texas that would be affected by this rule. Ninety-eight percent of these
are owned by small entities. If the total cost of testing were distributed equally among all herds affected by this
rule, this change in classification could save at the most approximately $4 per herd. 

Therefore, we believe that changing the brucellosis status for Texas would not have a significant economic impact
on the small entities affected by this interim rule. 

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Executive Order 12372 



This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive
Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015,
subpart V.) 



Executive Order 12778 



This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and
local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require
administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.

Exports to South Africa; Revision of Foreign Policy Controls 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Export Administration, Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 With the significant political changes underway in South Africa, the rationale for prohibiting all exports to South
African military and police entities no longer applies. The controls necessary to implement the mandatory U.N. arms
embargo against South Africa remain. In addition, restrictions on certain exports to the South African military
and police continue. This final rule amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by revising the export licensing
policy for exports to South African military and police entities in the following ways: By clarifying exemptions
from general prohibitions on certain technology and software; by revising policy to permit the consideration of
certain license applications; and by updating the list of South African military and police entities in the special
country policies and provisions. These changes, while not diminishing U.S. compliance with the U.N. mandatory embargo
against South Africa, and while maintaining U.S. ability to implement U.N. voluntary controls on certain exports
to the South African military and police, will allow U.S. businesses to begin to compete with foreign suppliers, who
are no longer bound by similar restrictions in their own countries. Thus, although it will likely result in an increase
in export license applications submitted, this rule will be generally beneficial to U.S. exporters.


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



In conformity with the United Nations Security Council Resolutions of 1977 and 1986, the United States maintains
an embargo on the export of arms, munitions and military equipment, and items used in their manufacture and maintenance
to the Republic of South Africa, as well as on certain items to the South African military or police that have a military
capacity and are intended for military purposes. These controls continue. Beyond these controls related to U.N.
Security Council resolutions, the United States has also maintained an embargo on virtually all exports to South
African military and police entities. The recent historic political changes in the Republic of South Africa argue
against the continuation of such global restrictions. This rule modifies existing controls to allow certain exports
to the South African military and police under an individual validated license. For example, applications to export
food, medicine, or items to meet emergency humanitarian needs, prevent acts of unlawful interference with international
civil aviation, or counter international narcotics trafficking will generally receive favorable consideration
on a case-by-case basis. Applications for export of items relating to arms, munitions, military equipment and their
manufacture or maintenance, or that have a military capacity and are intended for military purposes, will be subject
to either a strict or general policy of denial. All other exports will be considered on a case-by-case basis. 

Regardless of expanded opportunities to export under an individual validated license, return, repair or replacement
commodities may not be exported under General License GLR at this time. Therefore, exporters should include an allowance
for replacement parts on their original license applications. Repairs should be arranged in-country when practical,
since GLR will not be available for returning the item to South Africa after repair elsewhere, and the need for a validated
license could delay the return. 

Additionally, this rule clarifies the opportunity to use General License GTDU for exports destined to South African
military and police entities of sales data that are the minimum necessary to support a proposal; operation technical
data that are the minimum necessary to operate equipment authorized for export; or software updates (bug fixes) that
do not enhance the capabilities of the initially authorized package. While such exports have been allowed under the
provisions of  779.4(e), the availability of GTDU for these shipments was obscured by  771.2(c)(11),
which broadly prohibits use of general licenses for exports to South African military and police entities. This rule
clarifies the exemption of sales data, operation data and software updates from the general prohibitions. 

General License GIT may now be used for shipments in transit through the United States destined to the Republic of South
Africa, provided that the commodities are not related to arms and munitions or destined for military and police entities.

This rule also updates the list of military and police entities. This rule adds the company Denel (Pty) Ltd. and certain
of its subsidiaries to the list of South African military and police entities, and removes Musgrave, a former subsidiary
of Armscor, from the list. Denel was formed from several former Armscor subsidiaries, and produces a variety of products
for the South African military as well as the civilian population.

Finally, this rule removes remaining restrictions on exports to Walvis Bay. On February 28, 1994, South Africa returned
Walvis Bay to Namibia.



Rulemaking Requirements



1. This rule was not subject to review by Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866.

2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0694-0005,
0694-0007, and 0694-0010.

3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
assessment under Executive Order 12612.

4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this
rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under section 3(a) of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has
to be or will be prepared.

5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the
opportunity for public participation, and a delay in effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation involves
a military and foreign affairs function of the United States. Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed
rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule.




Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is no formal comment period, public comments on
this regulation are welcome on a continuing basis. Comments should be submitted to Hillary Hess, Office of Technology
and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.

Supplement No. 2 to Part 785_Interpretations


(1) The Department has received inquiries as to whether certain entities in the Republic of South Africa are considered
police or military entities and hence subject to the policies set forth in  785.4. 
(a) In addition to the military and police of the Republic of South Africa, the following entities are considered to
be police and military entities:



Aeronautical Systems Technology (AEROTEK) Division of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)

ARMSCOR (Armaments Development and Production Corporation) and all of its subsidiaries (including Specialist
B Vehicles (SBV), Institute of Maritime Technology, and Milistan) 
Denel (Pty) Ltd. (including the following of its subsidiaries: Advena, Armatron, Atlas Aircraft, Eloptro, Gennan,
Gerotek, Infoplan, Kentron, Lyttleton Engineering Works (LIW), Mechem, Naschem, Nimrod International, Overberg
Test Range (OTR), Pretoria Metal Pressing (PMP), Simera, Somchem, Swartklip Products) 
Department of Correctional Services 
``Homeland'' Police and Armed Forces 
National Intelligence Services 
Weapons Research activities of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)



(b) This list is not necessarily inclusive, and is subject to change. When dealing with any South African entity, exporters
should be sensitive to the potential for prohibited diversion of their products to police and military entities,
and the potential for illegal use of their exports in the manufacture or maintenance of arms or related materials.

ACTION: 

Final rule; technical amendment.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its regulations to correct the address for FDA's Dockets Management
Branch. A notice announcing the new address for the Dockets Management Branch was published in the 

Federal Register

 of June 10, 1991 (56 FR 26688). This action is being taken to improve the accuracy of the regulations.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In the 

Federal Register

 of June 10, 1991 (56 FR 26688), FDA announced the relocation of the Dockets Management Branch, effective June 14, 1991,
and listed its new address as the ``Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr. Rockville, MD 20857.'' In this document, FDA is amending certain portions of its regulations
to reflect the correct address.


Publication of this document constitutes final action on these changes under the Administrative Procedure Act (5
U.S.C. 553). Notice and public procedure are unnecessary because FDA is merely correcting nonsubstantive errors.

706 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 376) was redesignated as section 721 of the act (21
U.S.C. 379e). Publication of this document constitutes final action on these changes under the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. 553). FDA has determined that notice and public comment are unnecessary because these amendments are
editorial and nonsubstantive in nature.


This regulation is issued under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 

et seq.

) and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. FDA is amending Chapter I of Title 21 by removing
``706'' and ``21 U.S.C. 376'' and adding in its place ``721'' and ``21 U.S.C. 379e'', respectively, each time it appears.

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of an abbreviated
new animal drug application (ANADA) filed by Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co. The ANADA provides for using approved
single ingredient Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated broiler feeds containing salinomycin with bambermycins
and roxarsone. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co., P.O. Box 2500, Somerville, NJ 08876-1258, filed ANADA 200-080 which provides
for using approved single ingredient Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated broiler feeds containing
40 to 60 grams per ton (g/t) salinomycin sodium activity, 1 to 2 g/t bambermycins, and 45.4 g/t roxarsone. The Type C
feed is used for prevention of coccidiosis in broiler chickens caused by 

Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix, E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. brunetti

, and 

E. mivati

, including some field strains of 

E. tenella

 that are more susceptible to roxarsone combined with salinomycin than salinomycin alone; and for improved feed efficiency.
ANADA 200-080 is as a generic copy of Agri-Bio's NADA 134-185. ANADA 200-080 is approved as of March
28, 1994. The regulations are amended in 21 CFR 558.95(b)(1)(xi)(b) to indicate that Hoechst-Roussel is an approved
source for salinomycin in the combination and in 21 CFR 558.550(a) to indicate that Hoechst-Roussel has an approval
for the combination. 


 This approval is for use of single ingredient Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated feeds. Roxarsone is
a Category II drug which, as provided in 21 CFR 558.4, requires an approved form FDA 1900 for making a Type C medicated
feed. Use of salinomycin, bambermycins, and roxarsone Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated feeds requires
an approved form FDA 1900. 
 In addition, FDA published a rule in the 

Federal Register

 of March 11, 1992 (57 FR 8577) which reflected the change of sponsor of NADA 007-891 (3-NITRO (roxarsone)
Type A medicated article) from Solvay to A. L. Laboratories. Inadvertently, the references concerning roxarsone
in  558.550 were not amended to reflect the new sponsor. At this time, the references are amended accordingly.
 In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and  514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
 FDA has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(1)(ii) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant impact on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Technical amendment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice amends the definition of a Community-Based Nonprofit Organization (CBO), as set out in 24 CFR 248.101,
in response to a change in the definition of a Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO) in the Department's
HOME program. In its conference report, Congress requested that the definition of a CBO conform to the definition
of a CHDO to the extent practicable. Subsequent to the original publication of the CBO definition, the CHDO definition
was changed; as a result, an otherwise acceptable CBO with official CHDO status may not be an eligible CBO under the
April 8 interim rule. This notice amends the definition of a CBO by omitting the requirement that the governing board
of a rural multi-county CBO be required to contain low-income neighborhood residents from each county of the multi-county
area.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In the House Conference Report to the Cranston Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (Conf. Rep. No. 943, 101st
Cong., 2nd Sess.) Congress indicated its intent that, to the extent practicable, the definition of a Community-Based
Nonprofit Organization (CBO) should conform to the definition of a Community Housing Development Organization
(CHDO). Because the definition of a CHDO has been revised to eliminate the requirement that the board of directors
of rural, multi-county CHDOs be composed of a representative from each county the CHDO encompassed.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On November 4, 1993 (58 FR 58784), the Department published a final rule that states that until such time as HUD approval
may be obtained, the PHA or IHA must not take any action intended to further the demolition or disposition of a public
housing project or a portion of a public housing project without obtaining HUD approval under 24 CFR parts 970 or 905,
respectively. This final rule, which establishes an ``intent'' standard to the August 17, 1988 interim rule currently
in effect, was to become effective on December 6, 1993. 



On December 6, 1993, a notice was published to delay the effective date of the final rule from December 6, 1993, until
February 4, 1994. On February 4, 1994, another notice was published which further delayed the effective date of the
final rule for an additional 60 days. This notice withdraws the November 4, 1993 final rule. The August 17, 1988 interim
rule remains in effect.

Withdrawal of Final Rule 



On November 4, 1993, at 58 FR 58784, the Department issued a final rule regarding required and permitted actions that
a PHA or IHA may take prior to approval of an application for demolition or disposition of a public or Indian housing
project or a portion of a public or Indian housing project. The final rule had an effective date of December 6, 1993,
and a notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64141) that delayed that effective date until February 4, 1994, because serious concerns
had been expressed about the impact of some of the provisions of the final rule on residents and resident organizations.


In the spirit of cooperation, the Department further delayed the effective date of the final rule for an additional
60 days by publication of a notice on February 4, 1994 (59 FR 5321), so that further review of this rule could be conducted.
The Department, after further consideration, now believes that the Department can better serve all parties concerned
with this rule by receiving public comments before issuing this rule for effect. 

Accordingly, the final rule published on November 4, 1993 (58 FR 58784) that amended 24 CFR parts 905 and 970, is withdrawn.
The Department will issue a notice of proposed rulemaking in the near future.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) of the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) is amending
its regulations governing abandoned mine land (AML) reclamation fee payments. The revised rule establishes a new
dollar threshold of $25,000 or more for quarterly fee payments made by electronic transfer of funds to the Treasury
Financial Communications System (TFCS) or other electronic fund transfer mechanisms approved by the U.S. Department
of the Treasury. The increased use of the electronic transfer of funds by those making reclamation fee payments will
allow the Department to expedite and streamline its fee collection efforts.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 






I. Background.

II. Discussion of Final Rule and Response to Comments.

III. Procedural Matters.



I. Background



On August 30, 1993, OSM published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 45736) which would amend its regulations at 30 CFR 870.15 to require that surface coal mine operators who owe
$25,000 or more in quarterly reclamation fees for one or more mines shall forward payments by electronic transfer.
The comment period closed on October 29, 1993. The rule was proposed pursuant to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation
Act of 1977 (the Act) (30 U.S.C. 1201 

et seq.,

 as amended).

Section 402(b) of the Act (30 U.S.C. 1232(b)) provides that a reclamation fee on produced coal shall be paid no later
than thirty days after the end of each calendar quarter. Section 413(a) of the Act (30 U.S.C. 1242(a)) authorizes the
Secretary of the Interior to do all things necessary or expedient, including promulgation of rules and regulations,
to implement and administer the provisions of the Act relating to Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation (Title IV).

This rule amends OSM regulations at 30 CFR Part 870.15(d) by lowering the wire transfer threshold from $100,000 to
$25,000. This rule will require those companies which owe $25,000 or more for quarterly reclamation fees to submit
such payments through the use of an electronic fund transfer mechanism approved by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
The first electronic payment for those companies which owe $25,000 or more shall be made no later than 30 days after
the end of the first complete quarter following April 27, 1994.

Approximately 100 companies currently pay via wire transfer; however, by lowering the threshold to $25,000, OSM
estimates that approximately 1,500 companies will utilize the wire transfer method of payment. Payments from these
companies total approximately $55 million per quarter. Instead of submitting checks to OSM for these amounts, these
companies will be required to have their banks wire funds using an electronic fund transfer mechanism approved by
the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

Through the use of electronic fund transfer mechanisms for these large accounts, the Department will be able to expedite
and streamline its fee collection efforts. 

The TFCS is the computer-to-computer link between the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York (FRBNY). This system provides the capability for: (1) Automated receipt and processing of funds transfer,
and (2) computer-assisted generation of funds transferred between Treasury, Federal Reserve banks, and other banks
utilizing the Federal Reserve Communications System (FRCS). The TFCS also integrates these transactions into Treasury's
Government-wide Accounting System which accounts for all Federal receipts and outlays. Treasury maintains an account
at FRBNY. As a result, banks that maintain an account at a Federal Reserve bank may transfer funds to Treasury through
the FRCS for credit to the Account of the U.S. Treasury at FRBNY. Funds transferred between Treasury and banks that
do not maintain an account at a Federal Reserve bank are processed through correspondent banks that do maintain an
account at a Federal Reserve bank, 

The following are the TFCS transfer message format and specific instructions from the Treasury Fiscal Requirements
Manual for fund transfer message to be used in paying reclamation fees:

 















Funds Transfer Message Format 


Item 1_Priority Code_The priority code will be provided by the sending bank. (Note: Some Federal Reserve district
banks may not require this item.) 

Item 2_Treasury Department Code_The nine-digit identifier ``021030004'' is the routing symbol of the Treasury.
This item is a constant and is required for all funds transfer messages sent to Treasury. 

Item 3_Type Code_The code will be provided by the sending bank. 
Item 3_Sending Bank Code_This nine-digit identifier will be provided by sending bank. 
Item 5_Class Code_This class code may be provided by the sending bank at its option (if permitted by its Federal Reserve
district bank). 
Item 6_Reference Number_The reference number may be inserted by the sending bank to identify the transaction. 
Item 7_Amount_The amount will include the dollar sign and the appropriate punctuation including cents digits. This
item will be provided by the depositor. 
Item 8_Sending Bank Name_The telegraphic abbreviation which corresponds to item 4 will be provided by the sending
bank. 
Item 9_Treasury Department Name_This item is of critical importance. It must appear on the funds transfer message
in the precise manner as stated to allow for the automated processing and classification of the funds transfer message
to the agency location code of the appropriate agency. The item is comprised of a rigidly formatted, non-variable
sequence of 11 characters defined as follows: 






The 11 characters must be left-justified on Line 5 of the funds transfer message and must appear as follows: 



TREAS NYC/(14180001) 



Item 10_Agency Location Code_This item is of critical importance. It must appear on the funds transfer message in
the precise manner as stated to allow the automated processing and classification of the funds transfer message to
the agency location code of the appropriate agency. The agency location code refers to three-, four-, or eight-digit
numeric symbols used to identify Government departments and agencies (e.g., accounting stations, disbursing and
collecting offices). OSM's unique code must be specified in the funds transfer message in order for the funds to be
correctly classified to the agency. The code must immediately follow the left parenthesis of item 9, must contain
no spaces, dasher, or other extra characters, and must be immediately followed by a right parenthesis. This item would
appear on line 5 of the funds transfer message in conjunction with item 9 as shown below: 



TREAS NYC/(14180001) 



Item 11_Agency Name_OSM
Item 12_Third party information_Information to identify the reason for the funds transfer should be provided here.
This should include the six-digit Master Entity No.(s) from Part 1, Block 4 of the OSM-1 form, i.e., 012345, and
the six-digit OSM Document No.(s) from the upper right corner of Part 1, i.e., 401234. 





These instructions will be mailed to coal companies, along with the OSM-1 form which is the form used to report
quarterly coal reclamation fees to OSM. Submission of the OSM-1 form will remain the same, except that companies
required to use wire transfer should indicate in Part 1, Block 4 of the OSM-1 form that fees have been submitted
via wire transfer.

II. Discussion of Final Rule and Response to Comments


Only one comment letter was received. The comment supported the adoption of the rule as proposed. No comments were
received objecting to the proposal. In view of the lack of objections, OSM is adopting the rule with only minor changes
for clarity and for consistency with the existing regulations. A discussion of the rule and comments follows.


Section 870.15(d)_Reclamation Fee Payment


Under revised  870.15(d), an operator who owes total quarterly reclamation fees of $25,000 or more for one or
more mines will be required to: Use an electronic fund transfer mechanism approved by the U.S. Department of the Treasury;
forward its payments by electronic transfer, include the applicable Master Entity Number (Part 1, Block 4, on the
OSM-1 form) and OSM Document No. (Part 1, upper right corner on the OSM-1 form) on the wire message; and use
OSM's approved form to report coal tonnage sold, used, or for which ownership was transferred to the address indicated
in the Instructions for Completing the OSM-1 Form.
Operators who owe less than $25,000 in quarterly reclamation fees for one or more mines may either forward payments
by an electronic fund transfer mechanism in accordance with the procedures specified in amended paragraph 870.15(d)(1);
or submit a check or money order payable to the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, in the same envelope
with OSM's approved form to: Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, P.O. Box 360095M, Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania 15251.
A new paragraph has been added to the rule at (d)(3) clarifying that operators who submit a payment of more than $25,000
by a method other than an electronic fund transfer mechanism approved by the U.S. Department of the Treasury would
be in violation of the requirements of the Act, as amended.


Changes to the Proposed Rule


Certain changes have been made to the rule as originally proposed in the 

Federal Register

 on August 30, 1993. The changes were made to ensure consistency and accuracy with the existing regulations, and to
provide flexibility in the mechanism used to transfer funds. OSM is adopting the language contained in the proposed
rule with the following modifications.
(1) The proposed rule at  870.15(d)(1)(i) would have required that any person transferring funds electronically
use TFCS. OSM has replaced ``TFCS'' with the phrase ``an electronic fund transfer mechanism approved by the U.S. Department
of the Treasury'' in order to allow for future developments and changes in the field of electronic communications.
(2) At  870.15(d)(1)(iii), the language has been revised to clarify the identifying information (OSM Document
No. from the OSM-1 form) that must be included on the wire message in order to insure that credit is given to the
person making the payment. This revision will help insure accurate processing of quarterly coal reclamation fees.
(3) In  870.15(d)(1)(iv), the word ``production'' has been changed to ``tonnage of coal sold, used, or for which
ownership was transferred.'' The revised language has been added for clarity and accuracy.


Response to Comment


One comment letter was received during the comment period. The commenter was in favor of lowering the mandatory threshold
for electronic transfer of reclamation fee payments in order to reduce transaction costs. The commenter stated that
he opposed the electronic filing of the OSM-1 form without receipt of a hard copy because of the importance of
signed certifications contained on hard copies. Neither the proposed rule, nor this final rule contain any provisions
that would allow the electronic filing of the OSM-1 form.


III. Procedural Matters


Federal Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not contain collections of information which require approval by the Office of Management and Budget
under 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

Executive Order 12866




This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.



Regulatory Flexibility Act




The Department of the Interior has determined, pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.

, that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The final
rule merely specifies the manner in which reclamation fee payments are to be made to OSM. It does not alter the amount
or frequency of payment. The rule does not distinguish between small and large entities.



Executive Order 12778; Civil Justice Reform Certification



This wire transfer rule has been reviewed under the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778,
Civil Justice Reform. In general, the requirements of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778 are covered by the
preamble discussion of this wire transfer rule.


Additional remarks follow concerning individual elements of the Executive Order:


A. What is the preemptive effect, if any, to be given to the regulation?


The wire transfer rule will not have any preemptive effect on any state law. This relates only to Federal obligations.


B. What is the effect on existing Federal law or regulation, if any, including all provisions repealed or modified?


This rule modifies the implementation of the Act as described herein, and is not intended to modify the implementation
of any other Federal statute. The preceding discussion of this rule specifies the Federal regulatory provisions
that are affected by this rule.


C. Does the rule provide a clear and certain legal standard for affected conduct rather than a general standard, while
promoting simplification and burden reduction?


The standards established by this rule are as clear and certain as practicable, given the complexity of the topics
covered and the mandates of the Act.


D. What is the retroactive effect, if any, to be given to the regulation?


This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect.


E. Are administrative proceedings required before parties may file suit in court? Which proceedings apply? Is the
exhaustion of administrative remedies required?


No administrative proceedings are required before parties may file suit in court challenging the provisions of this
rule under section 526(a) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1276(a).


F. Does the rule define key terms, either explicitly or by reference to other regulations or statutes that explicitly
define those items?


Terms which are important to the understanding of this rule are set forth in 30 CFR 700.5, 701.5, and 870.5.


G. Does the rule address other important issues affecting clarity and general draftsmanship of regulations set forth
by the Attorney General, with the concurrence of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, that are determined
to be in accordance with the purpose of the Executive Order?

The Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget have not issued any guidance on this requirement.



National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)





This rule has been reviewed by OSM and it has been determined to be categorically excluded from the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) process in accordance with the Departmental Manual (516 DM 2, Appendix 1.10) and the Council on Environmental
Quality Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR 1507.3).

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act
of 1973, as amended (Act), for 11 plant species: 

Chamaesyce deppeana 

('akoko); 

Cyanea truncata

 (haha); 

Cyrtandra crenata

 (ha'iwale); 

Cyrtandra polyantha

 (ha'iwale); 

Eugenia koolauensis

 (nioi); 

Hesperomannia arborescens 

(no common name (NCN)); 

Lobelia oahuensis 

(NCN); 

Lycopodium nutans

 (wawae'iole); 

Melicope lydgatei

 (alani); 

Rollandia crispa 

(NCN); and 

Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa 

('ohe'ohe). All but five of the taxa are or were endemic to the Koolau Mountain Range on the island of Oahu, Hawaiian
Islands; the exceptions are or were found on the islands of Kauai, Molokai, Lanai, Maui, and/or in the Waianae Mountains
of Oahu, as well as the Koolau Mountains. The 11 plant taxa and their habitats have been variously affected or are currently
threatened by one or more of the following: Habitat degradation by trampling and/or predation by wild, feral, or domestic
animals (pigs, goats, cattle, rats, slugs); competition for space, light, water, and nutrients by naturalized,
introduced vegetation; habitat loss from fires; trampling due to military training exercises; and recreational
activities. Due to the small number of existing individuals and their very narrow distributions, these taxa are subject
to a danger of extinction from stochastic events and/or from reduced reproductive vigor. This final rule implements
the Federal protection provisions provided by the Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 






Chamaesyce deppeana, Cyanea truncata, Cyrtandra crenata, Cyrtandra polyantha, Eugenia koolauensis, Hesperomannia
arborescens, Lobelia oahuensis, Lycopodium nutans, Melicope lydgatei, Rollandia crispa,

 and 

Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa

 are either endemic to or have their largest or best known populations in the Koolau Mountain Range on the eastern side
of the island of Oahu, Hawaii. Five of these taxa are or were known from regions other than the Koolau Mountains. 

Eugenia koolauensis 

was historically known from the island of Molokai. 

Hesperomannia arborescens 

is known also from the islands of Molokai and Maui. It is extirpated on the island of Lanai. 

Lycopodium nutans 

once grew on the island of Kauai but is now found only in the Koolau Mountains of Oahu. 

Lobelia oahuensis 

and 

Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa 

are restricted to the island of Oahu, including the Koolau Mountains and one population of each species in the Waianae
Mountains.

The island of Oahu was formed from the remnants of two large shield volcanoes, the younger Koolau volcano on the east
and the older Waianae volcano to the west (Department of Geography 1983). Their original shield volcano shape has
been lost as a result of extensive erosion, and today these volcanoes are called mountains or ranges, and consist of
long, narrow ridges. The Koolau Mountains were built by eruptions that took place primarily along a 
northwest-trending rift zone (Macdonald 

et al.

 1983) and formed a range now approximately 37 miles (mi) (60 kilometers (km)) long (Foote 

et al.

 1972). Median annual rainfall for the Koolau Mountains varies from 50 to 250 inches (in) (130 to 640 centimeters (cm)),
most of which is received at higher elevations along the entire length of the windward (northeastern) side (Taliaferro
1959). 

The vegetation communities of the Koolau Mountains, especially in the upper elevations to which many of the 11 plant
taxa are restricted, are primarily lowland mesic and wet forests dominated by 

Metrosideros polymorpha

 ('ohi'a) and/or other tree or fern taxa. Much of the Koolau Mountain Range is vegetated with alien plant taxa. Most
of the remaining native vegetation is restricted to steep valley headwalls and inaccessible summit ridges. The windswept
ridges are very steep and are characterized by grasses, ferns, and low-growing, stunted shrubs (Gagne and Cuddihy
1990). 

The land that supports these 11 plant taxa is owned by the City and County of Honolulu, the State of Hawaii (including
land classified as natural area reserve and forest reserve), the Federal government, and various private parties.
Plants on Federal land are located on the boundary of Schofield Barracks Military Reservation, under the jurisdiction
of the U.S. Army, and Lualualei Naval Reserve, under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Navy. Populations of five taxa grow
on land leased by the U.S. Army from private parties and the State. 



Discussion of the 11 Plant Taxa 



P.E. Boissier (1862) described 

Euphorbia deppeana 

based on a 1835 collection by Ferdinand Deppe that had been erroneously labelled as being from California (Millspaugh
1916; Sherff 1941, 1944). Otto and Isa Degener and Leon Croizat accepted the elevation of the section 

Chamaesyce 

to the generic level and published the necessary combinations for the Hawaiian taxa (Croizat 1943; Degener and Croizat
1936a, 1936b, 1937; Koutnik 1987; Koutnik and Huft 1990). Other names by which 

Chamaesyce deppeana 

has been known are 

Anisophyllum californicum 

(Koutnik 1987), 

Chamaesyce festiva 

(Degener and Croizat 1936b), 

Euphorbia festiva 

(Sherff 1936), and 

E. pauciflora 

(Koutnik and Huft 1990). 



Chamaesyce deppeana

, a member of the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae), is an erect subshrub up to 4 feet (ft) (1.2 meters (m)) tall with fuzzy
branches. The hairless leaves, generally oval-shaped and often notched at their tips, are between 0.2 and 0.8 in (5
and 20 millimeters (mm)) long and 0.2 and 0.5 in (5 and 12 mm) wide; they are arranged in two opposite rows along the stem.
The leaf margins are usually toothed, rarely toothless. The small, petalless flower clusters (cyathia), 0.06 to
0.1 in (1.5 to 3 mm) wide, are borne singly in the leaf axils (point between the stem and leaf stalk) and produce small
capsules about 0.1 in (2 mm) long. Seeds have not been observed. This species is distinguished from others in the genus
by the following combination of characters: leaves arranged in two rows on opposite sides of the branches; leaves
glabrous; leaf apex notched; leaf margin toothed; and cyathia width (Boissier 1862, Koutnik and Huft 1990, Sherff
1936). 

Historically, 

Chamaesyce deppeana 

was known only from southern Oahu. Because the few collections that were made were collected prior to the 20th century,
it was thought to be extinct (Koutnik and Huft 1990). In 1986, Joel Lau and Sam Gon of The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii
(TNCH) rediscovered 

C. deppeana 

on State land in the southern Koolau Mountains of Oahu in Nuuanu Pali Wayside State Park near the Pali Lookout, a popular
tourist attraction (Hawaii Heritage Program (HHP) 1991a). About 50 to 100 individuals grow near there, with such
plant taxa as 'ohi'a, 

Bidens sandvicensis 

(ko'oko'olau), 

Casuarina equisetifolia 

(common ironwood), and 

Phyllanthus distichus 

(pamakani mahu) (Hawaii Plant Conservation Center (HPCC) 1990a; Joel Lau, TNCH, John Obata and Steve Perlman, HPCC,
pers. comms., 1991). The most visible and accessible plants, comprising about 30 percent of the population, are confined
to a 200 square foot (sq ft) (20 sq m) area, portions of which extend to within 15 ft (5 m) of the Pali Lookout parking lot
(HHP 1991a). The remaining plants are scattered on an adjacent steep, exposed, windswept slope growing with grasses
and shrubs (HHP 1991a; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1991). This population is found at an elevation of approximately 1,000
ft (300 m) (Center for Plant Conservation (CPC) 1989b, HHP 1991a, HPCC 1990a, Koutnik and Huft 1990). The major threats
to the single known population of 

Chamaesyce deppeana 

are competition for water, space, light, and nutrients with various alien plant taxa (common ironwood, 

Paspalum conjugatum 

(Hilo grass), and 

Schinus terebinthifolius 

(Christmas berry)), and stochastic extinction due to the limited number of individuals and restricted range. Fire
and impact by humans threaten the species as well.

Cyanea truncata 

was first collected on the Punaluu Valley Trail in 1911 by Joseph Rock and was placed by him in the genus 

Rollandia 

(Rock 1913). On further examination, Rock (1917) transferred the species to the closely related genus 

Cyanea 

because of its free staminal column. Charles N. Forbes (1916) described and named a specimen from Waiahole Valley


C. juddii, 

which Rock later reduced to synonymy under 

C. truncata 

(Rock 1919). Harold St. John (1939) recognized this taxon at the varietal level and published the combination 

C. truncata 

var. 

juddii. 

In 1987, St. John, questioning the validity of the characters used to delineate the genus 

Cyanea, 

transferred all taxa of 

Cyanea 

to another closely related genus, 

Delissea 

(St. John 1987, St. John and Takeuchi 1987). Few botanists have accepted St. John's taxonomy for this group; the majority
continue to recognize the genus 

Cyanea, 

and the latest revision of the genus recognizes only 

C. truncata 

(Lammers 1990). The specific epithet refers to the plant's occasionally truncate leaf base.


Cyanea truncata, 

of the bellflower family (Campanulaceae), is an unbranched or sparsely branched shrub covered with small sharp prickles.
The oval leaves, which are widest above the middle, are 8 to 24 in (22 to 60 cm) long and 4 to 10 in (10 to 26 cm) wide, and are
lined with hardened teeth along the margins. The upper surface of the leaf is hairless; the lower surface is hairy,
has sparse projections, and is pale green. Clusters of 8 to 40 white flowers with magenta stripes are produced on horizontal
or hanging stalks between 2 and 12 in (5 to 28 cm) long. Each slightly curved flower is 1.3 to 1.7 in (32 to 42 mm) long and
about 0.3 in (7 mm) wide and has spreading corolla lobes that are one-fourth to one-half as long as the flower. The fruits
are round orange berries about 0.4 in (9 mm) long that contain many tiny seeds. 

Cyanea truncata 

is distinguished from other members of this genus by the length of the flower cluster stalk and the size of the flowers
and flower lobes (Degener 1932a; Forbes 1916; Lammers 1990; Rock 1913, 1919; St. John 1939).
Historically, 

Cyanea truncata 

was known from Punaluu, Waikane, and Waiahole in the northern Koolau Mountains of Oahu (HHP 1991b2 to 1991b4). These
sites have not been recently surveyed due to their inaccessibility, but it is known that suitable habitat is present.
One population of at least two individuals was known to exist in ``Hidden Valley,'' a drainage northwest of Kaaawa
Valley that terminates at Kaaawa Point in the Koolau Range (HHP 1991b1, Rock 1962); however, that population was destroyed
by feral pigs (CPC 1989a, 1989b, 1990). In 1991, John Obata of HPCC discovered 20 immature lobeliods growing on private
land along a gully floor further upstream from the site of the destroyed 

C. truncata 

population (HPCC 1991a; J. Obata, pers. comm., 1991). This was thought to be the only known population of this species.
An individual from this sterile population was salvaged from pig-damaged areas in 1991 and this individual flowered
on June 22, 1993. This individual turned out to be 

Rollandia crispa 

(not 

C. truncata

). A site visit in July 1993 determined that all of the plants previously thought to be 

C. truncata 

were actually 

R. crispa. 

No individuals of 

C. truncata 

were located, though it is possible that juvenile plants could be found in the valley floor (Loyal Mehrhoff, U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1993).


Cyanea truncata 

typically grows on windward slopes in mesic to wet forests at elevations between 800 and 1,300 ft (240 and 400 m) (HHP
1991b1, Lammers 1990). Associated plant taxa include 

Hibiscus arnottianus 

(koki'o ke'oke'o), 

Diospyros sandwicensis 

(lama), 'ohi'a, 

Aleurites moluccana 

(kukui), 

Cyrtandra propinqua 

(ha'iwale), 

Neraudia melastomifolia 

(ma'aloa), 

Pisonia umbellifera 

(papala kepau), and 

Piper methysticum 

('awa) (HPCC 1991a; Wagner 

et al. 

1990; J. Lau and J. Obata, pers. comms., 1991; L. Mehrhoff, pers. comm., 1993). The major threats to 

Cyanea truncata 

are habitat degradation and predation by feral pigs, competition with invasive alien plant taxa (

Clidemia hirta 

(Koster's curse) and 

Psidium cattleianum 

(strawberry guava)), and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of remaining
individuals.

Cyrtandra crenata 

was first described by Harold St. John and William Storey (1950) from a specimen that they had collected on the Waikane-Schofield
Trail. The specific name refers to the rounded teeth of the leaf margin (St. John 1966).


Cyrtandra crenata, 

a member of the African violet family (Gesneriaceae), is a shrub 3 to 7 ft (1 to 2 m) tall with few branches. The leaves
are arranged in whorls of three, tufted at the end of branches; they are generally elliptic or lance-shaped, 4.7 to
11 in (12 to 28 cm) long and 1.6 to 3.1 in (4 to 8 cm) wide, and have toothed margins. The upper leaf surface is generally
hairless and has a wrinkled texture; the lower surface has only sparse hairs. Dense clusters of three to seven white
flowers, covered with thick brown hair, arise from the leaf axils. The calyx is bilaterally symmetrical, with the
three upper lobes somewhat longer than the two lower lobes. The curved, funnel-shaped flowers, about 0.9 in (24 mm)
long and 0.2 in (4 mm) wide, develop into fleshy ellipsoid berries about 0.7 in (1.8 cm) long that contain numerous tiny
seeds. The berries, as well as various other plant parts, are covered with short-stalked, brownish, hemispherical
glands. 

C. crenata 

is distinguished from other species in the genus by the combination of its three-leaf arrangement, bilaterally symmetrical
calyx, and brownish, hemispherical glands (St. John 1966, St. John and Storey 1950, Wagner 

et al. 

1990).
Historically, 

Cyrtandra crenata 

was known from Waikane Valley along the Waikane-Schofield Trail in the Koolau Mountains (HHP 1991c1, St. John 1966,
St. John and Storey 1950). It now remains below that trail, about 0.5 mi (0.8 km) from its historical location, at the
boundary of private and State lands (HHP 1991c2). This population has not been observed since 1947 and although the
number of remaining individuals is not known, it is thought to be very low. This species typically grows in ravines
or gulches in mesic to wet forests between elevations of 1,250 and 2,400 ft (380 and 730 m) with associated plant taxa
such as 'ohi'a, 

Dicranopteris linearis 

(uluhe), and 

Machaerina angustifolia 

('uki) (Wagner 

et al. 

1990; S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1991). The primary threat to this species is stochastic extinction and/or reduced
reproductive vigor due to the species' restricted range and the small number of individuals that are thought to exist.

On the basis of a collection by Wilhelm Hillebrand, C.B. Clarke (1883) described 

Cyrtandra polyantha,

 choosing the specific epithet to refer to the many-flowered clusters (St. John 1966). A description of 

C. triflora

 by Hillebrand (1888) is believed to be, in part, a description of 

C. polyantha

 (Wagner 

et al.

 1990). 



Cyrtandra polyantha,

 a member of the African violet family, is an unbranched or few-branched shrub 3 to 10 ft (1 to 3 m) in height. Its leathery,
elliptic, unequal leaves are 2 to 6.3 in (5 to 16 cm) long and 0.7 to 2 in (1.8 to 5.2 cm) wide and attached oppositely along
the stems. The upper surface of the leaves is conspicuously wrinkled and usually hairless, with the lower surface
moderately to densely covered with pale brown hairs. Seven to 12 flowers are grouped in branched clusters in the leaf
axils. The white petals, fused to form a cylindrical tube about 0.5 in (12 mm) long, emerge from a radially symmetrical
calyx, 0.2 in (5 mm) long, that is cleft from one-half to two-thirds its length. Each calyx lobe, narrowly triangular
in shape, is sparsely hairy on the outside and hairless within. The fruits are white oval berries about 0.6 in (1.6 cm)
long that contain many seeds about 0.02 in (0.5 mm) long. 

Cyrtandra polyantha

 is distinguished from other species in the genus by the texture and hairiness of the leaf surfaces and the length, shape,
and degree of cleft of the calyx. This species differs from 

C. crenata

 by the lack of short-stalked glands and by its leathery leaves, opposite leaf arrangement, and radially symmetrical
calyx (Clarke 1883, St. John 1966, Wagner 

et al.

 1990). 

Historically, 

Cyrtandra polyantha

 was known from the Kalihi region and from Kulepiamoa Ridge above Niu Valley on the leeward (southwest) side of the southern
Koolau Mountains (HHP 1991d2, 1991d3; St. John 1966). Two populations, located farther south on Kuliouou summit
ridge and at the northwest head of Hahaione Valley (HHP 1991d1, 1991d4), are approximately 1 mi (1.6 km) apart on private
and State land. One of the populations has not been visited within the past 50 years; it is not known how many individuals
remain. The most recently observed population, last seen in 1953, consists of one individual. The total number of
extant individuals is not known, although only a few are believed to remain on ridges of disturbed mesic valleys in
'ohi'a forests at elevations between 1,600 to 2,000 ft (490 and 610 m) (HHP 1991d1, 1991d2, 1991d4). 

Cyrtandra polyantha

 probably grows in association with 'uki, uluhe, 

Broussaisia arguta

 (kanawao), 

Coprosma foliosa

 (pilo), and 

Psychotria

 (kopiko), taxa commonly found in the 
'ohi
'a-dominated forests of the Koolau Mountains (S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1991). The primary threat to 

C. polyantha

 is stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of remaining individuals and
their restricted distribution. 



Eugenia koolauensis

 was first described by Otto Degener (1932b) from a specimen that he and K.K. Park collected from Kaipapau Valley in
the Koolau Mountains; it is named after its type locality. In 1957, Kenneth Wilson and Joseph Rock described a new species,


E. molokaiensis,

 based upon a collection made by Rock in 1918 from Maunaloa on the island of Molokai (Wilson 1957). Current classification
synonymizes the two species (Wagner 

et al.

 1990). 



Eugenia koolauensis,

 a member of the myrtle family (Myrtaceae), is a small tree or shrub between 7 and 23 ft (2 and 7 m) tall with branch tips
covered with dense brown hairs. The leathery, oval or elliptic leaves, 0.8 to 2 in (2 to 5 cm) long and 0.4 to 1.3 in (1 to
3.3 cm) wide, are densely hairy on the lower surface and have margins that curve under the leaves. One or two flowers
grow from the leaf axils on stalks 0.04 to 0.3 in (1 to 8 mm) long. The hypanthium (basal portion of the flower) is cone-shaped,
about 0.1 in (3 mm) long, and hairy. The four sepals of unequal length that comprise the hypanthium are attached to a
circular nectary disk (fleshy, nectar-producing structure). The four white petals, which are oval or elliptic and
0.2 to 0.3 in (4 to 8 mm) long, enclose numerous white stamens and are also attached to the nectary disk. The fruits are
fleshy, yellow to red, oval berries, 0.3 to 0.8 in (0.8 to 2 cm) long, that usually contain one round seed. 

Eugenia koolauensis

 is one of two species in the genus that are native to Hawaii. It differs from the other species in having leaves that are
densely hairy on the lower surface and leaf margins that curve under the leaves (Degener 1932b, Wagner 

et al.

 1990, Wilson 1957).

Eugenia koolauensis

 was historically known from Maunaloa on western Molokai and from Kaipapau Valley, Hanaimoa and Kahawainui gulches,
and a gully southeast of Kahuku on Oahu (HHP 1991e1, 1991e2, 1991e4, 1991e6, 1991e7; Wilson 1957). This species is
no longer believed to be extant on the island of Molokai because the region where the first two individuals were found
has been converted to pineapple fields (CPC 1990). On Oahu, five populations now remain on State and private land in
Papali Gulch, the north fork of Kamananui Stream, in the regions of Pupukea and Paumalu in the northern Koolau Mountains,
and at Hawaiiloa, a disjunct population in the southeastern Koolau Mountains (Garnett 1990; HHP 1991e3, 1991e5,
1991e8; HPCC 1991b1, 1991b2; J. Obata and S. Perlman, pers. comms., 1991). A total of fewer than 60 individuals of this
species remain in dry gulches and ridges in mesic forests dominated by 'ohi 'a and/or lama at 350 to 1,000 ft (100 to 300
m) in elevation (HHP 1991e3, 1991e5, 1991e8; Wagner et al. 1990). Other associated plant taxa include 

Myrsine lessertiana

 (kolea), 

Nestegis sandwicensis

 (olopua), 

Pleomele halapepe

 (hala pepe), and 

Psydrax odoratum

 (alahe
'e) (HHP 1991e5 to 1991e8; HPCC 1991b1, 1991b2; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1991). Habitat degradation by feral pigs
and competition with alien plant taxa (Christmas berry, Koster's curse, strawberry guava, 

Lantana camara

 (lantana)) are the major threats to 

Eugenia koolauensis

. The limited numbers of this species make it vulnerable to stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor
due to the small number of individuals and limited gene pool. 

The first specimen of 

Hesperomannia

 was collected by Horace Mann, Jr. on the summit of the island of Lanai in 1864 (Brigham 1868, Degener 1932c). Asa Gray
(1865) named the genus after its discoverer and also gave it the specific name 

arborescens

 for its tree-like habit (Brigham 1868). Other names which refer to this species are 

H. bushiana

 (Degener 1935), 

H. swezeyi

 (Degener 1933), and 

H. bushiana

 var. 

fosbergii

 (Degener 1937). According to Warren L. Wagner and others (1990), the last treatment of 

Hesperomannia

 (Carlquist 1957), which designates three subspecies (subspecies 

arborescens, bushiana,

 and 

swezeyi

) based on leaf shape, achene (dry, one-seeded fruit) size, and number of heads, does not seem to delimit geographical
or ecological entities, and therefore these subspecies do not warrant formal recognition. 



Hesperomannia arborescens 

is a small shrubby tree of the aster family (Asteraceae) that usually stands 5 to 16 ft (1.5 to 5 m) tall. Its typically
hairless leaves, 4 to 8 in (10 to 20 cm) long and 1 to 3 in (3 to 8 cm) wide, range from oval to lance-shaped and are about two
to four times as long as they are wide. The flower heads, which are about 2.4 in (6 cm) long, are either erect or ascending,
and grow singly or in clusters of 2 to 10. They grow on thick fuzzy stalks 0.2 to 0.6 in (4 to 15 mm) long and about 0.1 in (3
mm) in diameter. The involucre (set of bracts) that surrounds each flower head is between 0.8 and 1.4 in (2 and 3.5 cm)
high, the longest individual bracts growing to 1.1 in (2.8 cm). The yellow to yellowish brown florets that comprise
each head are about 0.9 to 1.2 in (2.4 to 3 cm) long and develop into 0.5 in (1.3 cm) long achenes (dry, one-seeded, fruits)
topped with yellowish brown or purple-tinged bristles. This member of an endemic Hawaiian genus differs from other


Hesperomannia

 species in having the following combination of characters: Erect to ascending flower heads; thick flower head stalks;
and usually hairless and relatively narrow leaves (Brigham 1868; Carlquist 1957; Degener 1932c, 1933, 1935; Gray
1865; Hillebrand 1888; Marticorena and Parra 1975; Rock 1913; Wagner 

et al.

 1990).

Hesperomannia arborescens 

was formerly known from locations on three islands: Kaiholena and Kukui on Lanai; Pelekunu Trail on Molokai; and scattered
populations throughout the Koolau Mountains, from Koolauloa and Pupukea at its northern extreme to Konahuanui at
the southern end (Forbes 1920; HHP 1991f1 to 1991f10, 1991f12 to 1991f16, 1991f22). This species is now known from
18 populations totalling fewer than 70 plants on the islands of Oahu, Molokai, and Maui. On Oahu, 15 populations, which
total about 50 to 60 individuals, have been observed since 1958 on private, Honolulu City and County, State, and Federal
lands at a few disjunct locations over a distance of about 27 mi (43 km). Locations include: upslope of Kahuku, Laie,
and Malaekahana; along Poamoho Trail above Poamoho Stream; along Waikane-Schofield Trail near the ridge summit;
at Kipapa Gulch; on Halawa Ridge; and upper Palolo Valley to Niu Valley (HHP 1991f1, 1991f3, 1991f5, 1991f7, 1991f8,
1991f10, 1991f17 to 1991f21, 1993a1 to 1993a4; HPCC 1990b1; Marticorena and Parra 1975; Derral Herbst, U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, and S. Perlman, pers. comms., 1991). The Waikane-Schofield population occurs on the boundary
of State (Ewa Forest Reserve) and Federal (Schofield Barracks Military Reservation) lands. On Molokai, one population
of three individuals was found on State land in Olokui Natural Area Reserve (NAR) (HHP 1991f11; HPCC 1991c; S. Perlman,
pers. comm., 1991). A recent discovery in 1989 by Joel Lau of TNCH extends this species' range to the island of Maui,
where two colonies totalling three individuals were discovered about 0.3 mi (0.5 km) apart on State land in West Maui
NAR between Lanilili and Keahikauo (HHP 1991f23; HPCC 1990b2; J. Lau and S. Perlman, pers. comms., 1991). 

Hesperomannia arborescens,

 often found on slopes or ridges in association with 'ohi'a, olopua, uluhe, 

Antidesma platyphyllum

 (hame), kopiko, 

Syzygium,

 and common 

Melicope

 species, typically grows in lowland wet forests and occasionally in scrub vegetation between 1,200 and 2,500 ft (360
and 750 m) in elevation (HHP 1991; HHP 1991f1 to 1991f3, 1991f5 to 1991f10, 1991f13 to 1991f18, 1991f20, 1991f22, 1991f23,
1993a1 to 1993a4; HPCC 1991c; Wagner 

et al. 

1990; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1991). The Molokai population grows in lama- and/or 'ohi'a-dominated lowland mesic forest
habitat within the same elevational range (HHP 1991f11; HPCC 1991c). The major threats to 

Hesperomannia arborescens

 are habitat degradation by feral pigs and goats, competition with alien plant taxa (Hilo grass, Koster's curse, strawberry
guava, 

Tibouchina herbacea

), fire, and impact by humans. Stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to this species' limited
numbers are significant threats as well. 



Lobelia oahuensis,

 named by Rock (1918, 1919) for the island on which the type specimen was collected, was transferred to the genus 

Neowimmeria

 by the Degeners in 1974; a genus not accepted by current authorities (Lammers 1990). 



Lobelia oahuensis,

 a member of the bellflower family, is a stout, erect, unbranched shrub 3 to 10 ft (1 to 3 m) tall. The elliptic leaves,
which are 16 to 24 in (40 to 60 cm) long and 1.6 to 2.4 in (4 to 6 cm) wide, are typically stalkless and form a very dense rosette
at the end of the stem. The upper surface of the leaves is hairless and the lower surface is covered with rather coarse
grayish or greenish hairs. The inflorescence is branched 3 to 5 times from its base, with each erect spike 3 to 5 ft (0.1
to 1.5 m) tall and comprised of 50 to 200 flowers. Each flower measures 1.7 to 1.8 in (42 to 45 mm) long and about 0.2 in (5
mm) wide, with a 1.2 in (3 cm) long bract just below it. The linear calyx lobes are about 0.6 in (16 mm) long and 0.1 in (3
mm) wide. The fruits are hairy, oval capsules 0.4 to 0.7 in (10 to 17 mm) long and about 0.4 in (9 mm) wide that contain numerous
brownish seeds. 

Lobelia oahuensis 

differs from other members of the genus in having the following combination of characters: Erect stems 3 to 10 ft (1
to 3 m) long; dense rosettes of leaves at the end of stems; lower leaf surfaces covered with coarse grayish or greenish
hairs; and flowers 1.7 to 1.8 in (42 to 45 mm) long (Lammers 1990; Rock 1918, 1919; St. John and Hosaka 1935).

Historically, 

Lobelia oahuensis 

was known from Kahana Ridge, Kipapa Gulch, and the southeastern Koolau Mountains of Oahu (HHP 1991g1, 1991g4 to 1991g7;
St. John and Hosaka 1935). Nine populations totalling between 100 and 200 individuals are located on private and State
land or on the boundary of private, State, City and County, and Federal lands. 

Lobelia oahuensis 

grows on steep slopes along Koolau Mountain ridgetops from Waikane and Halawa to Mount Olympus and the summit ridges
above Kuliouou and Waimanalo, a distance of about 17 mi (27 km) (HHP 1991g1 to 1991g3, 1991g6, 1991g8 to 1991g10; HPCC
1991d; J. Obata and S. Perlman, pers. comms., 1991). Ken Wood of HPCC and Joel Lau of TNCH recently discovered a single
mature individual of 

L. oahuensis

 on the boundary between State land and Schofield Barracks Military Reservation, extending the distribution of this
species to the Waianae Mountain Range of Oahu (J. Lau and Kenneth Wood, HPCC, pers. comms., 1993). These nine populations
are located between elevations of 2,800 and 3,000 ft (850 and 920 m) on summit cliffs in cloudswept wet forests or in
areas of low shrub cover that are frequently exposed to heavy wind and rain (HHP 1991g1 to 1991g3, 1991g6 to 1991g10;
HPCC 1991d; Lammers 1990). Associated plant taxa include 'ohi'a, uluhe, 'uki, 

Cheirodendron trigynum

 (olapa), 

Dubautia laxa

 (na'ena'e pua melemele), and 

Labordia hosakana

 (kamakahala) (HHP 1991g1, 1991g2, 1991g7, 1991g8, 1991g10; HPCC 1991d; J. Obata, pers. comm., 1991). The noxious
alien plant Koster's curse is the primary threat to 

Lobelia oahuensis 

because it effectively competes with this species for water, space, light, and nutrients. 



Lycopodium nutans 

was described by William D. Brackenridge in 1854 from a specimen collected from the ``high mountains'' of Oahu by Charles
Wilkes, commander of the U.S. Exploring Expedition of 1840 on which Brackenridge was the horticulturist (Ollgaard
1989). The specific epithet is probably in reference to the species' ``nodding'' or pendant spikes. Other names by
which this species has been known include 

Huperzia nutans

, 

Lycopodium phyllanthus

 var. 

nutans

, and 

Urostachys nutans

, which are not accepted by current authorities (Ollgaard 1989). 



Lycopodium nutans

 is an erect or pendulous herbaceous epiphyte (plant growing above ground on other plants) of the clubmoss family (Lycopodiaceae).
Its stiff, light green branches, 10 to 16 in (25 to 40 cm) long and about 0.2 in (6 mm) thick, are covered with stiff, flat,
leathery leaves, 0.5 to 0.6 in (12 to 16 mm) long and about 0.1 
in (2.5 mm) wide that overlap at acute angles. The leaves are arranged in six rows and arise directly from the branches.
The branches end in thick, 2.8 to 5.1 in (7 to 13 cm) long fruiting spikes that are unbranched or branch once or twice,
and taper toward a downward-curving tip. Bracts on the fruiting spikes, between 0.1 and 0.2 in (3 to 5 mm) long, are densely
layered and conceal the spore capsules. This species can be distinguished from others of the genus in Hawaii by its
epiphytic habit, simple or forking fruiting spikes, and larger and stiffer leaves (Degener 1934, Hillebrand 1888,
Wagner and Wagner 1987). 

Historically, 

Lycopodium nutans 

was known from the island of Kauai and from scattered locations in the Koolau Mountains of Oahu bounded by Kaluanui
Valley to the north, Paalaa to the west, and Mount Tantalus to the south (HHP 1991h1 to 1991h9; Skottsberg 1936). This
species is now known from only two sites within its historical range: Kaluanui Valley; and along Waikane-Schofield
Trail on Oahu. One population, located on State land, was described as ``scarce'' when last observed in 1965 (HHP 1991h3).
The other population, located about 5 mi (8 km) away on the boundary of State (Ewa Forest Reserve) and Federal lands
(Schofield Barracks Military Reservation), grew in ``several places'' according to its collector in 1961 (HHP 1991h4).

Two individuals of this population were observed in 1993 by Joel Lau, TNCH (HHP 1993b1, 1993b2). The entire species
totals fewer than 50 known individuals. 

Lycopodium nutans 

grows on tree trunks, usually on open ridges and slopes in 'ohi'a-dominated wet forests and occasionally mesic forests
(HHP 1991h5 to 1991h7, Hosaka 1937) between 2,000 and 3,500 ft (600 and 1,070 m) in elevation (Robinson 1914, Selling
1946). The vegetation in those areas typically includes kanawao, uluhe, 'uki, 

Hibiscus 

sp., hame, and kopiko (HHP 1993b1, 1993b2; S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1991). The primary threat to 

L

. 

nutans 

is stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor because of the small number of remaining individuals
and limited distribution. Additional threats to 

L. nutans 

are the noxious alien plants Koster's curse and strawberry guava. 

Hillebrand (1888) described 

Pelea lydgatei 

based on a collection by John M. Lydgate from Palolo Valley, Oahu. In an action not accepted by other taxonomists, Emmanuel
Drake del Castillo (1890) transferred the species to the genus 

Evodia

. In 1944, St. John described two new species, 

P. descendens

 and 

P. semiternata

, which he later determined were synonymous (St. John 1979). Current authorities, however, do not accept St. John's
species as being sufficiently different from 

P. lydgatei 

to maintain them as distinct taxa. Thomas G. Hartley and Benjamin C. Stone (1989, Stone 

et al

. 1990, Wagner 

et al

. 1990) synonymized the genus 

Pelea

 with 

Melicope

, resulting in the present combination. 



Melicope lydgatei 

is a small shrub of the citrus family (Rutaceae) that has leaves arranged oppositely or in threes. The glossy, papery
leaves, which are 1.6 to 5.1 in (4 to 13 cm) long and 0.6 to 2.6 in (1.5 to 6.5 cm) wide, vary from lance-shaped to oblong.
Flowers are usually functionally unisexual, with both unisexual and bisexual flowers growing on the same plant.
Its aromatic, greenish white flowers are about 0.2 to 0.3 in (4 to 7 mm) long and arise singly or in clusters of two or three.
The four-lobed capsules, which have sections fused for one-fourth to one-third their length, are between 0.6 and
0.9 in (14 and 22 mm) wide, and contain one or two glossy black seeds, about 0.2 in (5 mm) long, in each section. Both the
exocarp and endocarp (outermost and innermost layers of the fruit wall, respectively) are hairless. The species'
leaf arrangement (opposite or in groups of three), the amount of fusion of the fruit sections, and the hairless exocarp
and endocarp distinguish it from others in the genus (Hillebrand 1888; St. John 1944, 1979; Stone 1969; Wagner 

et al

. 1990). 



Melicope lydgatei 

was formerly known throughout the Koolau Mountains of Oahu from Hauula to Kahana, Kipapa Gulch to Waimano, and Kalihi
Valley to Wailupe Valley (HHP 1991i1 to 1991i8, 1991i10 to 1991i12, 1993c). Only three populations totalling fewer
than 10 individuals, distributed over a 7.5 mi (12 km) distance, remain within its historical range: Along Poamoho
Trail near the boundary of State (Ewa Forest Reserve) and private lands; along Manana Trail, growing on State land
in Ewa Forest Reserve; and along Peahinaia Trail on private lands (HHP 1991i9, 1991i13, 1993c). This species typically
grows in association with 

Acacia koa 

(koa), 'ohi'a, uluhe, kopiko, and 

Bobea elatior 

('ahakea lau nui) on open ridges in mesic forests and occasionally in wet forests at elevations between 1,350 and 1,800
ft (410 and 550 m) (HHP 1991i2, 1991i4 to 1991i6, 1991i8 to 1991i10, 1991i12, 1991i13, 1993c; Stone 

et al.

 1990). The primary threat to 

M. lydgatei 

is stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor because the few individuals that remain are restricted
in distribution. 

In 1826, Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupre described 

Rollandia crispa 

from a fragmentary specimen of a leaf he collected. Gaudichaud-Beaupre probably assigned it the specific epithet
based on the crisp or crimped leaf margin (Rock 1919). Names to which this species have been referred are 

Lobelia crispa 

(Endlicher 1836), 

R. crispa 

var. 

muricata 

(Rock 1919), 

R. grandifolia 

(Hillebrand 1888), and the illegitimate name, 

Cyanea rollandia 

(Gray 1861).

Rollandia crispa

, a member of the bellflower family, is an unbranched shrub with leaves clustered at the ends of succulent stems. The
broad oval leaves, 12 to 30 in (30 to 75 cm) long and 3.5 to 6.3 in (9 to 16 cm) wide, have undulating, smooth or toothed leaf
margins. Each leaf is on a stalk 0.3 to 1.6 in (0.8 to 4 cm) long. Clusters of three to eight fuzzy flowers grow on stalks
0.8 to 1.2 in (2 to 3 cm) long, with each flower borne on a stalk 0.4 to 0.8 in (1 to 2 cm) long. The calyx lobes are oval or oblong,
0.2 to 0.5 in (6 to 12 mm) long, and often overlapping at their base. The fused petals, 1.6 to 2.4 in (4 to 6 cm) long and fuzzy,
are pale magenta with darker longitudinal stripes. The fruits are spherical berries 0.4 in (1 cm) in diameter, that
contain many minute, dark seeds. 

Rollandia crispa 

is distinguished from other species in this endemic Hawaiian genus by its leaf shape, distinct calyx lobes, and the
length of the flowers and stalks of flower clusters (de Candolle 1839, Hillebrand 1888, Lammers 1990, Rock 1919, Wawra
1873). 

Historically, 

Rollandia crispa 

was known from scattered locations throughout the upper elevations of the Koolau Mountains of Oahu from Kaipapau
Valley to the north to Waialae Iki Ridge to the southeast (HHP 1991j1 to 1991j15, 1991j17 to 1991j19; Skottsberg 1926).
This species is now known from State and private lands in Hidden Valley (26 plants), Palolo Valley (1 plant), Kapakahi
Gulch (1 plant), and Pia Valley (1 plant) (HHP 1991j8, 1991j16, 1991j17; HPCC 1990c; Lammers 1990; D. Herbst, J. Obata,
K. Nagata, B.P. Bishop Museum, S. Perlman, pers. comms., 1991; L. Mehrhoff, pers. comm., 1993). The four populations
are scattered over a distance of about 19 mi (31 km). Three of the populations contain a single, mature, flowering individual.
The other population (Hidden Valley) contains 7 mature, flowering plants and 19 juvenile plants, giving a total of
fewer than 30 individuals for the entire species. 

Rollandia crispa 

is found in habitats ranging from steep, open mesic forests to gentle slopes or moist gullies of closed wet forests,
at elevations between 600 and 2,400 ft (185 and 730 m) (HHP 1991j2, 1991j5, 1991j8, 1991j9, 1991j12, 1991j13, 1991j16;
HPCC 1990c). Associated plant taxa include ke'oke'o, 

Cyanea acuminata 

(haha), 

Microsorum spectrum 

(NCN), common 

Cyrtandra 

species, 

Pisonia, Touchardia latifolia 

(olona), and the introduced strawberry guava, 'awa, kukui, and 

Cordyline fruticosa

 (ti) (HHP 1991j8, 1991j16; J. Obata, pers. comm., 1991; L. Mehrhoff, pers. comm., 1993). The major threats to 

R. crispa 

are habitat alteration and predation by feral pigs, competition with noxious alien plant taxa (Koster's curse and
strawberry guava), and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of remaining
individuals, their limited gene pool, and restricted distribution.

Based on a specimen collected by Lydgate in Niu Valley on Oahu, Hillebrand described 

Pterotropia gymnocarpa

, the specific epithet referring to its entirely free and naked (lacking a covering) fruit (Hillebrand 1888). Sherff
(1952) renamed the species 

Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa

 and split the species into four varieties (varieties 

pupukeensis, leptocarpa, megalocarpa

, and 

gymnocarpa

) (Sherff 1952, 1953) that are considered synonymous in the latest treatment of the genus (Lowrey 1990). Other names
by which this species has been known include 

Pterotropia gymnocarpa

 var. 

pupukeensis

 (Degener 1938), 

Heptapleurum gymnocarpum

 (Drake del Castillo 1890), and 

Dipanax gymnocarpa

 (Heller 1897). 



Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa

, a member of the ginseng family (Araliaceae), is a tree 8 to 33 ft (2.5 to 10 m) tall, either hairless or with fuzzy, short-lived
hairs on the young leaves and flower clusters. The leaves are 12 to 22 in (30 to 55 cm) long with 7 to 21 leathery, oval to
elliptic leaflets per leaf. Each leaflet is 2.8 to 7.1 in (7 to 18 cm) long and 1.2 to 3.1 in (3 to 8 cm) wide, and is folded
upward along the midvein. The flowers are usually arranged in threes or in an umbrella-shaped arrangement. Petals
are 0.2 to 0.3 in (4 to 8 mm) long and usually number 5 or 6 per flower, with an equal number of stamens. The ovary, which
usually has 3 or 4 sections, appears placed atop the receptacle (base of the flower) in a superior position, due to the
expansion of the ovary disk (outgrowth of the receptacle) and the reduction of the hypanthium (basal portion of the
flower). Fruits are purplish, oval or top-shaded drupes, 0.2 to 0.5 in (6 to 12 mm) long, that enclose a papery endocarp
and single seeds. 

Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa

 is distinguished from all other species in the genus in that its ovary appears fully superior (Degener 1938; Degener
and Degener 1962a, 1962b; Hillebrand 1888; Lowrey 1990; Sherff 1952, 1955). 


Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa

 was historically known from Punaluu, Waikakalaua Gulch, Mount Olympus, and the region between Niu and Wailupe, all
in the Koolau Mountains of Oahu (Degener 1938; HHP 1991k3, 1991k12 to 1991k14). Fifteen populations are now scattered
along the summit ridges of the Koolau Mountains over a distance of 28 mi (45 km), from the region of Paumalu at the northern
extreme to Kuliouou and Waimanalo at the southeasternmost point (HHP 1991k1, 1991k2, 1991k4 to 1991k11, 1991k15
to 1991k18, 1993c1, 1993d2; HPCC 1991e; S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1991). One population in the Waianae Mountains,
located on Palikea ridge on the border of Federal and private lands, was last visited in 1954; it is not known whether
it still exists (HHP 1991k8). Most populations contain between one and six individuals, giving a total of fewer than
40 individuals for the entire species. However, because 

T. gymnocarpa

 is difficult to distinguish from other species when infertile, the total number of individuals may be as high as ``a
few hundred'' (J. Obata, pers. comm., 1991). 

Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa

 is typically found on windswept summit ridges or in gullies in wet or sometimes mesic forests between elevations of
820 and 2,790 ft (250 and 850 m) with such associated plant taxa as 'ohi'a, olapa, uluhe, kopiko, 

Labordia tinifolia

 (kamakahala), and 

Myrsine fosbergii

 (kolea) (HHP 1991k1, 1991k2, 1991k4 to 1991k7, 1991k9, 1991k11, 1991k14, 1991k15, 1991k17, 1991k18, 1993d1; HPCC
1991e; Lowrey 1990). The major threats to 

T. gymnocarpa

 are competition with the alien plant taxon Koster's curse, feral pigs, and reduced reproductive vigor due to the limited
gene pool because of the small number of extant individuals. 



Previous Federal Action 



Federal action on these plants began as a result of section 12 of the Act, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States.
This report, designated as House Document No. 94-51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. In that document,


Cyrtandra crenata, Cyrtandra polyantha, Hesperomannia arborescens

 (as 

H. arborescens

 ssp. 

bushiana

 and ssp. 

swezeyi

), 

Lobelia oahuensis, Melicope lydgatei

 (as 

Pelea lydgatei

 and 

P. descendens

), and 

Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa

 (as 

T. gymnocarpa

 var. 

pupukeensis

) were considered to be endangered. 

Huperzia nutans

 (as 

Lycopodium nutans

) was considered to be threatened, and 

Chamaesyce deppeana

 (as 

Euphorbia deppeana

) and 

Eugenia koolauensis

 (as 

Eugenia molokaiana

) were considered to be extinct. On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonian report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section
4(b)(3)) of the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant species named therein. As a
result of that review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 (41 FR 24523) to determine endangered status pursuant to section 4 of the Act for approximately 1,700 vascular plant
species, including all of the above taxa considered to be endangered or threatened or thought to be extinct. The list
of 1,700 plant species was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the Smithsonian Institution and
the Service in response to House Document No. 94-51 and the July 1, 1975, 

Federal Register

 publication.

General comments received in response to the 1976 proposal are summarized in an April 26, 1978, 

Federal Register

 publication (43 FR 17909). In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over two years old be withdrawn.
A one-year grace period was given to proposals already over two years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published
a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, along with four other
proposals that had expired. The Service published updated notices of review for plants on December 15, 1980 (45 FR
82479), September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39525), and February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6183). In at least one of these notices, eight
of the species (including synonymous taxa) that had been in the 1976 proposed rule were treated as category 1 candidates
for Federal listing. Category 1 species are those for which the Service has on file substantial information on biological
vulnerability and threats to support preparation of listing proposals. Other than 

Chamaesyce deppeana

 (as 

Euphorbia deppeana

), 

Huperzia nutans

 (as 

Lycopodium nutans

), 

Melicope lydgatei

 (as 

Pelea lydgatei

 and 

P. descendens

) and 

Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa

 (as 

T. gymnocarpa

 var. 

pupukeensis

), all the aforementioned species that were either proposed as endangered or threatened or thought to be extinct in
the June 16, 1976, proposed rule were considered category 1 candidates in all three notices of review. 

Melicope lydgatei

 (as 

Pelea lydgatei

 and 

P. descendens

), a category 1 species in the 1980 and 1985 notices, was conferred category 1* status in the 1990 notice. Category 1*
species are those which are possibly extinct; however, because new information regarding this species' existence
has become available, it was proposed for listing. In the 1980 and 1985 notices, 

Huperzia nutans

 (as 

Lycopodium nutans

) was considered a category 2 species and 

Chamaesyce deppeana

 (as 

Euphorbia deppeana

) a category 3A species. Category 2 species are those for which there is some evidence of vulnerability, but for which
there are not enough data to support listing proposals at the time. Category 3A species are those for which the Service
has persuasive evidence of extinction. For those two species, because new information provided support for listing
or indicated their current existence, they were conferred category 1 status in the 1990 notice. 

Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa

 var. 

pupukeensis

 appeared as a category 3B species in the 1980 and 1985 notices; in the 1990 notice, it was considered synonymous with


T. gymnocarpa

, a category 1 species. Category 3B species are those which, on the basis of current taxonomic understanding, do not
represent distinct taxa meeting the Act's definition of ``species.'' 

Cyanea truncata

 and 

Rollandia crispa

 first appeared in the 1990 notice, as a category 1 species. 

Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make findings on petitions that present substantial information
indicating the petitioned action may be warranted within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments
further requires all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted on that date.
On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of these species was warranted, but precluded by
other pending listing actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act; notification of this finding
was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the Service to consider the petition as having
been submitted, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed in October of 1984, 1985, 1986,
1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. Publication of the proposal constituted the final one-year finding for these 11
plant taxa. 

On October 14, 1992, the Service published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 47028) a proposal to list 11 plant taxa from the Koolau Mountain Range, island of Oahu, as endangered. This proposal
was based primarily on information supplied by the Hawaii Heritage Program, the Hawaii Plant Conservation Center,
and observations by botanists and naturalists. The Service now determines 11 species primarily from the Koolau Mountain
Range to be endangered with the publication of this rule.

In the October 14, 1992, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit
factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final rule. The public comment period
ended on December 14, 1992. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations,
and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A newspaper notice inviting public comment
was published in the ``Honolulu Advertiser'' on October 23, 1992. Only one letter of comment was received, from a conservation
organization, supporting the listing of these taxa from the Koolau Mountain Range, island of Oahu, but raising no
specific issues.

A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range 



The native vegetation of the Koolau Mountains and adjacent areas has undergone extreme alterations because of past
and present land management practices, including deliberate alien plant and animal introductions, agricultural
development, military use, and recreational use (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Wagner 

et al

. 1985). Degradation of habitat by feral pigs and competition with alien plants are considered the greatest present
threats to the 11 plant taxa in this final rule. 

Feral pigs (

Sus scrofa

) have been in the Koolau Mountains for about 150 years and are known to be one of the major modifiers of wet forest habitats
(Stone 1985). Pigs damage the native vegetation by rooting and trampling the forest floor, which encourages the spread
of alien plant taxa that are better able to exploit the newly tilled soils than are native taxa (Cuddihy and Stone 1990,
Stone 1985). Feral pigs also feed on the starchy interior of tree ferns (

Cibotium

) and other succulent-stemmed plants (See Factor C). The last known population of three individuals of 

Cyanea truncata

 in Hidden Valley was destroyed in recent years by feral pigs (CPC 1989a, 1989b, 1990; HHP 1991b1). The continued impact
of pigs poses an immediate and severe threat to any plants of 

Cyanea truncata

 that may remain (L. Mehrhoff, pers. comm., 1993). Habitat degradation and predation of 

Rollandia crispa

 by pigs has been observed at the Hidden Valley population (L. Mehrhoff, pers. comm., 1993). Feral pigs are known to
frequent regions of the Koolau Mountains and threaten to destroy the habitat of 

Eugenia koolauensis

, 

Hesperomannia arborescens

, 

Lobelia oahuensis

, 

Rollandia crispa

, and 

Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa

 (HHP 1991f10, 1991g5, 1991j16, 1993a3, 1993d2; HPCC 1990b1, 1990c; K. Nagata and S. Perlman, pers. comms., 1991).
The only population of 

Hesperomannia arborescens

 on Maui is threatened by pigs as well (HHP 1991f23, HPCC 1990b2). 

Goats (

Capra hircus

) have become established on the island of Molokai as well as other major Hawaiian islands (Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii)
(Cuddihy and Stone 1990, van Riper and van Riper 1982). Goats are managed in Hawaii as a game animal, but are able to forage
in extremely rugged terrain and populate inaccessible areas where hunting has little effect on their numbers (Culliney
1988, HHP 1990). Feral goats eat native vegetation, trample roots and seedlings, cause erosion, and promote the invasion
of alien plants. On Molokai, goats degrade dry forests at low elevations and they are expanding their range (Cuddihy
and Stone 1990; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1991). Goats browse on introduced and native plants, especially in dry, open ecosystems
similar to that found between Wailau and Waiehu on the island of Molokai. In 1989, it was observed that numerous goats
occupied the Wailau-Waiehu area and threatened the survival of the only population of 

Hesperomannia arborescens

 on the island (HHP 1991f11). Although there is no longer a large feral goat population on Oahu, the effects of the goat
trade in the early 1820s, which allowed goats to proliferate without being confined by fences, and resultant damage
by goats to the native flora have permanently altered Oahu's native ecosystems (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Culliney
1988, Tomich 1986). Today, little of the original forests of the Koolau Mountains remain (Wagner 

et al

. 1985).

Like goats, cattle (

Bos taurus

) were once abundant on Oahu. Because of past restrictions on hunting, widespread ranching, and ineffective confinement
of the animals, the goat and cattle population boomed and spread to many parts of the island (Culliney 1988). The impact
of cattle on the native vegetation was similar to that described for goats (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Scott 

et al

. 1986, Tomich 1986). It was not until local land managers recognized the extent of destruction of native vegetation
by these animals that their numbers were controlled. However, by then much of the plant cover on cattle-grazing land
on Oahu and other islands was already degraded. Such areas remained grassland for many years following the removal
of cattle (Culliney 1988). Although not a current threat to the taxa in this rule, cattle that once roamed through the
Koolau Mountains contributed to the reduction in the range of many native plants, probably including at least some
of the 11 plant taxa.

Fire immediately threatens 2 of the 11 plant taxa (See Table 1) and poses a possible threat to 8 other taxa. Because Hawaii's
native plants have evolved with only infrequent, naturally occurring episodes of fire (lava flows, infrequent lightning
strikes), most species are not adapted to fire and are unable to recover well after recurring human-set fires. Alien
plants are often more fire-adapted than native taxa and will quickly exploit suitable habitat after a fire (Cuddihy
and Stone 1990). Species that grow in dry and mesic vegetation communities (including all of the 11 plant taxa except
the wet forest and shrubland species, 

Lobelia oahuensis

) may be susceptible to accidentally or maliciously set fires, especially near areas of habitation from which fires
could easily spread. In the past 14 or 15 years, approximately 8 to 10 fires occurred in conservation districts under
the jurisdiction of the Hawaii Division of Forestry and Wildlife in the low elevation slopes of the Koolau Mountains
(Earl Pawn, State Division of Forestry and Wildlife, pers. comm., 1991). Although the fires were contained within
small areas, the possibility remains for such fires to spread upslope into habitat occupied by the endangered species,
especially during the dry summer months. Fires have been reported from dry and mesic regions in the Koolau Mountains,
threatening 

Hesperomannia arborescens

 and 

Chamaesyce deppeana

 (HHP 1991a, 1991f1). A fire in the vicinity of the population spread fueled by alien and naturalized grasses and brisk
updrafts typical of the area, although the extent of the fire on Nuuanu Pali is not known. 

Although the northern Koolau Mountains are mostly State or privately owned, large parcels are leased to the U.S. Army
(Wagner 

et al

. 1985). Military training exercises and ground maneuvers are occasionally conducted in those areas, especially
along the summit ridges and in various locations above Kahuku. Because of the steep terrain, training areas are restricted
to foot travel; tanks and other off-road vehicles are not utilized. Vehicles are only used on roads or trails (Alton
Kanno, Environmental Management Office, U.S. Army Support Command, Hawaii, pers. comm., 1991), but the potential
for affecting one population of 

Hesperomannia arborescens

 that grows along a jeep trail exists (HHP 1991f10). Trampling by ground troops associated with training activities
could also affect other endangered species, including populations of 

Eugenia koolauensis

, 

Hesperomannia arborescens

, 

Lobelia oahuensis

, 

Lycopodium nutans

, 

Melicope lydgatei

, and 

Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa

 that occur on land leased or owned by the Army (HHP 1991e3, 1991e8, 1991f1, 1991f10, 1991f17, 1991f20, 1991f21, 1991h4,
1991i9, 1991k4, 1991k6, 1991k9).

B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes 



Unrestricted collecting for scientific or horticultural purposes and excessive visits by individuals interested
in seeing rare plants are potential threats to all of the endangered species, but especially to 

Cyanea truncata

, 

Cyrtandra crenata

, 

Cyrtandra polyantha

, and 

Melicope lydgatei

, each of which has a total of 10 or fewer individuals. Any collection of whole plants or reproductive parts of any of
these four species would cause an adverse impact on the gene pool and threaten the survival of the species. The proximity
of approximately 30 percent of the known individuals of 

Chamaesyce deppeana

 to a major scenic lookout, some within 15 ft (5 m) of heavy pedestrian traffic, poses a threat to a significant proportion
of the entire species (J. Lau and J. Obata, pers. comms., 1991). Its accessibility also may make the plants attractive
to collectors. One population of 

Hesperomannia arborescens

 is located close to a trail and, thus, is easily accessible to visitors (HHP 1991f1). Populations of 

Chamaesyce deppeana, Lobelia oahuensis

, and 

Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa

 are on the boundary of a game mammal hunting area and are potentially threatened by trampling as hunters use the area
(Buck 1991). 



C. Disease and Predation 



Disease is not known to be a significant threat to any of the endangered species. However, a tiny beetle, black twig
borer (

Xylosandrus compactus

), is known to infest common taxa of 

Melicope

 in the Koolau Mountains (Davis 1970). Black twig borers burrow into branches and introduce a pathogenic fungus that
kills twigs, reduces plant vigor, and often destroys entire plants. Populations of 

Melicope lydgatei

 that grow in the Koolau Mountains may be affected by these insects (Davis 1970, Hara and Beardsley 1979). 

Of the ungulates introduced to Oahu, pigs have become the primary modifiers of wet forests in the Koolau Mountains.
Not only do they destroy native vegetation through their rooting activities and dispersal of alien plant seed (See
Factor A), but pigs also feed on plants, preferring the pithy interior of large tree ferns and fleshy-stemmed plants
from the bellflower family (Stone 1985; Stone and Loope 1987; S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1991). Predation of 

Cyanea truncata

 and 

Rollandia crispa

 by pigs has been observed and is believed to be one of the primary causes of the decline or extirpation of populations
(L. Mehrhoff, pers. comm., 1993). Although the Service lacks conclusive evidence of predation on the other fleshy-stemmed
plant taxa in this final rule, none of them are known to be unpalatable to pigs. Predation is, therefore, a probable
threat to 

Lobelia oahuensis

 in areas where pigs have been reported.

<TEXT>
 

Predation of Hawaii's native vegetation by goats and the extensive damage caused by them have been well documented
(Tomich 1986, van Riper and van Riper 1982). Although browsing by goats is not confirmed for the 

Hesperomannia arborescens

 population on Molokai, such activity probably occurs, owing to the large number of goats in the vicinity. 

Two rat taxa, 

Rattus rattus

 (black rat) and 

R. exulans

 (Polynesian rat), and to a lesser extent other introduced rodents, eat large, fleshy fruits and strip the bark of some
native plants (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Tomich 1986, Wagner 

et al.

 1985). Predation of plants in the bellflower and African violet families that have fleshy stems and fruits has been
reported (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1991). Rats probably eat the fruits of 

Cyanea truncata, Cyrtandra crenata, Cyrtandra polyantha, Lobelia oahuensis,

 and 

Rollandia crispa,

 all of which produce fleshy fruits and stems and grow in areas where rats occur (J. Lau and J. Obata, pers. comms., 1991).


Little is known about the predation of certain rare Hawaiian plants by slugs, particularly 

Milax gagantes,

 which is found in wet montane habitats (Howarth 1985). Indiscriminate predation by slugs on plant parts of 

Lobelia oahuensis

 and particularly the fruits of 

Rollandia crispa

 has been observed; field botanists believe that the effect of slugs on the decline of these and related taxa may be significant
(S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1991). Slugs pose a serious threat to these two species because they chew through the stems
and eat the fruit, reducing the vigor of the plant and limiting the number of seeds for germination. 



D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms 



Of the 11 plant taxa in this final rule, a total of 8 have populations located on privately owned land, 10 on State land,
and 4 on Federal land. One taxon is located exclusively on private land and one is found only on State land. No State laws
or existing regulatory mechanisms at the present time effectively protect or prevent further decline of these plant
taxa on private land. However, Hawaii State laws relating to the conservation of biological resources allow for the
acquisition of land as well as the development and implementation of programs concerning the conservation of biological
resources (HRS, sec. 195D-5(a)). State regulations prohibit the removal, destruction, or damage of plants
found on State lands. Despite the existence of State laws and regulations which give protection to Hawaii's native
plants, their enforcement is difficult due to limited funding and personnel. Federal listing automatically invokes
listing under Hawaii State law, which prohibits taking of endangered plants in the State and encourages conservation
by State agencies (HRS, sec. 195D-4). Hawaii's Endangered Species Act states, ``Any species of aquatic life,
wildlife, or land plant that has been determined to be an endangered species pursuant to the (Federal) Endangered
Species Act shall be deemed to be an endangered species under the provisions of this chapter * * *''
(HRS, sec. 195D-4(a)). Further, the State may enter into agreements with Federal agencies to administer and
manage any area required for the conservation, management, enhancement, or protection of endangered species (HRS,
sec. 195D-5(c)). Funds for these activities could be made available under section 6 of the Federal Endangered
Species Act (State Cooperative Agreements). Listing of these 11 plant taxa reinforces and supplements the protection
available under the State Endangered Species Act and other laws. The Federal Endangered Species Act also offers additional
protection to these 11 plant taxa because it is a violation to remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such plant
in an area not under Federal jurisdiction in knowing violation of State law or regulation or in the course of any violation
of a State criminal trespass law. 



E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence 



The small number of populations and individuals of most of these taxa increases the potential for extinction from
stochastic events. The limited gene pool may depress reproductive vigor, or a single human-caused or natural environmental
disturbance could destroy a significant percentage of the individuals or the only known extant population. Three
of the plant taxa in this final rule, 

Chamaesyce deppeana, Cyanea truncata,

 and 

Cyrtandra crenata,

 are known from a single population. Five other taxa are known from only two to five populations (See Table 1). Ten of
the 11 plant taxa are estimated to number no more than 100 known individuals. Four of those taxa, 

Cyanea truncata, Cyrtandra crenata, Cyrtandra polyantha,

 and 

Melicope lydgatei,

 are estimated to number no more than 10 individuals.

Eight of the 11 endangered plant taxa are threatened by competition with one or more alien plant taxa (See Table 1).
Naturalized taxa compete with native plants for space, light, water, and nutrients (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). 

Clidemia hirta

 (Koster's curse), a noxious shrub first cultivated in Wahiawa on Oahu, spread to the Koolau Mountains prior to 1941,
where it is now rapidly displacing native vegetation (Wagner 

et al.

 1985). Koster's curse spread to the Waianae Mountains around 1970 and is now widespread throughout the southern half
of that mountain range (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Smith 1985, Wagner 

et al.

 1985). This pest forms a dense understory, shading out other plants and hindering plant regeneration, and is considered
the major alien plant threat in the Koolau Mountains (HHP 1987; Smith 1989; S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1991). At present,
Koster's curse threatens 

Cyanea truncata, Eugenia koolauensis, Hesperomannia arborescens, Lobelia oahuensis, Lycopodium nutans, Rollandia
crispa,

 and 

Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa

 (HHP 1993a1, 1993a2, 1993b2, 1993d1, 1993d2; HPCC 1990b1; J. Lau, K. Nagata, J. Obata, and S. Perlman, pers. comms.,
1991). 



Tibouchina herbacea,

 a relative of Koster's curse, first became established on the island of Hawaii in the late 1970s and, by 1982, was collected
in Lanilili on West Maui (Almeda 1990). Although the disruptive potential of this alien plant is not fully known, 

Tibouchina herbacea

 appears to be rapidly invading mesic and wet forests of Maui, and is considered the primary alien plant threat to the
only population of 

Hesperomannia arborescens

 on that island (Cuddihy and Stone 1990; HPCC 1990b2; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1991). 



Psidium cattleianum

 (strawberry guava) has become widely naturalized on all the main islands of Hawaii. Found in mesic and wet forests
in the Koolau Mountains, strawberry guava develops into dense stands in which few other plants can grow, displacing
natural vegetation. Strawberry guava is eaten by pigs that disperse the plant's seeds through the forest (Smith 1985,
Wagner 

et al.

 1985). 

Cyanea truncata, Eugenia koolauensis, Hesperomannia arborescens, Lycopodium nutans,

 and 

Rollandia crispa

 are seriously threatened by this pervasive weed (HHP 1991e8, 1991f1, 1991j16, 1993a4, 1993b1; HPCC 1991b1, 1991b2;
K. Nagata, S. Perlman, pers. comms., 1991). 

After escaping from cultivation, 

Schinus terebinthifolius

 (Christmas berry) became naturalized on most of the main Hawaiian Islands (Wagner 

et al.

 1990) and is a pervasive threat in the Koolau Mountain Range. This fast-growing tree, distributed mainly by feral
pigs and fruit-eating birds, is able to form dense thickets that displace other plants (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Smith
1985, Stone 1985). It is now replacing the native vegetation of the Koolau Mountains and threatens to occupy the habitat
of 

Chamaesyce deppeana

 and 

Eugenia koolauensis

 (HHP 1991e5, HPCC 1990a). 



Lantana camara

 (lantana) is an aggressive thicket-forming shrub, brought to Hawaii as an ornamental, that has now become naturalized
in mesic forests, dry shrublands, and other disturbed habitats (Smith 1989, Wagner 

et al.

 1990). Lantana poses an immediate threat to a population of 

Eugenia koolauensis

 in the Koolau Mountains (HHP 1991e7). 



Paspalum conjugatum

 (Hilo grass) is one of several perennial grasses purposely introduced for cattle fodder that have become noxious
weeds on Oahu as well as other Hawaiian islands (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Scott 

et al.

 1986, Tomich 1986). Hilo grass rapidly forms a dense ground cover in wet habitats from sea level to 6,600 ft (2,000 m)
in elevation and competes with ferns and other native plants (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Haselwood and Motter 1983, O'Connor
1990, Smith 1985). Its small hairy seeds are easily transported on humans and animals or carried by the wind through
native forests. Hilo grass threatens 

Chamaesyce deppeana

 and 

Hesperomannia arborescens

 (S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1991). 



Casuarina equisetifolia

 (common ironwood) is a large, fast-growing tree that reaches up to 65 ft (20 m) in height (Wagner 

et al.

 1990). This large tree shades out other plants, takes up much of the available nutrients, and possibly releases a chemical
agent that prevents other plants from growing beneath it (Neal 1965, Smith 1985). Like Hilo grass, common ironwood
is becoming a significant component of the wet forest vegetation in Nuuanu Valley and poses a significant threat to


Chamaesyce deppeana

 (HHP 1991a; HPCC 1990a; S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1991). 

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by these taxa in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation, this
rulemaking will list these 11 plant taxa as endangered. Ten of the taxa in this final rule either number no more than
about 100 individuals or are known from 5 or fewer populations. The 11 plant taxa are threatened by one or more of the
following: Habitat degradation and/or predation by feral pigs and goats; competition for space, light, water, and
nutrients by alien plants; habitat loss from fires; recreational activities; and predation by animals. Small population
sizes and limited distributions make these plant taxa particularly vulnerable to extinction from reduced reproductive
vigor or from stochastic events. Because these 11 plant taxa are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant
portion of their ranges, they fit the definition of endangered as defined in the Act.

Critical habitat is not being proposed for the 11 plant taxa included in this final rule, for reasons discussed in the
``Critical Habitat'' section of this rule. 


Critical Habitat 


Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
propose critical habitat at the time the species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that
designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent for these 11 plant taxa. As discussed under Factor B in the
``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species,'' the species face numerous anthropogenic threats. The publication
of precise maps and descriptions of critical habitat in the 

Federal Register

, as required in a proposal for critical habitat, would increase the degree of threat to these plants from take or vandalism
and, therefore, could contribute to their decline. The listing of these species as endangered publicizes the rarity
of the plants and, thus, can make these plants attractive to researchers, curiosity seekers, or collectors of rare
plants. All involved parties and the major landowners have been notified of the location and importance of protecting
the habitat of these species. Protection of the habitat of the species will be addressed through the recovery process
and through the Section 7 consultation process. 
Therefore, the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for these species is not prudent at this time, because
such designation would increase the degree of threat from vandalism, collecting, or other human activities.

Available Conservation Measures 


Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities.
Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies,
groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with
the State and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal
agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below.

Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations
implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) of
the Act requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of a proposed endangered species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed
critical habitat. If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that
activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species
or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical
habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. Four endangered species
grow on federally owned land and five species occur on land leased by the U.S. Army from the State and private parties.
There are no other known Federal activities that occur within the present known habitat of these 11 plant species.

The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 for endangered plants set forth a series
of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered and threatened plant species. With respect to
the 11 plant species, all prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These
prohibitions, in part, make it illegal with respect to any endangered plant for any person subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States to import or export; transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial
activity; sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce; remove and reduce to possession any such species
from areas under Federal jurisdiction; maliciously damage or destroy any such species on any area under Federal jurisdiction;
or remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such species on any other area in knowing violation of any State law or
regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agents of
the Service and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permits
to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered plant species under certain circumstances.
It is anticipated that few permits would ever be sought or issued because the species are not common in cultivation
or in the wild. 
Requests for copies of the regulations concerning listed plants and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits
may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits, 911 NE.

National Environmental Policy Act 


The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement,
as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection
with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining
the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is amending the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations
to make safe handling instructions mandatory on all raw meat and poultry product labeling. The handling instructions
include a rationale statement and address safe storage of raw product, prevention of cross-contamination, cooking
of raw product, and handling of leftovers. The rule provides additional safeguards to protect consumers from exposure
to possible bacterial contaminants found in raw meat and poultry products. This action is being taken in an effort
to reduce the risk of foodborne illness.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Executive Order 12866


In publishing the proposal on November 4, 1993 (58 FR 58922), the Agency stated that it had determined that the proposed
rule was a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 because the action would likely raise policy
issues arising out of the principles set forth in the Executive Order. The proposal advocated a significant new policy
direction that would require safe handling instructions on raw and partially cooked meat and poultry products to
further combat foodborne illness.
The Agency published an economic analysis for comment in the preamble to the proposed rule. That analysis incorporated
comments received in response to an earlier interim rule (58 FR 43478). As discussed in the proposal, a preliminary
economic analysis was published for comment in the preamble of that interim rule. Most comments addressed the cost
of the rule.
In contrast to the earlier interim rule, the proposal generated relatively few comments that criticized the analysis
and the assumptions behind the analysis. Presumably, the fewer critical comments reflected the modifications that
were made in response to data supplied in comments on the preliminary analysis published with the interim rule. Comments
on the modified analysis published with the proposal are discussed in the following paragraphs.

At least one commenter misunderstood the statement that: ``The Department also anticipates that stores will utilize
point-of-purchase materials that will minimize any labor costs.'' The commenter stated that the assertion was inaccurate
because the proposed rule does not allow for point-of-purchase information except as a supplement to the label on
each package. This statement was referring to the period after the effective date and before April 15, 1994. Under
the proposal, before April 15, 1994, official establishments and retailers would be allowed alternative approaches,
such as point-of-purchase materials, for affected products other than comminuted products. The Agency included
the above statement to acknowledge that there would be some labor costs associated with point-of-purchase materials,
but that such costs could easily minimized.

The same commenter pointed out that many stores, especially smaller ones, do not have label application guns and questioned
basing the estimate for labor costs on the use of label application guns. The Agency was not implying that it believes
that most retail stores currently have label guns. However, since hand-held label application guns are low cost option
for applying safe handling instructions, the Department would expect to see widespread use of such equipment.

One commenter stated that USDA has dismissed, based upon non-public information, the cost estimates provided by
the regulated industry regarding label costs. The reference to non-public information is related to the statement
in the proposal that ``Discussions with label manufacturers indicate that the lower prices are available for even
small quantities.''

The proposal points out that the preliminary analysis (published with the interim rule) estimated that the cost of
an additional pressure-sensitive label would range from $.01 to $.025. That estimate was based on discussions with
label manufacturers and/or wholesale distributors. Most of the comments on the interim rule suggest that the preliminary
estimate was accurate. In fact, the most frequent response was that the labels would cost $.01 each. The proposal acknowledged
that some comments including one from the U.S. Small Business Administration suggested that some retail firms were
paying more. Because the comments on the interim rule are more compelling evidence than provided by the earlier discussions
with label manufacturers, the quoted sentence would have been better stated as ``Comments on the interim rule support
the preliminary estimate that the lower prices are available for even small quantities.''

With respect to the comment on non-public information, the process of conducting a preliminary regulatory cost analysis
involves a wide mix of formal surveys and informal information gathering. In this case the preliminary estimate was
based on informal discussions with 4 or 5 manufacturers and/or wholesale distributors of pressure-sensitive labels
and the fact that pressure-sensitive address labels are widely advertised at costs ranging from $.01 to $.025. Because
the details of the specific label were not available the discussions were limited to general questions concerning
the range of costs and the relationship between label size and cost. The information collected was not recorded by
name of firm. Individual firm confidentiality is also a standard practice for more formal cost surveys. For example,
in conducting the regulatory impact analysis for the nutrition labeling rule, a survey was mailed to 650 meat and poultry
firms. Confidentiality of individual responses was assured.

A comment from a meat industry trade association noted the lack of ``hard numbers'' used in the cost-vs-benefit section.
This commenter specifically questioned why the Department estimated that annual deaths attributable to 

Escherichia coli

 0157:H7 could range from 146 to 389.

The estimate referred to was published in Agricultural Outlook, Economic Research Service, USDA, AO-197,
June 1993. The discussion in the preamble stated that ``the estimates in Table 1 were developed after the epidemic
outbreak of foodborne illness attributed to 

E. coli

 0157:H7 in undercooked hamburgers from a fast-food chain in 1993. Although the States have voted to make foodborne
illness from 

E. coli

 0157:H7, a disease that must be reported to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), such reporting will
not be effective for some time. Thus, cost estimates for 

E. coli

 should be reviewed as preliminary.'' Table 1 from the proposal is repeated here also as Table 1.

The Agricultural Outlook publication (which was available in the FSIS Hearing Clerk's office) states that ``CDC
researchers estimate that between 7,668 and 20,448 persons became ill from exposure to 

E. coli 

0157:H7 annually in the U.S.'' The range in estimated deaths is directly related to the range in the CDC estimate for
number of cases. CDC researchers have estimated that 1.9 percent of the 7,668 to 20,448 cases result in death.
Several comments point out that costs are affected by the effective date, especially in view of the upcoming implementation
date for nutrition labeling. The Department agrees that costs are affected by the implementation schedule. However,
it is beyond the scope of the cost analysis to be able to differentiate or estimate the cost savings that would be attributable
to processors and retailers having an additional 30 or 60 days to comply. The issue of effective date is discussed elsewhere
under comments related to the implementation schedule.
One comment alleged that the Department did not make sufficient supporting material available to the public, particularly
in the area of the cost and benefit analysis. The data from Table 1 represents the latest and best estimates of the cost
of foodborne illness prepared by the Department's Economic Research Service (ERS). ERS has been publishing articles
on their cost of foodborne illness research for more than a decade. The methodology has been refined and updated over
time. From the perspective of Executive Order 12866, the relevant information is the available data on costs and benefits
that is based on the latest methodology. The Department is not obligated to identify all the materials that have been
published during the development and refinement of these methods.
Another comment stated that USDA failed to place on the record any studies or other information relied upon by USDA
regarding foodborne illnesses other than 

E. coli 

0157:H7. The Agricultural Outlook article summarizes CDC findings for all foodborne diseases caused by bacterial
and parasitic agents.
While recognizing that in the majority of cases, the cause is unknown, CDC has found that when a source or likely source
is identified, approximately 50 percent of cases of all foodborne diseases are associated with meat or poultry products.
The CDC analysis supports the ERS estimates that meat and poultry are associated with approximately 50 percent of
foodborne bacterial diseases.
A supermarket chain commented that scale upgrades would cost almost $500,000, or approximately $9,700 per store.
While this cost is slightly outside the estimate of $6,000 to $9,000 used in the analysis, changing the range from $6,000
to $10,000 would not have an effect on the net benefit conclusions.
The same commenter pointed out that upgrading equipment does not eliminate labor costs, since there would always
be some items that were not compatible with automated equipment and would have to be done by hand. The Department agrees,
but accounting for this in the analytical model would have minimal effect on net benefits.

A large processor commented that the Agency did not include in its cost estimate many of the significant costs associated
with label redesign. The analysis did recognize that the cost of revising a label varies widely and that variation
is included in the estimate of a one-time cost for processors of $50 to $100 million. The Agency is aware that some firms
spend several thousand dollars on label revisions. Other firms spend far less. The Department considers an average
cost of $1,000 per label to be a reasonable estimate for an average cost for a label revision of this type.

A supermarket chain from a large urban area submitted a detailed estimate of its costs using a labor rate of $24.00 per
hour. The cost analysis used a labor rate of approximately $10.00 per hour. The Department recognizes that wages will
vary widely. Aggregate cost and benefit analyses must, however, be based on national averages.



Executive Order 12778



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. States and local jurisdictions
are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) from imposing
any marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirement on federally inspected meat and poultry products that
are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the FMIA or PPIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however,
exercise concurrent jurisdiction over meat and poultry products that are outside official establishments for the
purpose of preventing the distribution of meat and poultry products that are misbranded or adulterated under the
FMIA or PPIA, or, in the case of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their entry into the
United States. Under the FMIA and PPIA, States that maintain meat and poultry inspection programs must impose requirements
that are at least equal to those required under the FMIA and PPIA. The States may, however, impose more stringent requirements
on such State inspected products and establishments.

No retroactive effect will be given to this rule. The administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR 306.5 and 381.35
must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge of the application of the provisions of this rule, if the challenge
involves any decision of an inspector relating to inspection services provided under the FMIA or PPIA. The administrative
procedures specified in 9 CFR 335 and 381, Subpart W, must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge of the application
of the provisions of this rule with respect to labeling decisions.



Effect on Small Entities



The Administrator has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). The rule will affect a substantial
number of small entities, but the economic impact on such small entities will not be significant.

The final rule affects both retail stores and inspected establishments. In 1991, USDA estimated there were 253,000
foodstores in the United States. These stores are categorized as follows:








Most of the small businesses affected would be superettes and specialty stores, such as meat markets, butcher shops,
and locker plants. The specialty store category includes a large number of small businesses that do not sell meat and
poultry products, e.g., confectionery stores. Most convenience stores do not sell raw or partially cooked meat and
poultry products.

The Department recognizes that small retail firms would experience the greatest relative ongoing costs because
they may not be able to afford new or modified equipment that can minimize costs. However, the public health risks do
not allow for alternative small business considerations. At least one of the recent foodborne illness incidents
described in the interim rule referred to earlier involved ground beef sold through a small market in a small community.



Background



Introduction



The Secretary of Agriculture has statutory authority to require meat and poultry products to bear labels including
such ``information as the Secretary may require * * * to assure that * * * the public
will be informed of the manner of handling required to maintain the article in a wholesome condition.'' Federal Meat
Inspection Act, 21 U.S.C. 601 (n) (12); Poultry Products Inspection Act, 21 U.S.C. 453 (h) (12). The Secretary issued
an interim final rule on August 16, 1993, requiring raw and partially cooked meat and poultry products to carry safe
handling instructions, effective October 15, 1993 (58 FR 43478), and solicited comments for 30 days. In light of these
comments, the Secretary issued a final rule on October 12, 1993, which made significant changes in response to the
comments (58 FR 52856). Due to continued outbreaks of foodborne illness involving meat and poultry products which
resulted in serious illness and death, the Secretary invoked the ``good cause'' exception to the notice and comment
requirement of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(13)(B)).

On September 23, 1993, the Texas Food Industry Association, the National American Wholesale Grocers' Association,
the International Foodservice Distributors Association, and the National Grocers Association filed a complaint
in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas (District Court) alleging that the issuance
of the interim rule violated the APA and requested that the Court issue a preliminary injunction.
On October 14, the District Court granted plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction and enjoined the Department
from enforcing or implementing the interim or final regulations against the plaintiffs or any other affected entities
or individuals. The Department filed a motion with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on October
15 to stay the preliminary injunction and allow the safe handling regulations to take effect. This motion was denied
on October 19, 1993.
While the Department believed it would prevail on the APA issue in further litigation, it recognized that a notice
and comment rulemaking would take less time than further litigating the APA issue with the plaintiffs. Due to the importance
of protecting public health and the related need to provide this crucial information to consumers as quickly as possible,
the Department published simultaneously on November 4, 1993, a proposal to amend the regulations to require safe
handling instructions on raw and partially cooked meat and poultry products, and a final rule withdrawing the provisions
of the interim and final rules (58 FR 43478 and 58 FR 52856).


Authority


The Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 451 

et seq.

) direct the Secretary of Agriculture to maintain meat and poultry inspection programs designed to assure consumers
that meat and poultry products distributed to them (including imports) are wholesome, not adulterated, and properly
marked, labeled, and packaged.

Section 2 of the FMIA (21 U.S.C. 602) and section 2 of the PPIA (21 U.S.C. 451) state that unwholesome, adulterated,
or misbranded meat or meat food products and poultry products are injurious to the public welfare, destroy markets
for wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged products, and result in sundry losses
to producers and processors of meat and poultry products, as well as injury to consumers. Therefore, Congress has
granted the Secretary authority to regulate meat, meat food products, and poultry products to protect consumers'
health and welfare. Subsection 1(n)(12) of the FMIA (21 U.S.C. 601(n)(12)) and subsection 4 (h)(12) of the PPIA (21
U.S.C. 453(h)(12)) state that the term ``misbranded'' applies to any product if it fails to bear, directly thereon
or on its container, as the Secretary may be regulations prescribe, the inspection legend, and unrestricted by any
of the foregoing, such information as the Secretary may require in such regulations to assure that it will not have
false or misleading labeling and that the public will be informed of the manner of handling required to maintain the
article in a wholesome condition. Section 7(d) of the FMIA (21 U.S.C. 607(d)) states: ``No article subject to this
title shall be sold or offered for sale by any person, firm, or corporation, in commerce, under any name or other marking
or labeling which is false or misleading, or in any container of a misleading form or size, but established trade names
and other marking and labeling and containers which are not false or misleading and which are approved by the Secretary
are permitted.'' The PPIA contains similar language in section 8(c) (21 U.S.C. 457(c)).



Safe Handling Labeling Instructions



In 1972, the American Public Health Association, individual consumers, and six other public health and consumer
interest groups brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of
Agriculture alleging that labels placed on meat and poultry products were false and misleading because they failed
to warn consumers against the dangers of foodborne illness caused by Salmonella and other bacteria in such products.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's order dismissing the action, and ruled that the Secretary of Agriculture
did not abuse his discretion by choosing to undertake a consumer education program instead of requiring labeling
instructions for meat and poultry products. Since that ruling, USDA has conducted a massive and increasingly targeted
food safety campaign to inform consumers about safe handling and cooking of meat and poultry products. FSIS has offered
a toll-free nationwide hotline, staffed by food safety specialists, and conducted campaigns, directed at such specialized
audiences as food handlers, institutions, health professionals, and at-risk populations, as well as food handlers
in the home. Additionally, FSIS has permitted the voluntary labeling of poultry products with safe handling instructions
since 1987. FSIS does not monitor participation in voluntary labeling; however, one trade association has said that
75 percent of its members offer handling instructions on their labels.



New Policy Direction



In recent years, FSIS has been aware that a growing percentage of the U.S. population consists of persons lacking experience
in food preparation and knowledge of safe food handling and storage methods. Studies of foodborne illness outbreaks
have repeatedly shown improper food handling to be the frequent cause of foodborne illnesses. Improper cooling of
cooked foods has been ranked as the leading factor. Other factors cited included inadequate cooking, cross-contamination,
and inadequate reheating.

Studies of consumer knowledge and practices indicate that a significant number lack basic food safety information
and skills, particularly with respect to the relationship between temperature and foodborne illness.

Information from the CDC revealed that: (1) Undercooking was a factor in 108 of 345 (31.3 percent) home outbreaks of
foodborne illness that occurred between 1973 and 1982 (data include all foods); and (2) cooking foods ahead, i.e.,
12 hours or more before serving, was a factor in 12.8 percent of the home outbreaks.

While the Agency has long been committed to a program of consumer education to help prevent foodborne illness, as exemplified
by its distribution of publications for consumers and its Meat and Poultry Hotline, it has become convinced of the
need for more direct methods of placing food safety information in the hands of consumers. Thus, Agency officials
in early January 1993 began to advocate in their speeches and writings that the mandatory safe handling instructions
on the labeling of meat and poultry products was a necessary component of a program to combat foodborne illness.

The Agency's new policy direction gained additional impetus following the January 1993 outbreaks of a severe foodborne
illness that led to four deaths among approximately 500 confirmed cases in Washington, Idaho, California, and Nevada.
The outbreaks were linked to the pathogenic bacterial strain 

E. coli

 0157:H7. Because most of the cases were attributed to undercooked hamburgers served at a fast-food restaurant chain,
Federal and local authorities have intensified their regulatory activities. In June and July of 1993, the Department
became aware of nine separate incidents where 

E. coli

 0157:H7 was the direct or suspected cause of illness or death. The incidents led the Department to conclude that it
was time to immediately require safe handling information on raw and partially cooked meat and poultry products.
On August 16, 1993, FSIS published in the 

Federal Register

 an interim rule (58 FR 43478) mandating safe handling instructions on all raw and partially cooked meat and poultry
product labeling. Also, FSIS established a permanent liaison position with the CDC. The responsibilities of this
position include monitoring and tracking all 

E. coli

 epidemics reported to the CDC. Preliminary data for 1993 from CDC indicates 17 reported clusters of 

E. coli

 0157:H7 infections. Many of these cases occurred after publication of the interim rule.

Several noteworthy developments in previously cited cases of foodborne illness and new incidents, not reported
in the prior rulemaking publication, which reinforce the exigent need for safe handling instructions are summarized
below:

Reading, CT



The Connecticut Department of Health investigated an outbreak of 

E. coli

 0157:H7 that appeared to be linked to a country club. Four cases of 

E. coli

 0157:H7 were positively linked to undercooked hamburger patties served at the Reading Country Club. 

E. coli

 0157:H7 was isolated by the Connecticut State Lab and the FSIS Beltsville Lab.



Ft. Bragg, CA



The Mendocino County Health Department reported confirmed cases of 

E. coli

 0157:H7 in a 13 year old girl and an 84 year old woman in Ft. Bragg. The two cases appeared unrelated except that both victims
consumed home-cooked hamburgers which may have been made from ground beef purchased at the same supermarket during
the same time period. FSIS isolated 

E. coli

 0157:H7 from ground beef returned to the market as well as a patty from the residence where the 13 year old girl had eaten.



Texas



A total of 10 separate cases 

E. coli

 0157:H7 occurring over a 6-week period in the autumn of 1993 are being investigated by the Texas Health Department.
These included three cases that resulted in hemolytic uremic syndrome and one death. No common source has been identified.



Parameters of Good Safety



After reviewing available information, FSIS in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified
the following parameters of safe handling by consumers: How to safely store raw product and thaw frozen product; how
to avoid cross-contamination during preparation; how to cook for optimal safety and palatability; and, how to store
leftovers after preparation. For institutions, hot holding of prepared food is an additional parameter. (The term
institutions as used throughout this preamble includes hotels, restaurants, or similar institutions.) In addition,
the Agency proposed that the safe handling instructions include a rationale statement specifying the reason why
it is important to follow such instructions. The Agency believes that consumers will pay more attention to the safe
handling instructions if they understand that mishandling will lead to the growth of bacteria and possibly to illness.

Labeling



Various methods have been used in the past to inform consumers of handling instructions. Such methods have included
putting the instructions on the product label, on inserts, on tags attached to the product, and on point-of-purchase
materials displayed near the product at the point of sale. FSIS has concluded that the outside label is the most appropriate
location for safe handling instructions.

The Agency considered three options for presenting safe handling information on the label. These options included
long word messages, short word messages, and short word messages with symbols or graphic representations to accompany
the message. To collect information on which format would most effectively influence consumer behavior, FSIS initiated
consumer focus-study research.

In the FSIS initiated consumer focus-study, most participants wanted to see safe handling instructions on raw meat
and poultry products. Consumers in the study expressed a preference for the safe handling instructions to be on the
package label and felt that other labeling, such as pamphlets or in-store signs, should only be used to supplement
package labels. Instructions with graphic illustrations were generally preferred to those without graphic illustrations
and the short word messages were preferred to the long word messages. Also, most participants of the focus-study research
felt that the rationale statement was a necessary part of the safe handling instructions.



Current Regulations



The Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations currently require the placement of safe handling statements
on packaged products that require special handling to maintain their wholesome condition. Sections 317.2 and 381.125
of the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations (9 CFR 317.2(k) and 9 CFR 381.125, respectively)
provide that packaged products which require special handling to maintain their wholesome condition shall have
prominently displayed on the principal display panel of the label the statement: ``Keep Refrigerated,'' ``Keep
Frozen,'' ``Perishable Keep Under Refrigeration,'' or such similar statement as the Administrator may approve
in specific cases.



Proposal



FSIS proposed to amend the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations to mandate the inclusion of safe
handling instructions on the labeling of raw and partially cooked meat and poultry products along with a rationale
statement to indicate the reason why it is important to follow such handling instructions. The Department has established
required cooking temperatures for certain beef, poultry, and patty products. These requirements are set forth at
9 CFR 318.17, 381.150, and 318.23, respectively. The proposed rule applied the beef temperature requirements to
beef, swine, sheep, goat, horse, and other equine. The Department has also established processing requirements
for the curing or other treatment of certain meat products to control microbial activity. Some of these products are
identified in part 319 of the meat inspection regulations. These cooked products, e.g., cooked sausage, and some
products that have been otherwise further processed so as to render them ready-to-eat, e.g., dry fermented sausage,
are not considered to be at sufficient risk of microbial contamination to warrant the application of safe handling
labels. However, some products that are traditionally considered ready-to-eat receive no lethal heat treatment
and may not be pathogen free. FSIS is reevaluating its policies and regulations governing these products and plans
to propose a regulation requiring that these products either bear the safe handling instructions or be processed
in such a manner as to assure the destruction of pathogens.

FSIS proposed to permit official establishment and retailers to use alternate approaches to deliver the safe handling
instructions until April 15, 1994, except for comminuted products. For comminuted products, FSIS proposed to require
that safe handling instructions be included on the label within 30 days after publication of the final rule.

The alternate approaches presented in the proposed rule are: (1) Official establishments may include in the shipping
container either pressure-sensitive labels containing the safe handling instructions for retailers to apply to
packages or leaflets containing a facsimile of the safe handling instructions in lettering no smaller than one one-sixteenth
of an inch for retailers to place in close proximity to the packages to ensure that leaflets are likely to be seen and
taken home by consumers; and (2) retailers may distribute leaflets containing the facsimile described above.

In some cases, it was expected that retailers might prefer pressure-sensitive labels or leaflets of their own design
and manufacture to those that an official establishment would provide under the permitted alternative. FSIS proposed
that if a retailer notifies an official establishment in writing that it intends to supply its own labels or labeling,
the official establishment would not be required to supply the materials in the shipping container.

The following rationale statement was proposed for products prepared from inspected and passed meat and/or poultry:
This product was prepared from inspected and passed meat and/or poultry. Some food products may contain bacteria
that could cause illness if the product is mishandled or cooked improperly. For your protection, follow these safe
handling instructions.

FSIS proposed the following rationale statement for poultry slaughtered under exemptions specified in 9 CFR 381.10:
Some food products may contain bacteria that could cause illness if the product is mishandled or cooked improperly.
For your protection, follow these safe handling instructions.

FSIS proposed the following four safe handling statements for use on the label of both red meat and poultry products
distributed to both household consumers and institutions: (1) Keep refrigerated or frozen. Thaw in refrigerator
or microwave. (Any portion of this statement that is in conflict with the product's specific handling instructions,
may be omitted.) (A graphic illustration of a refrigerator shall be displayed next to the statement.); (2) Keep raw
meat and poultry separate from other foods. Wash working surfaces (including cutting boards), utensils, and hands
after touching raw meat or poultry. (A graphic illustration of soapy hands under a faucet shall be displayed next to
the statement.); (3) Cook thoroughly. (A graphic illustration of a skillet shall be displayed next to the statement.);
and (4) Keep hot foods hot. Refrigerate leftovers immediately or discard. (A graphic illustration of a thermometer
shall be displayed next to the statement.)
The label for safe handling instructions is shown in Exhibit 1.

FSIS proposed that safe handling instructions may appear anywhere on the label where they would likely to be read.
The proposal also required the safe handling instructions to be set off by a border and to one color type printed on a
single color contrasting background.
FSIS proposed to exempt products intended for further processing by an inspected establishment from mandatory safe
handling labeling requirements. Since products for further processing by another Federal or State establishment
will not be available to consumers or food service institutions, FSIS did not believe that it was necessary to require
safe handling instructions on such packaging.
FSIS proposed to allow safe handling instructions to be added to labels by the manufacturer and to be approved under
the provisions of generic label approval since the regulations prescribe the exact language of the safe handling
instructions.


Discussion of Comments



The FSIS Hearing Clerk received 60 comments on the proposed rule. Commenters included consumers, representatives
of consumer and other interest groups, State meat and poultry inspection officials, representatives and associations
of retail stores, representatives and associations of official meat and poultry establishments, two U.S. Department
of Agriculture Agencies, and others.

The following discussion of comments follows the general structure of the proposed rule. General concerns are addressed
in the context of specific features of the rule. Where the concerns cannot be logically addressed in the context of
specific sections of the rule, they are presented under a ``Miscellaneous Issues'' section. Changes made in the final
rule are described so that it is apparent how they address the concerns of commenters. Where the Agency addresses the
meat regulations, conforming changes are also made in the poultry regulations. Any changes unique to either the meat
or poultry regulations are identified.


Miscellaneous Issues


One commenter suggested that the comment period should be extended and that additional information that FSIS used
in formulating and supporting the regulation should be placed on the regulatory record. We disagree with this comment
and not that FSIS had made publicly available, as part of this rulemaking proceeding, all relevant data upon which
the regulation is based, including: the August 16, 1993 interim rule and all comments received in response thereto;
the studies referenced in the interim rule; the October 12, 1993 final rule; questions and answer papers formulated
in response to questions raised by the interim rule; the November 4, 1993 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and all comments
received in response thereto; all studies referenced in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, including the Focus-Study
Research and Agricultural Outlook (June, 1993); and documentation of oral presentations made in the course of the
rulemaking proceeding.

The majority of commenters supported the labeling of products with safe handling instructions. Several commenters
objected to mandatory labeling stating either that other methods of educating consumers would be more appropriate,
that the required labeling would be ineffective, that labeling is not a substitute for proper training of safe food
handling, that requiring a simple label can not guarantee any consumer will follow that label, or that some products
currently include sufficient safe handling instructions which make the proposed safe handling label unnecessary.
Seven commenters stated that many existing products contain much more helpful and meaningful handling and preparation
information than that required by the proposed regulation. One also questioned whether the information contained
in the proposed statements is so demonstrably more effective than the safe handling instructions currently in use
on meat and poultry so as to justify the millions of dollars in conversion costs. They also suggest that to prohibit
alternative language is unnecessarily restrictive and may preclude a more effective way of conveying the message
intended. Five commenters suggested that labeling is only one option and point-of-purchase materials or other types
of signs may be equally effective or more effective in instructing the consumer about safe food handling.

FSIS does not agree with these comments. The focus-study research asked participants about other alternatives for
safe handling instructions. Participants in the focus-study research expressed a preference for safe handling
instructions to be on the package label and felt other labeling, such as pamphlets or in-store signs, should only be
used to supplement package labels, but not replace the package labels. The safe handling instructions are not meant
to substitute for comprehensive training of safe handling procedures either in the home or food service setting.
The instructions primarily alert food preparers that there is a risk of illness if products are mishandled or improperly
cooked, and it addresses four broad parameters of food safety. Finally, FSIS does not believe that current handling
instructions on labels will make safe handling instructions unnecessary. The safe handling instructions are not
meant to replace more comprehensive cooking instructions found on products. In addition, current labeling may cover
the four broad parameters of food safety, but does not include a rationale statement explaining to food preparers
why it is important to follow the instructions. The focus-study research found that the rationale statement was an
essential feature of the label.

Officials from two retail stores and two retail associations suggested that the regulations have a sunset provision
and that the effectiveness of the regulation be studied periodically. Five additional commenters suggested that
the effectiveness of the regulation be evaluated. Several suggested annual reports be sent to the Secretary of Agriculture
for review and one requested that FSIS publish a method to measure the effectiveness of the regulation as part of the
final rule. There are no changes in the final rule in response to these comments. The Regulatory Flexibility Act already
provides that Agencies will periodically review regulations. While this does not have the same effect as a sunset
provision, it does insure that the continuing appropriateness of regulations will be assessed. Further, there is
no way to quantify the effectiveness of the regulation. It is impossible to determine how many cases of foodborne illness
were prevented by the inclusion of these instructions on the labels of raw and partially cooked meat and poultry products.

Twelve commenters addressed the four sets of ``Questions and Answers (Q&A's)'' that FSIS disseminated between
August 20 and September 15, 1993. Suggestions included codifying the Q&A's as part of the final rule, adding the
Q&A's to the proposal and reopening the comment period to allow all interested parties an opportunity to comment
on the Q&A's, and including specific responses either in the regulatory language or the preamble of the final
rule. Four issues specifically cited were the status of export products, retroactive labeling of products, placement
of information on hang tags and on the bottom of trays, and safe handling information requirements for multi-component
products which include a meat or poultry portion that is fully cooked or otherwise processed so as to render it ready-to-eat.
FSIS does not believe that these Q&A's need to be part of the regulatory language of the final rule. The Q&A's
either cited other regulations within Title 9 or provided interpretations of how the safe handling regulation would
be applied in specific situations.

In addition, the Q&A's, in large part, related to the interim rule, which was withdrawn. However, we will address
the specific questions raised by the commenters. Regarding the need for export products to carry safe handling instructions,
the condition under which deviations from labeling requirements are permitted are already set out in 9 CFR 317.7 and
9 CFR 381.128. FSIS will not require retroactive labeling of products, products labeled on or after the effective
date will be required to carry safe handling instruction on the label. Products labeled prior to the effective date
will not require the addition of safe handling instructions. For example, products in frozen storage, labeled prior
to the effective date but shipped afterwards, will not be required to add the safe handling instructions. Regarding
the placement of safe handling instructions on hang tags or the bottom of trays, FSIS has considered hang tags to be
an extension of the label and consequently they may contain required label features such as safe handling instructions.
Also, the instructions may be placed on the bottom of trays as long as they are visible at time of purchase. This is evident
in the language of the proposed and final rules that state the safe handling instructions, ``shall be prominently
placed with such conspicuousness (as compared with other words, statements, designs or devices in the labeling)
as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary consumer under customary conditions of purchase and
use.'' Finally, as to whether safe handling instructions need to be on products that include a fully cooked meat filling
but where the total product requires cooking, e.g., a fully cooked meat filling in uncooked dough: the rule does not
require safe handling instructions on products where the meat or poultry portion is fully cooked or otherwise processed
to render that portion ready-to-eat. However, while such products do not require safe handling instructions they
are not considered ready-to-eat products.

One commenter suggested that FSIS implement appropriate compliance procedures for safe handling labels, stating
the hope that ``after all the commotion and rhetoric accompanying this present rule that more effort will be made to
assure not only compliance with it but with all the other regulatory initiatives that are sorely in need of the Department's
attention.'' FSIS appreciates the concern of this commenter. It is envisioned that the monitoring of compliance
with these requirements will follow the current model of enforcement of misbranding of products at the retail level.
Jurisdiction is primarily exercised by State and local food regulatory agencies. Local codes generally require
that food be fully labeled in conformance with requirements of agencies having jurisdiction over the product. FSIS
and State meat and poultry inspection programs also monitor meat and poultry products in commerce. If products are
found out of compliance with these requirements, they generally require that the specific product be brought into
compliance or other appropriate action is taken. FSIS anticipates that initial compliance monitoring of this labeling
requirement will have an educational focus. Where noncompliance is found, FSIS Compliance and other enforcement
officials will provide guidance on these labeling requirements. Where it is apparent that businesses are making
a good faith effort to comply with these requirements, they will not be subject to enforcement action.

One commenter suggested that FSIS replace the term ``comminuted'' with a different term such as ``non-whole muscle''
products because historically, ``comminuted'' has been used to include only very finely ground meat and poultry
products produced from by-products of other whole muscle operations. FSIS does not agree with this comment. Other
FSIS regulations, including the August 2, 1993, pattie regulation (58 FR 41138), have defined ``comminuted'' as
a processing term used to describe the reduction in size of pieces of meat or poultry, and includes chopping, flaking,
grinding, and mincing.

One commenter was concerned that styrofoam trays are sometimes reused in children's crafts and that such a use poses
risks. The commenter suggested that these trays should include a message saying to discard them. Meat packed in styrofoam
trays could pose a potential health risk if ready-to-eat food products are stored in an unwashed tray. Use of these
materials by school children has not resulted in any reported foodborne illness. FSIS believes that most consumers
either discard the trays or wash them before giving them to their children to use. On this basis, FSIS does not believe
a message is needed to address this concern.

One commenter suggested that the Department introduce two new categories of product that could be sold in addition
to the current products that are labeled ``USDA Inspected and Passed (or For Wholesomeness).'' The first category
would be ``USDA Inspected for Cosmetics and Marketing Defects Only_Not Health Hazards,'' and the second category
would be ``Uninspected.'' Both of the new categories would be required to include safe handling information on the
label. Products meeting the criteria to be labeled ``USDA Inspected and Passed (or For Wholesomeness)'' would not
be required to include safe handling information.

The Agency does not agree with this commenter. The ``USDA Inspected and Passed'' logo represents an assurance that
products are derived only from animals slaughtered under inspection; contain only ingredients from approved sources;
are processed in a sanitary environment; and, are processed in accordance with accepted Good Manufacturing Practices.
All these assurances are of health and safety concern. The Agency does not agree with an assertion that failure to assure
that raw meat and poultry products are sterile reduces inspectional efficacy to assuring only the absence of cosmetic
and marketing defects. Inspection of the processing of cooked products is designed to assure a commercially sterile
product. Requiring safe handling instructions on the labels of raw and partially cooked meat and poultry products
is the appropriate step to alert consumers to the practical limits of the assurance represented by the ``USDA Inspected
and Passed'' logo.

Some commenters suggested that the focus-study research results were misused. Specifically, they state that FSIS
is mandating a nationwide labeling plan based on the input of 86 individuals. They also cited a statement in the final
report on the focus-study research that cautioned that the findings of focus-study research should not be generalized
to a larger population in any statistical sense. FSIS does not believe that its use of the focus-study research findings
was inappropriate. Consumers have an important role in assuring meat and poultry are safe to eat. Safe handling labels
are a part of the Agency's consumer education campaign. The focus-study research was used to obtain consumer feedback
on three label formats proposed by FSIS. The process used was consistent with generally recognized focus group methodology.
Focus-study research provides a richness of detail not possible in more structured quantitative research. Focus
groups are highly effective for developing understanding and insight into consumer behavior and thinking. The Agency
was responsive to focus-study research suggestions as well as public comments in formulating the previous final
regulation on safe handling instructions. As previously cited, participants in the focus-study research expressed
a preference for safe handling instructions to be on the package label and felt other labeling, such as pamphlets or
in-store signs, should only be used to supplement package labels, but not replace the package labels.



Implementation Date



Representatives from many official establishments and their associations, retail stores and their associations,
as well as officials of State meat and poultry inspection programs strongly recommended that the effective date of
the rule be extended. The most frequently mentioned date was July 6, 1994, to coincide with the effective date for nutrition
labeling. Many noted that a 30 day implementation time was not feasible. Retailers state that it will take a minimum
of 60 days to either receive and install new equipment or receive new labels, taking into account the lag time from publication
of a final rule to receiving the new regulation, and ordering and delivery of equipment or labels. Federally inspected
establishments and trade associations commenting on the 30-day implementation timeframe offered varied estimates
of the time required to make label changes. These ranged from 4 weeks to 4 months. In addition, several commenters stated
that pressure-sensitive stickers pose feasibility problems, including inability of the stickers to remain on the
product through processing, lack of adequate space on the current label to place the sticker without obscuring other
mandatory features, and extremely high labor costs due to the need to add a labor intensive manual process step where
businesses currently use high speed equipment that cannot be easily or economically retrofitted to apply the stickers.

The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture states that ``FSIS should consider delaying the implementation
to July 6, 1994, to provide an opportunity to educate not only the public, but also those who must enforce the requirement
and encourage the public to follow the guidelines. It is essential that FSIS provide a lead time to furnish state officials
with accurate and reliable information before the regulation is implemented.'' One retail store also stated that
30 days did not provide the time necessary to properly train employees.

Regarding FSIS's suggestion that companies revise their nutrition labeling timetable to coincide with safe handling,
one official establishment wrote, ``it is not practical to simply `revise our timetable for nutrition labeling'
as FSIS has stated. There is a great deal of analysis, planning, and designing that goes into each nutrition panel.
It is simply not a case of printing information that is already dictated as is the case for the handling instructions.''
Additionally, one commenter questioned whether the incremental cost of complying with the label requirement versus
the pamphleting option during the April 15 and July 6 period for noncomminuted products could be justified by any demonstrable
benefit. However, one consumer group requested that implementation of these requirements not be delayed for any
reason, because of the risks of foodborne illness associated with raw meat and poultry.

FSIS has been persuaded by the comments that in some cases it might be impractical to achieve compliance with a 30-day
implementation requirement for comminuted products and an April 15 requirement for other products. However, the
Agency does not agree that businesses will require 4 months to comply. A commenter that calculated 4 months as a minimum
included time for sketch approval by FSIS in its calculation. That step is not required for these generically approved
labels. They also included a period of time to exhaust preexisting label inventories. This is not a factor that impacts
on the feasibility of obtaining complying labels. Additionally, they did not consider such alternatives to complete
label redesign as pressure-sensitive labels. The latter approach could obviate both time concerns and concerns
over utilization of existing label inventories. Finally, many firms demonstrated the ability to make the required
label changes within the 2 months following the publication of the interim rule on August 16, 1993. Their performance
certainly belies the notion that 4 months is a minimum required to achieve compliance.

FSIS will extend the implementation requirement for the labeling of comminuted products to 60 days after publication
and the labeling of other products to July 6, 1994. The Agency believes that the high level of voluntary compliance
before these required dates will minimize the impact of extending the timeframes for implementation and eliminating
the pamphleting requirement. The Agency believes that these extended timelines will provide retailers as well as
establishments the needed time for those companies having difficulty obtaining the necessary labeling. Additionally,
it will allow some businesses to make one label change to incorporate both safe handling instructions and nutrition
labeling at a cost savings. Many retailers as well as official establishments have already voluntarily complied
with this regulation by providing safe handling labels, brochures and other point of sale information. In addition,
the Department's educational efforts to inform the public of the need to safely handle and prepare meat and poultry
as well as other food products along with publicity surrounding the rule has increased the public's awareness of the
necessity and requirements of safe food handling. A major joint voluntary effort to educate consumers began last
year. The Food Marketing Institute, the American Meat Institute and the National Livestock and Meat Board, in cooperation
with the USDA and FDA, developed ``A Consumer Guide to Safe Handling and Preparation of Ground Meat and Ground Poultry.''
The brochures are for consumers and for food service operators. Each brochure discusses proper handling, preparation
and storage methods for ground meat and ground poultry and emphasizes three key points (the three C's): keep it cold;
keep it clean; and cook it. These interim measures should minimize the impact of extending the timelines for implementation
of these labeling requirements.
Three commenters suggested that FSIS permit companies up to 18 months to exhaust supplies of labels that do not include
the safe handling instructions since it would be an economic and environmental burden to discard packaging materials.
One commenter cited the nutrition regulation which gave an 18 month implementation time and suggested a similar implementation
time. Three additional commenters requested that FSIS permit companies up to 1 year after the effective date of the
regulation to use labels with safe handling instructions required by the interim rule. They state that materials
were ordered in good faith to comply with the interim rule and it would be an economic burden to destroy such materials.
Commenters stated that due to low volume sales of certain products, they expect to have over a year's supply of labels
with the original safe handling instructions.
FSIS does not believe that 18 months or even 1 year should be given to exhaust packaging materials that do not include
the safe handling instructions. Implementation time required for the nutrition regulations cannot be compared
to the safe handling regulations since the two are very different. The safe handling regulations prescribe the exact
language required on the label and do not require time consuming laboratory analysis or interpretation of extensive
rules regarding formats, serving sizes, claims, etc. However, FSIS has been persuaded by the comments to permit safe
handling instructions provided in both the August 16, 1993, interim rule and the October 12, 1993, final rule to be
used for 1 year past the effective date of this final rule. The label required under this final rule is unchanged from
the label required in the October 12, 1993, final rule. 



Product Appropriateness and Inclusiveness


Eleven commenters suggested that we narrow the focus of the regulation making safe handling instructions mandatory
on ground meat and poultry products and voluntary on all other meat and poultry products. Many stated that the proposed
rule was overly broad and that no evidence was presented to support the requirement of safe handling instructions
on products other than ground products. They suggested the labeling effort would be more effective if ground products
were targeted so that the information would have a proper impact with consumers. In addition, they stated that to blanket
every package in the meat case with the same message would in effect make the message invisible because it would be so
repetitive.

Several commenters questioning the scope of the regulation cited information from the preamble of the August 2, 1993,
Uncured Meat Pattie regulation which stated ``The likelihood of foodborne illness is not the same in all beef products
or all hamburger-type products. Ground meat presents a different risk than whole muscle cuts such as steaks, roasts,
or chops * * * the production process for ground meat assures that any present pathogens will be distributed
throughout the product, including the interior, while bacteria tend to remain on the surface of steaks, roasts, and
chops. This factor has major implications for the cooking process. Because a rare steak is thoroughly cooked at the
surface, one can presume that pathogenic bacteria present are killed.'' They proposed limiting this labeling to
ground products. One additional commenter objected to pork products in 9 CFR 318.10(a) being suddenly drawn into
the proposed regulation.

FSIS agrees that comminuted products present a greater potential threat to public health than whole muscle cuts.
For this reason, FSIS is requiring that comminuted products be labeled with safe handling instructions within 60
days after publication of this final rule. As cited elsewhere in this preamble, many outbreaks of 

E. coli 

0157:H7 food poisoning in the past year have been epidemiologically linked to the consumption of comminuted products.
However, 

E. coli 

0157:H7 is not the only pathogen targeted in this rulemaking proceeding. The proposed rule also cited statistics
relating to illness, death, and medical and productivity cost due to other bacteria, including 

Salmonella, Camphylobacter jejuni 

or 

coli, Listeria monocytogenes, 

and parasites, including 

Toxoplasma gondii, Trichinella spiralis, Taenia saginata, 

and 

Taenia solium.
The safe handling instructions were designed to cover the four broad parameters of food safety and to prevent outbreaks
of foodborne illness resulting from all sources, not just E. coli 

0157:H7 in ground beef. Meat and poultry products are known carriers of the pathogenic bacteria and parasites identified
in the proposed rule and compliance with the safe handling instructions will prevent some foodborne illnesses and
deaths. To require safe handling instructions exclusively on ground meat and poultry might lead consumers to mistakenly
believe that other raw or partially cooked meat and poultry products are without risk, and ignores the concern for
public health arising from the presence of pathogenic organisms on all types of raw and partially cooked meat and poultry
products. It is important to remember that the safe handling instructions include parameters of safe handling beyond
cooking instructions. In addition, the scope of the proposed regulation is supported by one official establishment
which stated that all types of meat and poultry products should be required to have safe handling instructions since
bacterial contamination can take place on any cut or type of meat and one meat trade association which stated that even
products traditionally well cooked in the home need to carry safe handling instructions due to the possibility of
cross contamination.
Regarding the inclusion of certain pork products in 9 CFR 318.10(a), these products have not suddenly been drawn into
the safe handling regulation. These products were included in the interim rule as products needing safe handling
instructions. The commenter misinterpreted this section.
One meat trade association questioned the fact that FSIS has taken no initiative to seek FDA efforts to have foods under
FDA jurisdiction similarly labeled. FSIS will advise the Food and Drug Administration of the concerns expressed
by commenters.
Nine commenters recommended that safe handling instructions not be required for products such as frozen dinners
and entrees. Several reasons were given as to why such products do not need safe handling instructions. Commenters
stated that FSIS has provided no evidence that such products present a meaningful health risk to consumers. In addition,
they state that the four safe handling instructions either appear on the labels already or are unnecessary for frozen
dinners and entrees. The commenters state that other regulations require a handling statement on the label, thus
the refrigeration statement is redundant and unnecessary. Most of the products are not handled directly by consumers
and there is no contact between the products and working surfaces, making the cross contamination statement unnecessary.
Frozen dinners and entrees already contain very specific cooking instructions which are far superior to ``cook thoroughly.''
Lastly, most products are single serve items making the statement on leftovers inapplicable, however, many manufacturers
currently include statements such as ``Promptly refrigerate any unused portion'' on their labels.
FSIS disagrees with these comments. While frozen dinners and entrees probably pose a relatively lower risk of foodborne
illness than fresh meat and poultry products, these products are vulnerable to the same mishandling risks associated
with fresh product. Freezing is not considered a pathogen destruction step, but will only slow their growth. The Agency
believes it is prudent to require the safe handling instructions on these types of frozen products if the meat portion
is either uncooked or partially cooked. Since current instructions for handling frozen dinners and entrees varies
from manufacturer to manufacturer the safe handling instructions will provide a consistent and uniform message.
In addition, none of the current handling instructions include a rationale statement which explains to consumers
why it is important to follow the prescribed instructions and the focus-study research indicated that the rationale
statement was an integral part of the safe handling instructions.
The Texas Department of Health recommended that the exemption for custom slaughter products be eliminated. They
state that these products are as likely to contain harmful or pathogenic bacteria that could cause illness if mishandled.
However, they suggest that labeling each individual package is not necessary since the product goes back to the owner
for use. One meat trade association suggested that we retain the custom exemption since elimination of the exemption
could cause more owners to do their own farm slaughter and processing which would result in a greater danger of meat
and poultry contamination.
FSIS is not persuaded by the comments to eliminate the exemption of custom slaughtered products. While the Agency
encourages the distribution of safe handling information with products slaughtered under the exemption, labeling
is not required for such products if they are marked ``not for sale.''

Location of Information on Label



One official establishment and two meat trade associations misread the proposal as requiring that the labels be placed
on either the principal display panel or the information panel. One poultry trade association on behalf of an official
establishment requested FSIS to permit the safe handling instructions to appear on the back of an insert label with
a referral statement on the front informing consumers that the instructions were on the back.

One consumer group stated that placement of the safe handling instructions anywhere on the label as to render it likely
to be read is ambiguous and will likely result in lengthy disputes regarding its meaning. They recommended that FSIS
revert to the original requirement from the interim regulation on the placement, i.e., on the principal display panel
or information panel, which will have the same result while avoiding unnecessary disputes and litigation.

FSIS is not persuaded by the comments to make any changes in the placement of the safe handling instructions. The instructions
may be placed anywhere on the outside label where they will be visible at the time of purchase. Several of the commenters
must have misread the proposal when they objected to placement of the instructions on the principal display panel
or the information panel. The interim rule required such placement but comments persuaded FSIS to allow flexibility
in the placement of the safe handling instructions. We do not believe that the current language is ambiguous or will
lead to lengthy disputes.

Several commenters stated that FSIS ignored the previous comments that packages would be too small to carry all mandatory
information. As stated in the previous final regulation, FSIS is not aware of labels smaller than those on 12 ounce
chubs that would likely require safe handling instructions. FSIS believes that labels will be large enough to accommodate
all mandatory information due to the flexibility provided by the safe handling and nutrition regulations. FSIS received
no comments which provided examples of packages that could not accommodate both features.



Rationale Statement



Five commenters suggested changes to the rationale statement. One retail store, one grocers association and one
meat association recommended that since all meat and poultry sold in commerce was inspected and passed by either Federal
or State authorities, FSIS should permitted the following on all products, ``This product was inspected for your
safety.'' These groups suggested the second sentence be changed to ``Food products must be handled and prepared properly
to prevent potential illness.'' This would emphasize the positive rather than negative aspects of proper food handling.
In addition one commenter suggested the option of a singular ``meat'' or ``Poultry'' label. Two consumer groups suggested
that the rationale statement did not appraise consumers of the true threat bacterial contamination poses and may
even give consumers a false sense of confidence about the safety of the product. Suggested change included eliminating
the first sentence of the rationale, the use of a ``warning,'' mentioning the possibility of death, and adding descriptions
of the symptoms of foodborne illness. FSIS concluded that the proposed rationale statement strikes a good balance
that will neither scare consumers away from meat and poultry products nor cause them to ignore risks of foodborne illness.
Given that, and the overwhelming acceptance of the single label message which will reduce the likelihood of errors,
no changes are made or further flexibility permitted in the final rule.

Additionally, one commenter stated that a different rationale statement should be permitted for irradiated product.
They suggested that a reference should be made to the reductions in bacterial counts that irradiation produces. While
FSIS does not agree with this comment, it anticipates addressing the issue of label claims related to emerging pathogen
reduction treatments in the future. However, these statements should not be a substitute for the required safe handling
instructions since the handling statements also apply to treated products.


Handling Statements


Some commenters suggested allowing flexibility on the cross contamination, cooking, and leftover statements similar
to the flexibility permitted in the proposal for the refrigeration statement. Three commenters suggested that deviations
in the statements could be approved through the prior approval system.
FSIS does not agree with these comments. In the long term, differences between label messages would work against consumer
recognition of the one label message. In addition, this is supported by five commenters who recommended that FSIS
make no changes in the text of the safe handling statements and one commenter that stated that it was in the best interest
of both consumers and the industry to have only one set of safe handling instructions since the existence of more than
one statement would only contribute to consumer and industry confusion.
One commenter suggested that we require the FSIS Hotline number with the label. The Meat and Poultry Hotline telephone
number may be included on other parts of the label. FSIS does not have enough information about the impact of including
this phone number on the label. Requiring it on 15 billion packages of product per year might easily overwhelm the Hotline
resources.
One fast-food restaurant chain suggested that FSIS permit deviations in the refrigeration statement, as well as
in other statements, if they conflicted with company policy or other printed company materials including operating
manuals. FSIS is not persuaded by this comment to make any changes in the regulation. FSIS believes that the flexibility
provided for the refrigeration statement is adequate to accommodate the only significant area of concern identified.
Two commenters suggested that FSIS add a recommendation for disinfecting or sanitizing hard surfaces because washing
cutting boards with soap and water will not guarantee elimination of pathogens. One of the commenters suggested that
this be included in leaflets containing other expanded information, such as cooking temperatures. They recommend
that the leaflets be required to be available at the point-of-sale in addition to the safe handling labels on the products
