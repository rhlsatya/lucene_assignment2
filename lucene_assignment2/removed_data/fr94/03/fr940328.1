<USDEPT>FEDERAL RETIREMENT THRIFT INVESTMENT BOARD</USDEPT>






Privacy Act Regulations



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (Board) is deleting the requirement in its rules on the Privacy Act
that an individual who wishes to consent to a release of his or her records to a third party submit an originally signed
statement authorizing the disclosure. A photocopy or facsimile transmission of the individual's signature and
authorization will suffice.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



The Privacy Act of 1974, at 5 U.S.C. 552a(b), states that ``No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in
a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request
by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains * * *'' unless disclosure
would be made pursuant to one of the Act's 12 exceptions.

The Board, established by the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA), maintains records similar
to records of other Federal agencies and a Government-wide system of records on current and former participants in
the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). The TSP is a tax-deferred retirement plan for Federal employees that has approximately
2 million participants. The Department of Agriculture, National Finance Center, Thrift Savings Plan Service Office
is the recordkeeper for TSP records subject to the Privacy Act.

Under current Board rules developed pursuant to the Privacy Act, ``An individual who wishes to have a person of his
or her choosing review a record or obtain a copy of a record from the Board shall submit an originally signed statement
authorizing the disclosure of his or her record before the record will be disclosed.'' The Board's recordkeeper typically
receives authorizations executed by participants who want a record disclosed to a financial institution so that
they may qualify for a mortgage loan.

Based on the Board's experience in administering its Privacy Act record systems, submission of an originally signed
authorization to disclose a record is not necessary because no significant safeguard results from this requirement.
In addition, the requirement to submit an originally signed authorization is burdensome to the recordkeeper and
to the participants. The Board, therefore, proposes to amend its Privacy Act rules to allow disclosure of a record
about an individual upon receipt of a statement signed by the individual authorizing disclosure of his or her record.



Other Matters



This rule is not a major rule for the purpose of Executive Order 12291 of February 17, 1981. As required by the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, it is hereby certified that this rule will not have a significant impact on small business entities.
As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act, I hereby certify that this rule will not require additional reporting.



List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 1630



Administrative practice and procedure, Privacy, Records.




Accordingly, the Board proposes to amend part 1630 of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations to read as follows:



PART 1630_PRIVACY ACT REGULATIONS



1. The authority citation for part 1630 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 5 U.S.C. 552a.




2. Section 1630.5 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows:



 1630.5 

Granting access to a designated individual.



(a) An individual who wishes to have a person of his or her choosing review a record or obtain a copy of a record from the
Board shall submit a signed statement authorizing the disclosure of his or her record before the record will be disclosed.
The authorization shall be maintained with the record.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) and Rural Development Administration (RDA) propose to amend the regulations
for the Business and Industry (B&I) Loan Program. The action is needed to relieve borrowers with small loans from
the existing requirement to provide annual audited financial statements. The action is expected to clarify the requirements
for annual financial statements and establish thresholds for determining which borrowers will be required to provide
audited statements.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Classification


We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.


Intergovernmental Review


This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under number 10.422, and is subject to intergovernmental
consultation in accordance with Executive Order 12372, and as stated in FmHA Instruction 1940-J, ``Intergovernmental
Review of Farmers Home Administration Programs and Activities.''


Environmental Impact Statement


This purposed action has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, Subpart G, ``Environmental Program.''
FmHA has determined that this proposed action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment and, in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public
Law 91-190,, an Environmental Impact Statement is not required.


Civil Justice


This proposed regulation has been reviewed in light of Executive Order 12778 and meets the applicable standards provided
in sections 2(a) and 2(B)(2) of that Order. Provisions within this part which are inconsistent with State law are controlling.
All administrative remedies pursuant to 7 CFR part 1900, subpart B must be exhausted prior to filing suit.


Paperwork Reduction Act


The collection of information requirements contained in this regulation have been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Public reporting burden for this
collection of information is estimated to vary from 3 to 8 hours per response, with an average of 4 hours per response
including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data
needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate
or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Department
of Agriculture, Clearance Officer, OIRM, room 404-W, Washington, DC 20250; and to the Office of Management
and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the Farmers Home Administration, Washington, DC 20503.

Background


This regulatory package is an FmHA initiative to enhance the program by reducing the financial burden on small business
borrowers of obtaining annual audits of their financial statements. The existing regulations require annual audited
financial statements from all borrowers, except those with loans that have been paid down to no more than $100,000
and to no more than two thirds of the original balance and have been current on repayments for at least 24 months. The
cost of the audits can often be the difference between a profit and a loss for the year for small businesses. Many small
businesses that need and want the assistance of the B&I guaranteed loan decide not to apply because they are unwilling
to commit to the cost of an annual audit. Small businesses that have obtained B&I guaranteed loans sometimes become
delinquent on the loans because the funds were spent on audits or refuse to honor their agreement to provide the audits.
The proposed revision will remove or allow FmHA to waive the requirement for annual audits for all loans of $500,000
or less and for loans that have been outstanding and have provided audits for three years, have an unpaid balance not
exceeding $1,000,000, and are current on repayments. All borrowers that do not provide audited financial statements
will be required to provide financial statements compiled or reviewed by an independent certified public accountant
or licensed public accountant.
Guaranteed loan borrowers subject to OMB Circulars A-128 or A-133 will also have to comply with those Circulars.
Insured (direct) B&I loans are governed by the requirements of 7 CFR part 1942.


List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1980


Loan programs, Business and industry, Rural development assistance, Rural areas.



Accordingly, chapter XVIII, title 7, Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows:


PART 1980_GENERAL


1. The authority citation for Part 1980 continues to read as follows:





Authority:

 7 CFR 1989; 42 U.S.C. 1480; 5 U.S.C. 301; 7 CFR 2.23; 7 CFR 2.70.


Subpart E_Business and Industrial Loan Program


2. Section 1980.445 is added to read as follows:


 1980.445

Periodic financial statements and audits.


All borrowers will be required to submit periodic financial statements to the lender. Lenders must forward copies
of the financial statements and the lender's analysis of the statements to FmHA.
(a) 

Audited financial statements

. Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (d), and (e) of this section, all recipients of guaranteed loans of more than
$500,000 will be required to submit annual audited financial statements. The audit must be performed in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS) using the publication, ``Standards for Audit of
Governmental Organizations, Programs, Activities and Functions,'' developed by the Comptroller General of the
United States in 1988, and any subsequent revisions. In addition, the audits are also to be performed in accordance
with various Office of Management and Budget (OMB) circulars and any FmHA requirements specified in this subpart.
(b) 

Unaudited financial statements

. For borrowers with a loan balance (principal plus interest) of $500,000 or less, FmHA will require annual financial
statements which may be statements compiled or reviewed by an accountant qualified in accordance with the publication
``Standards for audit of Governmental Organizations, Programs, Activities and Functions,'' instead of audited
financial statements. For all loans, FmHA may also accept compilation or review statements even though the loan agreement
requires an audit, when all of the following conditions are met:



(1) The loan has been outstanding and satisfactory audits have been provided for at least 3 years;
(2) The loan balance does not exceed $1,000,000; and
(3) The loan repayment is on schedule.



(c) 

Internal financial statements

. FmHA may require submission of financial statements prepared by the borrower's staff at whatever frequency is determined
necessary to adequately monitor the loan. Quarterly financial statements should be required on new business enterprises
or those needing close monitoring.
(d) 

Minimum requirements

. This section sets out minimum requirements for frequency and quality of financial statements to be submitted to
FmHA. If specific circumstances warrant, FmHA may require audited financial statements or independent unaudited
financial statements in excess of the minimum requirements. For example, loans that depend heavily on inventory
and accounts receivable for collateral should normally be audited, regardless of the size of the loan. Nothing herein
shall be considered an impediment to the lender requiring financial statements more frequently or of a higher quality
than required by FmHA.
(e) 

Public bodies and Nonprofit Corporations

. Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, any public body or nonprofit corporation that receives a guarantee
of a loan of $100,000 or more must provide an audit in accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars
A-128 or A-133 for the fiscal year of the borrower in which the Loan Note Guarantee is issued. If the loan
is for development or purchases made in a previous fiscal year through interim financing, an audit will also be provided
for the fiscal year in which the development or purchases occurred. Any audit provided by a public body or nonprofit
corporation in compliance with OMB Circulars A-128 or A-133 will be considered adequate to meet the requirements
of this section for that year.
3. Section 1980.451 is amended by revising paragraph (i)(13) to read as follows:


 1980.451

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.


II. Background and Substance of Petition


The Department of the Interior received a letter dated January 31, 1994, from James Kringlen, Attorney at Law, Appalachian
Research and Defense Fund, Inc., Charleston, West Virginia, as a petition for rulemaking. The petitioner requested
that ``* * * a new regulation be issued by the Office of Surface Mining or the Department of the Interior,
as appropriate, which would require all permit applications for surface mining include documentation with public
records identifying the surface owners of the property they propose to mine as well as the property contiguous to the
proposed mining property.''
Under section 201(g) of SMCRA, any person may petition the Director of OSM to initiate a proceeding for the issuance,
amendment, or repeal of any of the regulations implementing SMCRA. Under the applicable regulations for rulemaking
petitions, 30 CFR 700.12, this notice seeks public comment on the merits of the petition and on the rule changes requested
in the petition.
At the close of the comment period, a decision will be made whether to grant or deny the petition. Under 30 CFR 700.12,
the Director shall issue a written decision either granting or denying the petition within 90 days of the date of its
receipt. Soon thereafter, notice of that decision will be published in the 

Federal Register

. If the petition is granted, rulemaking proceedings will be initiated in which public comment will again be sought
before a final rulemaking notice appears. If the petition is denied, no further rulemaking action will occur pursuant
to the petition.


III. Procedural Matters


Publication of this notice of the receipt of the petition for rulemaking is a preliminary step prior to the initiation
of the rulemaking process. If a decision is made to grant the petition, a rulemaking process will be initiated. Thus,
no regulatory flexibility analysis is needed at this stage, nor a review under Executive Order 12866.
Publication of this notice does not constitute a major Federal action having a significant effect on the human environment
for which an environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act, 44 U.S.C. 4322(a)(c),
is needed.

Bruce Babbitt, Secretary of the Interior



Suite 6151, Main Interior Building, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, D.C. 20240.






Re: Petition for Rule-Making under SMCRA






Dear Secretary Babbitt: I am writing to inform you of a substantial and serious absence of protection of surface owner's
rights which the Surface Mining, Reclamation and Control Act was intended to protect. Specifically, when coal companies
apply for surface mining permits to State agencies responsible for SMCRA enforcement, they are not required to provide
proof of any kind regarding who owns the surface of the property the coal company seeks to strip mine. In other words,
the coal companies set forth the name or names of the persons or companies that own the surface without any documentation,
and the various States simply assume the correctness of the coal companies' representations. My experience has shown
that it is very risky to presume the good faith or the accuracy of information submitted by coal companies in their permit
applications.



My concern is prompted chiefly by my experience representing an elderly woman in Perry County, Kentucky, in her efforts
to prevent a coal company from getting a surface mining permit for her property. At the time, I was a staff attorney with
the Appalachian Research and Defense Fund of Kentucky, Inc., a Legal Services Corporation-funded legal aid program
in eastern Kentucky (at present I am a staff attorney with its sister program in West Virginia, Appalachian Research
and Defense Fund, Inc.). My client, America Caudill, came to me in July, 1992, frustrated in her efforts to protect
her small piece of land that she and her now deceased husband had purchased in 1940. (Enclosed is a copy of a newspaper
article about Mrs. Caudill's difficulty.) After seeing the company's (Sheena Coal Company) published notice in
the local newspaper indicating that it had applied for a surface mining permit in the vicinity of her home, she took
the time and effort to go to the local Department for Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (``DSMRE'') (some
forty miles from her home) in order to examine the permit application. Much to her dismay, she saw that Sheena Coal sought
a permit to strip mine her property, but the application utterly failed to identify her as the owner of the surface!
Instead, the application and accompanying maps asserted that America's neighbors on either side of her property
were the owners of her property as well!



Mrs. Caudill then attempted to exercise the citizen's rights provisions of SMCRA by requesting the DSDRE to deny the
permit because it failed to identify her as an owner of the surface as required by SMCRA, and because she had not given
Sheena Coal permission to mine her property. In reply, the State of Kentucky advised Mrs. Caudill that her contention
amounted to a mere private ``property title dispute'' which it lacked the authority to resolve. They further advised
her that they were going to issue the permit without further ado, which they did. They were kind enough to advise her
of her right to petition for a hearing pursuant to SMCRA's provisions, further advising her to whom she should write
to request the hearing and nothing more. Mrs. Caudill followed up with a written request for a hearing, but the attorney
for the Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet promptly filed a motion to dismiss her petition
for hearing on the basis that her request for a hearing had failed to set forth with particularity the items required
by the applicable State regulations.
 Never mine that Mrs. Caudill had already provided all of that information in her previous communications with the
State of Kentucky and that the letter advising her of her right to request a hearing failed to advise her of the particular
requirements for a hearing request under the regulation.







It was at this point that Mrs. Caudill came to me and requested assistance. The first thing I did was to check the public
records at the Property Valuation Administrator's office in the County Courthouse. This office includes aerial
photographs of every square inch of the county as well as the property lines and owners of record of the surface. There
on file was the public evidence of Mrs. Caudill's and her deceased husband's surface ownership of the very land that
Sheena Coal proposed to strip mine. I submitted this documentation to the State as well as a previous letter from the
President of Sheena Coal Company to Mrs. Caudill in which he acknowledged that he had no right to mine her property,
but indicating his hope that she would some day give him permission to do so. In the end, Sheena Coal was compelled to
amend its permit so as to delete Mrs. Caudill's property.

<TEXT>
 

I subsequently learned that very often coal companies knowingly submit permit applications which fail to identify
all of the surface owners of record. Usually, this is done because the company does not have all of the surface owners'
permission to mine, although they are negotiating with them and expect, or merely hope, that they will get such permission
later. However, they wish to get the permit as quickly as possible without the cost and delay associated with incremental
permit applications as they may obtain permission or agreements from various surface owners to the company's proposed
surface mining. Furthermore, the more surface owners identified in the application, the more post-mining documents
they must prepare and submit to the State upon completion of mining. Since the States require neither documentation
of the ownership of the surface of property proposed for surface mining, nor verify the information provided by coal
companies in the permit application review process, the coal companies have little incentive to accurately identify
the surface owners of the property. The biggest danger here, of course, is that some surface owners may find their property
being strip mined, notwithstanding that they never granted permission to mine to the mining permittee. Further,
the permittee could be expected to defend itself by highlighting the fact that the State had given a permit to mine the
property.

This major loophole in the law should be closed. I propose a new regulation be issued by the Office of Surface Mining
or the Department of the Interior, as appropriate, which would require all permit applications for surface mining
include documentation with public records identifying the surface owners of the property they propose to mine as
well as the property contiguous to the proposed mining property.

Please consider this much needed corrective regulation. The rights of citizens such as America Caudill will continue
to be overlooked despite the protective provisions in SMCRA unless coal companies are required to document the information
they provide in their surface mining permit applications. Please advise me whether your Department may pursue this
matter. Also, please call or write to me if you desire any further information or if there is anything further that I
can do to assist you and your Department in its consideration of my request.




   Sincerely,

<DOCTITLE>Indiana Regulatory Program Amendment</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed Rule; Reopening and Extension of Public Comment Period on Proposed Amendment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing receipt of additional revisions pertaining to previously proposed amendment No. 93-3 to
the Indiana regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the ``Indiana program'') under the Surface Mining Control
and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The revisions of Indiana's proposed rules pertain to ultimate authority for
the department, and record of the director for surface coal mining permits. The amendment is intended to revise Indiana's
rules at 310 IAC 0.6 to reflect statutory changes contained in the 1992 Senate Enrolled Act 154.



This document sets forth the times and locations that the Indiana program and proposed amendment to that program are
available for public inspection, and dates and times of the reopened comment period during which interested persons
may submit written comments on the proposed amendment.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 






I. Background on the Indiana Program

II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendment

III. Public Comment Procedures

IV. Procedural Determinations



I. Background on the Indiana Program




On July 29, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Indiana program. Background information
on the Indiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval
can be found in the July 26, 1982, 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 32071). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments can be found at 30
CFR 914.10, 914.15, and 914.16.



II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendment



By letter dated April 2, 1993, (Administrative Record No. IND-1217) Indiana submitted proposed amendment
93-3 to its program pursuant to SMCRA. Indiana submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. The provisions
that Indiana proposes to amend are:

310 IAC 0.6-1-2 concerning applicability of the rule; 310 IAC 0.6-1-2.5 concerning ultimate
authority for the Department of Natural Resources (IDNR); and 310 IAC 0.6-1-17 concerning record of the
director of the IDNR for surface coal mining permits. OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the April
23, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 21693) and invited public comment on its adequacy.

During its review of the amendment, OSM identified additional changes to the rules which had not been previously reviewed
and approved by OSM. Consequently, OSM reopened the public comment period to provide opportunity for public comment
on those rules which had not been identified as amendments in the initial comment period (September 21, 1993; 58 FR
48996).

By telefax dated March 10, 1994 (Administrative Record No. IND-1339), Indiana submitted a version of the proposed
amendment which differs from that provided to OSM during the original submittal of April 2, 1993. OSM is, therefore,
reopening the public comment period and inviting comment on the substantive changes identified below.


1. 310 IAC 0.6-1-2.5 Ultimate Authority for the Department


Subsection 2.5(b) is amended by deleting the words ``permit revision application.'' With this change, the administrative
law judge (ALJ) is the ultimate authority for the IDNR except for proceedings concerning the approval or disapproval
of a permit application or permit review under IC 13-4.1-4-5 and proceedings for suspension or revocation
of a permit under IC 13-4.1-11-6.



2. 310 IAC 0.6-1-17 Record of the Director of the IDNR for Surface Coal Mining Permits


Subsection 17(c) is amended to add the following language after the first sentence. ``However, nothing in this subsection
precludes the admission of testimony or exhibits which are limited to the explanation or analysis of materials included
in the record before the director, or the manner in which the materials were applied, used, or relied upon in evaluating
the application.''
Indiana is also amending the third sentence (formerly the second sentence) to provide that timely objections may
be made ``before or during'' a hearing. Prior to this change, timely objections were to be made at a hearing.
Finally, subdivision 17(c)(2) is amended to read: ``[T]he permit application as defined at 310 IAC 12-0.5-10.''
Prior to this change, the proposed language did include the words ``as defined at 310 IAC 12-0.5-10.''


III. Public Comment Procedures


OSM is reopening the comment period on the proposed Indiana program amendment to provide the public an opportunity
to reconsider the adequacy of the proposed amendment in light of the additional changes submitted. In accordance
with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable
program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Indiana
program.


Written Comments


Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under ``

DATES

'' or at locations other than the Indianapolis Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking
or included in the Administrative Record.


IV. Procedural Determinations


Executive Order 12866


This proposed rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866
(Regulatory Planning and Review).


Executive Order 12778


The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by Indiana, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.


National Environmental Policy Act


No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).


Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

).


Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

IV. Procedural Determinations


I. Background on the Utah Program


On January 21, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Utah program. General background information
on the Utah program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval
of the Utah program can be found in the January 21, 1981, 

Federal Register

 (46 FR 5899). Subsequent actions concerning Utah's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 944.15, 944.16,
and 944.30.


II. Proposed Amendment


By letter dated March 7, 1994, Utah submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. UT-899). Utah submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative to ``streamline the Utah program
and to simplify the process for revising permits.'' The provisions of the Utah Coal Mining Rules that Utah proposes
to amend are: Utah Administrative Rules (Utah Admin. R.) 645-303-224.400, .500, and .600, regarding
the requirements for significant permit revisions.
Specifically, Utah proposes to delete Utah Admin. R. 645-303-224.400, which requires that permit changes
ordered by the Division in accordance with Utah Admin. R. 645-303-212 and 213 (the provisions authorizing
the Division to order permit changes) must always be processed as significant permit revisions. In addition, Utah
proposes to recodify the existing provisions at Utah Admin. R. 645-303-224.500 and .600, regarding additional
criterion for categorizing and processing proposed permit changes as significant permit revisions, as Utah Admin.
R. 645-303-224.400 and .500 respectively.


III. Public Comment Procedures


In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies
the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part
of the Utah program.


1. Written Comments


Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under ``

DATES

'' or at locations other than the Albuquerque Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking
or included in the administrative record.


2. Public Hearing


Persons wishing to testify at the public hearing should contact the person listed under  

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

  by 4 p.m., m.s.t. on April 12, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting
the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held.
Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission
of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate
questions.
The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to testify have been heard. Persons
in the audience who have not been scheduled to testify, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been
scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to testify and persons present in the audience who wish
to testify have been heard.

However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.


3. National Environmental Policy Act


No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposed Endangered Status for the Plant Puccinellia Parishii (Parish's
Alkali Grass) 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to list the plant 

Puccinellia parishii 

(Parish's alkali grass) as an endangered species under the authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended
(Act). This ephemeral annual grass occurs in small, widely disjunct populations in California, Arizona, and New
Mexico occupying desert springs or seeps. Parish's alkali grass is threatened by alteration of hydrologic flows
due to spring or seep development, water diversion or impoundment, and groundwater pumping; loss of habitat from
farming, grazing, and residential construction activities; limited distribution; and low population numbers.
This proposal, if made final, would implement Federal protection provided by the Act for Parish's alkali grass. Critical
habitat is not being proposed.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background



Parish's alkali grass was first collected by Samuel Bonsal Parish at Rabbit Springs in the Mojave Desert of California
in 1915. It was described by A.S. Hitchcock in 1928. Parish's alkali grass has also been collected in Arizona and New
Mexico. 

Parish's alkali grass is a member of the grass family (Poaceae). It is a dwarf, ephemeral, winter-to-spring, tufted
annual that flowers from April to May. The leaves are 1-3 centimeters (cm) (0.4-1.2 inches (in)) long,
firm, upright, and very narrow. Flowering stems are 2-20 cm (0.8-8 in) long and number 1-25 per plant.
The inflorescence is 1-10 cm (0.4-4 in) long, narrow, and few-flowered. Each division has 2-6 perfect
flowers, 3-5 millimeters (mm) (0.1-0.2 in) long, that separate at maturity. 

Parish's alkali grass is known from widely disjunct localities in California, Arizona, and New Mexico. Its small
populations occupy a very specific desert habitat of alkaline springs and seeps at elevations of 700-1,800
meters (m) (2,300-6,000 feet (ft)). This species is dependent upon continuous spring or seep flows. Population
size fluctuates widely in response to climatic conditions and precipitation. 

In Arizona, Parish's alkali grass is documented from several historic locations on the Navajo and Hopi Indian reservations.
These include a marsh near Tuba City in Coconino County (Phillips and Phillips 1991) and near Shato (Shonto), Navajo
County. There are seven currently known sites in Arizona, all from the vicinity of Tuba City. It is unknown whether
the historic and currently known locations near Tuba City are precisely the same. The 7 known populations total approximately
400 plants and occupy about 0.1 hectare (ha) (0.2 acre (ac)) of mesic canyon bottom seeps and natural springs. Associated
riparian species include 

Triglochin 

spp. (arrowgrass), 

Distichlis stricta 

(saltgrass), and 

Juncus 

spp. (rush). The Shato population has not been relocated; wetland sites may have disappeared in response to severe
overgrazing (B. Hevron, Navajo Natural Heritage Program, pers. comm., 1993). 

Parish's alkali grass presently occurs at two sites in the California Mojave Desert. The first site is located on a
privately owned multiple spring complex in San Bernardino County. First collected at these springs in 1915 and later
in 1950 (Phillips and Phillips 1991), the species was rediscovered at the spring complex in 1992 (T. Thomas and C. Rutherford,
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1993). An estimated 100-200 plants occupy a 50 square (sq) m (500
sq ft) area, 5-8 m (16-26 ft) downslope from a leaking earthen impoundment. Associated species include


Anemopsis californica 

(yerba mansa), 

Carex 

spp. (sedge), saltgrass, 

Hesperochiron pumilus, 

and 

Mimulus guttatus 

(monkey flower). It is uncertain whether Parish's alkali grass disappeared at this location or was merely overlooked;
botanists had searched for it repeatedly (Rutherford, pers. comm., 1993). Alteration of hydrology and loss of habitat
could explain why this species remained undetected for 42 years (Phillips and Phillips 1991). There is little historic
information on the land use or hydrology of this spring complex from which to evaluate the present condition of the
Parish's alkali grass population. However, it is evident that the spring complex was altered at some point to create
several ponds for livestock use (Thomas, pers. comm., 1993). Development around this site may have contributed to
lowering the water table to the point that the spring stopped or rarely flowed (Phillips and Phillips 1991). Jerrold
Davis, of the Bailey Herbarium at Cornell University, noted that the spring itself did not appear to have flowed for
a long time (A. Phillips, Museum of Northern Arizona, pers. comm., 1991).

A second California population of Parish's alkali grass was discovered in a remote area of Edwards Air Force Base in
Kern County in 1992 (D. Charlton, Edwards Air Force Base, pers. comm., 1993). An estimated 50-400 plants occupy
a total area of 50 sq m (500 sq ft) at an elevation of 700 m (2,300 ft). The associated halophytic vegetation includes


Atriplex canescens 

(fourwing saltbush), 

Suaeda moquinii 

(inkweed), 

Calochortus striatus 

(alkali mariposa lily), 

Atriplex confertifolia 

(shadscale), and 

A. spinifera 

(spinescale) (Charlton, pers. comm., 1993). This population is located between the base of a stabilized dune on the
east side of Rosamond Dry Lake and a small barren playa. Additional habitat probably existed where a road now borders
the playa. Past land use is unknown. There are currently no activities in the area, but due to its roadside location,
the site remains vulnerable to accidental disturbance. This population occurs in an active dune field and could be
buried if the dunes shift or destabilize. 

The largest known population of Parish's alkali grass occurs at a privately owned spring in Grant County, New Mexico
(Phillips and Phillips 1991). This spring has been captured and the outflow comes out of two pipes. Parish's alkali
grass occurs in a low-lying seep area about 300 m (1,000 ft) downstream from the spring. This population occupies approximately
4 ha (10 ac) and varies from 200-5,000 plants, depending on environmental conditions. Associated riparian
species include 

Distichlis stricta 

(saltgrass), 

Sporobolus airoides 

(alkali sacaton), yerba mansa, 

Scirpus olneyi 

(Olney bulrush), and 

Juncus balticus 

(wire rush). 

Misidentification of Parish's alkali grass by botanists has led to the inclusion of erroneous localities in the literature.
A grass specimen collected in 1967 near Winkleman, Navajo County, Arizona, was later identified as 

Poa annua (annual blue grass). A specimen collected in 1982 from Clark County, Nevada (Wallace 1993), was later identified
as Leptochloa filiformis 

(red sprangletop). A specimen collected in 1966 near the town of Red River, Taos County, New Mexico, was recently identified
as annual blue grass (R. Sivinski, New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, pers. comm., 1993).

Federal action on this species began as a result of section 12 of the Act, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution to prepare a report on those plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United
States. This report, designated as House Document No. 94-51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. On
July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonian report as a petition within the context of section 4 (c)(2) (now section
4(b)(3)) of the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. Parish's
alkali grass was included as threatened in this notice of review. On December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82479), the Service published
an updated notice reviewing the native plants being considered for classification as endangered or threatened.
Parish's alkali grass was included in this notice as a Category 1 species. Category 1 comprises taxa for which the Service
has on file substantial data on biological vulnerability and threats to support preparation of listing proposals.
The November 23, 1983, supplement to the plant notice of review (48 FR 53640) reclassified Parish's alkali grass as
a Category 2 candidate. Category 2 species are those taxa for which there is some evidence of vulnerability, but for
which there are insufficient data to support listing proposals at the time. Parish's alkali grass was included as
a Category 2 species in the 1985 and 1990 notices of review (50 FR 39525, September 27, 1985; 55 FR 6183, February 21,
1990). The most recent plant notice of review (58 FR 51144; September 30, 1993) upgraded this species to Category 1
status. 

Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make findings on certain pending petitions within 1 year of
their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires that all petitions pending on October 13,
1982, be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. Because Parish's alkali grass was included in the 1975
Smithsonian report, which was accepted as a petition, the petition to list this species was treated as being newly
submitted on October 13, 1982. From 1983 to 1993, the Service made the required 1-year findings that listing Parish's
alkali grass was warranted, but precluded by other listing actions of higher priority, in accordance with section
4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act. Biological data supplied by Phillips and Phillips (1991) fully support the listing of
this species. Publication of this proposed rule constitutes the final 1-year finding for this species. 



Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 



Section 4 of the Act and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the Act set forth the criteria and procedures
for adding species to the Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to
one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to 

Puccinellia parishii

 Hitchcock (Parish's alkali grass) are as follows: 

A. 

The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range. 

Parish's alkali grass is vulnerable to alteration of the hydrologic flows upon which it depends through water diversion
and impoundment, and groundwater pumping. The development of these fragile spring habitats could eliminate the
already small populations of this species. One population near Tuba City, Arizona, occurs in a mesic canyon bottom
used since the late 1800's for farming. The canyon bottom is divided into a series of plots that are farmed by individual
families (Hevron, pers. comm., 1993). Water is drained from the canyon bottom each spring by two lateral ditches and
a central drain. It takes about 4-6 weeks for the area to dry out enough to be farmed. Farming practices such as
burning, herbicide use, and plowing regimes may have impacted this population of Parish's alkali grass because the
grass is present in some farm plots, but absent in others with apparently similar soils and drainage. Plants of Parish's
alkali grass have been observed plowed up within some plots (Hevron, pers. comm., 1993). Threats to this and other
sites within the Tuba City area include farming of seep habitat, construction, recreation, and water diversion.


Livestock have access to most of the currently known sites of Parish's alkali grass, but apparently do not graze the
species. However, trampling by livestock occurs at the Grant County spring and in the Tuba City area. Livestock hooves
produce surface disturbance that can develop into gullies, increase soil erosion and surface water runoff, reduce
or eliminate the soil seed bank, open up the habitat to invasive weedy species, and lessen the ability of Parish's alkali
grass populations to recover. 

The most severe types of surface disturbance and habitat alteration occur when heavy equipment is used within spring
or seep habitat. The San Bernardino County spring complex was changed from a natural spring into several water impoundments
presumably used by livestock. Although no further construction is currently planned for this site, it is near the
community of Lucerne Valley, which is undergoing an accelerated rate of development. One population of Parish's
alkali grass in the Tuba City area occurs on a hillside that has been partly leveled by a bulldozer, possibly for house
construction. Such habitat alteration can cause permanent changes in the soil microhabitat, severe soil erosion,
loss of the soil seed bank, and eventual decline or loss of the population. 

B. 

Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. 

No economic uses for Parish's alkali grass are known. However, low population numbers make this species vulnerable
to overcollection by both scientists and rare plant enthusiasts.

C. 

Disease or predation. 

Jackrabbits (

Lepus californicus

) have been documented grazing the San Bernardino County, California, site during midsummer (Thomas, pers. comm.,
1993). The effect of this predation on Parish's alkali grass is unknown. No significant disease has been observed
in this species. 

D. 

The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. 

Parish's alkali grass is included as a Highly Safeguarded species on the list of plants protected under the Arizona
Native Plant Law (ARS 3-901), administered by the Arizona Department of Agriculture. A  Highly 
Safeguarded  species  is  one ``* * * whose prospects for survival in this State are in jeopardy*
* *.'' The protections afforded a Highly Safeguarded species include restrictions on collecting and a requirement
for salvage permits. However, all known populations of Parish's alkali grass in Arizona occur on tribal lands where
the Arizona Native Plant Law does not apply. This species is not currently protected on the Navajo or Hopi reservations
in Arizona. Under title 17 section 507(b) of the Navajo Tribal Code and Navajo Nation Council Resources Committee
Resolution RCF-014-91, the Navajo Fish and Wildlife Department has developed the Navajo Nation Endangered
Species List (NESL) for tribal lands. Parish's alkali grass is currently listed on the NESL as a Group 4 species, meaning
there is insufficient information to list it as endangered or threatened on the NESL. There are currently no restrictions
on its collection and/or the modification of its habitat on the Navajo reservation. The Navajo Fish and Wildlife Department
is in the process of revising the status of Parish's alkali grass (Hevron, pers. comm., 1993). 

Although Parish's alkali grass is not listed as endangered by the State of California, it is on List 1B of the California
Native Plant Society's Inventory of Rare and Endangered Vascular Plants of California. List 1B plants are considered
``rare, threatened, or endangered in California and elsewhere.'' Under the guidelines of the California Environmental
Quality Act, List 1B species are considered equivalent to State-listed species for the purposes of disclosing project
impacts to sensitive resources in environmental assessments. However, such disclosure does not confer protection
from project impacts on these species. 

Parish's alkali grass is protected in the State of New Mexico by the New Mexico Native Plant Protection Act (NMFRCD
Rule No. 91-1). This law prohibits collection without a permit from the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural
Resources Department. 

E. 

Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.

 Low population numbers and limited distribution make this species vulnerable to extinction from both natural and
manmade threats. Further reduction in population numbers could reduce the reproductive capability and genetic
potential of this species. There is a potential threat of deliberate destruction of plants by individuals concerned
about the perceived loss of property rights resulting from listing species under the Act. 

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by this species in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the
preferred action is to list Parish's alkali grass as endangered without critical habitat. Endangered status is appropriate
because there are few remaining populations and the species' habitat is vulnerable to hydrologic alteration, development,
grazing impacts, and other disturbances. Critical habitat is not being proposed for the reasons discussed below.




Critical Habitat 



Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
propose critical habitat at the time a species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation
of critical habitat is not prudent for Parish's alkali grass at this time. Service regulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)(1))
state that designation of critical habitat is not prudent when one or both of the following situations exist_(1) The
species is threatened by taking or other human activity, and identification of critical habitat can be expected to
increase the degree of such threat to the species, or (2) such designation of critical habitat would not be beneficial
to the species. As discussed under Factors B and E in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species,'' Parish's alkali
grass is threatened by taking (including vandalism to habitat), an activity difficult to enforce against and only
regulated by the Act with respect to plants in cases of (1) removal and reduction to possession of listed plants from
lands under Federal jurisdiction, or their malicious damage or destruction on such lands; and (2) removal, cutting,
digging up or damaging or destroying in knowing violation of any State law or regulation, including State criminal
trespass law. Such provisions are difficult to enforce, and publication of critical habitat descriptions and maps
would make Parish's alkali grass more vulnerable and increase enforcement problems. Pertinent Federal, State,
and local government agencies have been notified of the proposed listing of this species. Other interested parties
will be notified either by mail or by public notice in local newspapers. Private landowners that have not yet been notified
will be notified of the location and importance of protecting this species' habitat, following publication of this
proposal. Protection of this species' habitat will be addressed through the recovery process and through the section
7 jeopardy standard. Therefore, it would not now be prudent to propose critical habitat for Parish's alkali grass.

Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.
Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies,
groups, and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires
that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions
against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below. 

Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(4) requires Federal agencies to confer with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued
existence of a species proposed for listing or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical
habitat. If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities
they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or destroy
or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat,
the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. 

Possible future Federal actions that could affect Parish's alkali grass include U.S. Army Corps of Engineers involvement
in projects such as the construction of roads, bridges, and dredging projects subject to section 404 of the Clean Water
Act (33 U.S.C. 1344 

et seq.

) and section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 401 

et seq.

), and issuance of loans by the Farmers Home Administration. The Bureau of Indian Affairs may permit, fund, or carry
out actions such as utility corridors or home construction within spring habitat. Road construction, training exercises,
and other military activities could affect the species at Edwards Air Force Base. 

The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 set forth a series of general prohibitions
and exceptions that apply to all endangered plants. All prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by
50 CFR 17.61, apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the
United States to import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity,
sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduce to possession the species from areas
under Federal jurisdiction. In addition, for plants listed as endangered, the Act prohibits the malicious damage
or destruction on Federal lands and the removal, cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroying of such plants in knowing
violation of any State law or regulation, including State criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agents
of the Service and State conservation agencies. 

The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities
involving endangered species under certain circumstances. Such permits are available for scientific purposes
and to enhance the propagation or survival of the species. It is anticipated that few trade permits would ever be sought
or issued because Parish's alkali grass is not common in cultivation or in the wild. Requests for copies of the regulations
on listed species and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits may be addressed to the Office of Management Authority,
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, room 420C, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203 (703/358-2105,
FAX 703/358-2281). 



Public Comments Solicited 



The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible.
Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community,
industry, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularly
are sought concerning: 

(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning any threat (or lack thereof) to Parish's alkali
grass; 

(2) The location of any additional populations of this species and the reasons why any habitat should or should not
be determined to be critical habitat as provided by section 4 of the Act; 

(3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and population size of this species; and 

(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possible impacts on this species. 

Final promulgation of the regulation on this species will take into consideration the comments and any additional
information received by the Service, and such communications may lead to a final regulation that differs from this
proposal. 

The Endangered Species Act provides for one or more public hearings on this proposal, if requested. Requests must
be received within 45 days of the date of publication of the proposal in the 

Federal Register

. Such requests must be made in writing and be addressed to the Field Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, New
Mexico Ecological Services Field Office (see 

ADDRESSES

 section). 



National Environmental Policy Act 



The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that Environmental Assessments and Environmental Impact Statements,
as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection
with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining
the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).

ACTION: 

Notice of a finding on a petition.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a 90-day petition finding on a pending petition to add an endemic
Hawaiian spider, 

Doryonychus raptor,

 to the List of Endangered and Threatened wildlife. Substantial information has not been presented to indicate that
the requested action may be warranted.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background


Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) (Act), requires that the Service make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents
substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. To the
maximum extent practicable, this finding is to be made within 90 days of the receipt of the petition, and the finding
is to be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

. If the Service finds that a petition presents substantial information indicating that a requested action may be
warranted, then the Service initiates a status review on that species. The Service has received and made a 90-day finding
on the following petition.

On September 25, 1991, Dr. Rosemary G. Gillespie, Research Fellow of the Hawaiian Evolutionary Biology Program,
University of Maryland at College Park, submitted a petition to list an endemic Hawaiian spider, 

Doryonychus raptor

 Simon, as an endangered species. The petition was received by the Service on September 27, 1991. After review of the
petition and supporting documentation, the Fish and Wildlife Service finds that the petition does not present sufficient
information to substantiate that the requested action may be warranted.



Doryonychus raptor

 was initially discovered by R.C.L. Perkins in the 1890's, but had not been observed subsequently in the wild until
the petitioner, Dr. Gillespie, reported the existence of 

D. raptor

 within the Hono O Na Pali Natural Area Reserve in 1990. Dr. Gillespie believes that this species is restricted to areas
of low elevation, directly beneath high waterfalls emanating from the Alakai plateau on the island of Kauai. In addition
to its limited range, 

D. raptor

 may be threatened by predation by alien species of spiders and ants. Since the rediscovery of the species, the petitioner
has been actively collecting baseline data on the current distribution and abundance of 

D. raptor.

 However, because the historic distribution and abundance of the species is not known, there is no good comparative
evidence that would support a determination that the species is in decline over all or a significant portion of its
range at this point in time. In addition, the encroachment of alien plant species into the spider's habitat is not entirely
a threat, as the spider is reported to be present in alien 

Psidium

 (guava) forests.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Apportionment of reserve; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NMFS proposes to apportion reserve to certain target species in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area
(BSAI). This action is necessary to allow for ongoing harvest and account for previous harvest of the total allowable
catch (TAC). It is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The groundfish fishery in the BSAI area of the U.S. exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce
according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP),
prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and
Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.



The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the initial TACs specified for pollock and Greenland
turbot in the Bering Sea, for Pacific ocean perch, Greenland turbot, and pollock in the Aleutian Islands, for Atka
mackerel in the combined Eastern Aleutian District and Bering Sea subarea, and for Pacific cod in the BSAI, need to
be supplemented from the non-specific reserve in order to continue operations and account for prior harvest. Therefore,
in accordance with  675.20(b), NMFS proposes to apportion from the reserve to TACs for the following species:
(1) For the Bering Sea area_99,750 metric tons (mt) to pollock and 700 mt to Greenland turbot; (2) for the Aleutian Islands
area_1,635 mt to Pacific ocean perch, 350 mt to Greenland turbot, and 4,245 mt to pollock; (3) for the combined Eastern
Aleutian District and Bering Sea subarea_2,021 mt to Atka mackerel; and (4) for the BSAI management area_28,650 mt
to Pacific cod.

These proposed apportionments are consistent with  675.20(a)(2)(i) and do not result in overfishing of a target
species or the ``other species'' category, because the revised TACs are equal to or less than specifications of acceptable
biological catch. 

Pursuant to  675.20(a)(3)(i), the proposed apportionments of pollock are allocated between the inshore and
offshore components: (1) For the Bering Sea_34,913 mt to vessels catching pollock for processing by the inshore component
and 64,837 mt to vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component; and (2) for the Aleutian Islands_1,486
mt to vessels catching pollock for processing by the inshore component and 2,759 mt to vessels catching pollock for
processing by the offshore component.

Pursuant to  675.20(a)(3)(iv), the proposed apportionment of the BSAI Pacific cod TAC is allocated 573 mt to
vessels using jig gear, 12,606 mt to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear, and 15,471 mt to vessels using trawl gear.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing amendments
to the Federal Acquisition Regulation to clarify that the Government's obligation to purchase from statutorily
mandated sources of supply also applies when contractors purchase the supply items for Government use. This regulatory
action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September
30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



A. Background



The proposed amendments to FAR Parts 8, 51, and 62 provide clarification that the statutory obligation for Government
agencies to satisfy their requirements for certain supplies from procurement lists of supplies available from the
Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (Committee) also applies when contractors
purchase the supply items for Government use. The proposed revisions respond to concerns raised by the Committee
that such a clarification is necessary for situations when Government agencies contract with commercial sources
to perform an agency's supply function. The revisions are consistent with changes in the Committee's regulations
which were published in the 

Federal Register

 at 56 FR 48974, September 26, 1991.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

, because the rule will require contractors to purchase certain supply items from the same statutorily mandated sources
that Government agencies are required to use when the contractor is performing an agency's supply function. An Initial
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses
and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered
in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

 (FAR case 91-108), in correspondence.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

(c) The statutory obligation for Government agencies to satisfy their requirements for supplies available from
the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled also applies when contractors purchase
the supply items for Government use.

3. Section 8.003 is added to read as follows:



8.003

 Contract clause.



The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.208-00, Contractor Use of Mandatory Sources of Supply,
in solicitations and contracts which require a contractor to purchase supply items for Government use that are available
from the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled. The contracting officer shall identify
in the contract schedule the items which must be purchased from a mandatory source and the specific source.



PART 51_USE OF GOVERNMENT SOURCES BY CONTRACTORS



4. Section 51.101 is amended by adding paragraph (c) to read as follows:



51.101

* * * * *



(c) Contracting officers shall authorize contractors purchasing supply items for Government use that are available
from nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities (see subpart 8.7) to purchase
the items directly from the agencies or from the General Services Administration, Defense Logistics Agency and Department
of Veterans Affairs if products from the agencies are available through their distribution facilities.

5. Section 51.102 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) introductory text and (c)(3) to read as follows:



51.102

 Authorization to use Government supply sources.



(a) Before issuing an authorization to a contractor to use Government supply sources in accordance with 51.101 (a)
or (b), the contracting officer shall place in the contract file a written finding supporting issuance of the authorization.
A written finding is not required when authorizing use of the Government supply sources in accordance with 51.101(c).
The determination shall be based on, but not limited to, considerations of the following factors:



* * * * *



(c) * * *

(3) Approval for the contractor to use Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) supply sources from the Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management (Code 90), Office of Acquisition and Materiel Management, Department

PART 52_SOLICITATION PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT CLAUSES



6. Section 52.208-00 is added to read as follows:



52.208-00

 Contractor use of mandatory sources of supply.



As prescribed in 8.003, insert the following clause:



Contractor Use of Mandatory Sources of Supply (Date)



(a) Certain supplies to be provided under this contract for use by the Government are required by law to be obtained
from nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities (Javits-Wagner-O'Day
Act (JWOD) (41 U.S.C. 48)). Additionally, certain of these supplies must be purchased through the General Services
Administration (GSA), Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) or the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The Contractor
shall obtain supplies to be provided for use by the Government under this contract from the sources indicated in the
contract schedule.

(b) The Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer if a mandatory source is unable to provide the
supplies by the time required, or if the quality of supplies provided by the mandatory source is unsatisfactory. The
Contractor shall not purchase the supplies from other sources until the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor
that the mandatory source has authorized purchase from other sources.

(c) Price and delivery information for the mandatory source supplies is available from the Contracting Officer for
the supplies obtained through the GSA/DLA/VA distribution facilities. Information is available from JWOD nonprofit
agencies for the supplies they provide directly to the Contractor. Payments shall be made directly to the source making
delivery. Points of contact for JWOD nonprofit agencies are:

(1) National Industries for the Blind (NIB), 19101 North Beauregard Street, Suite 200, Alexandria, VA 22311-1727,
(703) 998-0770

Federal Acquisition Regulation; First Article Testing and Approval



AGENCIES: 

Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing a change
to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which adds language to the existing first article clauses and adds a new
solicitation provision, Waiver of First Article Testing and Approval. This regulatory action was not subject to
Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



A. Background



The existing first article clauses at FAR 52.209-3, First Article Approval-Contractor Testing, and 52.209-4,
First Article Approval-Government Testing, do not cover all the requirements of FAR 9.306, Solicitation requirements.
The proposed language will cover the main requirements in this section and will reduce the number of non-standard
provisions and clauses on this subject.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

, because the changes will standardize the FAR coverage addressed under FAR 9.306, Solicitation requirements. An
Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses
and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered
in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

 (FAR case 91-105), in correspondence.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96-511) is deemed to apply because the proposed rule contains information
collection requirements. Accordingly, a request for approval of a new information collection requirement concerning
the Waiver of First Article Testing and Approval Requirements solicitation provision is being submitted to the Office
of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

 Public comments concerning this request will be invited through a 

Federal Register

 notice appearing in this same issue.

Federal Acquisition Regulation; Subcontract Proposal Audits


AGENCIES: 

Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).



<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing amendments
to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to add two additional examples of when field pricing support audits of
subcontract proposals may be appropriate. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget
review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background


The DOD Inspector General's final report of December 11, 1991, Review of Actions Taken on 42 Contractor Estimating
System Cited as Inadequate by the General Accounting Office (Report No. AFU 92-1), found that estimating system
deficiencies warrant additional management attention. Expanded regulatory guidance governing contracting officer's
requests for assist audits of subcontractor cost proposals was recommended.


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

, because most contracts awarded to small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and certified
cost or pricing data and field pricing support are not required. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has,
therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered
in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601,


et seq.

, FAR case 92-2, in correspondence.


C. Paperwork Reduction Act


The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

2. Section 15.806-3 is amended in paragraph (a)(3) by removing the word ``or''; in paragraph (a)(4) by removing
the period and inserting a semicolon in its place; and adding paragraphs (a)(5) and (a)(6) to read as follows:


 15.806-3 

Field pricing reports.


(a) * * *
(5) The contractor or higher tier subcontractor has been cited for having significant estimating system deficiencies
in the area of subcontract pricing, especially the failure to perform adequate cost analyses of proposed subcontract
costs or to perform subcontract analyses prior to negotiation of the prime contract with the Government; or
(6) A lower tier subcontractor has been cited as having significant estimating system deficiencies.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing an amendment
to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to address unnecessarily requiring the submission of cost or pricing
data and to clarify when adequate price competition exists.



This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order 12866,
dated September 30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



A. Background



The revisions to FAR 15.804-1 and 15.804-2 originated as part of the Defense Management Review.

President Bush's memorandum on ``Reducing the Burden of Government Regulation'' tasked selected agencies and departments
to review current regulations, to identify those that impose a substantial cost on the economy, and to make appropriate
revisions. In response to this direction, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council solicited and received the
views of various industry associations and the public. The revision to FAR 15.804-3 originated from an industry
recommendation.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq

., because it clarifies current policy. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed.
Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning
the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately
and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq

. (FAR case 92-33), in correspondence.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501,

as follows:



 15.804-1

General.



(a) * * *

(2) Unnecessarily requiring the submission of cost or pricing data is not in the best interest of the Government because
it leads to increased proposal preparation costs, extends acquisition lead-time, and wastes both contractor and
Government resources.

(d) When there is a reasonable expectation that adequate price competition will result on a particular procurement,
the contracting officer should rarely have a need to require the submission or certification of cost or pricing data,

(A) The lowest price; or

(B) Offers the greatest value (see 15.605(c)) to the Government and price is a stated substantial factor in source
selection.

(2) * * *

(ii) An offeror has such a decided advantage that it is practically immune from competition; or

Federal Acquisition Regulation; Civil Defense Costs, Plant Protection Costs, and Recruitment Costs



AGENCIES:

(NASA).




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing amendments
to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) by removing and reserving regulations on Civil defense costs and Plant
protection costs, and by revising regulations on Recruitment costs. These proposed changes represent the second
in a series resulting from the Councils' ongoing review of industry recommendations concerning FAR regulations
on Contract Cost Principles and Procedures. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget
review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



A. Background



As part of the Defense Management Review, the Office of the Secretary of Defense requested comments from industry
concerning improvements to the Government's procurement regulations. The Council of Defense and Space Industry
Associations (CODSIA) responded with several proposals, including one to revise FAR part 31, Contract Cost Principles
and Procedures. CODSIA grouped its recommendations into six areas. Proposed rule changes will be published for comment
as the Councils complete their incremental reviews of CODSIA's recommendations in each of these groupings. However,
all resultant final rule changes will be published at one time, at the end of this effort. This proposed rule represents
the second of these six groupings.

The Councils believe deletion of FAR 31.205-5, Civil defense costs, is warranted because any ``extraordinary''
expenditures in planning for, and protecting life and property against, the possible effects of enemy attack (including
terrorist attacks) can be subjected to the ``reasonableness'' criteria under FAR 31.201-3 or made the subject
of an advance agreement under FAR 31.109. Likewise, removing FAR 31.204-29, Plant protection costs, is warranted
because such costs are common and necessary expenses incurred by all contractors and can also be subjected to the ``reasonableness''
criteria under FAR 31.201-3. Paragraph (c) of FAR 31.205-34 is revised to clarify the allowability of
offering any excessive compensation costs or any special emoluments (such as signing bonuses) to attract prospective
employees from other Government contractors. In addition, paragraph FAR 31.205-34(b)(5) is deleted and the
existing paragraph (b)(6) is redesignated as (b)(5) because the subject matter is discussed in the revised paragraph
(c). We believe the proposed language at FAR 31.205-34(c) more effectively articulates the Government's long-standing
policy against ``pirating''.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.,

 because most contracts awarded to small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost principles
do not apply. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited
from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart
will also be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite
5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

 (FAR case 91-112), in correspondence.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501,

(c) Compensation costs offered by a contractor to prospective employees working for another Government contractor
which are in excess of those normally offered to its employees with substantially the same training and experience
are unallowable. Such costs shall remain unallowable as long as they are in excess of normal compensation costs. For
the purpose of this cost principle, compensation costs include total compensation for personal services (as defined
in 31.205-6(a)) and any special emoluments associated with the recruitment.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to revise
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the clause, Allowable Cost and Payment_Facilities, to eliminate the
requirements for contractors to execute a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data in conjunction with final indirect
cost agreements on facilities contracts, and for auditors to obtain a certificate under auditor determination procedures
for final indirect cost rates. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant
to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



A. Background



Negotiation of final indirect cost agreements do not represent contract modifications or changes, but rather the
implementation of pre-existing contract terms. Accordingly, certification is not required by the provisions of
the Truth in Negotiations Act, as amended (10 U.S.C. 2306a and 41 U.S.C. 254(d)).



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

, because most contracts awarded to small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the requirements
for certified cost or pricing data do not apply. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been
performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with
5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

 (FAR case 91-103), in correspondence.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

 Existing approvals of information collection requirements under OMB control numbers 9000-0013 and 9000-0069
correspond to this rule; however, this proposed rule has an insignificant impact on the requirements.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to amend
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to emphasize the Government's policy on providing facilities to contractors,
to clarify the exceptions to this policy and the procedures for authorizing the exceptions, and to remove unnecessary
and duplicative language. The purpose in emphasizing the Government's current policy is to reduce the amount of Government
facilities provided to contractors. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review
pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Background




FAR 45.302 currently states that contractors shall furnish all facilities, with certain exceptions, in performing
Government contracts. Despite this policy statement, recent oversight reviews have been critical of the amount
of Government facilities in the hands of contractors. The Councils reviewed the language at 45.302 and revised it
to clarify current policy and remove unnecessary and duplicative language.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq., 

because the rule is a recasting of existing policy and does not include any substantive changes. An Initial Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected
FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately
and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq., 

(FAR case 91-83), in correspondence.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

1. The authority citation for 48 CFR part 45 continues to read as follows:





Authority:

 40 U.S.C. 486(c); 10 U.S.C. chapter 137; and 42 U.S.C. 2473(c).



2. Section 45.302-1 is revised to read as follows:


45.302-1

Policy.


(a) Contractors shall provide all facilities required for performing Government contracts except that agencies
may provide facilities_
(1) For use in a Government-owned, contractor-operated industrial plant operated on a cost-plus-fee basis;
(2) For support of industrial preparedness programs;
(3) For use in performing a contract on a Government installation;
(4) As components of special tooling or special test equipment acquired or fabricated at Government expense subsequent
to approval by the contracting officer;
(5) When the facilities are only available from Government sources;
(6) As otherwise authorized by law; or
(7) When the agency head or designee issues a Determination and Finding (see subpart 1.7) that the contract cannot
be fulfilled by any other practical means or that it is in the public interest to provide the facilities.
(i) Mere assertion by a contractor that it is unable to provide facilities is not, in itself, sufficient to justify
approval. The determination shall include findings that the contractor sought private financing of the facilities
but it was not available or that private financing is determined not advantageous to the Government. If the contractor's
inability to provide facilities is due to insufficient lead time, the Government may furnish existing facilities
until the contractor's facilities can be installed.
(ii) The original determination and the contractor's written statement asserting inability to obtain nongovernment
facilities, if applicable, shall be included in the contract file.
(iii) Government facilities with a unit cost of less than $10,000 shall not be provided to contractors under the exception
in subparagraph (a)(7) unless the contractor is a nonprofit institution of higher education or other nonprofit organization
whose primary purpose is the conduct of scientific research.
(b) Even when one of the exceptions in subparagraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section applies, agencies shall
not_
(1) Provide new facilities to contractors unless existing Government-owned facilities are either inadequate or
cannot be economically furnished;
(2) Use research and development funds to provide contractors with new construction or improvements of general utility,
unless authorized by law; or
(3) Provide facilities to contractors solely for nongovernment use, unless authorized by law.
(c) The applicability of the exceptions in subparagraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section shall be documented
in the contract file by a Determination and Findings signed by the contracting officer.
(d) Government facilities provided to contractors shall be individually identified in the solicitation and the
contract.

Federal Acquisition Regulation; Government Property




AGENCIES: 

Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to amend
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to alert the contracting officer that facilities contracts should be closed
out when Government production and research property is no longer required for the performance of the instant Government
contract or subcontracts. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant
to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



A. Background



Language has been added at FAR 45.302-1(e) stating that facilities contracts should be closed out when Government
production and research property is no longer required for the performance of the instant Government contract or
subcontracts. This language is important for the control and management of Government property and allows for timely
reutilization of facilities accountable to Government contracts. The language was removed from the Defense Federal
Acquisition Regulation Supplement at 48 CFR 245.302-1(S-70) as more appropriate for inclusion in the
FAR.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.,

 because few, if any, facilities contracts are with small firms. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has,
therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered
in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601,


et seq.

 (FAR case 91-72) in correspondence.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

Federal Acquisition Regulation; Special Tooling Under Fixed Price Contracts



AGENCIES: 

Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (CAAC) and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (DARC) are proposing
revisions to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to amend the Government's policy on managing and controlling
special tooling, for which the Government has the right to title. This regulatory action was not subject to Office
of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


A. Background



The CAAC and the DARC published a final rule on FAR 52.245-17, Special Tooling, in Federal Acquisition Circular
84-53, in the 

Federal Register

 at 54 FR 48978, November 28, 1989. The purpose of this change was to clarify that the special tooling clause is used in
fixed-price contracts when the Government will furnish special tooling to the contractor, or the contractor will
acquire or fabricate special tooling, and the Government intends to maintain rights to the special tooling until
it takes full title or has no further interests in the tooling. The change listed the type of information the contractors
must keep in their property control system and defined the reporting requirements for the special tooling. As a result
of concern expressed by some contractors over the increased recordkeeping requirements required by the clause,
revisions were made to that clause and are contained in this proposed rule. Specifically, we reverted to managing
right-to-title special tooling under an improved special tooling clause, 52.245-17, and to managing existing
Government-owned special tooling under the clause at 52.245-2, Government Property (Fixed Price Contracts),
as we did prior to FAC 84-53. The revised clause at 52.245-17 requires contractors to maintain minimal
records for right-to-title special tooling, and we have removed data requirements such as contracts under which
the special tooling was originally acquired, complete hierarchy of part numbers, tool part number, and some retention
codes. We did add the following data to the lists of special tooling required under the contract: (1) The part number
of the item on which used and the next higher assembly, as well as the retention code; (2) storage method code; (3) weight
and dimensions; and (4) excess code. These additions are necessary to permit the Government to make informed retention
or disposal decisions. We also added a paragraph at FAR 45.306-1 to state that Government-owned special tooling
shall be subject to the Government property clause, and we moved a paragraph from FAR 45.306-5 addressing the
method of acquisition to a more appropriate location at FAR 45.306-4.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq., 

because the rule applies to special tooling on Government contracts which, in most cases, is furnished to large businesses
for large dollar production contracts. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed.
Comments are invited from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart and will be considered in accordance
with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

 (FAR case 91-93), in correspondence.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not impose any additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements which require the approval of the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq

. However, it does reduce the amount of information required from contractors. A revised clearance for FAR Part 45
concerning Special Tooling Under Fixed Price Contracts and reducing the burden hours by a total of 585,600 is being
submitted to OMB for approval. Public comments concerning this request will be invited through a 

Federal Register

 notice.

2. Section 45.306-1 is amended by adding paragraph (c) to read as follows:



45.306-1

Providing existing special tooling.



* * * * *



(c) Contracting Officers shall include a Government property clause (see 45.106) in contracts that provide Government-owned
special tooling to a contractor.



45.306-5

[Redesignated as 45.306-4, revised and reserved]



3. Section 45.306-5 is redesignated as 45.306-4 and revised to read as follows:



45.306-4

Contract clause.



(a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.245-17, Special Tooling, in solicitations and contracts
when_

(1) A negotiated fixed price contract is contemplated; and

(2) The Government decides to acquire the right to take title to the special tooling acquired or fabricated by the contractor
and it is not possible to identify the special tooling; or

(3) The contract is the gaining contract for special tooling transferred from another contract and the Government
decides to retain the right to take title to the special tooling at some future date.

(b) The clause at 52.245-17, Special Tooling, does not apply to items of special tooling under a fixed price contract
for which the Government has decided to acquire the right to take title and the contracting officer has identified
the items, either individually or, for items costing less than $5,000; as a group, in the Schedule.



PART 52_SOLICITATION PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT CLAUSES



52.245-2

[Amended]



4. Section 52.245-2 is amended by revising the clause date to read ``(DATE)''; removing the second sentence
of paragraph (c)(2); and inserting the phrase ``and special tooling other than that subject to the special tooling
clause'' after the words ``special test equipment'' in paragraph (c)(3) of the clause.

5. Section 52.245-17 is revised to read as follows:



52.245-17

Special Tooling.



As prescribed in 45.306-4, insert the following clause:

(4) 

Format of lists. 

Lists furnished by the Contractor shall state the type of list and shall include all information from subparagraph
(h)(1) of this clause, unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer. All lists will be grouped by retention
code as prescribed in subdivision (h)(1)(viii) of this clause and further listed in tool identification number sequence.
(5)

lists reported in accordance with subparagraph (h)(3) of this clause. The Contracting Officer may direct disposition
by any of the methods listed in subparagraphs (i)(1) through (i)(3) of this clause, or a combination of such methods.
The Contractor shall comply with such disposition instructions.
(1) The Contracting Officer may identify specific items of special tooling to be retained or give the Contractor a
list specifying the products, parts, or services including follow-on requirements for which the Government may
require special tooling and request the Contractor to identify all usable items of special tooling on hand that were
designed for or used in the production or performance of such products, parts, or services. Once items of usable special
tooling required by the Government are identified, the Contracting Officer may_
(i) Direct the Contractor, in writing, to transfer specified items of special tooling to follow-on contracts requiring
their use. The notification shall specify whether the Government is taking title to the special tooling or reserving
the right to take title. Those items specified by the Contracting Officer shall be subject to the provisions of the
gaining contract(s); or 
(ii) Request the Contractor to enter into an appropriate storage contract for special tooling specified to be retained
by the Contractor for the Government. Tooling to be stored shall be stored pursuant to a storage contract between the
Government and the Contractor; or
(iii) Direct the Contractor to transfer title to the Government (to the extent not previously transferred) and deliver
to the Government those items of special tooling which are specified for removal from the Contractor's plant.
(2) The Contracting Officer may direct the Contractor to sell, or dispose of as scrap, for the account of the Government,
any special tooling not specified by the Government pursuant to subparagraph (i)(1) of this clause. To the extent
that the Contractor incurs any costs occasioned by compliance with such direction, for which it is not otherwise compensated,
the contract price shall be equitably adjusted in accordance with the procedures of the changes clause of this contract.
The net proceeds of all sales shall either be credited to the cost of contract performance or otherwise paid to the Government
as directed by the Contracting Officer. Sale of the special tooling to the prime contractor or any of its subcontractors
is subject to the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer.
(3) The Contracting Officer may furnish the Contractor with a statement disclaiming further Government interest
or right in specified tooling.
(4) If the Contracting Officer fails to give disposition instructions as required by subparagraphs (i)(1), (2),
or (3) of this clause, the Contractor may, at Government risk and expense_
(i) Retain the special tooling in place; or
(ii) Remove and store the special tooling at the Contractor's plant or in a public warehouse consistent with sound
industrial practice and the item's security classification.
The Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer by certified mail, at least 30 days in advance, before taking any
action under this subparagraph.
Except as provided in this subparagraph, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for failure to give written
notice required by subparagraphs (i) (1), (2) or (3) of this clause.
(5) 

Restoration of the Contractor's premises. 

Unless otherwise provided in the contract, the Government has no obligation to restore or rehabilitate the Contractor's
premises under any circumstances (e.g., abandonment, disposition upon completion of need, or upon contract completion).
(j) 

Access to special tooling. 

The Contractor shall provide access to special tooling subject to this clause at all reasonable times to all individuals
designated by the Contracting Officer.
(k) 

Storage or shipment. 

The Contractor shall promptly arrange for either the shipment or the storage of special tooling specified in accordance
with the final disposition instructions of this clause. Tooling to be shipped shall be properly packaged, packed
and marked in accordance with the directions of the Contracting Officer. All operation sheets or other appropriate
data necessary to show the manufacturing operations or processes for which the items were used or designed shall accompany
special tooling to be shipped or stored or shall otherwise be provided to the Government as directed by the Contracting
Officer. To the extent that the Contractor incurs costs for storage, shipment, packing, crating, or handling under
this paragraph and is not otherwise compensated for, the contract price shall be equitably adjusted in accordance
with the procedures of the changes clause of this contract.
(l) 

Subcontract provisions. 

To perform this contract, the Contractor may place subcontracts (including purchase orders) involving the use of
special tooling. If the full cost of the tooling is charged to those subcontracts, the Contractor agrees to include
in the subcontract appropriate provisions to obtain Government rights and data comparable to the rights of the Government
under this clause (unless the Contractor and Contracting Officer agree, in writing, that such rights are not of interest
to the Government). The Contractor agrees to exercise such rights for the benefit of the Government as directed by
the Contracting Officer.

Federal Acquisition Regulation; Disposal of Hazardous Government Property



AGENCIES: 

Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are considering amending
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart, Reporting, Redistribution, and Disposal of Contractor Inventory,
by adding a paragraph which will reference subpart, Hazardous Material Identification and Material Safety Data,
and agency regulations, in order to provide assistance to the contracting officer in identifying hazardous Government
property; specifying that unless the contract states otherwise, the Government may abandon any nonhazardous contractor
inventory in place, and the Government shall not abandon contractor inventory that is hazardous on the contractor's
premises without the contractor's written consent; and including in designated standard property clauses the requirement
that the contractor promptly identify to the contracting officer any Government property considered hazardous
upon notice that the Government intends to abandon the property. This regulatory action was not subject to Office
of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Background



The changes are a result of industry concern that the language in the standard property clauses does not preclude the
contracting officer from simply abandoning hazardous Government property in place. Sections 45.603, 45.611, and
the standard property clauses at 52.245-2, -4, -5, -7, and -11 are affected by this change.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.,

 because the revision will not have a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. An Initial
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the
affected FAR parts will also be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted
separately and cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.,

 (FAR case 91-57) in correspondence.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping information
collection requirements or collection of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

Federal Acquisition Regulation; Quality Assurance Nonconformances



AGENCIES: 

Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to amend
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) concerning quality assurance to include definitions of the terms ``critical
nonconformance,'' ``major nonconformance,'' and ``minor nonconformance,'' and make other conforming amendments
as a result of recommendations made by the Department of Defense Inspector General. 



This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order 12866
dated September 30, 1993. 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




A. Background 



On September 27, 1990, the Department of Defense Inspector General issued Audit Report 90-113, Nonconforming
Products Procured by the Defense Industrial Supply Center, which included recommendations that the DOD should use
standardized terminology for a nonconformance, and that the DOD definition of a nonconformance should be in agreement
with the FAR. Therefore, it is proposed that FAR Part 46 be amended to include uniform definitions for use by all acquiring
agencies. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

, because the revisions merely revise and standardize definitions of terms. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered
in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601,


et seq. 

(FAR case 92-27), in correspondence. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

Therefore, it is proposed that 48 CFR part 46 be amended as set forth below:

1. The authority citation for 48 CFR part 46 continues to read as follows:



PART 46_QUALITY ASSURANCE





Authority: 

40 U.S.C. 486(c); 10 U.S.C. chapter 137; and 42 U.S.C. 2473(c).




2. Section 46.101 is amended by adding in alphabetical order the definitions ``Critical nonconformance'', ``Major
nonconformance'', and ``Minor nonconformance'' to read as follows:



46.101 

Definitions.



* * * * *





Critical nonconformance 

means a nonconformance that judgement and experience indicate is likely to result in hazardous or unsafe conditions
for individuals using, maintaining, or depending upon the supplies or services; or is likely to prevent performance
of a vital agency mission.



* * * * *





Major nonconformance 

means a nonconformance, other than critical, that is likely to result in failure, or to materially reduce the usability
of the supplies or services for their intended purpose.



Minor nonconformance 

means a nonconformance that is not likely to materially reduce the usability of the supplies or services for their
intended purpose, or is a departure from established standards having little bearing on the effective use or operation
of the supplies or services.



* * * * *



3. Section 46.103 is amended at the end of paragraph (c) by removing ``and''; in paragraph (d) by removing the period
and inserting ``; and''; and by adding paragraph (e) to read as follows:



46.103 

Contracting office responsibilities.



* * * * *



(e) Ensuring that nonconformances are identified and considered when determining the acceptability of supplies
or services which do not meet contract requirements.

4. Section 46.407 is amended by revising the first sentence in paragraph (c)(1) introductory text; revising paragraph
(d); and revising the first sentence in paragraph (f) to read as follows:



46.407 

Nonconforming supplies or services.



* * * * *



(c)(1) In situations not covered by paragraph (b) of this section, the contracting officer ordinarily shall reject
supplies or services when the nonconformance is critical or major. * * *



* * * * *



(d) If the nonconformance is minor, the cognizant contract administration office may make the determination to accept
or reject, except where this authority is withheld by the contracting office of the contracting activity. To assist
in making this determination, the contract administration office may establish a joint contractor/contract administrative
office review group. Acceptance of supplies and services with critical or major nonconformances is outside the scope
of the review group.



* * * * *



(f) Each contract under which supplies or services with critical or major nonconformances are accepted, as authorized
in paragraph (c) of this section, shall be modified to provide for an equitable price reduction or other consideration. * * *

Federal Acquisition Regulation; Commercial Bills of Lading Under Cost-Reimbursement Contracts Audit by the General
Services Administration 




AGENCIES: 

Department of Defense (DoD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (CAAC) and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (DARC) are considering
a proposed rule which amends the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) by adding a new clause entitled, ``Submission
of Commercial Transportation Bills to the General Services Administration for Audit'', and a clause prescription.
The amendment clarifies procedures governing submission of documentation, payment, and audit of Commercial Bills
of Lading (CBL's) under cost-reimbursement contracts. The rule implements the requirements of GSA's Federal Property
Management Regulation's (FPMR's) ``Submission of paid freight bills/invoices, commercial bills of lading, passenger
coupons, and supporting documentation covering transportation services by contracts under a cost-reimbursement
contract.'' This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive
Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



A. Background



A proposed rule to add FAR 47.104-4(c) and a clause at 52.247-67, initiated by the DARC and subsequently
approved by the DARC and the CAAC, was published in the 

Federal Register

 with a request for comments (see 53 FR 45742, November 10, 1988). A correction to the proposed rule was published at
54 FR 18558, May 1, 1989. 

Six responses with substantive comments were received and, as a result, the rule has been revised as follows_

(a) The clause has been renumbered and retitled; 

(b) Passenger coupons have been added to the submission requirements to parallel the FPMR regulation; 

(c) The address shown in the clause has been updated; and 

(d) With GSA's approval, a $50 minimum on the submission of cost reimbursable contractors' freight shipment bills
has been added. This $50 minimum does not apply to bills and invoices for any other transportation services. 

As a result of amending the rule to include a $50 minimum and the requirement to submit passenger coupons, the councils
determined that the proposed rule should be republished with a request for further comment. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq., 

because the vast majority of contracts held by these entities are not subject to Pub. L. 87-653 or civilian agency
defective pricing rules. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments
from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with section 610 of
the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite FAR case 88-56 in correspondence. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act 



This rule is proposed to implement the requirements of GSA's FPMR 101-41.807-4, which was published as
a final rule on August 14, 1991. Therefore, GSA is considered the agency with primary responsibility for this requirement.
A decision was made to issue this FAR requirement under GSA's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance number
3090-0242, Documentation and Payment of Transportation Bills.

reimbursement of transportation as a direct charge to the contract or subcontract.

3. Section 52.247-67 is added to read as follows:



52.247-67



Submission of Commercial Transportation Bills to the General Services Administration for Audit.



As prescribed in 47.104-4(c), insert the following clause:



Submission of Commercial Transportation Bills to the General Services Administration for Audit (Date)



(a)(1) In accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit to the General Services Administration
(GSA) for audit, legible copies of all paid freight bills/invoices, commercial bills of lading (CBL's), passenger
coupons, and other supporting documents for transportation services on which the United States will assume freight
charges that were paid (i) by the Contractor under a cost-reimbursement contract, and (ii) by a first-tier subcontractor
under a cost-reimbursement subcontract thereunder.

(2) Cost-reimbursement Contractors shall only submit for audit those CBL's with freight shipment charges exceeding
$50.00. Bills under $50.00 shall be retained on-site by the Contractor and made available for GSA on-site audits.
This exception only applies to freight shipment bills and is not intended to apply to bills and invoices for any other
transportation services.

(b) The Contractor shall forward copies of paid freight bills/invoices, CBL's, passenger coupons, and supporting
documents as soon as possible following the end of the month, in one package to the General Services Administration,
ATTN: FWATS, 18th & F Streets, NW., Washington, DC 20405. The Contractor shall include the paid freight bills/invoices,
CBL's, passenger coupons, and supporting documents for first-tier subcontractors under a cost-reimbursement
contract. If the inclusion of the paid freight bills/invoices, CBL's, passenger coupons, and supporting documents
for any subcontractor in the shipment is not practicable, the documents may be forwarded to GSA in a separate package.

(c) Any original transportation bills or other documents requested by GSA shall be forwarded promptly by the Contractor
to GSA. The Contractor shall ensure that the name of the contracting agency is stamped or written on the face of the bill
before sending it to GSA.

(d) A statement prepared in duplicate by the Contractor shall accompany each shipment of transportation documents.
GSA will acknowledge receipt of the shipment by signing and returning the copy of the statement. The statement shall
show_

(1) The name and address of the Contractor;

(2) The contract number including any alpha-numeric prefix identifying the contracting office;

(3) The name and address of the contracting office;

(4) The total number of bills submitted with the statement; and

(5) A listing of the respective amounts paid or, in lieu of such listing, an adding machine tape of the amounts paid showing
the Contractor's voucher or check numbers.

Federal Acquisition Regulation; Administration of Cost Accounting Standards 



AGENCIES: 

Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA). 




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing an amendment
to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to require contractors, who issue subcontracts covered by Cost Accounting
Standards, to send subcontract award information not only to the contractor's contract administration office (CAO)
but also to the CAO cognizant of the subcontractor's facility. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of
Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A. Background 



The clause at 52.230-5, Administration of Cost Accounting Standards, currently requires contractors to send
information to the prime contractor's CAO, who forwards it on to the CAO cognizant of the subcontractor. Since the
prime contractor's CAO does not change, modify, or add to the information, but just sends it on to the CAO cognizant
of the subcontractor, it is more efficient for contractors to send it direct. The contractor's CAO should also have
the information and, therefore, the requirement to send the information to the contractor's cognizant CAO has not
been deleted. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.,

 because small businesses are exempt from Cost Accounting Standards requirements. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties.
Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with section
610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

 (FAR case 91-71), in correspondence. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96-511) is deemed to apply because the proposed rule contains information
collection requirements. Accordingly, a request for approval of an amended information collection requirement
(9000-0129) concerning Cost Accounting Standards has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget
under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

 Public comments concerning this request are invited through a 

Federal Register

 notice appearing in this issue.

 Proposed rule and notice of petition finding.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Service proposes to add 30 kinds of birds, found in Africa and on associated islands, to the List of Endangered and
Threatened Wildlife. All have restricted distributions and are threatened by habitat destruction, human hunting,
predation by introduced animals, and various other factors. All were subjects of petitions from the International
Council for Bird Preservation, submitted in 1980 and 1991. This proposal, if made final, would implement the protection
of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, for these birds. The Service also makes the finding that the listing
of 38 additional species of birds, included in the 1991 petition, is warranted but precluded because of other listing
activity.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 



In a petition of November 24, 1980, to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), the International Council for
Bird Preservation (ICBP) requested the addition of 79 kinds of birds to the U.S. List of Endangered and Threatened
Wildlife. Of that number, 58 occurred entirely outside of the United States and its territories. Of those foreign
birds, 6 have now been listed and the rest have been covered by petition findings that their listing is warranted but
precluded by other listing activity. 

Subsequently, in a petition dated April 30, 1991, and received by the Service on May 6, 1991, the ICBP requested the
addition of another 53 species of foreign birds to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. In the 

Federal Register

 of December 16, 1991 (56 FR 65207-65208), the Service announced the finding that this petition had presented
substantial information indicating that the requested action may be warranted. At that same time the Service initiated
a status review of these 53 birds, with the comment period lasting until March 16, 1992. The review yielded 22 comments,
one of them expressing general support for listing and all the rest suggesting that listing of the salmon-crested
cockatoo and/or the blue-throated macaw would interfere unnecessarily with the captive propagation of these species
and with commerce in birds resulting from such propagation (there did not appear to be any question that wild populations
of both species face severe threats and that importation of wild-caught individuals should be generally prohibited).

Section 4(b)(3) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended 
in 1982 (Act), requires that, within 12 months of receipt of a petition 
to list, delist, or reclassify a species, a finding be made as to 
whether the requested action is warranted, not warranted, or warranted 
but precluded by other listing activity. In the case of the 1991 ICBP 
petition, available information supports listing of all 53 species. 
With respect to 15 of these species_those occurring in Africa and 
Madagascar, and on associated islands of the Atlantic and Indian 
Oceans_a recently published book (Collar and Stuart 1985) provides 
detailed status data. This same source provides data supporting the 
listing of 13 of the African birds covered by the 1980 ICBP petition, 
and the Service also possesses sufficient data to support the listing of 
the other 2 African birds so covered. With respect to the other birds 
included in the two petitions, data are available from several sources, 
some of which are unpublished. Compilation of these data is in progress 
and a listing proposal will be completed as soon as allowed by the 
Service's other listing responsibilities. 
Considering the above, the Service makes the finding, hereby 
incorporated and published together with this proposal, that the action 
requested by the ICBP 1980 and 1991 petitions, with respect to the 30 
African birds named below in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the

Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et 
seq.

) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the 
listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding 
species to the Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be 
endangered or threatened due to one or more of the following five 
factors described in Section 4(a)(1): (A) the present or threatened 
destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; (B) 
overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational 
purposes; (C) disease or predation; (D) the inadequacy of existing 
regulatory mechanisms; and (E) other natural or manmade factors 
affecting its continued existence. The application of these factors to 
the 30 African species named below is shown by the appropriate letter in 
parentheses (information from Collar and Andrew 1988, Collar and Stuart 
1985, and Grzimek 1975, unless otherwise noted). Also indicated is the 
date of the petition covering each species, the formal ICBP 
classification, and the proposed U.S. classification. 
Amsterdam albatross (

Diomedia amsterdamensis

)._1991 petition, 
ICBP endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a large sea bird of the 
family Diomedeidae; known to breed only on Amsterdam Island, a French 
possession in the southern Indian Ocean. Destruction of nesting habitat 
by fires and introduced cattle (A) and predation by introduced rats and 
cats (C) have reduced numbers drastically. On the average, only five 
pairs were known to breed each year during the early 1980s. 
Thyolo alethe (

Alethe choloensis

)._1991 petition, ICBP 
endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a small, ground-dwelling bird of 
the family Muscicapidae, related to the Old World robins and thrushes; 
known only from 13 small patches of submontane evergreen forest in 
southern Malawi and from 2 such areas in northern Mozambique. Suitable 
habitat already has been largely destroyed through human clearing and 
encroachment and remaining sites are at risk of destruction (A). About 
1,500 pairs are estimated to survive. 
Uluguru bush-shrike (

Malaconotus alius

)._1980 petition, ICBP 
rare, proposed U.S. threatened; a small predatory bird of the family 
Laniidae, resembling the true shrikes in structure but utilizing more 
densely vegetated habitat and dwelling in the forest canopy; known only 
from the Uluguru Mountains in central Tanzania. Because of its dense 
forest habitat and evident low numbers, this bird has been difficult to 
locate and little is known of its status. However, the lower slopes of 
the mountains on which it lives are being steadily cleared and such 
activity places the species at risk (A). The Service would be 
particularly interested in receiving new information on the severity of 
this problem. 
Madagascar sea eagle (

Haliaeetus vociferoides

)._1980 petition, 
ICBP endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a fish-hunting species of the 
family Accipitridae, related to and somewhat smaller than the American 
bald eagle; confined to the rivers, shorelines, and offshore islands of 
the west coast of central to northern Madagascar. Its numbers have 
dropped sharply since the last century, with only 96 individuals being 
counted during the mid-1980s. Although reasons for the decline are 
unclear, hunting and deliberate nest destruction by people (B) are 
thought to be partly responsible. 
Madagascar serpent eagle (

Eutriorchis astur

)._1980 petition, ICBP 
endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a raptor of the family 
Accipitridae, more closely related to the harrier hawks than to most 
other eagles; until recently, known only from 11 specimens collected 
over 50 years ago in the eastern forests of Madagascar. In 1988 an 
individual was observed and in 1990 a dead specimen was recovered, both 
in northeastern Madagascar (Raxworthy and Colston 1992). The species 
thus is known to survive, but it is apparently dependent on large tracts 
of undisturbed primary rainforest, and such habitat is rapidly being 
destroyed or adversely modified by human activity (A). 
Mauritius fody (

Foudia rubra

)._1980 petition, ICBP endangered, 
proposed U.S. endangered; a small weaver of the family Ploceidae, 
feeding on insects, nectar and small fruits; formerly widespread in the 
upland forests of the island of Mauritius, a part of the nation of the 
same name in the Indian Ocean. It now is restricted to the southwestern 
part of Mauritius, where perhaps only 150 breeding pairs survive. More 
than half of the population had been wiped out in 1973-1974 during a 
large-scale forest clearing project (A). The remaining birds are 
subject to intensive nest predation from rats, macaques, and other 
introduced animals (C).

Rodrigues fody (

Foudia flavicans

)._1980 petition, ICBP 
endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; another small insectivorous weaver 
of the family Ploceidae; occurs only on the island of Rodrigues, a part 
of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. Formerly abundant in a variety of 
habitats on the island, by 1983 only about 100 individuals survived in 
remnant patches of evergreen forest. The main problem appears to be 
competition with the related Madagascar fody (

Foudia madagascariensis

), 
which was introduced by people and which evidently has adapted better to 
all habitats except mature forest (E). Since the latter habitat has 
been largely destroyed by human activity, the range of 

F. flavicans

 has 
been greatly reduced (A). In addition, the species is threatened by 
predation from introduced rats (C) and by the effects of cyclones (E). 

Djibouti francolin (

Francolinus ochropectus

)._1991 petition, 
ICBP endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a ground-dwelling, 
partridgelike bird of the family Phasianidae; restricted to highland 
forest in the country of Djibouti in northeastern Africa. Its 
restricted habitat is rapidly being destroyed by overgrazing, clearing, 
and other human activity (A). Only about 1,500 birds were thought to 
survive in 1985. 

Freira (

Pterodroma madeira

)._1991 petition, ICBP endangered, 
proposed U.S. endangered; a small sea bird of the family Procellariidae 
(petrels and shearwaters); known to breed only in the mountains of 
Madeira, an island possession of Portugal in the Atlantic Ocean. It has 
declined because of human bird and egg collectors (B), predation by 
introduced rats (C), and possibly natural climatic changes (E). Only 20 
breeding pairs may survive. 

Alaotra grebe (

Tachybaptus rufolavatus

)._1991 petition, ICBP 
endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a small diving bird of the family 
Podicipedidae; known primarily from Lake Alaotra and adjacent marshes in 
northeastern Madagascar. Human alteration of the limited habitat of the 
Alaotra grebe (A), especially the introduction of exotic fish, resulted 
in a great increase there of the much more widespread little grebe 
(

Tachybaptus ruficollis

) and to extensive hybridization between the two 
species (E). It appears that the resulting genetic swamping of the 
Alaotra grebe is irreversible. 

White-breasted guineafowl (

Agelastes meleagrides

)._1991 petition, 
ICBP endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a medium-sized 
ground-dwelling bird of the family Numididae, related to turkeys and 
peacocks; originally occurred throughout the rainforest zone from Sierra 
Leone to Ghana. This species evidently is dependent on primary forest 
and is unable to survive in the dense undergrowth of secondary forest. 
It has disappeared from most of its range, mainly because of timber 
exploitation (A). It also has been severely affected by human hunting 
pressure (B). It may survive only in Ivory Coast and Liberia, and in 
only small numbers even there.

Raso lark (

Alauda razae

)._1991 petition, ICBP endangered, 
proposed U.S. endangered; a songbird of the family Alauidae, closely 
related to the common Old World skylark; known only from Raso, one of 
the islands in the nation of Cape Verde off the west coast of Africa. 
This species was once common and widespread on Raso, but declined 
drastically because of a severe drought in the 1960s (E). The 
population may have fallen to only about 20 individuals in 1981. 
Numbers subsequently increased to at least 150, but the species is 
potentially threatened by climatic fluctuations (E), human settlement 
(A), and predation by introduced rats (C). 

Ibadan malimbe (

Malimbus ibadanensis

)._1991 petition, ICBP 
endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; another small weaver of the family 
Ploceidae, about the size of a house sparrow and with red markings; 
known only from southwestern Nigeria. The restricted range of this 
species is subject to intensive forest clearing (A). Although 
considered common when it was first discovered in 1951, it subsequently 
became very rare and prospects for survival are not favorable. The 
Ibadan malimbe does seem to have a limited tolerance to habitat 
modification, and the Service would be interested in obtaining more 
information about its potential to sustain itself. 

Algerian nuthatch (

Sitta ledanti

)._1980 petition, ICBP rare, 
proposed U.S. endangered; a member of the family Sittidae, about the 
size of a house sparrow but with a compact build, a long beak, and 
grayish coloration; known only from Mount Babor in northern Algeria. 
Discovered in 1975, this small arboreal species is dependent on forest 
habitat, including standing dead wood for nesting. Such habitat is 
being reduced by lumbering, fire, grazing of domestic livestock, and 
removal of dead wood for forestry management (A). About 80 pairs were 
estimated to survive in 1982. 

Canarian black oystercatcher (

Haematopus meadewaldoi

)._1980 
petition, ICBP extinct, proposed U.S. endangered; a shore bird of the 
family Haematopodidae, somewhat like a rail but with much stouter bill 
and legs, generally black plumage; known with certainty only from the 
eastern Canary Islands, a Spanish possession off northwestern Africa. 
This species seems always to have been uncommon and there have been no 
definite records since about 1913. It may have disappeared because of 
human disruption of its limited habitat and harvesting of the mollusks 
on which it fed (A), and because of predation by introduced cats and 
rats (C). Four apparently genuine reports of black oystercatchers_two 
on Tenerife in the Canaries and two on the coast of Senegal in West 
Africa_were made from 1968 to 1981, and give hope that the species 
still exists. The species is being included in this proposal based on 
the recent reports and on the reasonable prospect of rediscovery. Rare 
and elusive species are routinely found alive after years, decades, or 
even centuries of presumed extinction. Indeed, rediscovery of two of 
the other birds covered by this proposal_the Madagascar serpent eagle 
and the Madagascar pochard_was announced while the proposal was being 
drafted. The October 1993 issue of the journal 

Oryx

 contains 
announcements that three species_a bird, a mammal, and a reptile_none 
of which had been seen for at least 30 years, had all been found alive. 
The U.S. List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife already includes 
many such rediscovered species. Examples are the parma wallaby 
(

Macropus parma

), which was thought extinct for 33 years; the dibbler 
(

Antechinus apicalis

), which was thought extinct for 83 years; and the 
mountain pygmy possum (

Burramys parvus

), which was thought to have 
disappeared many thousands of years ago in the Ice Age. The Service 
makes a special request for new information that might help assess the 
status of the Canarian black oystercatcher and for informed opinions 
from authorities as to its appropriate treatment. Such comments, or the 
lack thereof, will be considered in the development of any final rule 
and could lead to a decision not to proceed with the listing of this 
species. 

Seychelles lesser vasa parrot (

Coracopsis nigra barklyi

)._1980 
petition, ICBP endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a member of the 
family Psittacidae, generally dark brown in color and about 10 inches 
(25 centimeters) long; known only from Praslin, one of the islands in 
Seychelles, a nation off the east coast of Africa. Originally common on 
the island, this species declined rapidly in the mid-20th century as its 
palm forest habitat was destroyed by human cutting and burning (A). The 
one remaining population was estimated to number about 30 to 50 
individuals in 1965, though it subsequently may have increased to about 
100 after efforts were made to protect it and its remaining habitat 
(King 1981, Silva 1989).

Mascarene black petrel (

Pterodroma aterrima

)._1980 petition, ICBP endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a small sea bird of the family Procellariidae; originally
found on the islands of Reunion and Rodrigues, which are parts of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It seems to have disappeared
from Rodrigues by the 18th century and to have become extremely rare on Reunion. Reasons for the decline are not precisely
known, but may involve human hunting (B), predation by introduced rats and cats (C), and absorption of pesticides
harmful to reproduction (E).

Pink pigeon (

Nesoenas mayeri

)._1980 petition, ICBP endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a member of the family Columbidae, about the size of
the domestic pigeon (

Columba domestica

), but with shorter and more rounded wings and generally pink in color (Goodwin 1977); known only from southwestern
Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. This species has declined because of the clearing of its native forest habitat by people
(A), human hunting for use as food (B), and predation by introduced rats and macaques (C). Remnant populations also
became more vulnerable to the effects of cyclones and natural food shortages (E). The pink pigeon already was rare
by the 1830s and currently the single known wild group contains only about 20 birds. Larger numbers exist in captivity.

White-tailed laurel pigeon (

Columba junoniae

)._1980 petition, ICBP rare, proposed U.S. threatened; a large member of the family Columbidae, closely related
to the common Old World wood pigeon (

Columba palumbus

); known only from the Canary Islands, a Spanish possession off northwestern Africa. Early reports suggest that this
species may once have occurred throughout the Canaries, though it is known with certainty only from the western islands
of Tenerife, La Palma, and Gomera. It now is relatively common only on parts of La Palma. Elsewhere it has disappeared
or declined in conjunction with human destruction of the endemic Canarian laurel forests (A). Some of the remnant
populations appear to be stable, following legal measures to protect them and their forest habitat.

Madagascar pochard (

Aythya innotata

)._1991 petition, ICBP endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a diving duck of the family Anatidae; apparently confined
to freshwater lakes and pools in the northern central plateau of Madagascar. Although still common around 1930, this
species subsequently declined drastically because of large-scale hunting by people (B). It may also have been adversely
affected by the introduction of exotic fish and accidental capture by people netting the fish (E). It probably is on
the brink of extinction; there had been no definite records between 1970 and August 1991, when a specimen was captured
alive and placed in the Botanical Garden at Antananarivo (

Oryx,

 April 1992, 26:73).

Dappled mountain robin (

Modulatrix orostruthus

)._1980 petition, ICBP rare, proposed U.S. threatened; a thrush of the family Muscicapidae; occurs in three isolated
patches of montane forest, one in northern Mozambique and two in eastern Tanzania. Much of the rainforest habitat
on which the species depends has been cleared for agricultural purposes (A). The population in Mozambique has not
been recorded since 1932. The other two populations may number in the hundreds or low thousands.

Marungu sunbird (

Nectarinia prigoginei

)._1991 petition, ICBP endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a nectar-feeding bird of the family Nectarinidae,
characterized by small size and a long bill, somewhat comparable to the hummingbirds superficially; known only from
the Marungu Highlands of southeastern Zaire. The remnant riparian forest on which this species probably depends
covers only a small part of the Marungu Highlands and is under severe pressure fr
