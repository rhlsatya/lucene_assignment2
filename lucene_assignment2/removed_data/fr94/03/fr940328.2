<DOCTITLE>Suitability Study for a Portion of the North Fork of the Clearwater River, Kelly Creek, and Cayuse Creek Being Considered
for National Wild & Scenic River Status; Clearwater National Forest; Clearwater & Idaho Counties, ID</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare a legislative environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service, USDA, will prepare a draft and final legislative Impact Statement (LEIS) associated with a study
of the suitability of a portion of the North Fork of the Clearwater River, Kelly Creek, and Cayuse Creek in the Clearwater
National Forest in Idaho for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic River System. The three streams were found eligible
for consideration as Wild and Scenic Rivers in the 1987 Clearwater National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan
(Forest Plan). All three streams are found within the boundaries of the Clearwater National Forest. The agency invites
written comments and suggestions on the suitability of these rivers. In addition, the agency gives notice of the environmental
analysis and decision-making process associated with the study so that interested and affected people are aware
of how they may participate and contribute to the decision.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Clearwater National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan was approved in 1987. Segments of the North Fork
of the Clearwater River, Kelly Creek, and Cayuse Creek were identified as eligible for inclusion in the National Wild
& Scenic Rivers System as part of the planning process, but were not studied for their suitability at that time.
The decision to be made, based upon the environmental impact statement, is whether or not to recommend any or all of
the above mentioned rivers for designation and inclusion in the National Wild & Scenic Rivers System. The Forest
Plan will be amended accordingly.




The area of consideration for each of the rivers is a corridor a minimum of 1/4 mile in width from each stream bank for
the length of the eligible river segments.

The eligible segment of the North Fork of the Clearwater River is a 60-mile stretch flowing from the Road No. 250 bridge
crossing (Section 6, Township 40 North, Range 11 East, Boise Meridian) downstream to the beginning of slack water
in Dworshak Reservoir (Section 34, Township 41 North, Range 6 East, Boise Meridian).

The eligible section of Kelly Creek is approximately 39 miles long including its main stem and its North, Middle, and
South Forks that originate near the Idaho/Montana state border and flow to the stream's confluence with the North
Fork of the Clearwater River.



The eligible portion of Cayuse Creek includes the entire 31-mile stream, from its source at Lost Lake (Section 24,
Township 38 North, Range 13 East, Boise Meridian) to its confluence with Kelly Creek (Section 24, Township 39 North,
Range 11 East, Boise Meridian).

Scoping for the study began in April of 1993 with a series of 6 regional public meetings to explain the study process
and to identify issues relating to the study. A study newsletter was also circulated at that time. Another series of
6 public meetings was held in December of 1993 to validate: study issues, preliminary outstandingly remarkable values
(ORV's), and preliminary alternatives. A second issue of the study newsletter was mailed to interested publics prior
to this set of meetings.

The following preliminary issues are being considered in the environmental analysis: (1) Effects on timber harvest
and mineral development in the area of the study rivers; (2) effects on the local and regional economy; (3) effects
on abilities of county governments and local constituents to affect resource management recommendations; (4) effects
on transportation system and development in the area of the study rivers; (5) effects on recreation use and users in
the study stream areas; (6) effects on wildlife and fish in the study river areas; (7) effects on water quality and the
free flowing nature of the study streams; (8) protection of the identified outstandingly remarkable values of the
study streams; (9) effects on the ability of the private landowners along the North Fork of the Clearwater River to
retain their properties and use their lands as they choose; and (10) effects on the roadless character of the headwaters
of Kelly Creek and a large portion of Cayuse Creek.

A range of alternatives is being considered. They will include as a minimum, one alternative that does not recommend
designation (no action), and one that recommends designation for all the eligible river segments. Additional alternatives
will be developed from public comments received during the scoping process. The environmental impact statement
will disclose the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of implementing each of the alternatives.

The Forest Service is seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State and local agencies, and
other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposal. This input will be utilized
in preparation of the draft environmental impact statement.

The draft environmental impact statement is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
by August 1994. At that time EPA will publish a notice of availability on the draft environmental impact statement
in the 

Federal Register.

 It is very important that those interested in the management of these rivers participate at that time. To be most helpful,
comments on the draft environmental impact statement should be as site-specific as possible.

The Forest Service believes it is important to give reviewers notice at this early stage of several court rulings related
to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact statements
must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts
an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions (

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v. 

NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978)

). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact stage, but are not raised
until after completion of the final statement, may be waived or dismissed by the courts (

City of Angoon 

v. 

Hodel, 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir., 1986) and Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. 

v. 

Harris, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980).

 Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by
the close of the scoping comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest
Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in identifying issues and alternatives.

To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
should be as specific as possible. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations
for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing
these points.

After the comment period ends on the draft EIS, the comments will be analyzed and considered by the Forest Service in
preparing the final study report and environmental impact statement. The final report is scheduled to be completed
by December 1994. The comments, responses, and environmental consequences discussed in the final environmental
impact statement and applicable laws, regulations, and policies will be considered in preparing the agency's recommendations
for Wild and Scenic River designation.

The responsible official for making recommendations to the Congress is Mike Espy, Secretary of Agriculture, Administration
Building, 12th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20250.

The decision on inclusion of a river in the National Wild & Scenic Rivers System rests with the United States Congress.

<DOCTITLE>Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area Comprehensive Management Plan Amendment 

#

1</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare supplemental environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service will prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement for a proposal to revise management
direction for the Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area, Mono Lake Ranger District, Inyo National Forest, Mono County,
California.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area Comprehensive Management Plan (CMP) was completed in March 1990. The CMP
which is a component of the 1988 Inyo Land and Resource Management Plan, provides direction and recommendations for
the management of Mono Lake and the surrounding Scenic Area. The CMP places an overall emphasis on protecting geologic,
ecological, and cultural resources, and recommends a lake level that ranges from 6,377 to 6,390 feet in elevation.
Furthermore, the CMP recognizes the relationship between lake levels and the impacts on the natural resources of
this unique ecosystem. For instance, lower lake levels expose dust-producing relicted lands, while the CMP provides
specific direction to work closely with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Great Basin Unified Air
Pollution Control District to bring the Mono Basin airshed into compliance with the requirements of the Clean Air
Act.




Since approval of the CMP, new scientific information relevant to the impacts of various lake levels on resource values,
including compliance with air quality requirements, has come to the attention of the Forest Service.The EPA has recently
classified the Mono Basin as a non-attainment area in respect to PM-10 emissions, with violations occurring primarily
as a result of wind-blown dust from the relicted lands. Review of this new information has revealed the need to amend
the CMP so that it can fully and adequately guide the protection and management of the Mono Basin ecosystem. An amendment
is also necessary to ensure compliance with the legal mandates of the Clean Air Act.

The Forest Service will consider a reasonable range of alternatives. One alternative will be no change in management
direction. Other alternatives will examine various lake level ranges and prose direction or make recommendations
that will address Mono Basin resource concerns, including air quality requirements. These other alternatives will
be based on the new information, in addition to the range of alternatives previously considered in the environmental
impact statement that supports the CMP.

The responsible official is Dennis W. Martin, Forest Supervisor, Inyo National Forest, 873 North Main Street, Bishop,
CA 93514-2494.

Public participation will be especially important at several points during this analysis. The first point is during
the scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7). The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments, and assistance from
Federal, State, and local agencies and other individuals or organizations interested in or affected by the proposed
action. Information obtained during scoping will be used to prepare the draft supplemental environmental impact
statement (DSEIS). The most useful information in preparing a DSEIS will be that pertaining to significant issues,
reasonable alternatives, potential environmental effects, and identification of other agencies whose cooperation
may be needed.

Workshops and open houses, if held, will be announced locally. Federal, State, and local agencies, user groups, and
other organizations known to be interested in this action are being invited to participate in the scoping process.

The DSEIS will be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and is expected to be available for public review
by January 1996. At that time the EPA will publish a notice of availability of the DSEIS in the 

Federal Register.

The comment period on the DSEIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA publishes the notice of availability in Federal
Register

.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft statements must
structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency
to the reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v. 

NRDC, 

435 U.S. 519, 533 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement
stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed
by the courts. 

City of Angoon 

v. 

Hodel, 

803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. 

v. 

Harris, 

490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
statement.

To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the DSEIS should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters of
the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the DSEIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated
and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for
implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these
points.

After the comment period ends on the DSEIS, written comments will be analyzed and considered by the Forest Service
in preparing the final supplemental environmental impact statement (FSEIS). The FSEIS is scheduled to be completed
by September 1996. The Forest Service is required to respond in the FSEIS to the comments received (40 CFR 1503.4).
The Forest Supervisor will consider the comments, responses, and environmental consequences discussed in the FSEIS,
and applicable laws, regulations, and policies in making his decision regarding amendment of the CMP. The responsible
official will document the decision and rationale in the Record of Decision. That decision will be subject to appeal
under 36 CFR 217.

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Relocation of the San Francisco Weather Service Forecast Office; Availability</DOCTITLE>



<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Weather Service (NWS) is publishing its proposed certification for the proposed relocation of the San
Francisco Weather Service Forecast Office, Redwood City, to Monterey, California, as required by Public Law 102-567.
In accordance with this law, the public will have 60-days in which to comment on this proposed certification. The proposed
certification is summarized in this notice but the entire package is too voluminous to publish in its entirety in the
FR and much of the supporting documentation is, therefore, available by contacting the addressees below.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The National Weather Service (NWS) anticipates relocating its forecast office for Northern California from Redwood
City to Monterey. This is the first modernization action which requires a certification of no degradation of service
under the Weather Service Modernization Act (the Act). In accordance with section 706 of Public Law 102-567,
the Secretary of Commerce must certify that this relocation will not result in any degradation of service and must
publish the proposed relocation certification in the FR. The proposed certification documentation includes the
following: 


(1) A draft memorandum by the meteorologist in charge recommending the certification, the final of which will be endorsed
by the Regional Director and the Director of the National Weather Service if appropriate, after consideration of
public comments and completion of consultation with the Modernization Transition Committee; 

(2) A description of local weather characteristics and weather-related concerns which affect the weather services
provided within the service area;

(3) A detailed comparison of the services provided within the service area and the services to be provided after such
action;

(4) A description of any recent or expected modernization of National Weather Service operation which will enhance
services in the service area;

(5) An identification of any area within any State which would not receive coverage (at an elevation of 10,000 feet)
by the next generation weather radar network;

(6) Evidence, based upon operational demonstration of modernized NWS operations, which was considered in reaching
the conclusion that no degradation in service will result from such action including the relocation checklist and
evidence from similar moves; and 

(7) A letter appointing the liaison officer.

The proposed certification will not include any report of the Modernization Transition Committee (the Committee)
which could be submitted in accordance with sections 706(b)(6) and 707(c) of the Public Law. At its March 16-17
meeting the Committee concluded that the information presented by that date did not reveal any potential degradation
of service and decided not to issue a report.

As stated earlier, some of the documentation included in the certification is too voluminous to publish, e.g. the
description of weather characteristics and the detailed comparison of services, and a number of the attachments
to the MICs evaluations. These items can be obtained through either of the contacts listed above.

Attached to this notice is (1) the draft memorandum from Norman C. Hoffman, Meteorologist in Charge, WSFO San Francisco
to Dr. Thomas D. Potter, Director, Western Region, summarizing the basis for his recommendation for relocation certification;
(2) the Relocation Checklist; (3) memorandum from (a) Dean P. Gulezian, Meteorologist in Charge, Detroit, (b) James
D. Belville, Meteorologist in Charge, WSFO Washington, DC (c) G.C. Henricksen, Jr., Meteorologist in Charge, WSFO
Philadelphia, all evaluating recent office moves for which they were responsible and providing evidence for the
present relocation.

Once all public comments have been received and considered, the NWS will complete consultation with the Committee
and determine whether to proceed with the final certification. If a decision to certify is made, the Secretary of Commerce
must publish the final certification in the 

Federal Register

 and transmit the certification to the appropriate Congressional committees prior to relocating the office.

Proposed MIC Recommendation. Included at this time for Completeness. Also, acronyms used in this package are provided
as part of this letter for reference. 



Memorandum For: W/WR_Thomas D. Potter
From: Norman C. Hoffmann, MIC, WSFO San Francisco
Subject: Recommendation for Relocation Certification 



After reviewing the documentation herein, I have determined that, in my professional judgment, relocating the Weather
Service Forecast Office (WSFO) for the northern and central California service area from Redwood City to Monterey
will not result in any degradation in weather services to this service area. Accordingly, I am recommending that you
approve this section in accordance with section 706 of Public Law 102-567. If you concur, please endorse this
recommendation and forward the package for transmittal to Congress. 
My recommendation is based on my review of the pertinent evidence and application of the modernization criteria for
relocation of a field office. In summary: 
1. A description of local weather characteristics and weather-related concerns which affect the weather services
provided within the northern and central California service area is included as attachment A. As discussed below,
I find that providing the services that address these characteristics and concerns from Monterey rather than from
Redwood City will not degrade these services.
2. A detailed list of the services currently provided within the northern and central California service area from
the Redwood City location and a list of services to be provided from the Monterey location after relocation is included
as attachment B. Comparison of these services shows that all services currently provided will continue to be provided
after the proposed relocation. As discussed below, I find that there will be no degradation in the quality of these
services as a result of the relocation. 
3. A description of the recent or expected modernization of National Weather Service operations which will enhance
services in the service area is included as attachment C. The new technology listed (ASOS, WSR-88D, and AWIPS)
has or will be installed and will enhance services in the northern and central California service area. 
4. A map showing planned NEXRAD coverage at an elevation of 10,000 feet for California is included as attachment D.
It identifies a limited area within the State (in the Sierra Nevadas) which will not receive coverage. It should be
noted that this area does not have any NWS radar coverage at this time. NWS operational radar coverage for the State
and for the specific service area will be increased dramatically. 
5. A relocation checklist setting forth all necessary steps to accomplish the proposed relocation without a disruption
of services is included as attachment E. In finalizing this checklist, I carefully considered the evidence from already
completed office moves and the comments on my draft checklist from the MICs responsible for these completed moves
[and from users and/or the public during the comment period.] Thus, the relevant aspects of ``battle plan'' and other
planning materials from the successful move from Ann Arbor to White Lake, Michigan are fully incorporated, for example,
extra care in ensuring an appropriate moving contractor. (The move from Philadelphia to Mount Holly, New Jersey also
suggests adding this particular check point.) I note that several recommendations made by the other MIC's, such as
a new phone system and a new demark box are already planned for the Monterey facility. [Final letter may point out any
important changes resulting from user/public comment]
This checklist includes all of the items required by the modernization relocation criteria. In particular, to satisfy
Item 1 requiring ``notification and technical coordination with users,'' I include as attachments F & G, a list
of the users in the SWFO San Francisco Bay Area service area that will be notified of the relocation and a draft of the
notification letter I plan to send to these users approximately 60 days prior to the relocation. 
6. In reaching my conclusion that no degradation in service will result from this relocation, I considered evidence,
based upon operational demonstration of modernized National Weather Service operations, of two types: 
First is the evidence based on existing operations in Redwood City which will remain the same once the office is relocated
in Monterey. Staff will continue to receive the same data and information on the same computer terminals and comparable
display monitors and will disseminate their products over the same telecommunications network to the media and other
users as they did before. In other words, in this case, ``modernized'' operations after the relocation will be the
same as existing operations. I am certain there is no reason to anticipate any effect on the quality of services throughout
the affected service area simply because they will be provided from a new location.

This expectation is confirmed by the second type of evidence I considered, that from completed office moves of WSFO
Washington (from Camp Springs, MD to Sterling, VA); WSFO Philadelphia (from Philadelphia, PA to Mount Holly, NJ);
and WSFO Ann Arbor (from Ann Arbor, MI to White Lake, MI), included as attachment H. The primary mechanism for determining
whether any degradation of service resulted from these moves is evidence of user dissatisfaction in products and
services after the move. I believe that, in each case, there has been adequate opportunity for such dissatisfaction
to surface if it existed and each MIC reports a successful move with no indication of such dissatisfaction. 

I recognize that no single move constitutes a perfect model for the present relocation but, after reviewing these
moves as a body, I find adequate evidence that no degradation of service will result. For example, the Ann Arbor WSFO
did not contain a service unit as does San Francisco, but the other two offices do contain such units and were moved without
degrading the services provided by such units. 

Therefore, based of my review of this evidence and in my professional judgment, I find that the relocation will not
result in a degradation in services to the northern and central California service area. 

7. A memorandum assigning the liaison officer for the San Francisco Bay Area service area is included as attachment
I. 

I note that WSFO San Francisco is not located on an airport and is not the only field office in California, so that those
special criteria involving an air safety appraisal and an evaluation to in-state users required under PL 102-567
are not applicable to this proposed relocation certification. 

 


[If, after the MIC considers comments raised during the comment period, he continues to recommend certification,
the final memorandum will address appropriate comments either here or in an attachment.] 

 


I, Thomas D. Potter, Director, Western Region, endorse this proposed relocation certification.

Memorandum For: Louis J. Boezi Wx2
From: Dean P. Gulezian MIC/AM WSFO DTX
Subject: Evaluation of Office Move
Reference: Your Memo, Same Subject 1/21/94



Listed below are the responses to each of the questions raised in your 1/21/94 memo.
Before answering the specific questions, I'll provide a little background on how we approached the move.
Our office move from Ann Arbor to White Lake Michigan was a TQM effort from the start. A move task team was developed which
included everyone in the office who volunteered or was assigned responsibility for certain aspects of the move. The
union had a representative on the task team as well, and he worked ``hand in hand'' with us every step of the way. We especially
worked closely with the union on such matters as floor plans, short distance transfer benefits, paperwork necessary
to process transfers, etc. A letter was presented to the union 60 days in advance of the move specifying the pertinent
information regarding the move (attachment 1).
Most move related tasks were delegated to various staff members who were given full authority and responsibility
to execute these tasks. My responsibility was to oversee everything, and carry out the few tasks that I took on myself.
Many ``move task force'' meetings were held during the time the move was being planned, with the meetings becoming
more frequent (daily at the end) as the move drew closer.
A ``battle plan'' (attachment 2 shows the final summary) for executing the move was developed at the first meeting.
Subsequent meetings evaluated the progress of this plan. Input for the battle plan came from a number of sources. They
were: the relocation kickoff meeting conducted by CRH SOD (agenda in attachment 3), the draft ROML issued by CRH on
Facilities Relocation Management (attachment 4), the Facilities Prep List prepared by the SFT (attachment 5), and
the Office Relocation Plan prepared by CRH SOD with input from members of the move task force (attachment 6). Furthermore,
a Move Activities Plan was written, using CRH guidance. Attachment 7 is the final copy of the plan. Rather than me commenting
on your draft relocation checklist, I offer our ``battle plan'' and move activities plan as well as the additional
documents mentioned in this paragraph as alternatives to the plan you drafted.

As a result of many people being an important part of the move, and excellent support from CRH and WSH, and a top-notch
moving company, our move went smoothly. Our staff was very supportive of the move, despite the fact that it meant most
people would have to relocate. For all employees involved in a short-distance transfer, the PCS's were processed
quickly and without complication. Because of the sparse population near the new office, the staff was given a 25 mile
radius from the new office to move into and still claim a short-distance transfer.

When reviewing our comments, it should be noted that our office at Ann Arbor was rather unique. It did not have a public
service unit, or any interaction with the public. It also did not have a CWA or NWR program. We still don't have these
programs, but will have them shortly when we pick up the service programs from WSOs Detroit and Flint.



1. The Move From Where to Where_Distance



The move occurred between Ann Arbor, MI and White Lake MI, which is a distance of 48 miles. AFOS and other communications
were disconnected at 8 AM and running again by 8 PM. We were fully operational by 10 PM that day. The move was managed by
following the above-mentioned documents. It went smoothly with no problems encountered.



2. User Notification of the Move



The attached user notification list was used to notify all users of our move (attachment 8). It was developed based
on a generic list provided by CRH (attachment 9). The move letter is also attached (attachment 10) as is the press release
that was sent on AFOS (attachment 11). Notification went smoothly with no problems encountered.



3. Service Backup



The attached service back-up plan (attachment 12) and letter explaining the Flexzone Program (attachment 13) enabled
service back-up to be perfectly executed with no problems encountered.



4. Communications, Installation, and Checkout



An inventory of all circuits at the old office was taken (attachment 14). This included all voice and data circuits.
Then a list was made of all of the necessary circuits that would be needed at the new office, including voice and data.
A Request for Change was written by WSH which also addressed necessary actions (attachment 15). Regional Headquarters
then ordered new circuits that were needed and ordered ``add term circuits'' for circuits that could be used at both
locations i.e. AFOS RDC Circuits. The add term circuits avoided the conflict of having to connect both ends when the
move took place. These circuits were ordered approximately eight months in advance with an installation date at least
a month in advance of the move. A minor problem did develop with the local telephone company during the evening of the
move. It was quickly taken care of by our ESA. Our Regional Communication Manager was also a tremendous help on moving
day. No matter how well the communications portion of a move is planned, the actions of the local telephone company
are out of the NWS's hands. Other than that minor problem, no other problems were encountered.



5. The Move of Furniture and Equipment



The move of furniture was handled by one of our forecasters. He was in charge of everything from marking what furniture
was to be shipped to the new office, to what furniture was to be made excess property. He also worked with our secretary
on preparing the excess property list (attachment 16), worked with CASC and met with the movers to arrange details
of the move, and drew color coded maps for both locations as to where each piece of furniture was to be taken from and placed.
On move day he oversaw the move of furniture out of Ann Arbor, while our Service Hydrologist oversaw the move of furniture
into the new White Lake office. The move of furniture went smoothly with no problems encountered.

CRH SOD and CASC procurement handled contracting the moving company for both furniture and equipment. They did not
look for the lowest bidder, but the company that showed they could move the equipment properly, without tipping or
laying the equipment over. The mover also had to agree to allow the NWS to instruct them what to move and when. This allowed
the NWS to get the equipment loaded first and moved safely to the new office immediately. Not only were no problems encountered
in moving equipment, but the ability to dictate what equipment was to be moved first enabled us to restore full operations
as quickly as we did.



6. System Installation and Checkout



The following were the major systems relocated at DTX: AFOS, SWIS, and Remote RADAR displays. An NWS telephone system
was also installed at the new office. Approximately 8 months in advance of the move, an inventory was conducted of all
of the cables needed by the major systems being moved. The larger cables, such as the AFOS GDM Bus cables were ordered
by CRH. The smaller cables were made by the Electronics staff at the WSFO using supplies purchased locally. These were
cables such as the ABT cables.

As soon as the building was accepted, the SFT installed the necessary peculiar electrical outlets for the systems
that would be installed. At the same time the electronics staff installed all of the phone system cabling and all of
the system cables. The phone system cables were terminated where necessary and the system cables were checked to ensure
the correct connectors were in the correct locations. The phone system was connected and all of the phone locations
were programmed and checked out for proper operation. CRH supplied the phone system and the phone sets. All of the interconnecting
cabling and termination supplies were purchased locally by the electronics staff.

The layout of the equipment in the new office was planned well in advance of the move and diagrammed, to scale, by CRH
SOD. This diagram allowed local staff to determine where all furniture and equipment would be located. It also allowed
the electronics staff to determine where all of the system cables and telephone cables needed to be terminated. As
a result, no problems were encountered with systems installation and checkout.



7. Validation of System Operability and Service Delivery



Diagnostics were run on AFOS followed by a MODIFY. Then all equipment was turned on and the electronics staff and forecasters
made sure all incoming data was received. We were fully operational and receiving all incoming data by 10 PM the evening
of the move and there were no problems encountered validating the system operability or products delivered by the
WSFO.



User Reaction



User reaction has been extremely positive. After moving to White Lake, we immediately held 2 open houses. One was for
our users (see attachment 17), and one for our new neighbors (see attachment 18). Both open houses went a long way toward
building a positive relationship with our users. A typical response from our users is one that a county emergency manager
made to a letter from our WPM (attachment 19). One neighbor did raise some concerns which were addressed in a memo which
is attached to this response (attachment 20). The response satisfied his concerns.

Memorandum For: Louis J. Boezi, Deputy Assistant Administrator for Modernization
From: James D. Belville, MIC/AM WSFO, Washington, DC
Subject: Evaluation of the Relocation of WSFO, Washington, DC from Camp Springs, MD to Sterling, VA



The Weather Service Forecast Office (WSFO) in Washington, DC provides weather forecasts and warnings over a four
state area (Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and the eastern panhandle of West Virginia) as well as, one federal district
and a large section of the North Atlantic Ocean. The WSFO in Washington, DC provides a full suite of services including
aviation, public, and marine forecasts; fire weather, air pollution, and agricultural support services; hydrologic
data collection and forecasts; and severe weather warnings. Due to the multi-state service area and multitude of
services, few if any WSFO's in the United States could compare in complexity for the relocation of this particular
office.
The WSFO Washington, DC (WBC) relocated on March 19, 1990 from Camp Springs, MD to Sterling, VA. The relocation of this
facility was necessary because of the location of the WSR-88D weather radar on property owned by the NWS just
west of Dulles International Airport. The distance of this move was approximately fifty (50) miles.
The move of WSFO WBC was completely planned and coordinated by myself, William Comeaux (DMIC), and numerous staff
members of the WSFO. Our first priority was to ensure that the office move was totally transparent to our entire user
community. This meant that all services continued uninterrupted during the transition of services from one location
to another. In every aspect of the planning process, the transition of services was the number one consideration.
User notification of the office relocation along with new NWS phone numbers presented the WSFO with a significant
challenge. While gearing up for this task, we found there was no central listing of the various users. Each office focal
point was tasked with developing a comprehensive list of users, along with the current address, for notification.
These were then combined and compiled in an administrative computer. A letter was composed for each specific user
group of individual along with computer produced mailing labels. We found that computer paper with the NOAA letterhead
was available. We were able to generate in excess of 2400 notification letters and mail them over a three day period.
Following the office relocation, we received zero complaints from all user groups concerning our notification procedures.
The notification occurred 45 days prior to the relocation.
Designing and implementing a communication system for the new facility in Sterling was the most difficult, as well
as frustrating, experience of the entire move. For the most part, this was due to the fact that the local phone company
was Contel, but C&P Telephone and AT&T also provided many of our data circuits. An enormous amount of coordination
was required in order to successfully install all needed communications circuits. All data circuits were tested
using a PC one week prior to the move. Several problems were found and immediately corrected. These efforts paid off
as the WSFO AFOS system, NWR, RADIDS monitors, and SWIS were all functioning in an operational configuration at the
new site within 18 hours of being turned off at the old location.
One significant outcome of the WSFO relocation was the vastly increased (nearly double) area covered by the metro
area telephone service the NWS obtained through Contel. The WSFO public service function was greatly enhanced by
the expanded telephone service area.
There were three communication deficiencies which resulted from the relocation of the WSFO.
1. FTS service was not available at the Sterling site for approximately 11/2 years following the relocation.
2. Relocating the office telephone system from the old site to the new location was a mistake. It proved to be quite expensive
and required several days to complete installation. Installing a new phone system prior to the relocation would have
been better.
3. The FEMA NAWAS circuits were installed about one month following the office move. This delay was caused by FEMA not
budgeting for the relocation of these circuits.
Service backup for the WSFO relocation was provided by several means. The public forecast and warning programs were
provided from WSO Baltimore, MD by WSFO WBC forecasters. The backup service began at 12 AM EST Sunday, March 19 and ended
at 8 AM EST Monday, March 20, 1990. All products were issued on time and were of excellent quality. Neither the public,
local officials, nor media could tell that a relocation had occurred. The aviation forecast products and marine forecast
products were issued by WSFO Charleston, WV and WSFO Raleigh, NC respectively. They did an excellent job of providing
quality products for our users.
The relocation of the equipment was planned in great detail. Equipment was loaded onto the vans in the order in which
it needed when unloaded. In other words, the most important was loaded last in order to be first off. The first off was
the NOAA Weather Radio (NWR). This system was down for a total of 6 hours. Next, the AFOS was off loaded. As each piece
was moved into the new facility, it was off loaded. As each piece was moved into the new facility, it was hooked up immediately
by the electronics technicians. The entire system installation and checkout was completed by 8 PM EST, March 19. The
system was allowed to run all night to ensure everything was operating satisfactorily. Two forecasters and a meteorological
technician monitored data flow and product delivery to validate service delivery capabilities. No troubles were
encountered during the night and all backup services were terminated at 8 AM Monday morning.
The relocation of WSFO WBC to a new facility was more than just a move. It also provided the WSFO with an opportunity to
improve several key areas of WSFO operations. These were:
1. Greatly improved operations layout with respect to access to the various technologies and the facilitation of
interaction between forecasters.
2. Vastly improved NOAA Weather Radio operations both in the basic programming and quality of the broadcast.
3. Improved warning procedures were obtained by locating the key dissemination systems to local officials and the
media in the operations area (NAWAS and EBS).
4. The SKYWARN spotter program was significantly enhanced with respect to the location of the amateur radio station
in the operations area and improved antenna system. It was difficult for SKYWARN to function at the old location.
To-date, I have not received nor have I heard of a complaint connected with the relocation of WSFO WBC to Sterling, VA.
The relocation went extremely well and was transparent to all users.
I have thoroughly reviewed the WSFO San Francisco relocation checklist with respect to requirements of relocation
of WSFO WBC. I find this checklist quite comprehensive and serves its intended purpose well. I could find no deficiencies
in their planning for this office relocation.

February 3, 1994.


Memorandum For: Louis J. Boezi, WX2
From: MIC/AM WSFO PHI
Subject: Evaluation of Office Move
Reference: WX21 memorandum 1/21/94



In reference to the above memorandum, the responses are as follows:
(1) The move was from downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Federal Building, 600 Arch Street), to Westampton township,
New Jersey, just west of the town of Mount Holly. The distance is 21 road miles.
(2) User notification was handled by our office and Eastern Region Headquarters. Over three thousand notifications
were mailed to radio, television, cable, newspapers, cooperative observers and spotters.
(3) Full service backup was accomplished by NWSFO PIT and NYC for sixty hours (60) from 7am edt August 23, 1993 to 7pm
edt August 25, 1993.
(4) Telephone lines were moved across state boundaries. This created numerous difficulties with the RDC/SDC AFOS
circuits, the asynchronous circuits, NWR, and general telephone lines. The NWR circuit problems took the longest
to resolve. The DMARC was moved from the old location to the new location. A new DMARC should have been constructed at
the new facility. The old DMARC caused numerous circuit restructuring problems. All cabling and connections were
installed and checked at the new facility prior to the move.
(5) & (6) The furniture and equipment move was handled poorly. The ``A'' side of AFOS was dropped. SWIS was dropped
and severely damaged. The equipment was loaded first and off-loaded last which was opposite to our instructions.
The damage and delay in off-loading equipment contributed to lengthening operational down time of the new facility_requiring
a longer full service backup. The RDA, RPG, and PUP installation went smoothly. The new facility environmental control
was seriously faulty and took several weeks to fully rectify.
(7) The WSR-88D was accepted approximately two weeks later than target date (early October 1993). The building
was conditionally (with faults noted with suggested corrections) accepted just prior to the move.
User reaction was strongly negative toward the poor communication systems or lack of proper operating communication
systems prior to resolution. Current reaction of the users is highly positive. In short, the major problem was communications.
The damage to the computer equipment and SWIS further delayed the restoration of full service capability. In the long
run, the systems were repaired, re-routed, restructured, and stabilized to the full satisfaction of all users.

For the Record:

From: MIC/AM WSFO PHI/MT. HOLLY_Chet Henricksen

Subject: The NWSFO PHL move to Mt. Holly




On August 23, 1993, the forecast office moved from center city Philadelphia to Mt. Holly, New Jersey. The move was approximately
21 miles. This is a summary of the move and the things that we've learned. Each move is different, with separate problems.
We can all learn from each individual move scenario.

(1) The equipment and furniture move_Significant damage occurred to our SWIS and AFOS system due to improper handling
during the move. We estimate approximately 10 thousand dollars in damages due to dropped and damaged equipment. A
more experienced computer equipment mover should have been used.

Recommendations: The area manager should have an active role in the selection of the equipment mover with EASC oversight.
The mover should have a history of successful computer moves. The computer equipment should be loaded last and off
loaded first. The delivery of non-computer equipment to the new sight should be delayed to allow for setup of moved
computer systems. The placement and handling of office and computer equipment requires at least two dedicated NWS
oversight personnel.

(2) Communications_All AFOS lines and telephone lines were laid prior to the move. The AFOS DEMARC from the center
city WSFO was hand carried to the new office, and put in place in a couple of hours. The new lines already in place in the
office had to be connected to the AFOS DEMARC. There was a circuit routing change required by SMCC in addition to normal
re-connection. This effected all asynchronous circuits. An attempt was made to reroute all asynchronous circuits
in the DEMARC. This was only partially successful. The end result was a significant delay in asynchronous service.
The RDC and SDC could not be checked prior to the move other than to confirm that the new lines were active. Problems arose
in data distribution checks after AFOS was reconnected. This further delayed return from full service backup. NWWS
and NU IFLOWS saw significant delays.

Recommendations: Standardized new DEMARC boxes should be available prior to a move, with all cables and wiring accomplished
prior to the move. All required changes in the DEMARC should be done well in advance, and available to the office for
installation to the new location prior to the physical move. Assistance from person(s) at another management area,
which has accomplished a similar move should be 

required

. Expertise and experience of NWS personnel should be fully utilized. We need a design review of the satellite antenna
plot to stabilize the system.

(3) Telephone Systems_The switch over from the old telephone line numbers to the new was not smooth. The old telephone
numbers were still active for over one week following the move. The public ring through answering machine failed,
probably due to an internal power supply failure. This occurred on power up at the new location. Additionally, the
ring through telephone number did not properly switch over to the New Jersey number as planned. It was more than two
weeks after the move, when we discovered that Bell Atlantic had not passed the work request on to Bell of Pennsylvania
to accomplish a ``roll over'' number for Pennsylvania callers. The three 800 telephone numbers failed to ``roll over''
to the New Jersey numbers as designed. In an attempt to keep the 800 numbers and ring through number changes transparent
to the user, unforeseen delays occurred in incoming calls to the new office. Numerous public complaints were filed
due to telephones not being answered (due to the numerous switch over problems). The learning curve on the NorthStar
telephone system was slow. This lead to an added irritant during and shortly following the move.

Recommendations: If the new lines are connected and operational, the old FTS 2000 lines should be disconnected by
GSA within twenty-four hours of the move. A voice intercept should be used for approximately thirty days on the old
telephone numbers announcing the new telephone number. With at least four telephone companies involved in an interstate
move, you can be assured of delays and errors in timing, and implementation of telephone numbers. A comparable spare
answering machine should be available for on site use in the event of the primary system failure.

(4) Environmental Systems_The condenser units on two of the three air conditioners flooded the ceiling and hallway
of the new office on four separate occasions. The problem turned out to be a defect under recall by the manufacturer
that had to be accomplished by the local service installers. The humidifier unit flooded the ceiling tiles twice.
This appears to be an engineering problem with the circulation system in the humidifier. we have a temporary fix in
place, but no permanent solution is available. The thermostatic control for the three air handlers is a computer.
A password and system training is necessary to operate and control the temperature environment in all but the equipment
room. The password was not made available until two weeks after the move. Training is still not accomplished. The computer
control unit failed due to a near by lightning strike. This caused the entire environmental system to fail. A telephone
line was installed three weeks after the move. This established contractor remote access to the computer control.
The environmental controller was placed on UPS three weeks after the move.

Recommendations: Communications of recalls and equipment modification lists must be improved. Facility problems
experienced at this location, are likely to be repeated at other NWS facilities. All environmental computer control
units should be placed on UPS in all NWS facilities. Passwords and training for the control units should be supplied
within 48 hours of building occupancy. Remote access to the control unit via telephone lines should be completed prior
to the move. A permanent fixed needs to be found for the humidifier problem.

Many things did go well with the move. I have listed the problem areas. This was done in an attempt to help other offices
in their move. I am open for questions and clarifications of these and other issues at anytime.

<DOCTITLE>Amendment of Export Visa and Quota Requirements for Certain Textile Products Produced or Manufactured in Various
Countries and Re-Imported Under Certain HTS Numbers </DOCTITLE>




March 22, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Issuing a directive to the Commissioner of Customs amending visa and quota requirements for goods re-imported under
HTS number 9801.00.2000 or 9801.00.2500.




</ACTION>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:






Authority: 

Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended; section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C.
1854).




Effective on March 25, 1994 textile and apparel products which are produced or manufactured in various countries
and 
entered into the United States for consumption and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption under existing visa
and quota requirements are no longer subject to visa or quota requirements upon re-entry into the United States under
Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) number 9801.00.2000 or 9801.00.2500. These tariff provisions provide for duty
free entry to products which have been previously imported into the United States. Upon the initial importation the
textile or apparel products would have been subject to all applicable quota and visa requirements. Since these HTS
numbers mandate that the same articles be re-imported, CITA has decided to exempt them from being subject to the same
quota and visa requirements a second time.

Dear Commissioner: This directive amends, but does not cancel, all import control directives issued to you by the
Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. This directive also amends, but does not cancel,
all visa requirements for all countries for which visa arrangements are in place with the United States.


Effective on March 25, 1994 textile and apparel products which are produced or manufactured in various countries
and 
entered into the United States for consumption and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption upon re-entry into
the United States under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) number 9801.00.2000 or 9801.00.2500 are no longer subject

Decision and Order
 


In the Matter of: Carrier Corporation. (Case No. F-065) 


Background


The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94-163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95-619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation
Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 100-12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA
1988), Public Law 100-357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102-486, 106 Stat. 2776,
which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer
products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption
that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, subpart
B. 

The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 to create a waiver process. 45 FR 64108,
September 26, 1980. Thereafter, DOE further amended its appliance test procedure waiver process to allow the Assistant
Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver from test
procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures.
51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986. 

The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily test procedures for a particular basic model
when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according
to the prescribed test procedures or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so
unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers
generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is
the subject of the waiver. 

The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Assistant Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver
when it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver
is denied, if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines
that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition
for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the
Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary. 

Carrier filed a ``Petition for Waiver,'' dated October 13, 1993, in accordance with  430.27 of 10 CFR part 430.
The Department published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 27, 1993, Carrier's petition and solicited comments, data and information respecting the petition.
58 FR 68400. Carrier also filed an ``Application for Interim Waiver'' under section 430.27(g) which DOE granted on
December 17, 1993. 58 FR 68400, December 27, 1993. 

No comments were received concerning either the ``Petition for Waiver'' or the ``Interim Waiver.'' The Department
consulted with The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning the Carrier Petition. The FTC did not have any objections
to the issuance of the waiver to Carrier. 



Assertions and Determinations


Carrier's Petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition
of the burner and the starting of the circulating air blower. Carrier requests the allowance to test using a 45-second
blower time delay when testing its 48HJ, 48HM, 48TJ/580D, 48SS/588A, and 48SX/589A induced draft roof-top furnaces.
Carrier states that since the 45-second delay is indicative of how these models actually operate and since such a delay
results in an improvement in efficiency of approximately 0.6 percent, the petition should be granted. 

Under specific circumstances, the DOE test procedure contains exceptions which allow testing with blower delay
times of less than the prescribed 1.5 minute delay. Carrier indicates that it is unable to take advantage of any of these
exceptions for its 48HJ, 48HM, 48TJ/580D, 48SS/588A, and 48SX/589A induced draft roof-top furnaces. 

Since the blower controls incorporated on the Carrier 48HJ, 48HM, 48TJ/580D, 48SS/588A, and 48SX/589A induced draft
roof-top furnaces are designed to impose a 45-second blower delay in every instance of start up, and since the current
provisions do not specifically address this type of control, DOE agrees that a waiver should be granted to allow the
45-second blower time delay when testing the Carrier 48HJ, 48HM, 48TJ/580D, 48SS/588A, and 48SX/589A induced draft
roof-top furnaces. Accordingly, with regard to testing the above induced draft roof-top furnaces, today's Decision
and Order exempts Carrier from the existing provisions regarding blower controls and allows testing with the 45-second
delay. 


It is, therefore, ordered that: 


(1) The ``Petition for Waiver'' filed by Carrier Corporation. (Case No. F-065) is hereby granted as set forth
in paragraph (2) below, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (3), (4), and (5). 

(2) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of Appendix N of 10 CFR part 430, Subpart B, Carrier Corporation, shall
be permitted to test its 48HJ, 48HM, 48TJ/580D, 48SS/588A, and 48SX/589A induced draft roof-top furnaces on the basis
of the test procedure specified in 10 CFR part 430, with modifications set forth below:

(i) Section 3.0 of Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph: 

3.0 Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-82
with the exception of sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures:


(ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 to Appendix N as follows: 

3.10 Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. The following paragraph is in lieu of the requirement specified
in section 9.3.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-82. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the
cool-down test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature,
using the thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner
start-up, delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t-), unless: (1) The furnace employs a single motor to drive the
power burner and the indoor air circulating blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together;
or (2) the furnace is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case
the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature
safety device which shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the
latter case, if the fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control
is permitted to start the blower, measure time delay, (t-), using a stopwatch. Record the measured temperatures.
During the heat-up test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within 

#

0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft. 

(iii) With the exception of the modifications set forth above, Carrier Corporation shall comply in all respects with
the test procedures specified in Appendix N of 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B. 

(3) The Waiver shall remain in effect from the date of issuance of this Order until DOE prescribes final test procedures
appropriate to the 48HJ, 48HM, 48TJ/580D, 48SS/588A, and 48SX/589A induced draft roof-top furnaces manufactured
by Carrier Corporation. 

(4) This Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements, allegations, and documentary materials submitted
by the petitioner. This Waiver may be revoked or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying
the petition is incorrect. 

(5) Effective March 21, 1994, this Waiver supersedes the Interim Waiver granted the Carrier Corporation on December
17, 1993. 58 FR 68400, December 27, 1993 (Case No. F-065).

2. Ozark Gas Transmission System


[Docket No. CP94-280-000]


Take notice that on March 11, 1994, Ozark Gas Transmission System (Ozark), 1700 Pacific Avenue, Dallas, Texas 75201,
filed in Docket No. CP94-280-000 an application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permission
and approval to abandon one lateral line compressor, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file
with the Commission and open to public inspection.
Ozark states that the 620 horsepower compressor unit which is subject to this abandonment filing is called the Hurley
compressor and is located in Section 28, Township 10 North, Range 24 West, Johnson County, Arkansas. Ozark further
states that this unit is no longer needed to provide service on the Hurley lateral. Ozark asserts that gas supply produced
from the wells located behind this compressor may be delivered without this unit, and therefore, service would not
be interrupted upon abandonment of the unit.

3. East Tennessee Natural Gas Co.


[Docket No. CP94-284-000]


Take notice that on March 14, 1994, East Tennessee Natural Gas Company (East Tennessee), Building E, Suite 424, Cross
Park II, 9111 Cross Park Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee 37923, filed in Docket No. CP94-284-000 a request
pursuant to   157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205,
157.212) for authorization to modify certain existing metering facilities under East Tennessee's blanket certificate
issued in Docket No. CP82-412-000 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth
in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.
East Tennessee proposes to replace existing meter tubes at two locations in order to increase the measurement accuracy
of the metering facilities. East Tennessee explains that it transports natural gas for Jamestown Natural Gas (Jamestown)
and Middle Tennessee Utility District (MTUD) and delivers the gas at flow rates that exceed the flow rates that can
be accurately measured by the existing metering facilities. East Tennessee states that to improve the measurement
accuracy of the facilities, East Tennessee would replace (a) One of the existing 2-inch meter tubes with a 4-inch meter
tube at the Jamestown Sales Station (Meter No. 75-9084) in Fentress County, Tennessee, and (b) two 4-inch meter
tubes with two 6-inch meter tubes at Meter No. 75-9031, Monterey Sales Station in Putnam County, Tennessee,
for MTUD. East Tennessee estimates that the cost of renovating each of the facilities is $10,000 for a total of $20,000
which would be absorbed by East Tennessee.

4. ANR Storage Company 



[Docket No. CP94-291-000] 



Take notice that on March 16, 1994, ANR Storage Company (ANR), 500 Renaissance Center, Detroit, Michigan 48243, filed
in Docket No. CP94-291-000 a request pursuant to Section 157.205 of the Commission's Regulations to increase
the authorized maximum volume of natural gas to be stored in its northern Michigan storage fields, under ANR's blanket
certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-523-000, pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more
fully set forth in the request on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

ANR proposes to change the maximum inventory level of the storage fields as follows: 


 


ANR states that engineering evaluation and actual operational experience has indicated that the size of ANR's Cold
Springs 12, Rapid River 35 and Excelsior 6/East Kalkaska fields are slightly larger than predicted when originally
authorized. These increases are partially offset by the slightly smaller estimate for the Cold Springs 31 field,
it is stated. ANR states that it does not propose to increase the maximum authorized reservoir pressure, construct
any new facilities, or impact the storage services ANR currently provides its existing customers. ANR indicates
that these changes in maximum inventory levels would conform to the actual operational characteristics of the fields
and would provide ANR greater operational flexibility by allowing ANR to use the maximum storage capability, within
allowable pressures, of each of its storage fields.

5. Riverside Gas Storage Company 


Docket No. CP94-292-000 


Take notice that on March 17, 1994, Riverside Gas Storage Company (Riverside), 3500 Park Lane, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
15275, filed in Docket No. CP94-292-000 an application pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, and
part 157 and subpart G of part 284 of the Commission's Regulations for a certificate of public convenience and necessity
to develop, construct, own and operate an underground gas storage field and related facilities in Greene and Fayette
Counties, Pennsylvania and for a blanket certificate to render firm and interruptible storage services on a non-discriminatory
open-access basis, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.


Riverside requests authorization to acquire, develop, own and operate an underground gas storage field and to provide
a total of 3,100 MMcf annually of natural gas storage service. It is stated that the field will have a capacity of 5,100
MMcf of which 3,100 MMcf will represent working gas and 2,000 MMcf will represent cushion gas. It is further stated
that Riverside will acquire or drill 21 injection/withdrawal wells, and install any necessary pipeline and compression
facilities. In addition, it is stated that the Riverside storage field will be attached to the interstate pipeline
system of Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation. 

Riverside proposes to offer two firm storage services: 
90-day withdrawal service under Rate Schedule 90SS and 30-day withdrawal service under Rate Schedule 30SS. Riverside
states that these services will permit year-round injections and withdrawal of gas subject to the requirement that
customers must inject 100 percent of contract entitlements on one occasion during the summer period of each year and
must withdraw at least 75 percent of contract entitlements on one occasion during the winter period of each year. 

Riverside proposes to operate under a part 284 blanket certificate, and in compliance with Order No. 636, Riverside's
proposed FERC gas Tariff includes provisions regarding capacity release, and the right of first refusal for customers
under expiring long-term contracts that wish to retain all or a portion of capacity rights. 

In addition, Riverside proposes initial certificate rates for firm storage service which are based on a straight
fixed variable classification with fixed costs being recovered through the deliverability and capacity charges
and variable costs recovered through the injection and withdrawal charges. It is stated that Riverside will allocate
40 percent of fixed costs to the deliverability rate component and 60 percent of fixed costs to the space component
of firm storage rates. 

Riverside states that it will also offer interruptible storage service under Rate Schedule ISS-1. It is stated
that the rates for interruptible storage service are designed on the 100 percent load factor derivation of the proposed
firm storage rates. Riverside states that it will credit 90 percent of net interruptible revenues to firm storage
customers. 

It is stated that Riverside held an open season in July 1993. Riverside states that based on the expressed level of customer
demand, Riverside proposes to offer 2.54 Bcf of base-load storage service under Rate Schedule 90SS, with an aggregate
Maximum Daily Injection Quantity of 29,210 Dth and an aggregate Maximum Daily Withdrawal Quantity of 29,210 Dth,
and to offer 
560 MMcf of peak storage service under Rate Schedule 30SS, with an aggregate Maximum Daily Injection Quantity of 19,320
Dth and an aggregate Maximum Daily Withdrawal Quantity of 19,320 Dth.

<DOCTITLE>Salt Lake City Area Integrated Projects Electric Power Marketing Draft Environmental Impact Statement</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Western Area Power Administration, DOE.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability and notice of public hearings.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In 1980, the Western Area Power Administration (Western) began examining its marketing criteria for long-term capacity
and energy sales from the Salt Lake City Area Integrated Projects (SLCA/IP) due to the impending expiration of existing
long-term contracts in 1989. Western proceeded to develop the Post-1989 General Power Marketing Criteria and Allocation
Criteria for the Salt Lake City Area, and completed an environmental assessment (EA) in late 1985. In response to controversy
over the potential environmental effects of the proposed marketing criteria, Western announced in the 

Federal Register

 on April 4, 1990, its intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on its power marketing and allocation
criteria (55 FR 12550). Following extensive public involvement and analysis, Western's SLCA/IP Electric Power
Marketing Draft EIS has been prepared and is now available for public review and comment.


Five public hearings will be held to discuss the alternatives presented in the draft SLCA/IP Electric Power Marketing
EIS, and allow the public to ask questions and provide formal comments for the record. A 90-day comment period will
extend until June 29, 1994.
During the public hearings, written and oral statements will be accepted. A court reporter will record the proceedings.
Persons, organizations, or agencies wishing to make oral statements will be asked to register at the door prior to
the beginning of the hearing. Western will respond to comments in the final EIS. There will be an informal public information
session before each hearing where the public can discuss aspects of the draft EIS with Western representatives at
several information stations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In 1980, Western began examining its marketing criteria for long-term capacity and energy sales from the SLCA/IP.
Existing long-term contracts were due to expire in 1989, and sufficient time was needed for customers to make other
contractual arrangements based on their final allocations of SLCA/IP power. Western proceeded to develop the Post-1989
General Power Marketing Criteria and Allocation Criteria for the Salt Lake City Area, and completed an EA in late 1985.
DOE approved a finding of no significant impact on January 8, 1986. In response to controversy over the potential environmental
effects of the proposed marketing criteria, Western announced its intent to prepare an EIS on its power marketing
and allocation criteria in the April 4, 1990, 

Federal Register

 (FR) (55 FR 12550).


Western's Salt Lake City Area Office markets electricity produced at hydroelectric facilities operated by the Bureau
of Reclamation largely on the Upper Colorado River. The facilities are known collectively as the SLCA/IP and include
dams equipped for power generation on the Green, Gunnison, Rio Grande, and Colorado Rivers. These facilities are
located in the States of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. Of these facilities, only the Glen Canyon
Unit, the Flaming Gorge Unit, and the Aspinall Unit (which includes Blue Mesa, Morrow Point, and Crystal Dams) are
currently influenced by Western power marketing and transmission decisions. The operation of these facilities
and their potential environmental impacts are analyzed in the draft EIS. Up to nine hydropower operational scenarios
were developed for each generation facility to assess the range of possible operational impacts.
Western developed seven EIS alternatives, called commitment level alternatives, which reflect the range of combinations
of capacity and energy which would feasibly and reasonably fulfill Western's firm power marketing responsibilities,
needs, and statutory obligations. Operational scenarios at each facility were combined to form various SLCA/IP
supply options, which were in turn paired with the commitment level alternatives in order to conduct air quality,
economic, and financial analyses. The draft EIS evaluates the potential impacts of these alternatives, including
no action, no socioeconomics, air resources, water resources, ecological resources, cultural resources, land
use, recreation, and visual resources.
Western is actively seeking public input on the draft EIS in order to make a decision on a preferred alternatives. No
preferred alternative is identified in the draft EIS for this reason. A decision on a preferred alternative will be
made after considering comments on the draft EIS, and that alternative will be identified in the final EIS.

Title: 

Application for Earth Station Authorization or Modification of Station License. 


Form Number: 

FCC Form 493.


Action: 

Revision of a currently approved collection. 


Respondents: 

Businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses). 


Frequency of Response: 

On occasion reporting requirement. 


Estimated Annual Burden: 

2,500 responses; 24 hours average burden per response; 60,000 hours total annual burden. 


Needs and Uses: 

FCC Form 493 is a multipurpose application form used to request Commission authorization for new or modified radio
station facilities under Part 25. The form is used for a number of satellite services governed by Part 25 covering several
classes of stations. Part 25 services include Domestic Fixed-Satellite Service; International Fixed-Satellite
Service; Radiodetermination-Satellite Service; and Mobile Satellite Service. FCC Form 493 is used to apply for
a license to construct and/or operate a transmit/receive earth station, a transmit-only earth station; to register
a domestic receive-only earth station; to license an international receive only earth station; or to modify a granted
license or registration. On 10/21/93, the Commission adopted a Report and Order establishing rules to govern the
licensing and regulation of non-voice non-geostationary mobile-satellite service systems (NVNG MSS). Applicants
will use FCC Form 493 to apply for approval for transceivers in the NVNG MSS. Several questions on the form require applicants
to submit further information in the form of exhibits. Applicants are advised to refer to 47 CFR Part 25 before completing
the form to determine whether other showings are necessary in addition to that specified in the form. FCC Form 493 will
be used by FCC staff to determine the applicant's eligibility to operate earth station facilities and to receive requested
modifications to earth station facilities. The agency would not be able to determine the applicant's eligibility
for acquiring an authorization without this information.

<DOCTITLE>Supplemental Awards to Current Community Partnership Demonstration Program Grantees </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Availability of Supplemental Funds for Currently Funded Grantees in the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention's
(CSAP) Community Partnership Demonstration Grant Program.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice informs the public that CSAP is making available approximately $600,000 in Fiscal Year 1994 for approximately
12 supplemental awards to existing grantees in its Community Partnership Program (CPP). The supplemental funding
is intended to permit currently-funded CPP grantees to build an ongoing communication-centered activity on their
existing infrastructure to further the accomplishment of their project's alcohol, tobacco, and other drug prevention
goals. 



Only currently funded CPP grantees are eligible to apply for supplemental funding. Eligibility is restricted because
the limited funds available can be used most effectively to demonstrate communications-centered approaches by
creating optimal conditions for success in the existing partnerships, where the necessary infrastructure and organizational
capacity to develop such approaches are already in place. The existing Community Partnerships have exhibited interest
in and the need for communications components to supplement their existing array of strategies, and many have participated
in relevant training offered by CSAP and other organizations. This restriction thus will allow more thorough demonstrations
of the effects of communication-centered approaches by linking them to existing partnerships, their needs assessments
and evaluation measures, rather than starting such projects from the beginning. 

To apply for a supplemental award, a CPP grantee must have a minimum of one full project year remaining in the current
grant as of September 30, 1994. Awards will be limited to one year and can not exceed a total of $50,000 in direct and indirect
costs. The receipt date for applications is April 29, 1994. The application receipt and review and the award process
will be handled in an expedited manner. Applications will be reviewed for merit by a panel of expert Federal and non-Federal
reviewers, and supplements will be awarded on the basis of merit and availability of funds no later than September
30, 1994.

Availability of an Environmental Assessment and Receipt of an Application for a Permit To Allow Incidental Take of
the Endangered Stephens' Kangaroo Rat by Pacific Gateway Homes Ltd., in the City of Corona, Riverside County, CA

ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The notice advises the public that Pacific Gateway Homes, Ltd., Partners (Applicant) has applied to the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental take permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species
Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The application has been assigned permit number PRT-787915. The requested permit
would authorize the incidental take of the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat (

Dipodomys stephensi

) in the city of Corona, Riverside County, California. The proposed incidental take would occur as a result of clearing,
grading, and construction activities in Stephens' kangaroo rat habitat for a single-family home subdivision, Tentative
Tract Map 27796.



The Service also announces the availability of an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the proposed issuance of the
incidental take permit. This notice is provided pursuant to section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy
Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 



Under section 9 of the Act, ``taking'' of Stephens' kangaroo rats, an endangered species, is prohibited. However,
the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species if such taking is
incidental to, and not the purpose of, otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered
species are in 50 CFR 17.22.

The Applicant proposes to implement a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) for the Stephens' kangaroo rat that will allow
clearing, grading, and construction of a single-family home subdivision, Tentative Tract Map 27796, in the city
of Corona, Riverside County, California. The permit would authorize the destruction of up to 26.6 acres of occupied
Stephens' kangaroo rat habitat, which is estimated to included 60 to 220 Stephens' kangaroo rats. The permit would
be in effect for 24 months. The application includes an HCP and Implementation Agreement.

The Applicant proposes to mitigate for the incidental take prior to site disturbance by: (1) Acquiring 26.6 acres
of occupied Stephens' kangaroo rat habitat within a Stephens' kangaroo rat Study Area administered by the Riverside
County Habitat Conservation Agency (RCHCA) to be managed in perpetuity to benefit the Stephens' kangaroo rat; (2)
implementing this requirement by payment of $232,750 to the RCHCA for the habitat acquisition; (3) paying $23,275
to the RCHCA for the long-term management of the acquired habitat; and (4) providing evidence conforming acquisition
of the habitat within 180 days of payment of the mitigation fee.

The EA considers the environmental consequences of six alternatives, including the proposed action and no-action
alternatives. The proposed action is the issuance of a permit under section 10(a) of the Act that would authorize removal
of 26.6 acres of Stephens' kangaroo rat habitat during development of the subdivision. The proposed action would
result in minimizing incidental take by limitations on and monitoring of proposed construction activities. Mitigation
under the proposed action would enhance Stephens' kangaroo rat conservation by the acquisition and management of
26.6 acres of habitat to be managed for the Stephens' kangaroo rat. Under the no-action alternative, the project would
not occur and the permit would not be issued. The present habitat fragmentation and isolation due to off-road vehicle
use, surrounding development, and other on-site disturbances would remain under the no-action alternative, and
the Stephens' kangaroo rat population on the site likely would disappear in time. In addition, proposed funding for
acquisition of habitat within the RCHCA reserve areas would not be available. The third alternative is to completely
avoid occupied habitat on the project site. A fourth alternative is to redesign the project to reduce the amount of
direct take on the site. A fifth alternative is to trap and relocate Stephens' kangaroo rats as a means of avoiding the
killing or serious injury of the animals. The sixth alternative is to obtain a take allocation from the city of Corona
as a co-permittee to the existing RCHCA 10(a) incidental take permit and HCP.

Abstract: 

10 CFR part 40 establishes requirements for licenses for the receipt, possession, use, and transfer of radioactive
source and byproduct material. NRC Form 244 is used to report receipt and transfer of depleted uranium under general
license, as required by 10 CFR part 40. NRC Form 484 is used to report certain ground-water monitoring data required
by 10 CFR part 40 for uranium recovery licensees. The information is used by NRC to make licensing and other regulatory
determinations concerning the use of radioactive source and byproduct material. The revision reflects an increase
in burden primarily because of the addition of burden estimates for decommissioning financial assurance provisions
and emergency plans. There is a revised estimate of the number of labelings or markings of industrial products or devices
containing depleted uranium under  40.35(b). There is a small increase in the burden estimate for Form 244 because
a greater number of the forms are now being received from licensees.



Copies of the submittal may be inspected or obtained for a fee from the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower
Level), Washington, DC.
Comments and questions may be directed by mail to the OMB reviewer:

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Statements; Availability, etc.: Combustion Engineering, Inc.</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is considering the renewal of Special Nuclear Material License SNM-33
for the continued operation of the Combustion Engineering, Inc. (CE), Hematite Nuclear Fuel Manufacturing Facility,
for 10 years.


Summary of the Environmental Assessment


Identification of the Proposed Action


The proposed action is the renewal of License SNM-33, allowing CE to continue manufacturing low-enriched nuclear
fuel for 10 years. The current license authorizes CE to receive, possess, use, and transfer special nuclear material
in accordance with 10 CFR part 70 and source material in accordance with 10 CFR part 40. This license also allows CE to
delivery radioactive material to a carrier for transportation in accordance with 10 CFR part 71. CE produces low-enriched
(>5 percent U-235) ceramic nuclear fuel for light-water cooled reactors.


The Need for the Proposed Action


The proposed action is needed for CE to continue to produce low-enriched nuclear fuel pellets which will ultimately
be used by commercial nuclear power plants to produce electricity. Since CE is one of only a few facilities that manufacture
nuclear fuel in this country, there remains a need for the fuel by the nuclear power industry.


Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action


Airborne effluents from process areas and process equipment involving uranium in a dispersible form are subject
to air filtering, prior to release to the atmosphere. Effluents from the process areas are continuously collected
on a particulate filter and are analyzed for gross alpha activity. The monitoring data for 1982 through September
1993 demonstrates that the levels of gross alpha activity released from the site do not exceed the limits specified
in 10 CFR part 20, Appendix B, Table II, Column 1.
There are no planned releases of radioactive liquid wastes from routine production processes. Liquids with low-uranium
content, such as mop water, cleanup water, and grinder coolant water, are collected and then evaporated to recover
the uranium. Liquids with higher uranium content are processed to recover the uranium, usually by precipitation
and filtration. Process filtrates, including wet recovery system filtrate and spent scrubber solutions, are routed
to a calibrated tank, mixed, sampled, and the filtrates are then evaporated, solidified with concrete, and packaged
for shipment to a licensed burial site.
A potential source of radioactive liquid waste is from the laundry, sink and shower areas, and the chemistry laboratory.
The laundry water is filtered and sampled prior to discharge to the sanitary sewer system. The water from change room
sinks and showers is also discharged through the sanitary waste system. Effluents from the sanitary waste system
enter the site creek immediately below the site pond dam. A grab sample of the water is taken each week and analyzed for
gross alpha and beta activities. The chemistry laboratory discharges to the storm drain system. While analytical
residues are recycled to recover the uranium and therefore do not contribute to the effluents, when the laboratory
glassware is cleaned, small amounts of liquids wash down the sinks and are discharged to the storm drain system. The
storm drain system discharges into the site pond which overflows to form the site creek. The overflow is sampled weekly
and analyzed for gross alpha and beta.

Liquid effluent sample data for 1982 through September 1993 was reviewed and indicates that the results are a small
fraction of the values set forth in 10 CFR part 20, Appendix B, Table II, Column 2.


CE conducts an environmental sampling program to determine if site operations are impacting the environment. Air,
soil, vegetation, surface water, and ground water samples are collected from various locations on or near the plant
site. Review of the data for 1982 through September 1993 indicates there is no significant impact to the environment
from manufacturing operations.


A dose assessment was performed to evaluate the impact from site operations to the maximally exposed individual who
would be the nearest resident. The maximally exposed individual is located 950 feet (290 m), west-northwest of the
plant site. The effective whole body dose for the maximally exposed individual is 3.31E-02 mrem/year. The critical
organ for this exposure would be the lungs, with a dose of 1.90E-01 mrem/year. The annual dose received by the
nearest resident is below the federal dose limits set forth in 10 CFR part 20 and 40 CFR part 190, 500 mrem/year and 25
mrem/year, respectively.




Conclusion




Liquid and airborne effluents released to the environment are well below all regulatory limits. Results of the environmental
monitoring program have shown that environmental radiation levels are not increasing as a result of site operations.
The total whole body dose received by the maximally exposed individual from site operations is well below federal
limits. Therefore, the staff concludes that the impact to the environment and to human health and safety from manufacturing
nuclear fuel at this site has been minimal.




Alternatives to the Proposed Action



The alternative to the proposed action would be to deny the license renewal. Not renewing the operating license would
cause CE to cease operations and begin decontamination and decommissioning activities at the site. While terminating
licensed activities at CE may create a minimal positive effect on the immediate environment, the socioeconomic impact
of denying the license would adversely affect the area because CE is one of the largest employers in the area. This alternative
would be considered if there were public health and safety issues that could not be resolved to the satisfaction of
the NRC.




Agencies and Persons Consulted




Staff utilized the application dated November 22, 1989, and additional information dated October 11, and December
16, 1991, and December 10, 1993. Staff toured the CE facility on August 18 and 19, 1990. The region III inspector and
CE staff were consulted in preparing this document. The staff also contacted personnel from the State of Missouri,
Department of Natural Resources, Air Pollution Control Program.




Finding of No Significant Impact



The Commission has prepared an Environmental Assessment related to the renewal of Special Nuclear Material License
SNM-33. On the basis of the assessment, the Commission has concluded that environmental impacts that would
be created by the proposed licensing action would not be significant and do not warrant the preparation of an Environmental
Impact Statement. Accordingly, it has been determined that a Finding of No Significant Impact is appropriate. 

The Environmental Assessment and the above documents related to this proposed action are available for public inspection
and copying at the Commission's Public Document Room at the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC, and
the Local Public Document Room located at the Jefferson College Library, 1000 Viking Drive, Hillsboro, MO.

<DOCTITLE>Order Requiring the Removal of An Individual From NRC-Licensed or Regulated Activities and Order Directing Review
of Personnel Security Files (Effective Immediately)</DOCTITLE>



In the matter of: Nuclear Support Services, Inc. Hershey, PA.



I


Nuclear Support Services, Inc. (NSSI) of Hershey, Pennsylvania, provides health physics personnel and support
to various nuclear power plants. To perform these services, these NSSI personnel require unescorted access authorization
to NRC-licensed or regulated nuclear power plants. As of January 3, 1990, the provisions of the NRC Fitness-For-Duty
(FFD) rule (10 CFR part 26) became effective for personnel (including contractors) granted unescorted access authorization
to nuclear power plants.


II


Mr. Robert C. Dailey was the NSSI Security Officer from November 1989 to May 1991. While in that position, Mr. Dailey
provided letters to NRC reactor licensees requesting unescorted access authorization for NSSI personnel and certifying
that these personnel met all applicable FFD and access authorization requirements. A licensee's granting of unescorted
access authorization to NSSI personnel who did not meet the FFD requirements would constitute a violation of 10 CFR
part 26 requirements.
On August 14, 1991, two NRC licensees (Northern States Power Company (NSP) and Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPC))
submitted Licensee Event Reports to the Commission because an NSSI employee had been improperly granted unescorted
access to the NSP Prairie Island plant and the WEPC Point Beach plant based on written requests for such access from
Mr. Dailey. These requests stated that the employee met all of the FFD requirements for unescorted access. However,
in fact, the employee had four past drug-related access denials at other nuclear power plants since 1987. Both Licensee
Event Reports noted that NSSI was aware of the past denials.
An NSSI letter dated August 8, 1991, from Fred H. Ershine, NSSI Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer,
to Mr. Thomas R. Eells, Security Representative for WEPC, stated that the incident that required WEPC to submit a report
to the NRC was caused by the former NSSI Security Officer not properly documenting or following up on the report of derogatory
information and/or materials concerning prior FFD violations with the appropriate individuals at each nuclear
plant.
An investigation was initiated by the NRC Office of Investigations (OI). The OI investigation concluded that Mr.
Dailey had sent on three occasions to Point Beach, and one occasion to Prairie Island, letters stating that the person
for whom he was requesting unescorted access had met all applicable FFD requirements and had no previous positive
drug or alcohol use test results within the previous five years. The OI investigation concluded that the letters sent
by Mr. Dailey were inaccurate because the person did have positive drug or alcohol use test results.
Despite what was contained in the access authorization request letters, Mr. Dailey told the OI investigator during
a January 1993 interview that he had verbally advised the appropriate NSP and WEPC security personnel of the past positive
test results. These licensee representatives denied being advised of such information. In Mr. Dailey's statement
to the OI investigator, which was subsequently determined to be false, Mr. Dailey deliberately provided to the NRC
investigator material information that he knew was inaccurate. This constitutes a violation of 10 CFR 50.5(a)(2).
In addition, WEPC and NSP notified NRC in LERs dated August 14, 1991 that several individuals were recommended by NSSI
for unescorted access without revealing their past access denials or past positive drug/alcohol tests.


III


Mr. Dailey, as the NSSI security manager, was responsible for the administration of the NSSI security screening program
including determining the qualifications of applicants for unescorted access into the protected and vital areas
of NSSI's client-owned nuclear power plants and for requesting such access from NSSI's clients. In the matters described
in section II of this Order, Mr. Dailey was acting for and on behalf of NSSI. As such, his actions are imputed to NSSI since
a corporation can only act through its agents and employees. Therefore, Mr. Dailey and NSSI violated 10 CFR 50.5.
The NRC must be able to rely on licensee contractors and contractor personnel, in addition to licensees, to comply
with NRC requirements including the requirement to provide information and maintain records that are complete and
accurate in all material respects. Mr. Dailey's violation of 10 CFR 50.5 has raised serious doubt as to whether he can
be relied upon to comply with NRC requirements and to provide complete and accurate information to the NRC, an employer,
or a licensee with regard to NRC-licensed or regulated activities. Consequently, I lack the requisite assurance
that NRC-licensed and regulated activities can be conducted by Mr. Dailey in compliance with the Commission's requirements.
Therefore, I find that the significance of the conduct described above is such that the public health, safety, and
interest require that NSSI be directed to remove Mr. Dailey from participation in NRC-licensed or regulated activities
for a period of five years from the date of this Order, effective immediately.

In addition, the conduct of Mr. Dailey raises serious concerns about the adequacy of the NSSI security screening program
during his tenure as Security Officer (November 1989 to May 1991). Therefore, the public health, safety and interest
require that we order NSSI to review security records in which Mr. Dailey was involved to assure that NSSI personnel
granted unescorted access to NRC-licensed nuclear plants met access authorization and fitness-for-duty requirements.



IV



Accordingly, pursuant to sections 62, 63, 81, 103, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182, and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as
amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202, 10 CFR 26.27 and 10 CFR 50.5, it is hereby ordered, effective
immediately, that:




A.1. Nuclear support Services, Inc., remove Robert C. Dailey from participation in NRC-licensed or regulated activities
for a period of five years from the date of this Order.

A.2. Nuclear Support Services, Inc., shall, if contacted by another person considering employing Robert C. Dailey
in NRC-licensed or regulated activities, advise that person of the existence of condition A. 1 of this order as well
as the existence and conditions of the Order issued to Mr. Dailey. This condition is to remain in effect for a period
of five years from the date of this Order.

B.1. Nuclear Support Services, Inc., shall notify the NRC of the names of licensees who employ or have employed NSSI
personnel whose recommendation for access authorization was handled by Mr. Dailey or by NSSI during Mr. Dailey's
tenure as NSSI Security Officer between November 1989 and May 31, 1991.

B.2. Nuclear Support Services, Inc., shall complete a review of all NSSI personnel security files processed during
the period of November 1989 through May 31, 1991, to ensure that, based upon the information in the files, any NSSI personnel
recommended for unescorted access to NRC-licensed nuclear plants during that period met applicable 10 CFR part 26
Fitness-for-Duty requirements and access authorization requirements for unescorted access in accordance with
requirements applicable to NSSI's clients' security plans as prescribed in such clients' contracts with NSSI.

B.3. Nuclear Support Services, Inc., shall advise the NRC, in writing, of the results of the review required by conditions
B.1 and 2. within 60 days of the date of this Order.

B.4. Nuclear Support Services, Inc., shall also, within 7 days of NSSI's discovery, advise the appropriate nuclear
power plant licensees and the NRC of any personnel identified during the review described above who were recommended
for unescorted access authorization by NSSI but did not meet part 26 requirements or access authorization requirements
at the time the NSSI request was submitted to the licensee. 
B.5. Nuclear Support Services, Inc. shall provide an audit plan to the NRC, to verify the accuracy of information obtained
by NSSI in its background inquiries which formed the basis for its access decisions during the period from November
1989 to May 31, 1991. The plan shall be submitted within 30 days of the date of this Order and include the sample size,
the milestones and schedule for completing the audit, qualifications of the auditors, and the basis for concluding
that the audit plan will provide assurance that NSSI's records are complete and accurate. Following NRC approval
of the plan, it shall be implemented. The results of the audit shall be provided to the applicable licensees and the
NRC within 7 days of the completion of the audit. 
B.6. Submittals to the NRC required by the above conditions shall be provided to the Chief, Safeguards Branch, Office
of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, with a copy to the Regional
Administrator, Region III. 



The Director, Office of enforcement, may, in writing, relax or rescind any of the above conditions upon demonstration
by Nuclear Support Services, Inc., of good cause. 


V


In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202, Nuclear Support Services, Inc., must, and Robert C. Dailey or any other person adversely
affected by this Order may submit an answer to this Order, and may request a hearing on this Order, within 20 days of the
date of this Order. The answer may consent to this Order. Unless the answer consents to this Order, the answer shall,
in writing and under oath or affirmation, specifically admit or deny each allegation or charge made in this Order and
shall set forth the matters of fact and law on which Nuclear Support Services, Inc., Robert C. Dailey, or any other person
adversely affected relies and the reasons as to why the Order should not have been issued. Any answer or request for
a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Attn: Chief, Docketing and Service
Section, Washington, DC 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, Washington, DC 20555, to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address,
to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region III, 801 Warrenville Road, Lisle, IL 60532-4351, and to Nuclear Support
Services, Inc., if the answer or hearing request is by a person other than Nuclear Support Services, Inc. If a person
other than Nuclear Support Services, Inc., or Robert C. Dailey requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with
particularity the manner in which his or her interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria
set forth in 10 CFR 2.714(d).
If a hearing is requested by Nuclear Support Services, Inc., Robert C. Dailey, or any other person whose interest is
adversely affected, the Commission will issue an Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing
is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether this Order should be sustained. 
Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), Nuclear Support Services, Inc., Robert C. Dailey or any other person adversely
affected by this Order may, in addition to demanding a hearing, at the time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding
officer to set aside the immediate effectiveness of a portion of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the
need for immediate effectiveness for a part of the Order, is not based on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded
allegations or error. 
In the absence of any request for hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from the
date of this Order without further order or proceedings. An answer or a request for a hearing shall not stay the immediately
effective part of this order.

<DOCTITLE>Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee; Open Committee Meeting</DOCTITLE>


According to the provisions of section 10 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92-463), notice is hereby
given that meetings of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee will be held on_



Thursday, Apr. 7, 1994,
Thursday, Apr. 28, 1994.




The meetings will start at 10:45 a.m. and will be held in room 5A06A, Office of Personnel Management Building, 1900
E Street, NW., Washington, DC.
The Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee is composed of a Chairman, representatives from five labor unions
holding exclusive bargaining rights for Federal blue-collar employees, and representatives from five Federal
agencies. Entitlement to membership on the Committee is provided for in 5 U.S.C. 5347.
The Committee's primary responsibility is to review the Prevailing Rate System and other matters pertinent to establishing
prevailing rates under subchapter IV, chapter 53, 5 U.S.C., as amended, and from time to time advise the Office of Personnel
Management.
These scheduled meetings will start in open session with both labor and management representatives attending. During
the meeting either the labor members or the management members may caucus separately with the Chairman to devise strategy
and formulate positions. Premature disclosure of the matters discussed in these caucuses would unacceptably impair
the ability of the Committee to reach a consensus on the matters being considered and would disrupt substantially
the disposition of its business. Therefore, these caucuses will be closed to the public because of a determination
made by the Director of the Office of Personnel management under the provisions of section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory
Committee Act (Pub. L. 92-463) and 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(9)(B). These caucuses may, depending on the issues involved,
constitute a substantial portion of the meeting.
Annually, the Committee publishes for the Office of Personnel Management, the President, and Congress a comprehensive
report of pay issues discussed, concluded recommendations, and related activities. These reports are available
to the public, upon written request to the Committee's Secretary.
The public is invited to submit material in writing to the Chairman on Federal Wage System pay matters felt to be deserving
of the Committee's attention. Additional information on these meetings may be obtained by contacting the Committee's
Secretary, Office of Personnel management, Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee, room 1340, 1900 E Street,

 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 notice is hereby given that on December 29, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in
Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization.






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange requests permanent approval of the pilot program which amended Amex Rule 109 to permit a specialist,
upon request, to grant stops in a minimum fractional change market.
 In the alternative, the Exchange proposes a one-year extension of the pilot program. The complete text of the proposed
rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission.





II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



On July 21, 1993, the Commission extended its pilot approval of amendments to Exchange Rule 109 until March 21, 1994.
 The amendments permit a specialist, upon request, to grant a stop
 in a minimum fractional change market
 for any order of 2,000 shares or less, up to a total of 5,000 shares for all stopped orders, provided there is an order
imbalance, without obtaining prior Floor Official approval. A Floor Official, however, must authorize a greater
order size or aggregate share threshold. 







During the course of the pilot program, the Exchange has closely monitored compliance with the rule's requirements;
analyzed the impact on orders on the specialist's book resulting from the execution of stopped orders at a price that
is better than the stop price; and reviewed market depth in a stock when a stop is granted in a minimum fractional change
market. The Exchange believes that the amendments to Rule 109 have provided a benefit to investors by providing an
opportunity for price improvement, while increasing market depth and continuity without adversely affecting orders
on the specialist's book. The Exchange's findings in this regard have been forwarded to the Commission under separate
cover.

The Exchange is therefore proposing permanent approval of the amendments to Rule 109. In the alternative, the Exchange
is requesting an extension of the pilot program for an additional one-year period, if the Commission feels that further
study and monitoring of the effects of the pilot program are necessary.



2. Statutory Basis



The proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of section
6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments
to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.
The Exchange believes that the proposed amendments to Rule 109 are consistent with these objectives in that they are
designed to allow stops, in minimum fractional change markets, under limited circumstances that provide for the
possibility of price improvement to customers whose orders are granted stops.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.



III. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-93-47
and should be submitted by April 18, 1994.



IV. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, with section 6(b)(5)
 and section 11(b)
 of the Act. The Commission believes that the amendments to Rule 109 should further the objectives of section 6(b)(5)
and section 11(b) through pilot program procedures designed to allow stops, in minimum fractional change markets,
under limited circumstances that provide the possibility of price improvement to customers whose orders are granted
stops.

In its orders approving the pilot procedures,
 the Commission asked the Amex to study the effects of stopping stock in a minimum fractional change market. Specifically,
the Commission requested information on: (1) The percentage of stopped orders executed at the stop price, versus
the percentage of such orders receiving a better price; (2) whether limit orders on the specialist's book were being
bypassed due to the execution of stopped orders at a better price (and, to this end, the Commission requested that the
Amex conduct a one-day review of all book orders in the ten stocks receiving the greatest number of stops); (3) market
depth, including a comparison of the size of stopped orders to the size of the opposite side of the quote and to any quote
size imbalance, and including an analysis of the ratio of the size of the bid to the size of the offer; and (4) specialist
compliance with the pilot program's procedures.





On March 12, 1993, June 28 and July 1, 1993, and October 15, 1993 and January 5, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the Commission
monitoring reports regarding the amendments to Rule 109. The Commission believes that, although these monitoring
reports provide certain useful information concerning the operation of the pilot program, the Amex must provide
further data, particularly about Rule 109's impact on limit orders on the specialist's book, before the commission
can fairly and comprehensively evaluate the Amex's use of the pilot procedures. To allow such additional information
to be gathered and reviewed, without compromising the benefit that investors might receive under Rule 109, as amended,
the Commission believes that it is reasonable to extend the pilot program until March 21, 1995. During this extension,
the Commission expects the Amex to respond fully to the concerns set forth below.

First, the January monitoring report indicates that approximately three-quarters of orders stopped in minimum
fractional change markets received price improvement. The Commission, therefore, believes that the pilot procedures
provide a benefit to investors by offering the possibility of price improvement to customers whose orders are granted
stops in minimum fractional change markets. According to the latest Amex report, moreover, nearly all stopped orders
were for 2,000 shares or less. In this respect, the amendments to Rule 109 should mainly affect small public customer
orders, which the Commission envisioned could most benefit from professional handling by the specialist. During
the pilot extension, the commission requests that the Amex continue to monitor the percentage of stopped orders that
are for 2,000 shares or less.

Second, the Amex preliminarily believes that, with respect to a significant majority of stops granted under these
amendments to Rule 109, customer limit orders existing on the specialist's book were not disadvantaged.
 This conclusion is based on the Exchange's review of limit orders on the opposite side of the market at the time a stop
was granted pursuant to this pilot program. As part of its one-day review of the ten stocks receiving the greatest number
of stops, the Amex determined how often book orders which might have been entitled to an execution had the order not
been stopped, in fact, were executed at their limit price by the close of the day's trading.
 The Commission does not consider that data to be conclusive given the narrow scope of the Exchange's analysis of the
pilot program's impact.

The Commission historically has been concerned that book orders may get bypassed when stock is stopped, especially
in a minimum fractional change market.
 Based on the Amex's experience to date, the Commission believes that additional data is necessary before the Commission
can determine whether there are sufficient grounds to conclude that this long-standing concern has been alleviated.
Thus to ensure that Rule 109, as amended, will not potentially harm public customers with limit orders on the specialist's
book, the Amex should provide detailed facts supporting its arguments about the impact of its pilot procedures. The
Commission therefore requests that the Amex conduct another review of this issue. At a minimum, the Amex should determine
how often limit orders against which stock is stopped in a minimum fractional change market are executed by the close
of the day's trading.
 Further, the Amex should conduct, on a date to be selected by the Commission, another one-day review of all book orders
in the ten stocks receiving the greatest number of stops, and should submit to the Commission both raw trade data for,
 and a description of the final disposition of,
 each such order.









In terms of market depth, the Amex's January monitoring report suggests that stock tends to be stopped in minimum fractional
change markets where there is a significant disparity (in both absolute and relative terms) between the number of
shares bid for and the number of shares offered.
 That report also suggests that, given the depth of the opposite side of the market, orders affected by the Rule 109 pilot
tend to be relatively small.
 The Amex repeatedly has stated, both to the Commission
 and to its members,
 that specialists can only stop stock in a minimum fractional change market when (1) an imbalance exists on the opposite
side of the market and (2) such imbalance is of sufficient size to suggest the likelihood of price improvement.

The Commission believes that the requirement of a sufficient market imbalance is a critical aspect of the pilot program.
 Such a requirement is necessary to ensure that stops are only granted, in a minimum fractional change market, when
the benefit (

i.e.

, price improvement) to orders being stopped far exceeds the potential of harm to orders on the specialist's book.
 To evaluate how this standard is being applied in practice, the Commission requests that the Amex conduct another
comprehensive quantitative analysis of market depth. In its next monitoring report, the Amex should provide, in
chart form, a comparison of the size of the stopped order to any quote size imbalance.
 The chart also should include the ratio of the size of the bid to the size of the offer.
 The Amex should concentrate an orders for 2,000 shares or less, and should provide the requested information in the
form of an average for all buy orders stopped, and the for all sell orders stopped, in that size range. 







Finally, the Amex report describes its efforts regarding compliance with the pilot procedures. To alleviate confusion
about how to evidence Floor Official approval (which, as noted above, a specialist must obtain to stop any order for
more than 2,000 shares, or a total of more than 5,000 shares for all stopped orders), the Exchange has developed new
manual and automated reports, which serve as a written audit trail for surveillance purposes. As a result, the Commission
believes that the Amex has sufficient means to determine whether a specialist complied with the amendments' order
size and aggregate share thresholds and, if not, whether Floor Official approval was obtained for larger parameters.
The Commission also notes the Amex's on-going effort to keep its specialists properly informed about the pilot program's
requirements. In this context, the Amex has distributed Information Circulars.
 and held continuing educational sessions on the pilot program and its requirements for stopping stock in minimum
fractional change markets. 




During the pilot extension, the Commission requests that the Amex continue to monitor closely specialist compliance
with Rule 109's procedures. As before, the Amex should determine how often orders requiring Floor Official approval
to be stopped do not receive such approval. In so doing, the Amex should distinguish between instances where the specialist
did not ask for permission and those where it was denied (and, if so, on what grounds). The Amex should gather and report
information about the market conditions prevailing at the time of each instance of specialist non-compliance with
these procedures and the action taken by the Exchange in response thereto. 
The Commission requests that the Amex submit a report describing its findings on these matters, specifically: (1)
The effect of Rule 109, as amended, on limit book orders and (2) specialist compliance with the pilot procedures, by
December 31, 1994. In addition, if the Exchange determines to request an extension of the pilot program beyond March
21, 1995, the Commission requests that the Amex also submit a proposed rule change by December 31, 1994. 
The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of the notice of filing thereof. This will permit the pilot program to continue on an uninterrupted basis.
In addition, the procedures the Exchange proposes to continue using are the identical procedures that were published
in the 

Federal Register

 for the full comment period and were approved by the Commission.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Temporary Accelerated Approval to Proposed
Rule Change by Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to an Extension of a Pilot Program for Stopped Orders in Minimum
Variation Markets</DOCTITLE>



March 21, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act;;),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 notice is hereby given that on November 9, 1993, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in
Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On March 16, 1994, the Exchange
submitted Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change to make certain technical corrections to the text of the original
filing.
 The CHX has requested accelerated approval of the proposal. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons.







I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange proposes to extend the pilot program for stopped orders in minimum variation markets for an additional
one (1) year period. The pilot program is currently set forth in interpretation and policy .03 to Rule 37 of Article
XX of the CHX rules. This is the third requested extension of the pilot, originally approved on January 14, 1992.
 The first requested extension of the pilot was approved on March 10, 1993.
 The second requested extension of the pilot was approved on June 11, 1993.
 The pilot program is set to expire on March 21, 1994.







II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




1. Purpose



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to extend the pilot program implemented to establish a procedure regarding
the execution of ``stopped'' market orders in minimum variation markets (usually an 1/8th spread market). In 1992,
the Exchange adopted interpretation and policy .03 to Rule 37 of Article XX, on a pilot basis, to permit stopped market
orders in minimum variation markets.
 Prior to the pilot program, no Exchange rule required specialists to grant stops in minimum variation markets if an
out-of-range execution would result. While the Exchange has a policy regarding the execution of stopped market orders
generally, the Exchange believes it is necessary to establish a separate policy for executing stopped market ordes
when there is a minimum variation market.





The Exchange's general policy regarding the execution of stopped orders is to execute them based on the next primary
market sale. If this policy were used in a minimum variation market, it would cause the anomalous result of requiring
the execution of all pre-existing orders, even if those orders are not otherwise entitled to be filled.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940328-2-00083 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940328-2-00051 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Exchange's proposed policy would prevent unintended results by continuing a pilot program, established in 1992,
for stopped market orders in minimum variation markets.
 Specifically, the pilot program would require the execution of stopped market orders in minimum variation markets
after a transaction takes place on the primary market at the stopped price or worse (higher for buy orders and lower
for sell orders), or after the applicable Exchange share volume is exhausted. In no event would a stopped order be executed
at a price inferior to the stopped price.
 In the Exchange's view, the proposed policy would continue to benefit customers because they might receive a better
price than the stop price, yet it also protects Exchange specialists by eliminating their exposure to executing potentially
large amounts of pre-existing bids or offers when such executions would otherwise not be required under Exchange
rules. 






2. Statutory Basis 



The proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) (5) in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles
of trade. 



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 



The Exchange believes that no burdens will be placed on competition as a result of the proposed rule change. 



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others 



No comments were received. 



III. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the CHX. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-CHX-93-30
and should be submitted by April 18, 1994. 



IV. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change 



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, with section 6(b) (5)
 and Section 11(b)
 of the Act. The Commission believes that proposed interpretation and policy .03 to Rule 37 should further the objectives
of section 6(b) (5) and section 11(b) through pilot program procedures designed to allow stops, in minimum variation
markets, under limited circumstances that offer primary market price protection for customers whose orders are
granted stops, while still adhering to traditional auction market rules of priority and precedence.

In its orders approving the pilot procedures,
 the Commission asked the CHX to study the effects of stopping stock in a minimum variation market. Specifically, the
Commission requested information on (1) the percentage of stopped orders executed at the stop price, versus the percentage
of such orders receiving a better price; (2) whether limit orders on either side of the specialist's book were being
bypassed due to the execution of stopped orders at a better price (and to this end, the Commission requested that the
CHX conduct a one-day review of all book orders in the five stocks receiving the greatest number of stops); and (3) specialist
compliance with the pilot program's procedures.





On March 2, 1993, June 1, 1993, and December 6, 1993, the Exchange submitted to the Commission monitoring reports regarding
its proposed interpretation of Rule 37. The Commission believes that, although these monitoring reports provide
certain useful information concerning the operation of the pilot program, the CHX must provide further data before
the Commission can fairly and comprehensively evaluate the CHX's use of the pilot procedures. To allow such additional
information to be gathered and reviewed, the Commission believes that it is reasonable to extend the pilot program
until March 21, 1995. During this extension, the Commission expects the CHX to respond fully to the concerns set forth
below.

First, the December monitoring report indicates that less than half of orders stopped in minimum variation markets
received price improvement. However, given that the CHX's prior results were substantially higher, the Commission
believes that further study is necessary. The Commission also notes that, under the Exchange's procedures, whether
a stopped order receives price improvement depends largely on price movements in the primary market,
 and not on the effectiveness of the pilot program itself. Thus during the pilot extension, the Commission requests
that the Exchange instead calculate the percentage of stopped orders that do not benefit from the CHX proposal (

i.e.

, orders which receive an out-of-range execution despite having been stopped).
 In addition, the CHX should continue to monitor the percentage of stopped orders which are for 2,000 shares or less.

<PARENT> FR940328-2-00051 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Second, the CHX does not appear to believe that its proposed policy significantly disadvantages customer limit orders
existing on the specialist's book.
 This conclusion is based on the Exchange's review of limit orders on the opposite side of the market at the time a stop
was granted pursuant to the pilot program. As part of its review, the CHX determined how often book orders which might
have been entitled to an execution had the order not been stopped, in fact, were executed at their limit price by the
close of the day's trading. Although the results of that review suggest a few limit orders, potentially, may have been
disadvantaged, that data is not conclusive give the relatively small sample of orders used to analyze the pilot program's
impact.




The Commission historically has been concerned that book orders may get bypassed when stock is stopped, especially
in a minimum variation market.
 Based on the CHX's experience to date, the Commission believe that additional data is necessary before the Commission
can determine whether there are sufficient grounds to conclude that this long-standing concern has been alleviated.
Thus to ensure that Rule 37, as amended, does not result in potential harm to public customers with limit orders on the
specialist's book, the CHX should provide detailed facts supporting its arguments about the impact of its pilot procedures.
The Commission therefore requests that the CHX conduct a more thorough review of this issue. At a minimum, the CHX should
determine how often limit orders against which stock is stopped in a minimum variation market are executed by the close
of the day's trading.
 Further, the CHX should conduct, on a date to be selected by the Commission, another one-day review of all book orders
in the five stocks receiving the greatest number of stops, and should submit to the Commission both raw trade data for,
 and a description of the final disposition of,
 each such order.








In terms of the pilot program's effect on limit orders on the same side of the market as the stopped stock, the CHX report
suggests that a substantial majority of limit orders at the bid (for stopped buy orders) or offer (for stopped sell
orders) with time priority were executed by the close. During the pilot extension, the Commission requests that the
CHX gather and report information on (1) the average number of limit orders and average number of shares on the book
ahead of the stopped stock and (2) how much of that pre-existing volume typically is executed by the close. Moreover,
the CHX should determine how often, as percentage of total stops granted, the pre-existing volume is executed in its
entirety.

Finally, the CHX has responded to the Commission's questions about compliance with the pilot program procedures;
at this time, the Exchange staff is not aware of any market surveillance investigations or customer complaints relating
to the practice of stopping stock in minimum variation markets.
 During the pilot extension, the Commission requests that the CHX continue to monitor closely specialist compliance
with Rule 37's procedures. As before, the CHX report should describe each instance of specialist non-compliance
with these procedures and any action taken by the Exchange in response thereto.





The Commission requests that the CHX submit a report describing its findings on these matters by December 31, 1994.
In addition, if the Exchange determines to request an extension of the pilot program beyond March 21, 1995, the Commission
requests that the CHX also submit a proposed rule change by December 31, 1994.

The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day the date of publication
of the notice of filing thereof. This will permit the pilot program to continue on an uninterrupted basis. In addition,
the procedures the Exchange proposes to continue using are the identical procedures that were published in the 

Federal Register

 for the full comment period and were approved by the Commission.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Temporary Accelerated Approval to Proposed
Rule Change by New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to an Extension of Its Pilot Program for Stopping Stock Under
Amendments to Rule 116.30.</DOCTITLE>





March 21, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on March 14, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change




The proposed rule change consists of extending the pilot for amendments to Rule 116.30 for an additional year until
March 21, 1995.
 The amendments permit a specialist, upon request, to grant a stop in a minimum variation market for any order of 2,000
shares or less, up to a total of 5,000 shares for all stopped orders.





II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose




The practice of ``stopping'' stock by specialists on the Exchange refers to a guarantee by the specialist that an order
the specialist receives will be executed at no worse a price than the contra side price in the market when the specialist
receives the order, with the understanding that the order may in fact receive a better price.


Formerly, Exchange Rule 116.30 permitted a specialist to stop stock only when the quotation spread was at least twice
the minimum variation (i.e., for most stocks, at least a 1/4 point), with the specialist then being required to narrow
the quotation spread by making a bid or offer, as appropriate, on behalf of the order that is being stopped.

For three years, on March 21, 1991, March 16, 1992, and March 22, 1993, the Commission approved, on a one-year pilot
basis each time, amendments to the rule which permit a specialist to stop stock in a minimum variation market (generally
referred to as an ``1/8th point market'').
 The Exchange sought these amendments on the grounds that many orders would receive an improved price if stopping stock
in 1/8th point markets were permitted. The amendments to Rule 116.30 permit a specialist, upon request, to stop individual
orders of 2,000 shares or less, up to an aggregate of 5,000 shares when multiple orders are stopped, in an 1/8th point
market. A specialist may stop an order pursuant to a specified larger order size threshold, or a specified larger aggregate
share threshold, after obtaining Floor Official approval.




On February 12, 1993, the Exchange requested that the Commission grant permanent approval to the amendments to Rule
116.30.
 At that time, the Commission staff requested that the Exchange extend the pilot for an additional year to allow the
Commission more time to consider the Exchange's request to make the amendments to Rule 116.30 permanent. The Commission
staff has again requested that the Exchange extend the pilot for the same reason. Therefore, the Exchange is now proposing
to extend the effectiveness of the amendments to Rule 116.30 for an additional year through March 21, 1995.




2. Statutory Basis


The basis under the Act for the proposed rule change is the requirement under section 6(b)(5) that an Exchange have
rules that are designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to, and perfect the
mechanism of, a free and open market and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The Exchange's
proposal to extend amendments to Rule 116.30 is consistent with these objectives in that it permits the Exchange to
better serve its customers by enabling specialists to execute customer orders at improved prices.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.


III. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NYSE-94-06
and should be submitted by April 18, 1994.


IV. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, with section 6(b)(5)
 and section 11(b)
 of the Act. The Commission believes that the amendments to Rule 116.30 should further the objectives of section 6(b)(5)
and section 11(b) through pilot program procedures designed to allow stops, in minimum variation markets, under
limited circumstances that provide the possibility of price improvement to customers whose orders are granted stops.







In its orders approving the pilot procedures,
 the Commission asked the NYSE to study the effects of stopping stock in a minimum variation market. Specifically,
the Commission requested information on (1) the percentage of stopped orders executed at the stop price, versus the
percentage of such orders receiving a better price; (2) market depth, including a comparison of the size of stopped
orders to the size of the opposite side of the quote and to any quote size imbalance, and including an analysis of the
ratio of the size of the bid to the size of the offer; (3) whether limit orders on the specialist's book were being bypassed
due to the execution of stopped orders at a better price (and, to this end, the Commission requested that the NYSE conduct
a one-day review of all book orders in the ten stocks receiving the greatest number of stops); and (4) specialist compliance
with the pilot program's procedures.




On February 13, 1992, November 5, 1992, and October 15, 1993, the Exchange submitted to the Commission monitoring
reports regarding the amendments to Rule 116.30. The Commission believes that, although these monitoring reports
provide certain useful information concerning the operation of the pilot program, the NYSE must provide further
data, particularly about Rule 116.30's impact on limit orders on the specialist's book, before the Commission can
fairly and comprehensively evaluate the NYSE's use of the pilot procedures. To allow such additional information
to be gathered and reviewed, without compromising the benefit that investors might receive under Rule 116.30, as
amended, the Commission believes that it is reasonable to extend the pilot program until March 21, 1995. During this
extension, the Commission expects the NYSE to respond fully to the concerns set forth below.
First, the October monitoring report indicates that approximately half of eligible orders (i.e., orders for 2,000
shares or less) stopped in minimum variation markets received price improvement. The Commission, therefore, believes
that the pilot procedures provide a benefit to investors by offering the possibility of price improvement to customers
whose orders are granted stops in minimum variation markets. According to the latest NYSE report, moreover, virtually
all stopped orders were for 2,000 shares or less. In this respect, the amendments to Rule 116.30 should mainly affect
small public customer orders, which the Commission envisioned could most benefit from professional handling by
the specialist. During the pilot extension, the Commission requests that the NYSE continue to monitor the percentage
of stopped orders that are for 2,000 shares or less.

Second, in terms of market depth, the NYSE's October monitoring report suggests that stock tends to be stopped in minimum
variation markets where there is a significant disparity (in both absolute and relative terms) between the number
of shares bid for and the number offered.
 That report also suggests that, given the depth of the opposite side of the market, orders affected by the Rule 116.30
pilot tend to be relatively small.
 For a substantial majority of stops granted, the size of the stopped order was less than, or equal to, 25% of the size
of the opposite side quote. Based on such data, the NYSE concludes that the imbalances on the opposite side of the market
from the orders stopped were of sufficient size to suggest the likelihood of price improvement to customers.

<TEXT>
 

The Commission believes that the requirement of a sufficient market imbalance is a critical aspect of the pilot program.
 Such a requirement is necessary to ensure that stops are only granted, in a minimum variation market, when the benefit
(i.e., price improvement) to orders being stopped far exceeds the potential for harm to orders on the specialist's
book.
 To evaluate how this standard is being applied in practice, the Commission requests that the NYSE conduct another
comprehensive quantitative analysis of market depth. In its next monitoring report, the NYSE should provide, in
chart form, a comparison of the size of the stopped order to any quote size imbalance.
 The chart also should include the ratio of the size of the bid to the size of the offer.
 The NYSE should concentrate on orders for 2,000 shares or less, and should provide the requested information in the
form of an average for all buy orders stopped, and then for all sell orders stopped, in that size range.









Third, the NYSE does not believe that the amendments to Rule 116.30 significantly disadvantage customer limit orders
existing on the specialist's book.
 This conclusion is based on the Exchange's review of limit orders against which orders receiving price improvement
were stopped pursuant to this pilot program. As part of its review, the NYSE determined how often such book orders were
executed at their limit price by the close of the day's trading. The Commission does not consider that data to be conclusive,
because it does not reflect the disposition of book orders in those circumstances (approximately half of all stops
granted) where the stopped order did not receive price improvement.

<DOCNO> FR940328-2-00091 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

The Commission has historically been concerned that book orders get bypassed when stock is stopped, especially in
a minimum variation market.
 Based on the NYSE's experience to date, the Commission believes that additional data is necessary before the Commission
can determine whether there are sufficient grounds to conclude that this long-standing concern has been alleviated.
Thus to ensure that Rule 116.30, as amended, does not harm public customers with limit orders on the specialist's book,
the NYSE should provide detailed facts supporting its arguments about the impact of the pilot procedures. The Commission
therefore requests that the NYSE conduct another review of this issue. At a minimum, the NYSE should determine how
often limit orders against which stock is stopped in a minimum variation market are executed by the close of the day's
trading.
 Further, the NYSE should conduct, on a date to be selected by the Commission, another one-day review of all book orders
in the ten stocks receiving the greatest number of stops, and should submit to the Commission both raw trade data for,
 and a description of the final disposition of,
 each such order.








Finally, the NYSE report describes its compliance efforts (

e.g., 

automated surveillance, review of Floor Official records, information memos, continuing education). The Commission
believes that these programs provide specialists with adequate notice of their responsibilities. Similarly, the
Exchange has sufficient means to determine whether a specialist complied with the amendments' order size and aggregate
share thresholds and, if not, whether Floor Official approval was obtained for larger parameters.

During the pilot extension, the Commission requests that the NYSE will continue to monitor closely specialist compliance
with Rule 116.30's procedures. As before, the NYSE should determine how often orders requiring Floor Official approval
to be stopped do not receive such approval. In so doing, the NYSE should distinguished between instances where the
specialist did not ask for permission and those where it was denied (and, if so, on what grounds). The NYSE should gather
and report information about the market conditions prevailing at the time of each instance of specialist non-compliance
with these procedures and the action taken by the Exchange in response thereto.

The Commission requests that the NYSE submit a report describing its findings on these matters, specifically (1)
the effect of Rule 116.30, as amended, on limit book orders and (2) specialist compliance with the pilot program procedures,
by December 31, 1994. In addition, if the Exchange determines to request an extension of the pilot program beyond March
21, 1995, the Commission requests that the NYSE also submit a proposed rule change by December 31, 1994.

The Commission finds food cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of the notice of filing thereof. This will permit the pilot program to continue on an uninterrupted basis.
In addition, the procedures the Exchange proposes to continue using are the identical procedures that were published
in the 

Federal Register 

for the full comment period and were approved by the Commission.






It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-NYSE-94-06) is approved for a one year period ending on March 21,
1995.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

</ACTION>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of application. The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference
Branch.


Applicants' Representations


1. Atlas Assets is an open-end, management investment company organized as a Maryland corporation. Atlas Assets
is organized as a series fund, and currently issues shares in twelve series (the ``Portfolios''). Portfolios that
are money market funds are referred to herein as ``Money Market Portfolios.'' The Adviser serves as the investment
adviser to Atlas Assets. The Distributor serves as the principal underwriter of the shares of Atlas Assets.
2. The Portfolios, other than the Money Market Portfolios, currently offer their shares at net asset value plus a front-end
sales charge. The Money Market Portfolios issue their shares at net asset value without the imposition of a front-end
sales charge. Atlas Assets is subject to a distribution plan pursuant to rule 12b-1 under which each Portfolio
may reimburse the Distributor up to .25% per year of its average daily net assets for actual expenditures made by the
Distributor on behalf of that Portfolio for distribution and shareholder services.
3. Applicants request an order to permit the Funds to issue and sell multiple classes of shares, assess a CDSC on certain
redemptions, and waive the CDSC in certain instances.
4. Under applicants' proposal, the Funds initially may offer shares either: (a) Subject to a conventional front-end
sales load and a rule 12b-1 distribution or service fee at an annual rate of up to .25% of the average daily net assets
(``Class A shares''); or (b) subject to a CDSC (which applicants expect will range from 3% on redemptions made during
the first year following purchase to 1% on redemptions made during the fifth year since purchase), a rule 12b-1
service fee at an annual rate of up to .25%, and a rule 12b-1 distribution fee at an annual rate of up to .75%, of average
daily net assets (``Class B shares''). Existing shares will become Class A shares upon implementation of the proposed
multi-class distribution system. Applicants also may establish one or more additional classes of shares, the terms
of which may differ from the classes of shares described herein only as described in condition 1 below.
5. The CDSC will be imposed on the lesser of the aggregate net asset value of the shares being redeemed either at the time
of purchase or redemption. No CDSC will be imposed on shares acquired more than a fixed number of years prior to the redemptions
or on shares derived from the reinvestment of distributions. No CDSC will be imposed on an amount that represents capital
appreciation.
6. Applicants request the ability to waive or reduce the CDSC in the following instances: (a) Redemptions following
the death or disability of a shareholder within the meaning of section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended
(the ``Code''), if redemption is made within one year of death or disability; (b) redemptions in connection with a
lump-sum or other distribution following retirement or, in the case of an IRA or Keogh Plan or a custodial account pursuant
to section 403(b)(7) of the Code, after attaining age 591/2; and (c) redemptions that result from a tax-free return
of an excess contribution pursuant to section 408(d)(4) or (5) of the Code or from the death or disability of an employee.

7. All or part of the proceeds from a redemption of Class B shares may be reinvested within 30 days of redemption (or such
other time period as a Fund may establish) into Class B shares of any Fund at net asset value. The Distributor will refund
from its own assets the CDSC imposed at the time of redemption by crediting the shareholder's account with additional
shares in an amount equal to the CDSC. Upon any such reinvestment, the amount reinvested will be subject to the same
CDSC to which such amount was subject prior to the redemption.


8. Class B shares of a Fund held for the Class B CDSC period will automatically convert to Class A shares of such Fund at
the relative net asset values of each of the classes. The purpose of the conversion feature is to relieve the Class B
shareholders from remaining subject to the asset-based sales charge for longer than the CDSC period.



9. Each class of shares will be exchangeable only for shares of the same class of other Funds. Applicants only will permit
exchanges into shares of Money Market Portfolios having rule 12b-1 plans if either the time period during which
the shares of the money market funds are held is included with the time period during which the exchanged shares were
held in the calculation of the CDSC, or such time period is not included but the amount of the CDSC is reduced by the amount
of any rule 12b-1 payments made by the money market funds with respect to those shares. Applicants may choose
not to offer an exchange privilege for single class Money Market Portfolios. Applicants will comply with rule 11a-3
as to all exchanges.




10. Class A, Class B, and additional classes of shares created in the future will each represent interests in the same
portfolio of investments, and will be identical in all respects except: (a) Each class of shares would have different
designation; (b) each class of shares might be sold under different sales arrangements (e.g., subject to a front-end
sales load, a CDSC, a front-end sales load and a CDSC, or at net asset value); (c) each class of shares would bear any payments
incurred in connection with a rule 12b-1 plan or non-rule 12b-1 shareholder services plan related to that
class (and any other costs relating to obtaining shareholder approval of the rule 12b-1 plan for that class or
an amendment to its rule 12b-1 plan); (d) each class of shares would bear expenses specifically attributable
to the particular class (``Class Expenses''), as described in the following paragraph; (e) the fact that classes
will vote separately with respect to a Fund's rule 12b-1 plan and/or shareholder services plan, except as provided
in condition 15 below; (f) each class of shares would have different exchange privileges; and (g) each class of shares
might have different conversion features.




11. Class Expenses may include the following: (a) Transfer agency fees as identified by the transfer agent as being
attributable to a specific class; (b) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials
such as shareholder reports, prospectuses and proxies to current shareholders; (c) Blue Sky registration fees incurred
by a class of shares; (d) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (e) the expenses of administrative personnel
and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (f) litigation, tax liens or other legal
expenses relating solely to one class of shares; (g) directors' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one
class of shares; and (h) other expenses that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated
to one class of shares which shall be approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order.




Applicants' Legal Analysis






1. Applicants request an order exempting them from the provisions of sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) of the Act
to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of various classes of shares representing interests in the same Fund
might be deemed: (a) to result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g); (b) prohibited by section
18(f)(1); and (c) to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i).



2. Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement will better enable the Funds to meet the competitive
demands of today's financial services industry. Under the multi-class arrangement, an investor will be able to choose
the method of purchasing shares that is most beneficial given the amount of his or her purchase, the length of time the
investor expects to hold his or her shares, and other relevant circumstances. The proposed arrangement would permit
the Funds to facilitate both the distribution of their securities and provide investors with a broader choice as to
the method of purchasing shares without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs or unnecessary investment
risks.



3. The proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights relating to the rule 12b-1 plans in the manner described
is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. In addition, such arrangements should
not give rise to any conflicts of interest because the rights and privileges of each class of shares are substantially
identical.



4. Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement does not present the concerns that section 18 of
the Act was designed to address. The multi-class arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the shares
of the Fund. The multi-class arrangement does not involve borrowing, nor will it affect the Funds' existing assets
or reserves, and does not involve a complex capital structure. Nothing in the multi-class arrangement suggests that
it will facilitate control by holders of any class of shares.



5. Applicants submit that the requested exemption to permit the Funds to implement the proposed CDSCs is appropriate
in the public interest, and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the Act. The proposed CDSC arrangements will provide shareholders the option of having their full
payment invested for them at the time of their purchase of shares of the Funds with no deduction of an initial sales charge.

Applicants' Conditions



Applications agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:

1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same protrfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in
all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among various classes of shares of the same Fund will
relate solely to: (a) the designation of each class of shares of a Fund; (b) expenses assessed to a class as a result of
a rule 12b-1 plan providing for a distribution fee or a service fee or a shareholder services plan (e.g., Class
B and Class A shares may pay different rule 12b-1 service fees and/or rule 12b-1 distribution fees); (c)
different Class Expenses for each class of shares, which will be limited to: (i) Transfer Agency fees as identified
by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing
and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses and proxies to current shareholders; (iii)
Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares;
(v) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class;
(vi) litigation, tax liens or other legal expenses relating solely to one class of shares; and (vii) directors' fees
incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; (d) the fact that the classes will vote separately with
respect to a Fund's rule 12b-1 plan or shareholder services plan, except as provided in condition 15 below; (e)
different exchange privileges; and (f) the conversion feature applicable to certain classes of shares. Any additional
incremental expenses not specifically identified above that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly
allocated to one class of shares shall not be so allocated until approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order.

2. The directors of each of the Funds, including a majority of the independent directors, shall have approved the multi-class
arrangement, prior to the implementation of the multi-class arrangement by a particular Fund. The minutes of the
meetings of the directors of each of the Funds regarding the deliberations of the directors with respect to the approvals
necessary to implement the multi-class arrangement will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the proposed
multi-class arrangement is in the best interest of both the Fund and their respective shareholders.

3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the directors of the affected Fund, including a majority
of the independent directors. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable
by a Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the directors, and the directors shall review, at least quarterly,
a written report of the amounts so expended and the purpose for which the expenditures were made.

4. On an ongoing basis, the directors of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and
otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes
of shares. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action as is reasonably
necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible for
reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Distributor
at their own expense will remedy the conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment
company.

5. If any class will be subject to a shareholder services plan, the shareholder services plan will be adopted and operated
in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b-1 (b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder
were subject to rule 12b-1, except that shareholders need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b-1.

6. The directors of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder
servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to
time. In the statements, only distribution or shareholder servicing expenditures properly attributable to the
sale of servicing of one class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or shareholder servicing fee charged
to shareholders of that class of shares. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a specific class of shares
will not be presented to the directors to support any fees charged to shareholders of that class of shares. The statements,
including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent
directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.

7. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that Class Expenses and costs
and distribution fees associated with any rule 12b-1 plan and shareholder services plan relating to a particular
class will be borne exclusively by each respective class.

8. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends, and distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of income and expenses among the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'').
The Expert has rendered a report to the applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, stating that the
methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that the calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate
manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the
calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon this review, will render at least annually a report to
the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as
part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of
the Experts with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make, will be available
for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written request for these work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment
Management or of a Regional Office of the SEC, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant,
the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant
Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation'' and
the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness''
as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards
as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.

9. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of income
and expenses among the classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in its initial
report referred to in condition 8 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert,
on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 8 above. The applicants will take
immediate corrective action if the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur in the ongoing reports.

10. The prospectuses of the Funds, if such is the case, will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and
any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different levels
of compensation with respect to one particular class of shares over another class in the Fund.

11. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when shares of a particular class may appropriately be sold
to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to those
standards.

12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the directors
of the Funds with respect to the multi-class arrangement will be set forth in guidelines that will be furnished to the
directors.

13. Each Fund will disclose in its prospectus the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements,
services, fees, sales loads, CDSCs, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus,
regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. Each Fund will disclose the respective
expenses and performance data applicable to each class of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports
will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the
Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class
basis with respect to the classes of shares of the Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes
the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will disclose the expenses and/or performance
data applicable to all classes of shares of such Fund. The information provided by applicants for publication in any
newspaper or similar listing of a Fund's net asset value or public offering price will separately present this information
for each class of shares.

14. Any class of shares with a conversion feature will convert into another class of shares on the basis of the relative
net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion,
the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined
in Article III, section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based
sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion.

15. If a Fund adopts and implements any amendment to its rule 12b-1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts
or implements any amendment of a shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be
borne by the class of shares (``Target Class'') into which the class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase
Class'') will convert under the plan, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target Class shares
unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The directors shall
take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new
class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior
to implementation of the proposal, no later than the date such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target
Class shares. If deemed advisable by the directors to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange
of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class
shares in all material respects except that New Purchase Class shares will convert into New Target Class shares. A
New Target Class or New Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described
in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the directors reasonably believe will not be subject to federal
taxation. In accordance with condition 4 above, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion
of New Target Class shares or New Purchase Class shares will be borne solely by the Adviser and the Distributor. Purchase
Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher
maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to
the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement.

16. Applicants will comply with proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act, Investment Company Act Release No. 16619
(Nov. 2, 1989), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended.

17. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply SEC
approval, authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to
rule 12b-1 plans or shareholder services plans in reliance on the exemptive order.

Cosco, Inc.; Denial of Petition For Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance



Cosco, Inc. (Cosco) of Columbus, Indiana determined that some of its child safety seats failed to comply with the flammability
requirements of 49 CFR 571.213, ``Child Restraint Systems,'' Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 213, and
filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573. Cosco also petitioned to be exempted from the notification
and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 

et seq.

) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety.

Notice of receipt of the petition was published on July 7, 1993, and an opportunity afforded for comment (58 FR 36510).
No comments were received. This notice denies the petition.

Paragraph S5.7 of Standard No. 213 states that ``[e]ach material used in a child restraint system shall conform to
the requirements of S4 of FMVSS No. 302 (571.302).'' Paragraph S4.3(a) of Standard No. 302 states that ``[w]hen tested
in accordance with S5, material described in S4.1 and S4.2 shall not burn, nor transmit a flame front across its surface,
at a rate of more than 4 inches per minute.''

Between November 1, 1989, and March 31, 1993, Cosco produced 133,897 add-on (as opposed to built-in) child restraint
seats, with shoulder harness straps which it has determined do not comply with the flammability requirements of Standard
No. 213. The principal restraining mechanism on the noncompliant seats is a soft-shield harness assembly. The soft-shield
harness assembly consists of a buckle, a soft molded urethane shield, and two straps, protruding to the top of the shield,
which go over the child's shoulders through slots in the back of the child restraint and attach to a metal bar, which
in turn is attached to an adjustment strap. Indications of a possible noncompliance came to light during testing of
the seats by NHTSA at Detroit Testing Laboratory in February 1993, and retesting at U.S. Testing Laboratory. The harness
straps burned at a rate of 4.3 inches per minute. This formed the basis of NHTSA investigation NCI 3269.

Cosco supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the arguments set forth below. Cosco also submitted
photographs of the noncompliant seats, photographs of the tests being conducted on the seats, and test data. These
materials were available for review in the NHTSA docket during the comment period.

The company began its petition by agreeing




generally that requiring child restraints to meet the [FMVSS] 302 standard does further the purpose of the standard
when considering such child restraint components as vinyl or fabric pads or their foam contents. Cosco also concedes
that the applicability of the standard to the harness systems of certain child restraints furthers the purpose of
the standard, such as five-point harness systems which attach to, or pass through, the seating surface of the child
restraint where sources of ignition such as cigarettes or matches could become entrapped.




Cosco's principal argument dealt with the improbability that the restraints would ignite. In support of this, it
submitted that:




[I]t is not physically possible for the harness straps of the soft shield to ignite or burn unless the entire child restraint
or the automobile seat upon which it is installed is already burning.
The configuration and placement of the straps of the Cosco soft-shield assembly are such that these straps cannot
come into contact with an independent source of ignition, such as a cigarette or match, which would result in any burning
of the harness strap.
These are the only two possible causes for the ignition of the shoulder straps of Cosco soft-shield child restraints.
The first is fire already consuming the child restraint and/or the vehicle seat upon which the child restraint is installed
is on fire. It cannot be seriously questioned that, in such an instance, the child would be seriously or fatally burned
from these sources of fire as opposed to the shoulder straps of the child restraint contributing in any degree to the
child's injury. Cosco retained John E. Pless, M.D., Director of Forensic Pathology, Department of Pathology, Indiana
University, School of Medicine, to review this issue. Dr. Pless, one of the leading forensic pathologists in the country
and, through his work with Riley Children's Hospital in Indianapolis, one of the most experienced pediatric pathologists,
concludes that the webbing of the Cosco soft-shield child restraints would have no practical importance on the effects
of such a fire on a child. [Dr. Pless' report and curriculum vitae are in the docket.] Dr. Pless' conclusions are supported
by tests performed by Cosco [photographs of the tests are in the docket.] The tests establish that the webbing does
not ``ignite'' as that term is commonly understood. The webbing burns in a fashion that can be more accurately described
as smoldering and generally extinguishes itself after a brief period of time. It should be noted that the tests * * *
do not reflect any possible ignition of the child restraint harness straps if the child restraint were occupied by
a child. [Cosco believes t]here is simply no way for a source of ignition, such as a lighter, to come into contact with
the strap * * * when the child restraint is occupied by a child.

The other possible source of ignition of the harness strap would be from a localized heat source, such as a match or cigarette.
It is critical in the analysis of whether such a risk exists to examine the configuration and placement of the straps
of the Cosco soft-shield child restraints. [T]hese straps only contact the child who is occupying the child restraint
at the mid-chest level, or higher on the child's body. The straps are essentially vertical as they leave the shield.
Cosco conducted tests attempting to ignite the harness strap with a burning cigarette. [Photographs of this test
are in the docket.] Simply stated, a lighted cigarette cannot ignite the harness strap. Cosco conducted these tests
under controlled conditions which, frankly, seemed inconceivable to occur in the actual use of child restraints.

For example, in order to come into contact, for any length of time, with the child restraint harness strap, a lighted
cigarette would have to be balanced at the point where the strap emerges from the molded shield. This is so unlikely
as to be virtually inconceivable. Dr. Pless also commented on this possibility and indicated that such a localized
heat source is ``not within the realm of practical consideration.'' Cosco believes that any practical examination
of these issues concludes that the risk of the ignition of the harnesses of Cosco soft-shield child restraints could
not, under any conceivable set of circumstances, result in injury or death to the occupant of the child restraint.
The noncompliance of Cosco soft-shield child restraints is therefore inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle
safety as set forth in FMVSS 302.

NHTSA has given careful consideration to this argument, and disagrees with Cosco's assertion that the straps cannot
become ignited. With respect to the photographs Cosco submitted of tests conducted on the straps with a cigarette
lighter, Cosco believes that they show that the strap webbing smolders and then extinguishes itself without igniting.
NHTSA interprets the photographs as illustrating that the straps support a flame which could injure a child restrained
in the child seat.

In issuing Standard No. 302 in 1971 (36 FR 289), the agency cited matches, cigarettes or short circuits in interior
wiring as examples of sources for fires occurring in the interior of vehicles. The agency believes that there are situations
where the straps could become ignited. One example is children in the back seat of a car, playing with matches, a cigarette
lighter, or other ignition source near a child restrained in a Cosco seat.

In point of act, had the tests been conducted under real life circumstances, the results could have been worse. Webbing
samples are tested horizontally, but webbing is worn vertically. If a fire begins at the bottom of webbing, it will
travel upward at a faster rate than it would in a horizontal placement.

NHTSA considered Cosco's argument that, if fire is ``already consuming the child restraint and/or the vehicle seat
upon which the child restraint is installed,'' the child would be injured from these sources as opposed to the shoulder
straps of the restraint. This argument cannot seriously be presented as ground for granting an inconsequentiality
petition. If a vehicle fire is of such intensity that it is destroying a child restraint or vehicle seat that is certified
as complying with Standard No. 302, then it will destroy the shoulder strap as well whether or not it complies. NHTSA
is concerned with fires of less intensity, where it is critical that interior components (the child seat as well as
the components specified in Standard No. 301) do not ignite, or if they do, that they burn at a slow enough rate that there
will be time to remove the child from the occupant compartment.

Cosco also argued that there was no real-world indication of a safety threat. It said that:




Cosco has never received a report of the burning of a soft-shield harness strap. Cosco is unaware of any study that indicates
that the burning of a child restraint harness has caused any injury or death. All occupant protection studies which
Cosco has reviewed indicate an almost infinitesimal risk of injury or death by vehicle fires in total, at least in collisions.
Cosco is unaware of any data on fires of the interior of vehicles unrelated to collisions.





In NHTSA's view, the fact that Cosco has not received any reports is not a sufficient basis on which to grant its petition.
The present lack of such reports does not necessarily diminish the future potential of such incidents. 

NHTSA has, in fact, received a report which may have some relevance in this matter. The complaint was made to the agency's
Auto Safety Hotline on August 30, 1993, reporting the burning of the belt of a Cosco child seat while placed for three
hours in a vehicle parked in sunlight. According to the report, the claimant ``[n]oticed burning fumes and found burn
marks [brownish discoloration] on the harness straps of the child restraint where the straps had been in contact with
the top edge of the restraint's plastic shell as they lay across it.'' This incident raises concern that the burned
fiber of the strap may have weakened the strength of the harness so that it might not provide the needed safety protection
for a child occupant during a crash.

Cosco's final major argument was the owners might not respond to a future campaign of a more serious nature, if they
were notified of one that concerned only a technical noncompliance. It argued:




That child passenger safety advocates, child restraint manufacturers, and the Agency are aware of the negative impact
of recalls resulting from technical noncompliance or defects that do not, as a practical matter, have true safety
consequences. The most important negative effects of such recalls are:

1. That the public, because of the number and frequency of such recalls, pays no attention to recalls that actually
affect, in a practical way, child passenger safety; and 

2. That the public, upon seeing the number of recalls, concludes that child restraints currently available are unsafe
and therefore decline to use them. The Agency is aware and, in fact, has publicly advised consumers to use child restraints
that have defects or noncompliances that have that have resulted in recalls until such child restraints can be corrected.
[An example of this advisement is contained in the docket.] This is in recognition of the fact that technical noncompliances
or relatively insignificant safety defects do not compromise the overall effectiveness of child restraints.




The statement that consumers ignore recalls because of their number and frequency is unsubstantiated. Further,
NHTSA views it equally unlikely that, because of campaigns, consumers would conclude that child restraints are unsafe
and decline to use them. Indeed, the opposite is more likely the case. Responses to safety notifications depend on
factors including the type of noncompliance or defect, the type and extent of the notification campaign, media coverage,
and the efforts of manufacturers.

Future campaigns are more likely to be effective than past ones. Standard No. 213 has been amended to provide for the
registration of child restraints. The purpose of the program is to increase the effectiveness of campaigns to recall
child seats. It requires manufacturers to take steps that will increase their ability to inform owners of particular
child restraints about problems in these restraints and that encourage owners to register their child seats. And
the agency does not agree that the noncompliance is ``technical'' in nature.
NHTSA also notes that the petition failed to acknowledge that the agency tested and retested the harness webbing in
March 1993, and encountered a more serious test failure than the 4.3 inch burn rate presented in the petition and which
reflected NHTSA's original tests. In the second series of tests, NHTSA found burn rate test and retest failures of
5.4 and 5.2 inches respectively. Thus the test and retest failures uncovered by NHTSA average 4.85 inches and 4.75
inches respectively, a margin of failure of 20%, and hardly inconsequential or of a ``technical'' nature in the agency's
opinion.

Finally, NHTSA believes flammability requirements for child restraints should be stringently adhered to for the
following reasons. The test requirement of not more than 4 inches a minute was justified by the need ``to prevent injury
to occupants from rapidly spreading interior fires, to allow sufficient time for the driver to stop the vehicle, and,
if necessary, for occupants to leave it before injury occurs'' (36 FR 10817). This is even more critical in the case
of child restraints as a small child is typically not capable of exiting a vehicle without assistance. Therefore,
some additional time is required for another person to remove the child. Moreover, the child most often is in the rear
seat and the adult is in front, also requiring additional time to reach the child. Finally, because webbing rests against
the child's body, noncompliant webbing has a great potential for injuring the child if ignited.

For the reasons discussed above, the agency has concluded that the petitioner has not met its burden of persuasion
that the noncompliance herein described is inconsequential as it relates to safety, and its petition is denied.

<DOCTITLE>Solectria Corporation; Grant of Petition for Temporary Exemption From Four Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards</DOCTITLE>



Solectria Corporation of Arlington, Massachusetts, petitioned to be exempted from four Federal motor vehicle safety
standards for trucks that it converts to electric power. The basis of the petition was that compliance with the standards
would cause substantial economic hardship.

Notice of receipt of the petition was published on December 23, 1993, and an opportunity afforded for comment (58 FR
68189). This notice grants that petition.

Previously, petitioner received NHTSA Exemption No. 92-2 covering Geo Metro passenger cars that it converts
to electric power, and markets under the name ``Solectria Force.'' As of the date of the latest petition, 45 Solectria
Forces had been sold. Petitioner now intends to convert new Chevrolet S-10 pickup trucks to electric power.
The vehicles to be converted have been certified by their original manufacturer to conform to all applicable Federal
motor vehicle safety standards. However, petitioner determined that the vehicles may not conform with all or part
of four Federal motor vehicle safety standards after their modification. The standards for which exemptions were
requested are discussed below.



1. Standard No. 204, Steering Control Rearward Displacement



The conversion affects the ability to meet paragraph S4.2. According to the petitioner, ``[b]ecause the weight in
the hood is changed, a 30 mile per hour crash test under the conditions of S5 would be needed to determine the steering
wheel's rearward displacement.''



2. Standard No. 208, Occupant Crash Protection



The conversion affects the ability to meet paragraphs S4.2.2 and S4.6.1. According to the petitioner, ``[b]ecause
the Solectria pickup has manual Type 2 seat belts, S4.2.2 requires that the pickup meet the requirements of S4.1.2.3.
S4.6.1 requires that Solectria's pickup meet the frontal crash protection requirements of S5.1.''



3. Standard No. 212, Windshield Mounting

4. Standard No. 219, Windshield Zone Intrusion



According to the petitioner, ``[t]he modifications will affect the requirements'' of each of these two standards.

Exemption was requested from these four standards for a period of three years. the conversion of the vehicle to electric
power results in a net weight increase of 500 pounds which is 17 percent over the weight at which the vehicle was originally
certified. It involves the substitution of electrical propulsion components for the original ones relating to internal
combustion propulsion, and modifications to the heating system and drive shaft. Petitioner stated that ``thirty-mile
per hour barrier crash testing is needed to determine the actual energy absorbing characteristics of the new front
compartment components.''

Petitioner argued that to require immediate compliance would create substantial economic hardship. As of September
30, 1990, the end of its first fiscal year, the company had a net income of $8,186. However, at the end of its second and
third fiscal years, it had net losses, respectively of $87,602 and $106,243. Thus, as of September 30, 1992, it had
cumulative net losses of $185,659. It estimates that the total cost of testing for compliance with the four standards
would be $155,520. If modifications appear indicated, further testing would be required. An exemption would permit
vehicle sales and the generation of cash permitting testing and full certification of compliance while the exemptions
are in effect. It anticipates orders for 25 trucks in its first year of production, 50 units in the second year, and 150
vehicles in the third. A denial of the petition would delay Solectria's production ``for several years and would likely
prevent production altogether.''

According to the petitioner, granting the exemption would be in the public interest and consistent with the National
Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act) because it ``will be able to make a substantive contribution to the nation's
clean transportation needs. ''

No comments were received on the petition.

Petitioner's lifetime financial history through September 30, 1992, indicated a cumulative net loss of almost $186,000.
It is doubtful that the results for the year ending September 30, 1993, which have not been supplied, would materially
improve the picture. According to The New York Times (January 28, 1994, page D4), Solectria's total vehicle production
since its founding is about 60, and it has orders for about 52 vehicles more. It has estimated compliance testing costs
for the four standards to be approximately $155,000. Further costs would be incurred if modifications are indicated.
In the agency's view, the petitioner has demonstrated that immediate compliance would cause it substantial economic
hardship.

Because the host vehicle is certified to be in compliance with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards,
the statutory language requiring a finding that the petitioner has made a good faith effort to comply with the standards
from which exemption is sought must be considered in a different light. Petitioner has evaluated the effect of its
conversion operations upon a certified vehicle, and has determined that its converted vehicle may not conform with
four Federal motor vehicle safety standards. It has further estimated the cost of testing to verify the compliance
status of its vehicles, a sum that approaches in amount its cumulative net losses to date. During the time the exemption
is in effect it states that it will carry through its compliance testing program to achieve full conformance. Under
these circumstances, NHTSA believes that the petitioner is making a good faith effort to comply with the standards.
Finally, though the volume of production would be small, the exempted vehicles would emit zero emissions. Thus, an
exemption would be in the public interest, and consistent with the objectives of the Vehicle Safety Act to promote
alternatives to the internal combustion engine and to relieve on a temporary basis restrictions upon small manufacturers
consistent with safety.

On the basis of the foregoing, it is hereby found that immediate compliance would cause the petitioner substantial
economic hardship, that the petitioner has in good faith attempted to conform with the standards from which exemption
is requested, and that an exemption would be consistent with the public interest and the objectives of the Act. Accordingly,
Solectria Corporation is hereby granted NHTSA Temporary Exemption No. 92-2, expiring February 1, 1997, from
the following standards, or portions thereof, applicable to its Chevrolet S-10 pickup truck conversion: 49
CFR 571.204 Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 204 Steering Column Rearward Displacement; paragraphs S4.2.2 and
S4.6.1 of 49 CFR 571.208 Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208 Occupant Restraint Systems; 49 CFR 571.212 Motor Vehicle
Safety Standard No. 212 Windshield Mounting; and 49 CFR 571.219 Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 219 Windshield
Zone Intrusion.

include benzoic acid and benzaldehyde.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 



Under section 4672(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an 
importer or exporter of any substance may request that the 
Secretary determine whether such substance should be listed 
as a taxable substance. The Secretary shall add such 
substance to the list of taxable substances in section 
4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines that taxable chemicals 
constitute more than 50 percent of the weight, or more than 
50 percent of the value, of the materials used to produce 
such substance. This determination is to be made on the 
basis of the predominant method of production. Notice 89-61, 
1989-1 C.B. 717, sets forth the rules relating to the 
determination process. 



Determination 



On March 16, 1994, the Secretary determined that benzoic 
acid and benzaldehyde should be added to the list of taxable 
substances in section 4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue 
Code, effective July 1, 1993. 

The rate of tax prescribed for benzoic acid, under section 
4671(b)(3), is $3.67 per ton. This is based upon a 
conversion factor for toluene of 0.7545. 

The rate of tax prescribed for benzaldehyde, under section 
4671(b)(3), is $4.22 per ton. This is based upon a 
conversion factor for toluene of 0.8682. 

The petitioner is Kalama Chemical Company, a manufacturer 
and exporter of these substances. No material comments were 
received on these petitions. The following information is 
the basis for the determinations. 



Benzoic Acid 



HTS number: 2916.31.10.05 

CAS number: 65-85-0 




Benzoic acid is derived from the taxable chemical toluene. 
Benzoic acid is a solid produced predominantly by the 
continuous liquid-phase oxidation of toluene, using air as 
the oxygen source, in the presence of a cobalt containing 
catalyst. 

The stoichiometric material consumption formula for 
benzoic acid is:

weight of the materials used in its production. 



Benzaldehyde 



HTS number: 2912.21.00.00 

CAS number: 100-52-7




Benzaldehyde is derived from the taxable chemical toluene. 
Benzaldehyde is a liquid produced predominantly by as a co- 
product of benzoic acid by the continuous liquid-phase 
oxidation of toluene, using air as the oxygen source, in the 
presence of a cobalt containing catalyst.

taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) of the Internal 
Revenue Code, effective January 1, 1993. 

The rate of tax prescribed for diphenylamine, under 
section 4671(b)(3), is $5.11 per ton. This is based upon a 
conversion factor for benzene of 1.010 and a conversion 
factor for nitric acid of 0.835. 

The rate of tax prescribed for aniline, under section 
4671(b)(3), is $4.44 per ton. This is based upon a 
conversion factor for benzene of 0.8780 and a conversion 
factor for nitric acid of 0.7260. 

The petitioner is Aristech Chemical Corporation, a 
manufacturer and exporter of these substances. No material 
comments were received on these petitions. The following 
information is the basis for the determinations. 



Diphenylamine 



HTS number: 2921.44.00.00 

CAS number: 122-39-4




Diphenylamine is derived from the taxable chemicals 
benzene and nitric acid. Diphenylamine is a liquid produced 
predominantly by liquid phase condensation of aniline over an 
acid catalyst. 

The stoichiometric material consumption formula for 
diphenylamine is:




2 C

6

H

6

 (benzene) + 2 HNO

3

 (nitric acid) + 6 H

2

 (hydrogen) __> C

12

H

11

N (diphenylamine) + NH

3

 (ammonia) + 6 H

2

O (water) 




Diphenylamine has been determined to be a taxable 
substance because a review of its stoichiometric material 
consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant 
method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 95.9 
percent by weight of the materials used in its production. 



Aniline 



HTS number: 2921.41.10.00 

CAS number: 62-53-3




Aniline is derived from the taxable chemicals benzene and 
nitric acid. Aniline is a liquid produced predominantly by 
the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene. 

The stoichiometric material consumption formula for 
aniline is:




C

6

H

Aniline has been determined to be a taxable substance 
because a review of its stoichiometric material consumption 
formula shows that, based on the predominant method of 
production, taxable chemicals constitute 95.9 percent by weight of the materials used in its production.

Clearance Request for Government Property



AGENCIES: 

Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of request for a revision to an existing OMB clearance (9000-0075).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501), the Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR) Secretariat has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request to review and approve an extension
of a currently approved information collection requirement concerning Government Property.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Purpose



This is a request for approval of a revision to a previously approved OMB Clearance Number 9000-0075. The reason
for submitting this revision is to allow for a proposed revision to part 45 that, while increasing hours in some respects,
decreases hours in others, accounting for an overall reduction of 585,600 hours.

``Property,'' as used in part 45, means all property, both real and personal. It includes facilities, material, special
tooling, special test equipment, and agency-peculiar property. Government property includes both Government-furnished
property and contractor-acquired property.

Contractors are required to establish and maintain a property system that will control, protect, preserve, and maintain
all Government property because the contractor is responsible and accountable for all Government property under
the provisions of the contract including property located with subcontractors.

The contractor's property control records shall constitute the Government's official property records and shall
be used to:

(a) Provide financial accounts for Government-owned property in the contractor's possession or control;

(b) Identify all Government property (to include a complete, current, auditable record of all transactions);

(c) Locate any item of Government property within a reasonable period of time.

This clearance covers the following requirements:

(a) FAR 45.307-2(b) requires a contractor to notify the contracting officer if it intends to acquire or fabricate
special test equipment.

(b) FAR 45.502-1 requires a contractor to furnish written receipts for Government property.

(c) FAR 45.502-2 requires a contractor to submit a discrepancy report upon receipt of Government property when
overages, shortages, or damages are discovered.

(d) FAR 45.504 requires a contractor to investigate and report all instances of loss, damage, or destruction of Government

(NASA).




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of request for an amendment to an existing OMB clearance (9000-0129).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501), the Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR) Secretariat has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request to approve an amended information
collection requirement concerning Cost Accounting Standards Administration.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A. Purpose



The clause at FAR 52.230-5, Administration of Cost Accounting Standards, requires contractors to send information
to the prime contractor's ACO, who then forwards it to the ACO of the cognizant subcontractor. To eliminate this double
step, the clause will be changed to require the prime contractor to send the information directly to the subcontractor's
ACO with a duplicate copy to the prime contractor's ACO.

<DOCTITLE>OMB Clearance Request for First Article Testing and Approval Waiver</DOCTITLE>




AGENCIES: 

Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of new request for OMB clearance.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501), the Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR) Secretariat has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request to review and approve a new information
collection requirement concerning First Article Testing and Approval Waiver.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




A. Purpose




Under the proposed rule, a new solicitation provision, ``Waiver of First Article Testing Requirements'' is proposed
for addition to the FAR. The solicitation provision will be prescribed at FAR 9.308(a) for inclusion in all solicitations
which contain a requirement for First Article Testing and Approval (FATA), unless it is known at the time of solicitation
that FATA will not be waived. As provided in FAR 9.302, FATA may be required during contract performance to ensure that
the contractor can furnish a product that conforms to all contract requirements. In situations where the contractor
has provided the same or similar items to the Government under a previous contract, the Government may waive the requirement
for FATA. In order to determine that waiver of FATA is appropriate, the offeror is requested, under the subject solicitation
provision, to identify the contract under which the items were previously furnished.

The information is used by contracting officers to determine whether or not FATA requirements can be waived for an
offeror. If the information is not obtained, the contractors and the Government may incur additional expense and
administrative delay by imposing unnecessary testing demands on contractors who have proven their ability to manufacture
the required items.



B. Annual Reporting Burden



Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 6 minutes per response, including
the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,
and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any
other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to General Services
Administration, FAR Secretariat, 18th & F Streets NW., room 4037, Washington, DC 20405, and to the FAR Desk Officer,
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

The annual reporting burden is estimated as follows: Respondents, 3,750; responses per respondent, 20; total annual
responses, 75,000; preparation hours per response, 1; and total response burden hours, 7,500.



C. Annual Recordkeeping Burden



The annual recordkeeping burden is estimated as follows: Recordkeepers, 37,500; hours per recordkeeper, 5; and
total recordkeeping burden hours, 18,750.



Obtaining Copies of Proposals



Requester may obtain copies of OMB applications or justifications from the General Services Administration, FAR
Secretariat (VRS), room 4037, Washington, DC 20405, telephone (202) 501-4755. Please cite OMB clearance request
regarding First Article Testing and Approval Waiver, FAR case 91-105, in all correspondence.

Applicable Regulations: 

(a) The Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) in 34 CFR parts 74, 75, 77, 79, 82, 85, and
86; and (b) the Strengthening Institutions Program Regulations, 34 CFR part 607. 



Supplementary Information:

 On September 16, 1993, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for this program in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 48478). 

It is not the policy of the Department of Education to solicit applications before the publication of final regulations.
However, in this case, it is necessary to solicit applications on the basis of the NPRM, with the modifications described
below, to be able to implement section 314(c) of the HEA. That section requires the Secretary to notify an applicant
by June 30, 1994 of (1) the score given the applicant by a panel of reviewers, (2) the recommendation of the panel with
regard to such application, and (3) the Secretary's reasons for funding or not funding an application, and any modification
in a panel recommendation with regard to an application. 



Anticipated Changes to the NPRM 



Since the publication of the NPRM, Congress enacted the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993, Public Law
103-208. One of those technical amendments revised section 313(b) of the HEA. 

Prior to its amendment, section 313(b) of the HEA provided that ``In awarding grants under this part, the Secretary
shall 
give priority to applicants who are not already receiving a grant under this part.'' The Higher Education Technical
Amendments of 1993 added the following exception to that section: ``Except that a grant made under section 354(a)(1)
shall not be considered a grant under this part.'' (Section 354(a)(1) authorizes the Secretary to fund ``cooperative
arrangement'' grants.) 

In proposed  607.13, the Secretary had provided that an institution could not apply for both an individual development
grant and a cooperative arrangement grant. However, as a result of the amendment to section 313(b), that limitation
has been eliminated and an applicant may apply for both types of grants. In addition, as a result of the amendment to
section 313(b) of the HEA, a recipient of a cooperative arrangement grant does not fall into a lower funding priority,
and  607.20(b) will be amended accordingly. 

The Secretary anticipates making the following two additional changes in the NPRM. If these changes are not ultimately
made, applicants will be given the opportunity to revise their applications as necessary. 

Under the first anticipated change, in  607.11, an applicant must justify its failure to complete activities
funded under a previous grant regardless of whether the applicant is requesting additional grant funds to complete
those activities. In the NPRM, an applicant had to justify its failure to complete funded activities only if it was
requesting additional grant funds to complete those activities. 

Under the second anticipated change, under  607.10, an applicant may choose a ``Dean'' to be a project coordinator
or activity director under a grant and may use grant funds to pay the salary of that individual as long as that ``Dean''
does not report directly to the President of the applicant institution and does not have college-wide administrative
authority and responsibility.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is establishing guidelines on the inclusion of women and minorities and their
subpopulations in research involving human subjects, including clinical trials, supported by the NIH, as required
in the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 NIH Guidelines on the Inclusion of Women and Minorities as Subjects in Clinical Research.



I. Introduction



This document sets forth guidelines on the inclusion of women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations
in clinical research, including clinical trials, supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). For the purposes
of this document, clinical research is defined as NIH-supported biomedical and behavioral research involving human
subjects. These guidelines, implemented in accordance with section 492B of the Public Health Service Act, added
by the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993, Public Law. (Pub.L.) 103-43, supersede and strengthen the previous policies,
NIH/ADAMHA Policy Concerning the Inclusion of Women in Study Populations, and ADAMHA/NIH Policy Concerning the
Inclusion of Minorities in Study Populations, published in the NIH GUIDE FOR GRANTS AND CONTRACTS, 1990.

The 1993 guidelines continue the 1990 guidelines with three major additions. The new policy requires that, in addition
to the continuing inclusion of women and members of minority groups in all NIH-supported biomedical and behavioral
research involving human subjects, the NIH must:

 Ensure that women and members of minorities and their subpopulations are included in all human subject research.

 For Phase III clinical trials, ensure that women and minorities and their subpopulations must be included
such that valid analyses of differences in intervention effect can be accomplished;

 Not allow cost as an acceptable reason for excluding these groups; and,

 Initiate programs and support for outreach efforts to recruit these groups into clinical studies.

Since a primary aim of research is to provide scientific evidence leading to a change in health policy or a standard
of care, it is imperative to determine whether the intervention or therapy being studied affects women or men or members
of minority groups and their subpopulations differently. To this end, the guidelines published here are intended
to ensure that all future NIH-supported biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects will be carried
out in a manner sufficient to elicit information about individuals of both genders and the diverse racial and ethnic
groups and, in the case of clinical trials, to examine differential effects on such groups. Increased attention,
therefore, must be given to gender, race, and ethnicity in earlier stages of research to allow for informed decisions
at the Phase III clinical trial stage.

These guidelines reaffirm NIH's commitment to the fundamental principles of inclusion of women and racial and ethnic
minority groups and their subpopulations in research. This policy should result in a variety of new research opportunities
to address significant gaps in knowledge about health problems that affect women and racial/ethnic minorities and
their subpopulations.

The NIH recognizes that issues will arise with the implementation of these guidelines and thus welcomes comments.
During the first year of implementation, NIH will review the comments, and consider modifications, within the scope
of the statute, to the guidelines.





II. Background



The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993, PL 103-43, signed by President Clinton on June 10, 1993, directs the NIH to
establish guidelines for inclusion of women and minorities in clinical research. This guidance shall include guidelines
regarding_




(A) the circumstances under which the inclusion of women and minorities as subjects in projects of clinical research
is inappropriate * * *;

(B) the manner in which clinical trials are required to be designed and carried out * * *; and 

(C) the operation of outreach programs * * * 492B(d)(1)




The statute states that




In conducting or supporting clinical research for the purposes of this title, the Director of NIH shall * * *
ensure that_

A. women are included as subjects in each project of such research; and

B. members of minority groups are included in such research. 492B(a)(1)




The statute further defines ``clinical research'' to include ``clinical trials'' and states that




In the case of any clinical trial in which women or members of minority groups will be included as subjects, the Director
of NIH shall ensure that the trial is designed and carried out in a manner sufficient to provide for valid analysis of
whether the variables being studied in the trial affect women or members of minority groups, as the case may be, differently
than other subjects in the trial. 492B(C)




Specifically addressing the issue of minority groups, the statute states that




The term ``minority group'' includes subpopulations of minority groups. The Director of NIH shall, through the guidelines
established * * * defines the terms ``minority group'' and ``subpopulation'' for the purposes of
the preceding sentence. 492B(g)(2)




The statute speaks specifically to outreach and states that 




The Director of NIH, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Research of Women's Health and the Director
of the Office of Research on Minority Health, shall conduct or support outreach programs for the recruitment of women
and members of minority groups as subjects in the projects of clinical research. 492B(a)(2)




The statute includes a specific provision pertaining to the cost of clinical research and, in particular clinical
trials.




(A)(i) In the case of a clinical trial, the guidelines shall provide that the costs of such inclusion in the trial is
(sic) not a permissible consideration in determining whether such inclusion is inappropriate. 492B(d)(2)

(ii) In the case of other projects of clinical research, the guidelines shall provide that the costs of such inclusion
in the project is (sic) not a permissible consideration in determining whether such inclusion is inappropriate unless
the data regarding women or members of minority groups, respectively, that would be obtained in such project (in the
event that such inclusion were required) have been or are being obtained through other means that provide data of comparable
quality. 492B(d)(2)




Exclusions to the requirement for inclusion of women and minorities are stated in the statute, as follows:




The requirements established regarding women and members of minority groups shall not apply to the project of clinical
research if the inclusion, as subjects in the project, of women and members of minority groups, respectively_



(1) Is inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects;

(2) Is inappropriate with respect to the purpose of the research; or

(3) Is inappropriate under such other circumstances as the Director of NIH may designate. 492B(b)

(B) In the case of a clinical trial, the guidelines may provide that such inclusion in the trial is not required if there
is substantial scientific data demonstrating that there is no significant difference between_

(i) The effects that the variables to be studied in the trial have on women or members of minority groups, respectively;
and

(ii) The effects that variables have on the individuals who would serve as subjects in the trial in the event that such
inclusion were not required. 492B(d)(2)



III. Policy



A. Research Involving Human Subjects



It is the policy of NIH that women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations must be included in all NIH-supported
biomedical and behavioral research projects involving human subjects, unless a clear and compelling rationale
and justification establishes to the satisfaction of the relevant Institute/Center Director that inclusion is
inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the research. Exclusion under other circumstances
may be made by the Director, NIH, upon the recommendation of a Institute/Center Director based on a compelling rationale
and justification. Cost is not an acceptable reason for exclusion except when the study would duplicate data from
other sources. Women of childbearing potential should not be routinely excluded from participation in clinical
research. All NIH-supported biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects is defined as clinical
research. This policy applies to research subjects of all ages.

The inclusion of women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations must be addressed in developing a research
design appropriate to the scientific objectives of the study. The research plan should describe the composition
of the proposed study population in terms of gender and racial/ethnic group, and provide a rationale for selection
of such subjects. Such a plan should contain a description of the proposed outreach programs for recruiting women
and minorities as participants.



B. Clinical Trials 



Under the statute, when a Phase III clinical trial (see Definitions, Section V-A) is proposed, evidence must
be reviewed to show whether or not clinically important gender or race/ethnicity differences in the intervention
effect are to be expected. This evidence may include, but is not limited to, data derived from prior animal studies,
clinical observations, metabolic studies, genetic studies, pharmacology studies, and observational, natural
history, epidemiology and other relevant studies.

As such, investigators must consider the following when planning a Phase III clinical trial for NIH support.

 If the data from prior studies strongly indicate the existence of significant differences of clinical or public
health importance in intervention effect among subgroups (gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups), the primary
question(s) to be addressed by the proposed Phase III trial and the design of that trial must specifically accommodate
this. For example, if men and women are thought to respond differently to an intervention, then the Phase III trial
must be designed to answer two separate primary questions, one for men and the other for women, with adequate sample
size for each.



 If the data from prior studies strongly support no significant differences of clinical or public health importance
in intervention effect between subgroups, then gender or race/ethnicity will not be required as subject selection
criteria. However, the inclusion of gender or racial/ethnic subgroups is still strongly encouraged. 

 If the data from prior studies neither support strongly nor negate strongly the existence of significant differences
of clinical or public health importance in intervention effect between subgroups, then the Phase III trial will be
required to include sufficient and appropriate entry of gender and racial/ethnic subgroups, so that valid analysis
of the intervention effect in subgroups can be performed. However, the trial will not be required to provide high statistical
power for each subgroup. 

Cost is not an acceptable reason for exclusion of women and minorities from clinical trials. 



C. Funding



NIH funding components will not award any grant, cooperative agreement or contract or support any intramural project
to be conducted or funded in Fiscal Year 1995 and thereafter which does not comply with this policy. For research awards
that are covered by this policy, awardees will report annually on enrollment of women and men, and on the race and ethnicity
of research participants. 



IV. Implementation



A. Date of Implementation



This policy applies to all applications/proposals and intramural projects to be submitted on and after June 1, 1994
(the date of full implementation) seeking Fiscal Year 1995 support. Projects funded prior to June 10, 1993, must still
comply with the 1990 policy and report annually on enrollment of subjects using gender and racial/ethnic categories
as required in the Application for Continuation of a Public Health Service Grant (PHS Form 2590), in contracts and
in intramural projects.



B. Transition Policy



NIH-supported biomedical and behavioral research projects involving human subjects, with the exception of Phase
III clinical trial projects as discussed below, that are awarded between June 10, 1993, the date of enactment, and
September 30, 1994, the end of Fiscal Year 1994, shall be subject to the requirements of the 1990 policy and the annual
reporting requirements on enrollment using gender and racial/ethnic categories. 

For all Phase III clinical trial projects proposed between June 10, 1993 and June 1, 1994, and those awarded between
June 10, 1993 and September 30, 1994, Institute/Center staff will examine the applications/proposals, pending
awards, awards and intramural projects to determine if the study was developed in a manner consistent with the new
guidelines. If it is deemed inconsistent, NIH staff will contact investigators to discuss approaches to accommodate
the new policy. Administrative actions may be needed to accommodate or revise the pending trials. Institutes/Centers
may need to consider initiating a complementary activity to address any gender or minority representation concerns.


The NIH Director will determine whether the Phase III clinical trial being considered during this transition is in
compliance with this policy, whether acceptable modifications have been made, or whether the Institute/Center
will initiate a complementary activity that addresses the gender or minority representation concerns. Pending
awards will not be funded without this determination.



Solicitations issued by the NIH planned for release after the date of publication of the guidelines in the 

Federal Register

 will include the new requirements.



C. Roles and Responsibilities



While this policy applies to all applicants for NIH-supported biomedical and behavioral research involving human
subjects, certain individuals and groups have special roles and responsibilities with regard to the adoption and
implementation of these guidelines.

The NIH staff will provide educational opportunities for the extramural and intramural community concerning this
policy; monitor its implementation during the development, review, award and conduct of research; and manage the
NIH research portfolio to address the policy.



1. Principal Investigators



Principal investigators should assess the theoretical and/or scientific linkages between gender, race/ethnicity,
and their topic of study. Following this assessment, the principal investigator and the applicant institution will
address the policy in each application and proposal, providing the required information on inclusion of women and
minorities and their subpopulations in research projects, and any required justifications for exceptions to the
policy. Depending on the purpose of the study, NIH recognizes that a single study may not include all minority groups.



2. Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)



As the IRBs implement the guidelines, described herein, for the inclusion of women and minorities and their subpopulations,
they must also implement the regulations for the protection of human subjects as described in title 45 CFR part 46,
``Protection of Human Subjects.'' They should take into account the Food and Drug Administration's ``Guidelines
for the Study and Evaluation of Gender Differences in the Clinical Evaluation of Drugs,'' Vol. 58 

Federal Register

 39406.



3. Peer Review Groups



In conducting peer review for scientific and technical merit, appropriately constituted initial review groups
(including study sections), technical evaluation groups, and intramural review panels will be instructed, as follows:

 To evaluate the proposed plan for the inclusion of minorities and both genders for appropriate representation
or to evaluate the proposed justification when representation is limited or absent, 

 To evaluate the proposed exclusion of minorities and women on the basis that a requirement for inclusion is
inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects, 

 To evaluate the proposed exclusion of minorities and women on the basis that a requirement for inclusion is
inappropriate with respect to the purpose of the research,

 To determine whether the design of clinical trials is adequate to measure differences when warranted,

 To evaluate the plans for recruitment/outreach for study, participants, and

 To include these criteria as part of the scientific assessment and assigned score.



4. NIH Advisory Councils



In addition to its current responsibilities for review of projects where the peer review groups have raised questions
about the appropriate inclusion of women and minorities, the Advisory Council/Board of each Institute/Center shall
prepare biennial reports, for inclusion in the overall NIH Director's biennial report, describing the manner in
which the Institute/Center has complied with the provisions of the statute.



5. Institute/Center Directors



Institute/Center Directors and their staff shall determine whether: (a) The research involving human subjects,
(b) the Phase III clinical trials, and (c) the exclusions meet the requirements of the statute and these guidelines.



6. NIH Director



The NIH Director may approve, on a case-by-case basis, the exclusion of projects, as recommended by the Institute/Center
Director, that may be inappropriate to include within the requirements of these guidelines on the basis of circumstances
other than the health of the subjects, the purpose of the research, or costs.





7. Recruitment Outreach by Extramural and Intramural Investigators



Investigators and their staff(s) are urged to develop appropriate and culturally sensitive outreach programs and
activities commensurate with the goals of the study. The objective should be to actively recruit the most diverse
study population consistent with the purposes of the research project. Indeed, the purpose should be to establish
a relationship between the investigator(s) and staff(s) and populations and community(ies) of interest such that
mutual benefit is derived for participants in the study. Investigator(s) and staff(s) should take precautionary
measures to ensure that ethical concerns are clearly noted, such that there is minimal possibility of coercion or
undue influence in the incentives or rewards offered in recruiting into or retaining participants in studies. It
is also the responsibility of the IRBs to address these ethical concerns.

Furthermore, while the statute focuses on recruitment outreach, NIH staff underscore the need to appropriately
retain participants in clinical studies, and thus, the outreach programs and activities should address both recruitment
and retention.

To assist investigators and potential study participants, NIH staff have prepared a notebook, ``NIH Outreach Notebook
On the Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Biomedical and Behavioral Research.'' The notebook addresses both recruitment
and retention of women and minorities in clinical studies, provides relevant references and case studies, and discusses
ethical issues. It is not intended as a definitive text on this subject, but should assist investigators in their consideration
of an appropriate plan for recruiting and retaining participants in clinical studies. The notebook is expected to
be available early in 1994.



8. Educational Outreach by NIH to Inform the Professional Community



NIH staff will present the new guidelines to investigators, IRB members, peer review groups, and Advisory Councils
in a variety of public educational forums.



9. Applicability to Foreign Research Involving Human Subjects



For foreign awards, the NIH policy on inclusion of women in research conducted outside the U.S. is the same as that for
research conducted in the U.S.

However, with regard to the population of the foreign country, the definition of the minority groups may be different
than in the U.S. If there is scientific rationale for examining subpopulation group differences within the foreign
population, investigators should consider designing their studies to accommodate these differences.



V. Definitions





Throughout the section of the statute pertaining to the inclusion of women and minorities, terms are used which require
definition for the purpose of implementing these guidelines. These terms, drawn directly from the statute, are defined
below.



A. Clinical Trial



For the purpose of these guidelines, a ``clinical trial'' is a broadly based prospective Phase III clinical investigation,
usually involving several hundred or more human subjects, for the purpose of evaluating an experimental intervention
in comparison with a standard or control intervention or comparing two or more existing treatments. Often the aim
of such investigation is to provide evidence leading to a scientific basis for consideration of a change in health
policy or standard of care. The definition includes pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic, and behavioral interventions
given for disease prevention, prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy. Community trials and other population-based
intervention trials are also included.



B. Research Involving Human Subjects



All NIH-supported biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects is defined as clinical research
under this policy. Under this policy, the definition of human subjects in title 45 CFR part 46, the Department of Health
and Human Services regulations for the protection of human subjects applies: ``Human subject means a living individual
about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains: (1) Data through intervention
or interaction with the individual, or (2) identifiable private information.'' These regulations specifically
address the protection of human subjects from research risks. It should be noted that there are research areas (Exemptions
1-6) that are exempt from these regulations. However, under these guidelines, NIH-supported biomedical and
behavioral research projects involving human subjects which are exempt from the human subjects regulations should
still address the inclusion of women and minorities in their study design. Therefore, all biomedical and behavioral
research projects involving human subjects will be evaluated for compliance with this policy. 



C. Valid Analysis



The term ``valid analysis'' means an unbiased assessment. Such an assessment will, on average, yield the correct
estimate of the difference in outcomes between two groups of subjects. Valid analysis can and should be conducted
for both small and large studies. A valid analysis does not need to have a high statistical power for detecting a stated
effect. The principal requirements for ensuring a valid analysis of the question of interest are:

 Allocation of study participants of both genders and from different racial/ethnic groups to the intervention
and control groups by an unbiased process such as randomization,

 Unbiased evaluation of the outcome(s) of study participants, and

 Use of unbiased statistical analyses and proper methods of inference to estimate and compare the intervention
effects among the gender and racial/ethnic groups.



D. Significant Difference



For purposes of this policy, a ``significant difference'' is a difference that is of clinical or public health importance,
based on substantial scientific data. This definition differs from the commonly used ``statistically significant
difference,'' which refers to the event that, for a given set of data, the statistical test for a difference between
the effects in two groups achieves statistical significance. Statistical significance depends upon the amount
of information in the data set. With a very large amount of information, one could find a statistically significant,
but clinically small difference that is of very little clinical importance. Conversely, with less information one
could find a large difference of potential importance that is not statistically significant.



E. Racial and Ethnic Categories



1. Minority Groups



A minority group is a readily identifiable subset of the U.S. population which is distinguished by either racial,
ethnic, and/or cultural heritage.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Directive No. 15 defines the minimum standard of basic racial and ethnic
categories, which are used below. NIH has chosen to continue the use of these definitions because they allow comparisons
to many national data bases, especially national health data bases. Therefore, the racial and ethnic categories
described below should be used as basic guidance, cognizant of the distinction based on cultural heritage.





American Indian or Alaskan Native:

 A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North America, and who maintains cultural identification
through tribal affiliation or community recognition.



Asian or Pacific Islander:

 A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, or
the Pacific Islands. This area includes, for example, China, India, Japan, Korea, the Philippine Islands and Samoa.



Black, not of Hispanic Origin:

 A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa.



Hispanic:

 A person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless
of race.



2. Majority Group





White, not of Hispanic Origin:

 A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, North Africa, or the Middle East.

NIH recognizes the diversity of the U.S. population and that changing demographics are reflected in the changing
racial and ethnic composition of the population. The terms ``minority groups'' and ``minority subpopulations''
are meant to be inclusive, rather than exclusive, of differing racial and ethnic categories.



3. Subpopulations



Each minority group contains subpopulations which are delimited by geographic origins, national origins and/or
cultural differences. It is recognized that there are different ways of defining and reporting racial and ethnic
subpopulation data. The subpopulation to which an individual is assigned depends on self-reporting of specific
racial and ethnic origin. Attention to subpopulations also applies to individuals of mixed racial and/or ethnic
parentage. Researchers should be cognizant of the possibility that these racial/ethnic combinations may have biomedical
and/or cultural implications related to the scientific question under study.



F. Outreach Strategies



These are outreach efforts by investigators and their staff(s) to appropriately recruit and retain populations
of interest into research studies. Such efforts should represent a thoughtful and culturally sensitive plan of outreach
and generally include involvement of other individuals and organizations relevant to the populations and communities
of interest, e.g., family, religious organizations, community leaders and informal gatekeepers, and public and
private institutions and organizations. The objective is to establish appropriate lines of communication and cooperation
to build mutual trust and cooperation such that both the study and the participants benefit from such collaboration.



G. Research Portfolio



Each Institute and Center at the NIH has its own research portfolio, i.e., its ``holdings'' in research grants, cooperative
agreements, contracts and intramural studies. The Institute or Center evaluates the research awards in its portfolio
to identify those areas where there are knowledge gaps or which need special attention to advance the science involved.
NIH may consider funding projects to achieve a research portfolio reflecting diverse study populations. With the
implementation of this new policy, there will be a need to ensure that sufficient resources are provided within a program
to allow for data to be developed for a smooth transition from basic research to Phase III clinical trials that meet
the policy requirements.



VI. Discussion_Issues in Scientific Plans and Study Designs



A. Issues in Research Involving Human Subjects





The biomedical and behavioral research process can be viewed as a stepwise process progressing from discovery of
new knowledge through research in the laboratory, research involving animals, research involving human subjects,
validation of interventions through clinical trials, and broad application to improve the health of the public.

All NIH-supported biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects is defined broadly in this guidance
as clinical research. This is broader than the definition provided in the 1990 NIH Guidance and in many program announcements,
requests for applications, and requests for proposals since 1990.

The definition was broadened because of the need to obtain data about minorities and both genders early in the research
process when hypotheses are being formulated, baseline data are being collected, and various measurement instruments
and intervention strategies are being developed. Broad inclusion at these early stages of research provides valuable
information for designing broadly based clinical trials, which are a subset of studies under the broad category of
research studies.

The policy on inclusion of minorities and both genders applies to all NIH-supported biomedical and behavioral research
involving human subjects so that the maximum information may be obtained to understand the implications of the research
findings on the gender or minority group.

Investigators should consider the types of information concerning gender and minority groups which will be required
when designing future Phase III clinical trials, and try to obtain it in their earlier stages of research involving
human subjects. NIH recognizes that the understanding of health problems and conditions of different U.S. populations
may require attention to socioeconomic differences involving occupation, education, and income gradients.



B. Issues in Clinical Trials



The statute requires appropriate representation of subjects of different gender and race/ethnicity in clinical
trials so as to provide the opportunity for detecting major qualitative differences (if they exist) among gender
and racial/ethnic subgroups and to identify more subtle differences that might, if warranted, be explored in further
specifically targeted studies. Other interpretations may not serve as well the health needs of women, minorities,
and all other constituencies.

Preparatory to any Phase III clinical trial, certain data are typically obtained. Such data are necessary for the
design of an appropriate Phase III trial and include observational clinical study data, basic laboratory (i.e. 

in vitro

 and animal) data, and clinical, physiologic, pharmacokinetic, or biochemical data from Phase I and Phase II studies.
Genetic studies, behavioral studies, and observational, natural history, and epidemiological studies may also
contribute data.

It is essential that data be reviewed from prior studies on a diverse population, that is, in subjects of both genders
and from different racial/ethnic groups. These data must be examined to determine if there are significant differences
of clinical or public health importance observed between the subgroups.

While data from prior studies relating to possible differences among intervention effects in different subgroups
must be reviewed, evidence of this nature is likely to be less convincing than that deriving from the subgroup analyses
that can be performed in usual-sized Phase III trials. This is because the evidence from preliminary studies is likely
to be of a more indirect nature (e.g. based on surrogate endpoints), deriving from uncontrolled studies (e.g. non-randomized
Phase II trials), and based on smaller numbers of subjects than in Phase III secondary analyses. For this reason, it
is likely that data from preliminary studies will, in the majority of cases, neither clearly reveal significant differences
of clinical or public health importance between subgroups of patients, nor strongly negate them.



In these cases, Phase III trials should still have appropriate gender and racial/ethnic representation, but they
would not need to have the large sample sizes necessary to provide a high statistical power for detecting differences
in intervention effects among subgroups. Nevertheless, analyses of subgroup effects must be conducted and comparisons
between the subgroups must be made. Depending on the results of these analyses, the results of other relevant research,
and the results of meta-analyses of clinical trials, one might initiate subsequent trials to examine more fully these
subgroup differences.



C. Issues Concerning Appropriate Gender Representation



The ``population at risk'' may refer to only one gender where the disease, disorders, or conditions are gender specific.
In all other cases, there should be approximately equal numbers of both sexes in studies of populations or sub-populations
at risk, unless different proportions are appropriate because of the known prevalance, incidence, morbidity, mortality
rates, or expected intervention effect.



D. Issues Concerning Appropriate Representation of Minority Groups and Subpopulations in All Research Involving
Human Subjects Including Phase III Clinical Trials



While the inclusion of minority subpopulations in research is a complex and challenging issue, it nonetheless provides
the opportunity for researchers to collect data on subpopulations where knowledge gaps exist. Researchers must
consider the inclusion of subpopulations in all stages of research design. In meeting this objective, they should
be aware of concurrent research that addresses specific subpopulations, and consider potential collaborations
which may result in complementary subpopulation data.

At the present time, there are gaps in baseline and other types of data necessary for research involving certain minority
groups and/or subpopulations of minority groups. In these areas, it would be appropriate for researchers to obtain
such data, including baseline data, by studying a single minority group.

It would also be appropriate for researchers to test survey instruments, recruitment procedures, and other methodologies
used in the majority or other population(s) with the objective of assessing their feasibility, applicability, and
cultural competence/relevance to a particular minority group or subpopulation. This testing may provide data on
the validity of the methodologies across groups. Likewise, if an intervention has been tried in the majority population
and not in certain minority groups, it would be appropriate to assess the intervention effect on a single minority
group and compare the effect to that obtained in the majority population. These types of studies will advance scientific
research and assist in closing knowledge gaps.

A complex issue arises over how broad or narrow the division into different subgroups should be, given the purpose
of the research. Division into many racial/ethnic subgroups is tempting in view of the cultural and biological differences
that exist among these groups and the possibility that some of these differences may in fact impact in some way upon
the scientific question. Alternatively, from a practical perspective, a limit has to be placed on the number of such
subgroups that can realistically be studied in detail for each intervention that is researched. The investigator
should clearly address the rationale for inclusion or exclusion of subgroups in terms of the purpose of the research.
Emphasis should be placed upon inclusion of subpopulations in which the disease manifests itself or the intervention
operates in an appreciable different way. Investigators should report the subpopulations included in the study.

An important issue is the appropriate representation of minority groups in research, especially in geographical
locations which may have limited numbers of racial/ethnic population groups available for study. The investigator
must address this issue in terms of the purpose of the research, and other factors, such as the size of the study, relevant
characteristics of the disease, disorder or condition, and the feasibility of making a collaboration or consortium
or other arrangements to include minority groups. A justification is required if there is limited representation.
Peer reviewers and NIH staff will consider the justification in their evaluations of the project.

NIH interprets the statute in a manner that leads to feasible and real improvements in the representativeness of different
racial/ethnic groups in research and places emphasis on research in those subpopulations that are disproportionately
affected by certain diseases or disorders.

Summary



Background



On September 21, 1993, the President signed into law the National and Community Service Trust Act, which created the
Corporation for National and Community Service (the Corporation). The Corporation's mission is to engage Americans
of all ages and backgrounds in service that addresses the nation's education, public safety, health, and environmental
needs to achieve direct and demonstrable results. In doing so, the Corporation will foster civic responsibility,
strengthen the ties that bind us together as a people, and provide educational opportunity for those who make a substantial
commitment to service.

The Corporation is a new government corporation that encompasses the work and staff of two existing independent agencies,
the Commission on National and Community Service and ACTION. The Corporation will fund a new national service initiative
called AmeriCorps. AmeriCorps includes a wide variety of programs operated by grantees (including local non-profits),
the National Civilian Community Corps, and the Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) program. The Corporation
will also support service-learning initiatives for elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher
education called Learn and Serve America, and operate the senior volunteer programs previously operated by ACTION.

The Act authorizes the Corporation to support and improve Summer of Service programs, AmeriCorps grants programs,
and Learn and Serve programs through a variety of training and technical assistance (T/TA) activities. These activities
should build on the AmeriCorps regulations and the ``Principles for High Quality National Service Programs'' document
which lay out the Corporation's vision and expectations for AmeriCorps programs. The regulations and ``Principles''
document should be read by all potential T/TA providers. Copies may be obtained by calling the Corporation at 202-606-4949
or writing the Corporation at 1100 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC, 20525. To receive information on getting the
``Principles'' or regulations on Internet, please send a blank electronic mail message to: cncs@ace.esusda.gov.
There should be no text in the body of the message. An automatic response will be sent back to you with information on
how to retrieve the regulations.



Overview



The Corporation announces the availability of approximately $5.1 million in fiscal year 1994 for training and technical
assistance initiatives. Under each fundable activity, estimated levels of funding are listed. Most grants or cooperative
agreements will be made for a term of one year, unless specified otherwise. The Corporation requests proposals, and,
in some cases, concept papers for the specific activities described herein. This Notice lists applications requiring
full proposals and areas in which concept papers are requested. In most cases, applicants are not required to cover
all of the needs in a given area; for example, an organization can apply to train grantees in fundraising skills only
in the ``Maintaining a Strong Organization'' section.

Concept papers may also be submitted describing activities that meet needs of AmeriCorps or Learn and Serve programs
not described in this Notice. Guidelines are described in the ``Invitation for Original Concept Papers'' section.
In all cases, applicants should demonstrate an understanding of and commitment to the Corporation's mission and
goals, a need that relates to that mission and goals, a sound plan for accomplishing the activity, and a fulfillment
of the selection criteria listed below.


Eligibility 


Public agencies (including federal, state, and local agencies and other units of government), non-profit organizations
(including youth-serving groups, community-based organizations, service organizations, etc.), institutions
of higher education, Indian tribes, and for-profit companies are eligible to apply. State and federal agencies and
non-governmental organizations that intend to operate AmeriCorps or Learn and Serve programs are also eligible.
Organizations may apply to provide T/TA in partnership with organizations seeking other Corporation funds. 

Applications for Continuation of Assistance for Current Technical Assistance Grantees



The former Commission on National and Community Service issued a number of technical assistance grants to organizations
in fiscal years 1992 and 1993. Pursuant to the National and Community Service Trust act of 
1993, the administration of these grants transferred to the 
Corporation for National and Community Service. Existing 
technical assistance grantees interested in the continuation of 
funding or undertaking new technical assistance activities may submit 
competitive applications in accordance with the applicable due 
dates and activities described in this Notice. 


Objectives of the Training and Technical Assistance Activities 


The goal of training and technical assistance is to improve the ability of AmeriCorps 
programs and participants to ``get things done'' by achieving 
direct and demonstrable results in communities, fostering civic 
responsibility, and strengthening the ties that bind communities 
together. To best support programs, the Corporation will fund 
technical assistance that strengthens program performance and 
effectiveness in the short term and builds leadership and 
permanent resources in the long term. Technical assistance must 
be relevant to program needs, responsive to changing needs, and easily 
accessed by states and grantees. Training and technical 
assistance providers will build a strong infrastructure by_
_Increasing the effectiveness and capacity of programs and 
states; 
_Increasing the resources available to support high quality work; and 
_Developing leaders at all levels. 
Training and technical assistance providers will also foster 
a national identity and common understanding of the goals and 
mission of national service among AmeriCorps participants, programs, and states. 
In addition, the Corporation is committed to strengthening 
service nationwide. Although technical assistance providers 
should show preference to AmeriCorps program grantees (except 
where activities pertain to Learn and Serve grantees), T/TA providers may be expected 
to serve those who wish to become grantees as well. (For more on 
this, see ``Requirements'' section below). 
These principles guide the Corporation's technical assistance 
strategy: 
_Treat technical assistance as a full partnership among the 
Corporation, states, and programs, with roles for all in 
designing and delivering technical assistance. 
_Encourage collaboration among partners, especially efforts 
that team service programs and those experienced in working in 
the issue areas. 
_``Train the trainers''_focus on developing resource 
capacity in local areas. 
_Instead of repeating the excellent work of others, build 
on existing training, materials, and expertise. 
_Focus on the most pressing needs to have the greatest 
impact. 
_Invest sufficiently to provide adequate technical 
assistance support in the first years. 


Application Guidelines 


Applications can be of two kinds as specified: full proposals 
and concept papers. While many of the same elements will be 
addressed in these two types of applications, proposals ask 
applicants to give a much more comprehensive and detailed 
overview of planned activities, organizational capacity, budget, 
and workplan than do concept papers. After reviewing concept 
papers, the Corporation may ask for full proposals from a select 
number of applicants based on program need, availability of 
funds, and the strength of concept paper ideas received by the 
Corporation. 
Where specified, a full proposal should be submitted for each activity, unless the proposal thoughtfully combines

activities into a single coordinated initiative. A full 
proposal must include: 
_A cover page listing: the title of the organization 
applying; the amount of funds requested; a brief summary of the 
proposed T/TA program or activity; the name, address, phone 
number, and fax number of the organization; and the name and 
title of a contact person. 
_A narrative of no more than 10 double-spaced typed pages 
in 12-point font, describing_ 
(a) The scope of activity being proposed, e.g., number of trainers 
hired and programs served by them, relative to the amount of the 
grant requested;

(b) the organization's plan and ability to meet compelling 
and ongoing needs, in collaboration with others where possible and appropriate; 
(c) the organization's capacity, including staff strengths 
and backgrounds, resumes of key people, and the organization's 
track record; 
(d) the innovation and replicability of the proposed T/TA 
activity; and 
(e) outcome objectives and indicators to be used to assess success. 
_A detailed budget, including an estimate of travel costs 
for delivery of T/TA services, with a supporting narrative 
explaining how costs are calculated and information on funding 
from other sources. 
_A detailed workplan for accomplishing the specific 
objectives including a timeline showing when each step toward the 
objectives will be accomplished. 
Where specified, a concept paper must include: 
_A cover page listing the title of the organization 
applying; the amount of funds requested; a brief summary of the 
proposed T/TA program or activity; the name, address, phone 
number, and fax number of the organization; and the name and 
title of a contact person. 
_A brief narrative of no more than 5 double-spaced typed 
pages in 12-point font describing proposed T/TA activity. 
_A brief budget, with major expense line items, which may 
include a supporting narrative. 
_A preliminary workplan for accomplishing the specific 
objectives. 
_A preliminary timeline. 


Selection Criteria 


The Corporation will assess applications based on the 
criteria listed below. The percentage weight of each criterion 
in the assessment is given. 


Quality (45%).

 The Corporation will consider the quality of 
the proposed activities, based on_ 
_Scope of proposed T/TA activity relative to the amount of 
the grant requested, the number of people, programs, and/or State 
Commissions proposed T/TA activities are expected to reach; 
_Demonstration that the proposed activities meet clear 
compelling program and/or state needs related to the Corporation's mission and 
goals for national service; 
_Description of proposed T/TA techniques, including 
opportunities for peer exchange and peer training, experiential 
learning, and individual assistance tailored to meet specific 
program or state needs; also description of plans to use tested 
methods or ways to test training activities or curricula on a 
small scale and refine them before offering them on a large 
scale; 
_Plan for implementing mechanisms continually to assess and 
improve value and impact of T/TA services. This may include 
providing opportunities for customer(s) participation in design 
of activity and opportunities for ongoing training and feedback 
from AmeriCorps or Learn and Serve participants and programs, 
community partners of AmeriCorps or Learn and Serve programs, 
State Commissions, Corporation staff, and others; 
_Commitment to build on existing resources and collaborate 
with other technical assistance providers; ability to coordinate 
planning, development, and execution with other providers; efforts to 
prevent duplication of work or inefficient use of resources; and 
ways to establish networks with other T/TA providers to ensure 
coordination among providers and presentation of a clear, 
coherent set of assistance activities to programs, states, and 
the Corporation; and 
_Cost-effectiveness of proposed activity, the degree to 
which the T/TA provider proposes a reasonable estimate of the 
amount of services the organization will be able to provide given 
the requested amount of funds and the organization's existing 
resources. 


Organizational Capacity (45%). 

Applicants should demonstrate 
evidence of either organizational experience and success in 
delivering high-quality technical assistance and training, particularly in the specific area under consideration,
or 
the similar experience of identified staff retained for the T/TA 
project. Backgrounds of key staff, leadership, and other 
individuals proposed to contribute to the proposed program will 
be considered in assessing organizational capacity. 
In some cases, the capacity to begin providing training 
and/or technical assistance quickly will be required. In certain 
instances, noted in the description of applicable activities, 
services will be needed as early as summer 1994. The applicant must demonstrate the 
ability to provide high quality services in the desired time 
frame. 


Innovation and Replicability (10%). 

The Corporation will 
assess the extent to which the T/TA activity, or its elements, 
are creative or distinctive in approach or in the need that is met. 
The Corporation will assess the degree to which the proposed 
T/TA activity could serve as a long-term resource by identifying 
other sources of funding and the extent to which the activity or its elements are applicable or adaptable to various
program 
types, locations, or approaches to service. 
In addition, the Corporation will assess the use of 
innovative technology in providing training or technical 
assistance, where appropriate. This criterion includes use of technology to increase access to 
training and technical assistance activities and convenience for 
users. For example, an information session might be conducted by 
video conference, allowing users to participate from a local 
facility and avoid travel costs. The Corporation expects that all of 
its program grantees will be connected through on-line networks. 
Training and technical assistance providers will be expected to 
be connected to electronic networks as well and should be prepared to use technology and to distribute information
through 
on-line networks when appropriate. 


Requirements 


There are certain requirements that every recipient of a 
T/TA grant or cooperative agreement must fulfill. They include 
the following provisions: 
(a) T/TA providers must work closely with Corporation 
staff and other T/TA providers, especially the ``National Service 
Resource Center'' described in the ``Concept Paper'' section below. 
Providers must be willing to receive input from Corporation staff 
during development and delivery of T/TA activities; periodically 
attend meetings and conferences at the Corporation's request; 
inform other T/TA providers of plans and progress and coordinate 
efforts when appropriate; and work with Corporation staff to 
assess the direction and value of each T/TA activity every 
six months and modify T/TA activity to better serve the users of 
T/TA and adapt to changing needs. 
(b) T/TA grantees must develop and continually apply 
mechanisms for assessing the value and impact of their T/TA 
activities and show evidence of continuous program improvement 
resulting from the application of such mechanisms. 
(c) While the Corporation has a vested interest in 
promoting best practices throughout the field, to grantee and 
potential grantees alike, grantees will be given preference when 
resources are limited. 
(d) Databases or other on-line materials should be 
created in Foxpro or Oracle software. This will allow easy data 
transfer both to the Corporation and among T/TA grantees. Assistance may be available to convert existing databases
to 
Foxpro or Oracle if necessary.

TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES

The Corporation expects to give grants to or enter into 
cooperative agreements with organizations to accomplish the following activities. 


(I) Application by Proposal 


Proposed T/TA activities in this category include: 
(A) Technical Assistance and Training for the National Leadership Corps.
(B) Maintaining a Strong Organization.
(C) National Priority Skills Development Centers.


(A) Technical Assistance and Training for the National Leadership Corps 


_Proposals due May 3, 1994.
_Must be able to deliver services by July 1, 1994.


Summary 


The National Leadership Corps will create a diverse cadre of 
emerging service leaders to help build the highest quality AmeriCorps programs and 
strengthen the national service infrastructure and identity. In 
the first year, the Corporation will recruit up to 50 members 
from programs such as Peace Corps, VISTA, the Armed Forces, youth 
corps, and other full-time service programs. T/TA providers will 
help design and carry out initial training for the Corps which 
will last two to five weeks and begin in mid-July or early 
August, 1994. Providers will also help with ongoing training 
which will occur at least three times during the year. Leadership Corps 
(LC) members will bring skills and expertise to new AmeriCorps 
programs in year-long assignments starting September, 1994. 


Amount and Duration of Funding


The Corporation expects to issue one or more grants or cooperative agreements totaling 
approximately $100,000 to accomplish the tasks listed below. 
Funding would be for one year, with possibility of renewal 
subject to performance, continuing need, and availability of 
funds. 



Description of T/TA Activities Desired


The Corporation seeks T/TA providers who will work with 
Corporation staff and other T/TA providers to design and deliver 
training for the Leadership Corps. 
Proposals may address one or all of the activities outlined 
below, or may suggest additional activities. These include: 
_

Team building 

among Leadership Corps members. Since 
LC members will be placed in separate AmeriCorps programs around 
the country, it is important that members develop strong bonds 
with each other during training so that they are able to provide 
support to each other and share resources, ideas, and lessons 
learned throughout their experience. 
_

Specialty skills. 

This component of training will 
give LC members an understanding of how to organize and carry out 
projects that meet community needs in one or more of the 
Corporation's national priority areas. (The national priorities 
areas are discussed more fully in the ``National Priority Skills 
Development'' section below). This element of training will ensure 
that members know how to make demonstrable impacts on specific 
community problems and bring resources to programs that do not 
already exist. 
_

Leadership skills. 

Training that helps LC members 
master the main tasks required of front-line supervisors such as 
group facilitation, organizing and managing service projects, 
team building, handling conflict, community relations, working 
with diverse peoples and organizations, and others. 
_

Communication skills. 

Training that teaches LC 
members how to communicate effectively, including public speaking 
and media training. 

Proposals should include a plan to train leaders in any or 
all of the activities mentioned above over a 2-5 week period 
during the initial training in July, 1994, as well as 
periodically throughout the year. The Corporation intends to 
involve leaders in curriculum design for ongoing training, so 
applicant plans should be flexible enough to accommodate their 
input. 


Encouraged Approaches


While the Corporation will consider any proposal that accomplishes one or more of the activities listed above, it

especially encourages the following approaches: 
(a) A proposal by an organization that has experience and 
expertise in one or more of the components listed above and can 
arrange to have expert resources and information available 
starting in mid-May to provide assistance to the Corporation in 
designing and delivering training. 
(b) A proposal by a consortium of organizations whose 
members collectively have the expertise to work with the 
Corporation to provide all of the training components listed 
above. This sort of proposal should clearly describe the 
specific responsibilities of each provider, the amount of funds 
to be allocated to each, the amount of staff time devoted by 
each, and the mechanisms for cooperation and coordination among 
members and the Corporation. If possible, the consortium should 
have experts available to work with the Corporation starting in 
mid-May as discussed above. For more information on the leadership pool, please contact Jane Marsh at (202) 606-5000,
extension 173.


(B) Maintaining a Strong Organization: Fundraising, Program Management, Evaluation, Fiscal Administration,
and Grievance Procedures 


_Proposals due May 18, 1994. 
_Preference will be given to organizations which can have the 
majority of services available by August 1994.


Summary 


Strong management, well-planned and well-executed fundraising, evaluation, and careful, 
appropriate administration of funds are critical to the success 
of AmeriCorps programs. The Corporation will fund activities 
that provide information, training, and technical assistance to 
State Commissions and AmeriCorps programs to strengthen the ability of 
programs to manage, fundraise, and leverage community resources, 
design and perform program evaluation, administer funds 
effectively, establish grievance procedures, and perform other 
critical functions. 


Amount and Duration of Funding 


The Corporation expects to make up to five grants or cooperative 
agreements in this area. Together, grants will total 
approximately $1,000,000. Grants will be for one year, with the 
possibility of renewal based on performance, need, and availability of funds. 


Description of T/TA Activity Desired


Specific tasks include but are not limited to providing, 
arranging for, or connecting programs to information, training, 
and technical assistance on the factors involved in establishing and maintaining a strong organization, including:

(a) 

Fundraising

: Building on existing Corporation 
materials, assist grantees in developing comprehensive 
fundraising strategies. Proposals may also describe ways in 
which technical assistance can help organizations put fundraising 
plans into action. The Corporation has an interest, as 
manifested through the match requirement, to encourage grantees 
not to rely solely on Corporation funds, but rather to solicit a 
broad range of financial and in-kind resources from foundations, 
corporations, individuals, and other governmental agencies. As 
the match increases, grantees will need to raise additional 
funds, create more partnerships, build larger constituencies, and 
leverage additional resources. Technical assistance should be 
designed with this mission in mind. 
(b) 

Program Management

: Help programs build a strong 
leadership team as well as feedback mechanisms such as 
participant advisory councils or other vehicles which allow for 
regular input from participants and/or community members and 
involve them in program design, operation, and evaluation. 
(c) 

Evaluation and organizational development

: Help 
programs use evaluation as a tool for program improvement. Aid 
them in developing a mission statement, goals, and annual 
objectives, concrete operating plans, and tailored evaluation 
strategies. As needed, work with Corporation evaluation staff to 
create materials, develop and conduct trainings, and/or offer 
technical assistance to State Commissions and AmeriCorps programs 
related to setting direct and demonstrable objectives and 
performing program monitoring and evaluation functions. 
(d) 

Fiscal Management

: Building on Corporation materials, 
help establish appropriate and effective fiscal management and 
accounting processes, including compliance with all federal laws 
and regulations. 
(e) 

Grievance Procedures

: Help grantees develop grievance 
procedures that give programs systems in which to resolve 
disputes with staff members, program participants, community 
residents, and others. These procedures should comply with the 
requirements for grievance procedures described in the National 
and Community Service Trust Act of 1993. 
In each case, providers are expected to: 
_Bring to bear existing training and subject 
expertise. Efforts will focus on arranging or providing 
assistance, rather than developing new training and resources 
using Corporation funds; 
_Comply with federal requirements for administering 
federal funds. The T/TA provider will work with Corporation staff as needed to develop training on this topic; 
_Demonstrate a commitment to and experience in 
evaluation that examines outcomes and uses its findings as tools 
for redesigning and improving program activities and approaches; and

_Assist Corporation evaluation and T/TA staff in 
providing other training or technical assistance, as requested. 


Encouraged Approaches 


While the Corporation will consider any proposal that 
accomplishes the activities listed above, it encourages the 
following approaches: 
(a) A proposal that includes a partnership among providers 
who together can offer training and technical assistance in the 
areas listed above and who together have a presence across the 
country that enables them to provide training and assistance 
regionally. Such a proposal must clearly describe the 
specific responsibilities of each partner, the amount of funds to 
be allocated to each, the amount of staff time dedicated by each, 
and the mechanisms for cooperation and coordination among 
partners and the Corporation. 
(b) A proposal that includes a partnership of which at 
least one member has experience providing training and technical 
assistance in complying with federal requirements for 
administering federal funds. 




(C) National Priority Skills Development Centers 


_Proposals due June 1, 1994.
_Preference will be given to applicants that can begin 
delivering assistance by August 1994.


Summary 


National Priority Skills Development Centers will help meet the 
short-term, immediate training and technical assistance needs of 
the Corporation, states, and AmeriCorps programs in their efforts 
to make direct and demonstrable impacts in the areas of need the 
Corporation has identified as ``national priorities.'' The Centers 
will provide information and hands-on support, create networks 
and expert groups, and carry out other activities as needed. 
National Priority Skills Development Centers also provide an 
opportunity to begin developing resources to serve the service 
field over the long-run. Based on the lessons learned and 
foundations laid by the Skills Development Centers, grantees may 
begin to develop ``Centers of Excellence.'' Centers of Excellence 
will serve as more permanent resources for the service field and 
as such, will receive a much more significant investment of funds 
from the Corporation. These Centers will be much larger than the 
Skills Development Centers. Over time, they will develop more 
extensive expertise in the practices that make for high-quality, 
effective service programs in various priority area fields. 
At present, funding is only available for the Skills Development 
Centers. The Corporation encourages providers to devote some of 
their resources to developing plans to expand their Skills 
Development Center(s) into more comprehensive and permanent 
Center(s) of Excellence. 


Need 


AmeriCorps programs must achieve direct and demonstrable results 
in the areas of education, public safety, health, human needs, 
and the environment. Programs funded through the AmeriCorps 
direct competition must achieve the results in more specific 
national priority areas. The national priority areas are as 
follows: 
In Education: 
_School Readiness: 

furthering early childhood development. 
_

School Success: 

improving the educational achievement of 
school-age children and adults who lack basic academic skills.
In Public Safety: 
_

Crime Control: 

improving criminal justice services, law 
enforcement, and victim services. 
_

Crime Prevention: 

reducing the incidence of violence.
In Human Needs: 
_

Health: 

providing independent living assistance and home- and community-based health care. 
_

Home: 

rebuilding neighborhoods and helping people who are 
homeless or hungry. 
In Environment: 
_

Neighborhood Environment: 

reducing community environmental 
hazards. 
_

Natural Environment: 

conserving, restoring, and sustaining natural habitats.
The Corporation will fund Skills Development Centers to help 
programs and participants achieve demonstrable results in these 
areas by providing them with training, information, technical 
support, and other resources. T/TA providers will be expected to work 
closely with service programs so that providers' expertise in how 
to make impacts in certain needs areas is complemented by an 
understanding of service programs, regardless of the area of need 
addressed. The ``Principles of High Quality National Service 
Programs'' document mentioned in the Background section more 
extensively describes the Corporation's current thinking in these 
areas. Applicants should have the expertise to expand the 
Corporation's thinking and the ability to help make programs working in each 
area more effective. 


Amount and Duration of Funding


The Corporation will make available approximately $1,500,000 for 
all activities. Up to eight Skills Development Centers may be 
funded to provide the T/TA activities described below. Grants 
will range from $50,000 to approximately $300,000, with most 
awards between $100,000 and $150,000. Up to $25,000 of each 
award can be used in planning for a future ``Center of Excellence'' 
in the priority area addressed. Grants or cooperative agreements 
will be for up to one year, with the possibility of renewal or of 
an award to implement a ``Center of Excellence,'' subject to 
performance, need, and availability of funds. There is no 
guarantee of renewal or implementation award. 


Description of T/TA Activity Desired 


The Corporation will fund Skills Development Centers to help 
programs and participants meet needs in the areas listed below. 
Applicants may propose to provide T/TA in one or more areas. 
Applicants may also combine areas rather than running two distinct 
Centers, for example, as long as the applicant's proposal 
provides an explanation of the manner in which the needs of each 
area can be addressed when combined with others. 
Skills Development Centers will be developed in the 
following areas: 


Crime Control: 

T/TA activities to help programs improve 
criminal justice services, enforcement, and victim services. 


Crime Prevention: 

T/TA activities to help programs and 
participants reduce the incidence of violence. 


Early Childhood Development: 

(including the Corporation's 
School Success priority) T/TA activities to help programs and 
participants further early childhood 
development. 


School Success: 

T/TA activities to help programs and 
participants improve educational achievement. 


Comprehensive Services: 

(including the Corporation's Home 
and Neighborhood Environment priorities) T/TA activities to help 
programs and participants link community resources together to 
provide for disadvantaged residents' basic needs. 


Preventive Health Care: 

T/TA activities to help programs 
and participants successfully carry out health outreach, 
education, and prevention campaigns. 


Independent Living: 

T/TA activities to help programs and 
participants provide independent living assistance and home-based health care.

Natural Environment: 

T/TA activities to help programs and 
participants conserve, restore, and sustain natural habitats. 

In each case, Skills Development Centers are expected to: 

(a) 

Develop and/or maintain a network of geographically 
dispersed expert resource people and organizations around the 
country and maintain a database of these resources. 

Providers should identify expert resources from the specific 
field_organizations and individuals_that the Corporation, 
state commissions, and programs can access when needed. A 
database, developed in Foxpro or Oracle software, with pertinent 
information about these expert resources should be maintained and 
linked to the National Service Resource Center database 
(described below) so that capacity building is ensured. The 
provider should train resource people as needed to make sure that 
they provide useful assistance; receive regular feedback from 
T/TA customer's on resource peoples' performance; and work with 
Resource Center staff to make recommendations on how to ``certify'' 
trainers and other T/TA providers should the Corporation decide 
that this is necessary. The provider should also gather 
information from Corporation staff, state commissions, programs, 
and other T/TA grantees in order to expand the pool of resources 
in the database. 


(b) 

Provide hands-on support to programs using the network 
of expert trainers and other resource people. 

Working with the National Service Resource Center, National 
Service Skills Development Centers should respond to individual 
requests for assistance from the Corporation, state commissions, 
or programs to provide help with project design and 
implementation, specific project improvement issues, or other 
forms of training and technical assistance. Applicants should 
estimate how many person days they expect to devote to this and 
how many people and/or programs they think they have the capacity 
to serve. Whenever possible, T/TA providers should use local 
resource people to carry out these tasks. This way, T/TA efforts 
will help build capacity and relationships on the local level. 

(c) 

Demonstrate an understanding of the central 
characteristics of successful service programs. 

T/TA providers are expected to have expertise in the 
specific fields their T/TA will cover (e.g. crime prevention) so 
that they can help service programs produce direct and 
demonstrable results in those areas. Providers must also 
understand the more generic, common components of successful 
service programs, regardless of what needs service programs 
address. For suggestions on how to gain this knowledge, see 
``Encouraged approaches'' below. Providers will be expected to 
collaborate with other Corporation T/TA providers, particularly 
those working to ``Strengthen the Basics of National Service 
Programs'' (as described in section below). 

(d) 

Gather and provide critical information on at least one 
of the priority areas. 

T/TA providers should identify the most important 
information and resources (including databases) from the specific 
field(s) addressed. This might include training curricula, 
standards of best practice, examples of effective practices in 
service and community work, and in project planning, and 
participant training and support specific to the needs of that 
field. Providers should focus their efforts by gathering the 50 
or so ``best'' resources. The resource materials should be made 
available to the National Service Resource Center and should be 
adapted to meet the needs of Corporation staff, state 
commissions, and AmeriCorps programs where necessary. 
(Reproduction and distribution issues will be negotiated in the 
terms of the grant.) 

(e) 

Convene an expert group. 

With input from the Corporation, regularly convene a 
sounding board of leading individuals from the priority area 
field, the service community, and other areas to develop an 
agenda for T/TA activity in each priority area. 

(f) 

Plan for a ``Center of Excellence.'' 

T/TA providers should lay the groundwork for more 
established future ``Centers of Excellence,'' focusing on 
particular priority areas. Providers are encouraged to develop a 
plan to submit to the Corporation by January, 1995, for a 
potential ``Center of Excellence'' in a specific area. A maximum of 
$25,000 may be expended for this planning activity, and there is 
no guarantee of future funding from the Corporation. 

(g) 

Assist in applicant outreach. 

Providers may be asked to assist the Corporation in reaching 
out to potential AmeriCorps program applicants in the priority 
area(s) addressed. 



Encouraged Approaches 




While the Corporation will consider any proposal that 
accomplishes the activities listed above, it encourages the 
following approaches: 

_Proposals by a small consortium of organizations that 
include at least one organization with expertise in each national 
priority area being addressed, and at least one organization with 
experience in the operation of service programs. Service programs 
will help organizations with issue-area expertise better 
understand issues such as participant recruitment, selection, 
training and preparation, management, and support; and project 
issues including project conception and selection, formation of 
working relationships with service sponsors, orientation of 
service sponsors, and project management and evaluation. 

_Proposals in which the organization(s) providing expertise 
in specific priority area(s) has a partnership with a service 
program or operates a service program, and where it tests project 
models and T/TA models directly in the program as it develops 
them for national use. 

For example, a proposal in the area of school readiness 
might include a national center that does program development and 
assistance in the early childhood area, and which operates its 
own pre-school program. The center would test certain service 
projects in its program, and test training for participants who 
work in the program. These activities would help refine and 
improve the training and technical assistance it offers to 
national service programs funded by the Corporation.

expects to invite likely applicants to submit a detailed proposal by June 30, 1994. 



(A) National Service Resource Center 




_Preference will be given to applicants which can begin 
delivering assistance by August, 1994. 



Summary 




The Corporation seeks to provide a National Service Resource 
Center to compile, store, and retrieve the T/TA resources provided by the 
Corporation and other T/TA providers. Rather than producing 
materials and resources, the resource center will ensure that 
State Commissions and AmeriCorps programs have easy access to the 
T/TA services and resources other T/TA providers produce. 

The Resource Center will develop and manage the following: 

_A 

resource library 

that gathers training curricula, 
effective strategies for program planning and management, and 
other information and materials from Corporation T/TA providers and the service field. The Resource Center will
also develop means of dissemination, 
both in print and through electronic outlets. 

_A 

start-up survey 

of T/TA providers around the nation who can meet needs of 
State Commissions and AmeriCorps programs. This survey should be 
done as quickly as possible, to provide an immediate resource for 
Corporation grantees, and to establish the foundation for the 
long-term project of creating and developing a comprehensive 
database for the directory service. 

_A T/TA 

directory service 

that draws on the start-up survey 
and subsequent database to respond to queries for information 
from state commissions and national service programs in search of 
trainers, consultants, and other resources. On a toll-free 
assistance line, trained information specialist(s) will respond 
to day-to-day questions and inquires from grantees, state 
commissions, and Corporation staff, matching their needs with 
T/TA services whenever possible. The Resource Center will be 
responsible for marketing the directory service to AmeriCorps 
programs and State Commissions in order to make its services as 
accessible as possible and may make the directory service 
database available to them through print and/or electronic means. 

AmeriCorps program grantees will be required to assess the 
T/TA they use and report back to the Corporation program staff 
and the Resource Center with their evaluations. This information 
will inform Resource Center listings and eventually may serve as 
the foundation for a system of consumer-based T/TA service 
provider ratings. The Resource Center will be expected to make 
recommendations to the Corporation on how to certify T/TA 
providers should the Corporation decide that this is necessary. 

Grantee evaluations are especially important in the case of 
T/TA purchased with the up to $5,000 of discretionary T/TA money 
each AmeriCorps program grantee will be allotted. The purpose of 
these funds is to flexibly meet immediate program needs not met 
by other Corporation- or state-funded T/TA services, tap 
grantee-based networks, and help to establish a consumer-driven 
marketplace. The Resource Center, working closely with 
Corporation staff, will be the repository for all grantee 
evaluations of T/TA and will incorporate those evaluations into 
the resource library and directory service. 



Amount and Duration of Funding 




The Corporation will make available one grant totaling 
approximately $500,000. The grant or cooperative agreement will 
be issued for 18 months, with no guarantee of renewal but 
possibility of renewal based on performance, need, and 
availability of funds. 



Requirements 




_The resource library staff must work closely with 
Corporation staff to make sure that the Corporation's own 
internal resource room is kept up to date with important 
materials and other pieces of information. 

_The Commission on National and Community Service, 
predecessor to the Corporation, awarded funds to a consortium of 
organizations led by the National Youth Leadership Council to 
establish a clearinghouse for information and technical 
assistance on service-learning primarily for K-12. To avoid 
duplication of effort and unnecessary costs, will be expected to 
refer interested parties to the Service-Learning Cooperative and 
coordinate other efforts with them whenever possible. 

_Providers must use Foxpro or Oracle software when establishing 
any databases. 



(B) Strengthening the Basics of National Service Programs 




_Preference will be given to applicants who can begin 
delivering assistance August 1994. 



Summary 




The Corporation will fund T/TA activities that help programs 
strengthen the basic components that enable programs to implement 
excellent service projects and engage participants in addressing 
vital community needs. The Corporation hopes that many seasoned service providers will share 
their expertise with others in the service field through these 
activities. 

The Corporation describes many of these components in the 
second half of its ``Principles of High Quality National Service Programs.'' Opportunities to provide technical
assistance 
supporting several of these components_building a strong 
organization, evaluation procedures, and developing fundraising 
expertise_are listed in the ``Maintaining a Strong Organization'' 
section of this Notice. Here, the Corporation encourages potential 
grantees to provide assistance in_

_Designing excellent service projects; 

_Providing a high quality participant experience through 
participant preparation and support; 

_Front-line supervisor training; 

_Training in mediation and conflict resolution; and 

_Creating strong community partnerships. 



Amount and Duration of Funding 



The Corporation expects to make available approximately 
$500,000 total for up to 10 grants or cooperative agreements with 18 month durations. The possibility of renewal is
subject 
to performance, continuing need, and availability of funds.
