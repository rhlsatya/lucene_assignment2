Avocados Grown in South Florida; Revision in Maturity and Reporting Requirements 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would revise maturity requirements in effect on a continuous basis for avocados grown in Florida
by revising the calendar dates in the various shipping schedules for some 60 avocado varieties to be applicable to
any calendar year. This would ensure that only mature fruit is shipped to the fresh market, thereby improving grower
returns and promoting orderly marketing conditions. This proposed rule would also suspend for the next two seasons,
pack-out reports for avocado shipments sold or delivered in Florida by handlers within the regulated area. This proposed
rule would reduce the burden of information collection requirements currently provided for under the marketing
order.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This proposed rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 915 (7 CFR part 915), as amended, regulating
the handling of avocados grown in South Florida, hereinafter referred to as the order. This order is effective under
the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as
the Act.



The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This proposed rule is not
intended to have retroactive effect. This proposed rule would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or
policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.

Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

There are about 65 avocado handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering avocados grown in Florida,
and about 95 avocado producers in South Florida. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business
Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service
firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of the Florida avocado handlers
and producers may be classified as small entities. 


The Avocado Administrative Committee (committee) works with the Department in administering the order, and it meets
prior to and during each season to consider recommendations for modification, suspension, or termination of the
regulatory requirements for Florida avocados. 


The committee met December 8, 1993, and unanimously recommended that the shipping schedules for avocados be revised
and that certain reporting requirements be temporarily suspended. Committee meetings are open to the public and
interested persons may express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews committee recommendations,
information submitted by the committee and other information, and determines whether modification, suspension,
or termination of the regulatory requirements would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 


Maturity requirements for avocados grown in Florida, based on minimum weights, diameters, and skin color, are specified
in  915.322 (7 CFR 915.322), and are in effect on a continuous basis. These maturity requirements specify minimum
weights and diameters for specific shipping periods for some 60 varieties of avocados, and color specifications
for those varieties which turn red or purple when mature. The maturity requirements for the various varieties of avocados
are different, because each variety has different characteristics. The maturity requirements for each avocado
variety are based on maturity test results. 


These maturity requirements are designed to prevent shipments of immature avocados to the fresh market, especially
during the early part of the harvest season for each variety. Providing fresh markets with mature fruit is an important
aspect of creating consumer satisfaction and is in the interest of both producers and consumers. Fresh shipments
of Florida avocados usually begin with light shipments of early varieties in May, and they continue until the following
March or April, with heaviest shipments occurring from July through December. 


This proposed rule would revise the shipping schedules for the avocado varieties specified in Table I of paragraph
(a)(2) of  915.322 (7 CFR 915.322) to synchronize those schedules with any calendar year. The previous schedules
needed to be adjusted to each new year to ensure that dates and weekdays conformed to each new year. The schedules in
Table I are similar to previous calendars, except that the maturity schedules have fixed dates, which become effective
on the Monday nearest the date specified in Table I. The new schedules are expected to conform more closely to the needs
of the industry. This proposed rule also would exempt from maturity requirements, the Hass, Fuerte, Zutano, and Edranol
varieties of avocados, since these varieties of avocados are not commercially grown in the production area in Florida.



The maturity requirements, based on minimum weights, diameters, and skin color, specified in  944.31 (7 CFR
944.31) for imported avocados were indefinitely suspended by a final rule issued May 15, 1991 (56 FR 23009, May 20,
1991). Therefore, this action will not impact imported avocados until the suspension is lifted. However a proposed
rule will be published separately to reinstate the temporarily suspended maturity requirements for avocados imported
into the United States. 


A minimum grade requirement of U.S. No. 2 currently in effect on a continuous basis for avocados grown in Florida under
 915.306 (7 CFR 915.306), and for avocados imported into the United States under  944.28 (7 CFR 944.28)
remains in effect unchanged by this action. 


Florida avocado handlers may ship, exempt from the minimum grade, size, and maturity requirements effective under
the order, up to 55 pounds of avocados during any one day under a minimum quantity provision, and up to 20 pounds of avocados
as gift packs in individually addressed containers. Also, avocados grown in Florida utilized for commercial processing
are not subject to the grade, size, and maturity requirements under the order.

This proposed rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to make the specified changes.
The Department's view is that this action will have a beneficial impact on producers and handlers since it will help
ensure that only mature avocados are shipped to fresh markets. The committee considers that maturity requirements
for Florida grown avocados are necessary to improve grower returns and promote orderly marketing conditions. Although
compliance with these maturity requirements will affect costs to handlers, these costs will be offset by the benefits
of providing the industry and consumers with mature avocados. 
Paragraph (d) of  915.150 (7 CFR 915.150), currently requires that each handler, at the end of the day's operation,
report to the committee the number of containers (1/4 Bushel, 1/2 Bushel, and 4/5 Bushel) of avocados sold and delivered
within the State of Florida. This proposed action would suspend paragraph (d) of  915.150 for the next two seasons,
through March 31, 1996. This would temporarily suspend the requirement that handlers file the ``Avocado Handler
Daily Size Report Form.'' The committee has determined that information needed for operations, marketing policies,
and compliance, could sufficiently be obtained from inspection certificates collected on a daily basis by program
staff, and that information collected on the ``Avocado Handler Daily Size Report Form'' will not be needed for the
next two seasons. Further, Hurricane Andrew reduced avocado production by almost half, and this has reduced assessment
collections, resulting in a need to reduce staff and administration costs. 
The information collection requirements have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB Number 0581-0078. 
This rule would reduce the reporting burden on approximately 65 handlers of avocados who complete the form ``Avocado
Handler Daily Size Report Form,'' taking about 0.083 hour to complete each report. 
Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Fruits; Imported (Avocados); Reinstatement and Revision of Avocado Import Maturity Requirements 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would reinstate, with revision, temporarily suspended maturity requirements based on minimum
sizes (diameters and weights) and skin color for avocados imported into the United States. These maturity requirements
were temporarily suspended to provide the United States Trade Representative (USTR) adequate time to review contemplated
changes in the import requirements. 
This proposed rule would also add an exemption for certain varieties of avocados, and remove the exemption for avocados
grown in the southern hemisphere. This proposed rule would also add exemptions from maturity requirements for avocados
imported for certain uses. This proposed rule is needed so that imported avocados meet the same minimum size and color
maturity requirements as those established for avocados under the Federal marketing order covering Florida avocados,
consistent with section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This proposed rule is issued under section 8e (7 U.S.C. section 608e-1) of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. Section 8e of the Act provides
that whenever specified commodities, including avocados, are regulated under a Federal marketing order, imports
of these commodities into the United States are prohibited unless they meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality,
or maturity requirements as those in effect for domestically produced commodities. The Secretary has determined
that minimum weight and diameter maturity import requirements for avocados imported into the United States should
be the same as such requirements applied to avocados grown in Florida under Marketing Order No. 915 (7 CFR part 915),
hereinafter referred to as the order. 



The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended
to have retroactive effect. This proposed rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies,
unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must
be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. 

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. Import regulations issued
under the Act are based on those established under Federal marketing orders. 

There are about 20 avocado importers who would be subject to the proposed avocado import maturity requirements. Small
agricultural service firms, which include importers, have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13
CFR 121.601) as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. A majority of these importers may be classified
as small entities.

Minimum size (weight and diameter) and skin color maturity requirements for imported avocados in  944.31 (7
CFR 944.31) were continuously in effect for several years prior to their suspension by a final rule issued May 15, 1991
(56 FR 23009, May 20, 1991). The avocado import maturity requirements were temporarily suspended to provide the USTR
adequate time to review contemplated changes in those requirements, as required by section 8e of the Act. Suspension
of the avocado import maturity requirements became necessary when the Florida avocado maturity requirements in
 915.332 (7 CFR 915.332), upon which the avocado import maturity requirements were based, were revised on May
15, 1991 (56 FR 23005, May 20, 1991). This revision was finalized on September 4, 1991 (56 FR 46224, September 11, 1991).
Section 915.332 was most recently amended to make calendar date adjustments in the shipping schedule for several
varieties of Florida avocados on June 29, 1993 (58 FR 34684, June 29, 1993), and that rule was finalized on October 4,
1993 (58 FR 46759, September 3, 1993). 
Prior to suspension, the avocado import maturity requirements were based on minimum weights and diameters applied
to avocados grown in all foreign countries, except for those grown in southern hemisphere countries. Such requirements
were applied to each variety for a specific time period during the first part of the shipping period. The minimum weights
or diameters were not applied to avocados grown in southern hemisphere countries, such as Chile, where practically
all imported southern hemisphere avocados have originated in recent years, because the southern hemisphere's avocado
growing season and various shipping periods differed from those in Florida. The import maturity requirements based
on minimum weights or diameters were applied to avocados grown in northern hemisphere countries, such as those in
the Bahamas and the Dominican Republic, where practically all northern hemisphere imported avocados have originated
in recent years, because their growing season and various shipping periods are similar to those in Florida. 
The avocado import maturity requirements based on skin color for certain varieties of avocados which turn red or purple
when mature were applied to avocados imported from all foreign countries in both the southern and northern hemispheres.
Such requirements applied to all avocados grown in both hemispheres, because all such avocados turn color when mature
regardless of where they were grown. 
This proposed rule would also reinstate the minimum size (weight and diameter) requirements for avocados and the
skin color maturity requirements for avocados imported from all foreign countries by lifting the suspended provisions
of  944.31. However, this proposed rule would exempt the Hass, Fuerte, Zutano, and Edranol varieties of avocados
from such import maturity requirements, because such varieties are not grown in commercial quantities in Florida
and regulated under the Florida avocado maturity requirements in  915.332. 
This proposed rule would obviate the need for exempting avocados imported from the southern hemisphere, since the
major varieties imported from the southern hemisphere are the Hass, Fuerte, Zutano, and Edranol varieties. 
This proposed rule would also add language to  944.31 to cite the minimum size (weight and diameter) and skin
color maturity requirements, and define the term ``diameter''. 
This proposed rule also would exempt imported avocados under  944.31, from minimum weight, diameter, and color
maturity requirements if they are to be used in certain specified outlets. Similar exemptions from grade requirements
established for imported avocados under  944.28 were implemented by an interim final rule published in the


Federal Register

 (58 FR 69182, December 30, 1993), with an effective date of January 1, 1994.

The avocado import maturity regulation (7 CFR 944.31) is based on the maturity requirements in effect for avocados
grown in Florida under the order throughout the year. Under the order, any person may handle avocados without regard
to established grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements provided that such avocados are handled for: (1) Consumption
by charitable institutions; (2) distribution by relief agencies; (3) commercial processing into products; (4)
seed; or (5) individual shipments of up to 55 pounds. Prior to issuance of this rule, the only exemption allowed under
the avocado import regulation was that for individual shipments of up to 55 pounds. Thus, this proposed rule would
add consumption by charitable institutions, distribution by relief agencies, seed, and commercial processing
into products to the list of exemptions allowed under the avocado import regulation. 

To ensure that imported avocados exempt from the maturity requirements are utilized in exempt outlets, this rule
proposes that such avocados be subject to the safeguard procedures for imported fruit established in  944.350
(58 FR 69182, December 30, 1993). 

Under these procedures, an importer wishing to import avocados covered herein for uses in other than regulated commercial
channels, would complete in triplicate, prior to importation, an ``Importer's Exempt Commodity Form.'' One copy
would notify the Marketing Order Administration Branch (MOAB) of the Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, and the second
copy would notify the U.S. Customs Service of the importer's intent to import a commodity under an exemption. The third
copy would accompany the exempt lot to the receiver. 

The form could be obtained from either the inspection or customs offices serving the port of entry. The form could also
be obtained from the MOAB in Washington, DC or from its Marketing Field Offices in Fresno, California; Portland, Oregon;
McAllen, Texas; or Winter Haven, Florida. 

At the time the commodity enters the United States the importer would complete the form; surrender a copy of the completed
form to the U.S. Customs at the time the commodity is offered for importation; and would forward a copy of the completed
form to MOAB within 15 days after completeion of the form. Information called for on the ``Importer's Exempt Commodity
Form'' would include: 

(1) The commodity and the variety (if known) being imported, 

(2) The date and place of inspection, if applicable, 

(3) Identifying marks or numbers on the containers,

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940404-1-00010 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940404-1-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) Identifying numbers on the railroad car, truck or other transportation vehicle transporting product to the receiver,


(5) The name and address of the importer, 

(6) The place and date of entry, 

(7) The quantity imported, 

(8) The name and address of the intended receiver (eg. processor, feeder, charity, or other exempt receiver), 

(9) Intended use of the exempt commodity, 

(10) The U.S. Customs Service entry number and harmonized tariff code number, and 

(11) Such other information as may be necessary to ensure compliance with this regulation. 

For purposes of this regulation, a lot would be considered to be imported when it is released by the Customs Service
for entry into commercial markets or other channels. Lots that are exempt from maturity requirements of the import
regulations would not be subject to the inspection and certification requirements in such regulations. An imported
lot intended for normal commercial channels, or any portion of such a lot, that fails established maturity requirements,
could be disposed of in exempt outlets, as specified in the pertinent avocado import requirements. 

The third copy of the form would accompany the exempt lot to its intended destination. The receiver would certify that
the lot has been received and it will be utilized in an exempt outlet. After the certification is signed by the receiver,
the form would be returned to MOAB by the receiver, within 15 days of receipt of the lot. The information collection
requirements contained in this proposed rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), and have been assigned OMB number
0581-0167. 

In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the USTR has concurred with the issuance of this proposed rule. 

Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

This proposed rule reflects the Department's appraisal of the need to reinstate the suspended avocado import maturity
requirements and make the specified changes in the avocado import maturity requirements, as hereinafter set forth,
in accordance with section 8e of the Act.

Statement of Regulatory Burden



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Farm Credit Administration. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final notice of intent. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) requested comments regarding the appropriateness of the requirements it imposes
on the Farm Credit System. The action was taken to improve the regulatory environment in which the Farm Credit System
operates by targeting areas for more focused study and by revising rules where comments present strong evidence that
an FCA requirement is unjustified. This notice announces that the comment period has closed for the Statement on Regulatory
Burden. In addition, the notice describes the FCA's plans for addressing the comments received. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On June 10, 1993, the FCA Board approved a notice of intent for a Statement on Regulatory Burden seeking public comment
on the appropriateness of the requirements imposed on the Farm Credit System. Comments were sought on the requirements
that duplicate other Governmental requirements, are not effective, or impose a burden that is greater than the benefit
derived. The document appeared in the

 (58 FR 34003) on June 23, 1993, for a 90-day comment period. The comment period was originally scheduled to end on September
21, 1993. However, several comments were received subsequent to that date and will also be considered. 



The FCA received 28 comments (12 comments from 11 associations or groups of associations; 11 comments from 6 Farm Credit
Banks; 3 comments from 3 work groups established by the Farm Credit System President's Planning Committee; 1 comment
from a Bank of Cooperatives; and 1 comment letter from The Farm Credit Council on behalf of its membership). The FCA
is pleased to note that the comments received address a wide variety of issues and contained a number of useful ideas.


A majority of the comments involve regulatory projects that the FCA Board previously identified in the Unified Agenda
of Regulations published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 57276). These ongoing projects are Standards of Conduct, Eligibility and Scope of Financing,
Collateral Evaluation, Borrower Rights, Capitalization, and Financially Related Services, and Disposition of
Records; Federal Records. The FCA work groups already organized to review these issues will consider the comments
received within the scope of these existing regulatory projects. An analysis and appropriate response to these comments
will be included as part of the regulatory action published in the 

Federal Register

. The remaining issues resulting from the Statement on Regulatory Burden that were not included in the Unified Agenda
of Regulations include the following: Organization; Loan Policies and Operations; Bank for Cooperatives Financing
International Trade; Funding; Disclosure; Accounting and Reporting; Examination Issues; and Miscellaneous Issues
such as releasing information. Additional work groups have been established to analyze the comments and make recommendations
to the FCA Board regarding action on the suggestions. The public will be notified of the FCA Board's decisions in an
appropriate manner.

SW., Washington, DC 20591, or by calling (202) 267-3485. Communications must identify the notice number of
this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory
Circular No. 11-2A, which describes the application procedure. 




The Proposal




The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify Class E
airspace areas; specifically Class E4 (Class E airspace areas consisting of airspace extending upward from the surface
designated as an extension to a Class D surface area) at Rapid City, SD to modify the legal description to include the
statement ``excluding that airspace within the Rapid City, SD, Class D Airspace area.'' The intended affect of this
action is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures in instrument conditions from
other aircraft operating in visual weather conditions, and to establish Class E airspace to contain instrument procedures
in areas outside the Class D surface area. Aeronautical maps and charts would reflect the defined area which would
enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in order to comply with applicable visual flight rules requirements. 


The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which 



 is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this
document would be published subsequently in the Order. 




The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposed rule would amend the Helena, Montana, Class D airspace. This action is necessary to correct an error
in the airspace description inadvertently omitted during the airspace reclassification process. This action would
amend the Helena, Montana, Class D airspace from full-time back to part-time. Airspace reclassification, in effect
as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and, for control zones with
operating control towers, replaced it with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' This amendment would bring publications
up-to-date giving continuous information to the aviation public.

The Proposal



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend Class D airspace
at Helena, Montana, to correct an error in the Class D airspace description. During the airspace reclassification
process, the language designating the Class D airspace as part-time was inadvertently omitted. This action would
correct that error. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the
term ``airport traffic area'' and, for control zones with operating control towers, replaced it with the designation
``Class D airspace.'' The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace
is published in Paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is
incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this
document would be published subsequently in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Proposal



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class
D airspace for Tri-Cities Airport, Pasco, WA by excluding additional airspace overlying the Vista Field Airport.
Recent construction at the airport has resulted in closure of the east-west runway, requiring aircraft operating
to runway 02/20 to fly over the Columbia River outside the present airspace exclusion. Additional excluded airspace
will not adversely impact the Tri-Cities airport. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American
Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published in Paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and
effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class
D airspace listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Proposal 
 


The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Sandpoint, Idaho, to accommodate arrival/departure aircraft transitioning between the enroute and
terminal area in western Idaho. The area would be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference. The coordinates
for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas are published in Paragraph 6006
of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14
CFR 71.1(58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently
in the order. 
 
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Proposal


The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend Class E airspace
at La Grande, Oregon to accommodate arrival/departure aircraft transitioning between the en route and terminal
areas in southeastern Oregon. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the
use of the term ``transition area,'' and airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth
is now Class E airspace. The area would be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference. The coordinates for
this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or
more above the surface of the earth are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace
designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is
not a `'significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Program To Encourage Public and Community Service Employment



<AGENCY>

Department of Defense.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Currently, separating Military Service members and their spouses, and Department of Defense (DoD) civilian employees,
have the option to register for potential employment opportunities with employers in the private sector through
the Defense Outplacement Referral System. This program was implemented by DoD Directive 1332.35, ``Transition
Assistance For Military Personnel,'' (32 CFR part 88).




The proposed rule would establish guidelines for the registration of public and community service organizations
and a listing of separating DoD personnel and their spouses to be maintained by the DoD. The purpose of the public and
community service organizational registry is to provide an avenue for public and community service organizations
to recruit highly skilled and experienced separating DoD personnel and their spouses. The proposed rule is required
to implement the encouragement of continuing public and community service for separating Military Service members,
as well as to implement the temporary early retirement authority as established in the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (hereinafter, ``the Act''). This registry would be maintained indefinitely to encourage
separating Service members to enter into public and community service job vacancies, such as in education, conservation,
environmental protection, law enforcement, and public health care after separation from active duty. This action
is intended to provide the necessary interim guidelines to determine how separating Military Service members, DoD
civilian personnel leaving the Government, and their spouses register for public and community service employment,
which organizations qualify for registration, and procedures qualifying organizations must take to be placed on
the registry. A final rule will be issued after a thorough review of all comments is completed.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Objective


This proposed rule addresses the issue of which public and community service organizations qualify for a registry
required by section 4462, Public Law 102-484, 106 Stat. 2738 (10 U.S.C. 1143a(c)). The proposed rule resolves
the issue by using the definition for ``public and community service organization'' provided by the Act together
with input from congressional staff and representatives of federal and nonprofit agencies. The guidelines in 26
U.S.C. 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) for nonprofit organizations are incorporated by reference and are limited to private
nonproft organizations.



Consultation



Section 4462, Public Law 102-484, Stat. (10 U.S.C. 1143a(e)) required that DoD consult closely with the Secretary
of Labor, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Education, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management,
appropriate representatives of State and local governments, and appropriate representatives of business and nonprofit
organizations in the private sector. DoD has consulted with those Federal agencies. DoD obtained additional advice
from representatives of the Departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, the
Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of National Service, the Commission on National and Community Service,
and the Points of Light Foundation.This invitation to the public to comment on this proposed rule is intended to satisfy
the requirement of consulting with appropriate representatives of State and local governments, and appropriate
representatives of business and nonprofit organizations in the private sector.

It has been certified that this proposed rule, if issued, would not be a significant rule. The rule would: (a) Not have
an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a section of
the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities;

(b) Not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

(c) Not materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and
obligations of recipients thereof; or,

(d) Not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866.

(e) Not become subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601) because it is not likely to have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The primary effect on grantees administering the proposed
rule will be a reduction in administrative costs and other burdens resulting from the simplification and clarification
of certain policies and the elimination of policy differences among the federal agencies promulgating this final
rule.

(f) Impose a reporting requirement under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3250). The Office
of Management and Budget approved the reporting requirement and assigned control number 0704-0324.

Applicability and scope.



This part applies to: (a) The Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Military Departments, the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, the Unified Combatant Commands, and the Defense Agencies (hereafter referred to collectively as
``the DoD Components''). The term ``Military Services,'' as used herein, refers to the Army, the Navy, the Air Force,
and the Marine Corps.

(b) All active duty Service members and former members under section 4462 of Public Law 102-484 and section 561
of Public Law 103-160, and DoD civilian personnel leaving the Government, and their spouses.



 77.3 

Definitions.



(a) 

Community service employment.

 Work in nonprofit organizations that provide or coordinate services listed in paragraphs (d) (1) through (12) of
this section. ``Nonprofit'' is defined as having been recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as having a tax-exempt
status under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4). These organizations shall not be administered by businesses organized
for profit, labor unions, partisan political organizations, or organizations engaged in religious activities,
unless such activities are unrelated to religious instructions, worship services, or any form of proselytization.

(b)

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; 
Texas; Revision to the 
State Implementation Plan (SIP) 
Addressing Carbon Monoxide (CO) for El Paso 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action proposes to approve a revision to the Texas SIP addressing CO for El Paso. Certain elements of the complete
El Paso CO SIP were submitted by the Governor of Texas to the EPA in order to meet the November 15, 1992, deadline for the
purpose of bringing about the attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for CO. These elements
satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area CO SIP for El Paso. Therefore, this 

Federal Register

 (FR) action only proposes approval of some of the elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP, specifically the 1990 base
year CO emissions inventory and the oxygenated fuels program. 



The remaining elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP, to be submitted to the EPA by November 15, 1993, have been or will
be acted upon in separate FR actions. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A segment of El Paso, Texas, was designated nonattainment for CO and classified as moderate with a design value below

12.7 parts per million (ppm.) (specifically 12.6), under 
sections 107(d)(4)(A) and 186(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA)
of 1990.

1

 Please reference 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 13498 and 13529 (April 16, 1992). 





The air quality planning requirements for moderate CO nonattainment areas with a design value less than or equal to
12.7 ppm. are set out in subparts one and three of part D, 
Title I of the CAA. Subpart one contains provisions generally applicable to CO nonattainment areas, and subpart three
contains provisions specifically applicable to CO nonattainment areas. Section 104 of the CAAA of 1990 amended part
D of Title I of the CAA by adding two additional sections to subpart three 
(sections 186 and 187), which pertain to the classification of CO nonattainment areas and to the submission requirements
of the SIPs for these areas, respectively. At times, subparts one and three overlap or conflict. The EPA has attempted
to clarify 
the relationship among these various provisions in the 
General Preamble and, as appropriate, in this FR action.

The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing the EPA's preliminary views on how the EPA intends to review SIPs
and SIP revisions submitted under Title I of the CAA, including those State submittals containing moderate CO nonattainment
area SIP requirements. See generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992). Because the EPA is
describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more
detailed discussion of the interpretations of Title I advanced in this action and the supporting rationale. In this
proposed rulemaking action on certain elements of the El Paso, Texas, complete moderate CO SIP, the EPA is applying
its interpretations, taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented.

On October 23, 1992, the Governor of Texas submitted to the EPA a SIP revision for CO concerning El Paso, which included
the general SIP revision and the oxygenated fuels regulations. The State also submitted to the EPA a completed emissions
inventory on November 17, 1992, and a commitment to upgrade the existing I/M Program on November 15, 1992. These elements
were intended to satisfy the CAA CO SIP requirements due on November 15, 1992. The required items for the El Paso CO SIP,
due November 15, 1992, unless otherwise noted, specifically include: (1) A comprehensive, accurate, and current
inventory of actual emissions from all sources of CO in the nonattainment area (sections 172(c)(3) and 187(a)(1)
of the CAA); (2) no later than September 30, 1995, and no later than the end of each three year period thereafter, until
the area is redesignated to attainment, a revised inventory meeting the requirements of sections 187(a)(1) and 187(a)(5)
of the CAA; (3) a permit program to be submitted by November 15, 1993, which meets the requirements of section 173 for
the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of CO (section 172(c)(5)); (4) contingency
measures due November 15, 1993, that are to be implemented if the EPA determines that the area has failed to attain the
primary standards by the applicable date (section 172(c)(9)); (5) a commitment to upgrade the current I/M program
and submit a SIP revision for the I/M program by November 15, 1993, (section 187(a)(4)); and (6) an oxygenated fuels
program (section 211(m)). As outlined below, the State of Texas' CO SIP revision concerning El Paso, a moderate CO
nonattainment area, was reviewed against the applicable requirements. The reader is referred to the El Paso CO SIP
submittal and the EPA's supporting technical information, Technical Support Document (TSD), for pertinent details
regarding each requirement. The TSD is available for public review at the addresses indicated above for the EPA Regional
Office in Dallas, the EPA Washington, D.C. office, and the TNRCC Austin office. 
Section 110(k) of the CAA sets out provisions governing the EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-66).
In this FR action, the EPA is approving only some of the elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP, specifically the 1990
base year CO emissions inventory, and the oxygenated fuels program. The inspection and maintenance (I/M) committal
was addressed by the EPA in an FR notice published on September 27, 1993. The remaining elements of the complete El Paso
CO SIP, to be submitted to the EPA by November 15, 1993, will be acted upon in separate FR actions. 

This proposed approval action does not include any approval for the El Paso Post-1982 SIP submittal. That SIP proposal
was the result of a SIP call on February 24, 1984, and one to which the Texas Air Control Board (TACB) responded. However,
the EPA did not take action regarding the SIP submittal, and the CAAA of 1990 have negated the need for the EPA to take
further action on that SIP action revision submittal.

Analysis of State Submission 



1. Procedural Background 



The CAA requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan
revisions for submission to the EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the CAA provides that each implementation plan submitted
by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.

2

 See also section 110(l) of the CAA. Also, the EPA must determine whether a submittal is complete and, therefore, warrants
further EPA review and action. See section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565. The EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals
are set out at 40 Code of Federal Regulations part 51, appendix V (1993), as amended by 56 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991).
The EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, a submittal
is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by the EPA six months after receipt
of the submission. 





After providing adequate notice, the TACB public hearings were held on July 2, 1992, and September 9, 1992, to entertain
public comment on certain elements of the complete CO implementation plan. Following the public hearing, these elements
were adopted by the State on September 18, 1992, and submitted to the EPA as a proposed revision to the SIP. 

The SIP revision was reviewed by the EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with
the completeness criteria referenced above. A letter dated January 15, 1993, was forwarded to the Governor indicating
the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process. 



2. CO Emission Inventory 



Section 172(c)(3) of the CAA requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, and
current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The TACB,
the TNRCC effective September 1, 1993, included the requisite El Paso inventory in the CO SIP. The base year for the
inventory was 1990, using a three month CO season of November 1990 through January 1991. Stationary point sources,
stationary area sources, on-road mobile sources, and nonroad mobile sources of CO were included in the inventory.
Stationary sources with emissions greater than 100 tons per year within a 25-mile buffer of the nonattainment area
were also included in the inventory. The following list presents a summary of the CO peak season daily emissions estimates
in tons per day (t/d) by source category: Point Sources, nine t/d; Area Sources, three t/d; Mobile On-Road Sources,
291 t/d; Mobile Nonroad Sources, 67 t/d; Total Sources, 370 t/d. Available guidance for preparing emission inventories
is provided in the General Preamble (57 FR 13498, April 16, 1992). Section 110(k) of the CAA sets out provisions governing
the EPA's review of base year emission inventory submittals in order to determine approval or disapproval under section
182(a)(1). See 57 FR 13565-66, April 16, 1992. The EPA is proposing to grant approval of the El Paso CO base year
emission inventory submitted to the EPA based on Level I, II, and III review findings. The following paragraphs outline
the review procedures performed on the inventory. 

The Level I and II review process is used to determine that all components of the base year inventory are present. The
review also evaluates the level of supporting documentation provided by the State, and assesses whether the emissions
were developed according to current EPA guidance.

<TEXT>
 

The Level III review process is outlined here and consists of nine points that the inventory must include. For a base
year emission inventory to be acceptable, it must pass all of the following criteria: (1) An approved Inventory Preparation
Plan (IPP) must be provided and the Quality Assurance contained in the IPP must be performed and its implementation
documented; 
(2) Adequate documentation must be provided that enables the reviewer to determine the emission estimation procedures
and the data sources used to develop the inventory. Summary emissions by categories of source type must be provided;
(3) The point source inventory must be complete; (4) Point source emissions must have been prepared or calculated
according to the current EPA guidance; (5) The area source inventory must be complete; (6) The area source emissions
must have been prepared or calculated according to the current EPA guidance; (7) The methods used to develop vehicle
miles traveled (VMT) estimates (e.g., a network transportation planning model) must follow EPA guidance. The VMT
methods must be adequately described and documented in the inventory report; (8) The MOBILE model must be correctly
used 
to produce emission factors for each of the vehicle classes; and (9) Nonroad mobile emissions must be prepared according
to current EPA guidance for all of the source categories. 

The base year emission inventory will be approved if it passes Levels I, II, and III of the review process. Detailed
Level I and II review procedures can be found in the following document_``Quality Review Guidelines for 1990 Base
Year Emission Inventories,'' U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards
(OAQPS), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, July 27, 1992. Level III review procedures are specified in a memorandum
from John S. Seitz to the Regional Air Division Directors, entitled ``Emission Inventory Issues,'' June 24, 1993.

The TACB submitted the El Paso CO inventory on 
November 17, 1992. EPA Region 6, EPA's OAQPS Emissions Inventory Branch, and contractor's reviewed the inventory.
Comments were sent to the TACB, and the TACB responded with a resubmittal. The resubmittal underwent a second review.
The review directive comments were given to Texas and discussed during an on-site visit to Austin, Texas, on September
2, 1993. The EPA Office of Mobile Sources (OMS) comments on El Paso ozone were also considered, where applicable. 

Texas addressed the final directive comments and the OMS comments and submitted revised submittal documentation
to Region 6 on October 4, 1993, along with documents responding to the directive comments and the OMS comments. Region
6 compared the Texas responses with the deficiencies noted in the final directive review and OMS comments and concluded
that Texas had adequately addressed the remaining deficiencies so that Region 6 could verify that Texas had satisfied
the Level III criteria for El Paso CO.

Documentation of the Region 6 evaluation, including 
details of the review procedure, is contained in a memorandum 
(Attachment A) in the TSD. 

Also, please reference Appendix AK of the El Paso CO SIP for specific details on the State inventory. Finally, it should
be noted that no later than September 30, 1995, and no later than the end of each three year period thereafter (until
the area is redesignated to attainment), the TACB (now TNRCC) will be required to submit to the EPA a revised inventory
meeting the requirements of sections 187(a)(1) and 187(a)(5) of the CAA. 



3. Nonattainment New Source Review (NSR) Permit Program 



The State of Texas submitted NSR regulatory revisions to the EPA on May 13, 1992, and November 3, 1992, respectively.
NSR regulatory revisions were also included in a submittal by the State on August 31, 1993. The revisions were due independently
of the November 15, 1992, moderate CO nonattainment area SIP requirements addressed in this FR action. The EPA action
on the El Paso CO nonattainment NSR permit program will be addressed in detail in future separate FR notices. 



4. Contingency Measures 



As per section 172(c)(9) of the CAA, all nonattainment SIPs must contain contingency measures (due November 15, 1993)
that are to be implemented if the area fails to make reasonable further progress (RFP) or to attain the NAAQS by the applicable
date. These contingency measures are to be implemented immediately after the EPA determines failure of RFP or attainment
of standards. The contingency measures for the El Paso SIP, due independently of the November 15, 1992, moderate CO
nonattainment area SIP requirements addressed in this FR action, were received by the EPA Region 6 on November 15,
1993, and will be addressed in a separate FR action. 



5. I/M SIP Revision 



Section 187(a)(4) of the CAA provides a savings clause for vehicle I/M programs. All moderate CO nonattainment SIPs
must include a vehicle I/M program as described in section 182(a)(2)(B). The State of Texas adopted State rules and
currently is operating a State I/M program in El Paso, Texas. The State of Texas has also submitted a committal SIP for
the El Paso CO nonattainment area to the EPA, in accordance with provisions of the General Preamble (57 FR 13530), stating
that a comprehensive SIP revision will be submitted to the EPA by November 15, 1993, which will upgrade the existing
El Paso, Texas, I/M program to meet the new requirements mandated by the CAAA of 1990. The EPA proposed approval of the
committal SIP in a separate FR action published on September 27, 1993. 



6. Oxygenated Fuels Program 



Motor vehicles are significant contributors of CO emissions. An important measure toward reducing these emissions
is the use of cleaner-burning oxygenated gasoline. Extra oxygen, contained within the oxygenate in the fuel, enhances
fuel combustion and helps to offset fuel-rich operating conditions, particularly during vehicle starting, which
are more prevalent in the winter. 

Section 211(m) of the CAAA requires that various States submit revisions to their SIPs, and implement oxygenated
gasoline programs by no later than November 1, 1992. This requirement applies to all States with CO nonattainment
areas with design values of 9.5 ppm. or more, which is based generally on 1988 and 1989 data. Each State's oxygenated
gasoline program must require gasoline sold or dispensed in the specified control area to contain not less than 2.7
percent oxygen by weight during that portion of the year in which the area is prone to high ambient concentrations of
CO (the control period). 

The EPA announced guidance on the establishment of control periods, by area, in the FR on October 20, 1992.

4

 The EPA also announced the availability of oxygenated gasoline credit program guidelines in the October 20, 1992,
FR.

5

 Under a credit program, marketable oxygen credits may be generated from the sale of gasoline with a higher oxygen content
than is required (i.e., an oxygen content greater than 2.7 percent by weight). These oxygen credits may be used to offset
the sale of gasoline with a lower oxygen content than is required. As an alternate to the credit program, the State may
elect a program in which a minimum of 2.7 percent by weight oxygen must be present in every gallon of gasoline sold. 






The EPA also issued labeling regulations under section 211(m)(4) of the CAA. These labeling regulations were published
in the FR on October 20, 1992.

The State of Texas adopted amendments to its TACB 
Regulation IV, Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles, Chapter 114, to add a Section 114.13, which establishes
an Oxygenated Fuel Program for El Paso. The TACB (now TNRCC) Board approved the Regulation IV revisions on September
18, 1992. The program covers the County of El Paso, Texas (the control area), which is also the El Paso Metropolitan
Statistical Area. In this action, the EPA is proposing approval of the El Paso oxygenated fuel program, based on the
TACB's revised Chapter 114, Control of Air Pollution from Vehicles, section 114.13, Oxygenated Fuels. The State
has entered into an agreement with the El Paso City/County Health Department (known as the El Paso Local Air Pollution
Control Program) for that agency to assist the State with the administration of the oxygenated fuels program. The
agreement, in the form of grant objectives, details the activities that El Paso will undertake for the State in the
administration of the oxygenated fuels program. Examples of the activities the El Paso City/County Health Department
performs for the State in the oversight of the oxygenated fuels program include sampling 20 percent of the affected
facilities and reporting on the number of violations during the control period. The TNRCC is, however, ultimately
responsible for the administration, oversight, and enforcement of the El Paso oxygenated fuels program. 


The control period for the program is from October 1 of one year to March 31 of the following year, and the program is one
in which all oxygenated gasoline must contain a minimum oxygen content of 2.7 percent by weight of oxygen. The State
has adopted labeling regulations, enforcement procedures, and oxygenate test methods in conformity with Federal
regulations. 
For further details of the oxygenated fuels program, the reader is referred to the TSD. 




7. Enforceability Issues 




All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and the EPA. See sections 172(c)(6), 110(a)(2)(A)
and 57 FR 13556. The EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in a September
23, 1987, memorandum (with attachments) from 
J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al. See 57 FR 13541. The criteria include, for example:
ensuring that the rules contained in the SIP are explicit in their applicability to the regulated sources; ensuring
that compliance dates are clearly specified; ensuring that compliance periods and test methods are clearly noted;
ensuring that adequate recordkeeping is required; and ensuring that any exemptions or variances are clear in their
applicability and in how they are triggered. In addition to enforceable requirements, nonattainment area plan provisions
must contain a program that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP. See section
110(a)(2)(C). 


The State of Texas has an enforcement program that will ensure that certain control measures contained in the El Paso
CO SIP (i.e., the oxygenated fuels) are adequately enforced. As stated in the oxygenated fuels section of this FR notice,
the State has an agreement with the El Paso City/County Health Department for that agency to assist the TACB (now TNRCC)
in its oversight activities regarding the oxygenated fuels program. The State, however, is responsible for the administration,
oversight, and enforcement of the El Paso oxygenated fuels program. 




8. Attainment Demonstration 





There is no attainment demonstration required for CO nonattainment areas with design values equal to or below 
12.7 ppm. and El Paso's design values are less than 12.7 ppm. 



However, the International Border provision (section 179B of the CAA commonly referred to as section 818 of the CAAA),
provides a State on an international border, such as Texas, an option to satisfy the EPA Administrator regarding attainment
of the NAAQS by the statutory deadline. Specifically, section 179B provides that a nonattainment area on an international
border that fails to meet NAAQS will not be reclassified if it can demonstrate attainment ``but for emissions emanating
from outside the United States.'' Criteria for a section 818 demonstration are further discussed in the TSD. The TACB
(now TNRCC) included in this SIP revision its intention to perform a section 818 CO technical analysis for El Paso.
The EPA will take action on a section 818 El Paso CO demonstration, if one is submitted, in a future FR notice.

Proposed Action 




The EPA in this action is proposing to approve the following elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP: The 1990 base year
CO emissions inventory and the oxygenated fuels program. The remaining elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP to be
submitted to the EPA by November 15, 1993, will be acted upon in separate FR actions. 


The EPA has reviewed these revisions to the El Paso CO SIP and is proposing to approve them as submitted. 




Request for Public Comments 




The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of today's proposal. As indicated at the outset of this notice, the EPA
will consider any comments received by May 4, 1994.




Miscellaneous 




Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA
may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities
include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000. 


SIP approvals under section 110 and Subchapter I, part D, of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California State Implementation Plan Revision, El Dorado County
Air Pollution Control District



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing a limited approval and limited disapproval of a revision to the California State Implementation
Plan (SIP) which concerns the control of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from the loading, unloading,
and storage of VOCs. The intended effect of proposing limited approval and limited disapproval of these rules is to
regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act).
EPA's final action on this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) will incorporate these rules into the federally approved
SIP. EPA has evaluated these rules and is proposing a simultaneous limited approval and limited disapproval under
provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals and general rulemaking authority because these revisions,
while strengthening the SIP, also do not fully meet the CAA provisions regarding plan submissions and requirements
for nonattainment areas. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Applicability


EPA is proposing a limited approval and limited disapproval of a revision to the California SIP submitted by the El
Dorado County Air Pollution Control District (EDCAPCD) entitled Regulation IX, Air Toxic Control Measures, Section
A, Benzene, Rules 900 through 914. This regulation was submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA
on April 5, 1991.


Background


On September 12, 1979, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the 1977 Clean Air
Act (1977 CAA or pre-amended Act), which included a portion of the EDCAPCD.

1

 44 FR 53083; 40 CFR 81.305. Because that portion of the EDCAPCD was unable to reach attainment by the statutory attainment
date of December 31, 1982, California requested under pre-amended section 172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension
of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. 40 CFR 52.238. The EDCAPCD was not able to attain the ozone standard by the
approved attainment date. On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H)
of the pre-amended Act, that EDCAPCD's portion of the SIP was inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard
and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, amendments
to the 1977 CAA were enacted. Public Law 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. In amended
section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas fix their
deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of May 15, 1991
for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies. In addition, in section 182(b)(3), Congress amended the
Act by requiring Stage II gasoline vapor controls for moderate and above ozone nonattainment areas. 





Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified
as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended
section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment guidance.

2

 EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. The Tahoe
Air Basin portion of the EDCAPCD is designated attainment for ozone while the Mountain Counties portion, which lies
in the Sacramento Metropolitan Area, is classified as a serious nonattainment area.

3

 Therefore, the Mountain Counties portion of the EDCAPCD is subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991
deadline. Rules 900-914 apply to the entire EDCAPCD.
 





Section 182(b)(3) applies to areas classified as moderate and above. It requires owners or operators of gasoline
dispensing stations to install a vapor recovery system for emissions from vehicle fueling operations (commonly
known as Stage II vapor control). Facilities selling 10,000 gallons or less per month and small businesses may be exempted.
Compliance dates range from May 15, 1991 to November 15, 1993, depending on the stage of construction on November 15,
1990, and on the size of the facility.
The CARB submitted many revised RACT rules to EPA for incorporation into its SIP on April 5, 1991, including the rules
being acted on in this document. This document addresses EPA's proposed action for Regulation IX, Air Toxic Control
Measures, Section A, Benzene, (rules 900 through 914). These 900 series rules were adopted by the EDCAPCD on September
18, 1990. The rules were found to be complete on May 21, 1991 pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria set forth in 40
CFR part 51, appendix V

4

 and are being proposed for limited approval and limited disapproval. 





Rules 900-914 control the emission of VOCs from the loading and storage of organic liquids, primarily gasoline.
VOCs contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. 
The rules in Regulation IX were originally adopted as part of EDCAPCD's effort to achieve or maintain the National
Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and have been revised in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section
182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement. Rules 900-914 replace rules 213 and 214 of the current SIP and were adopted to
control hazardous benzene emissions in addition to other VOCs. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action
for EDCAPCD's rules 900-914.


EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action 


In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of
the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation,
Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the
basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 2. Among those provisions
is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources
of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act. 
For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique
Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive
norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents,
as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). The
CTGs applicable to rules 900-914 are: (1) EPA-450/2-77-026, Control of Hydrocarbons from
Tank Truck Gasoline Terminals; (2) EPA-450/1-77-035, Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from
Bulk Gasoline Plants; (3) EPA-450/2-77-036, Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Storage
of Petroleum Liquids in Fixed-Roof Tanks; (4) EPA 450/2-78-047, Control of Volatile Organic Emissions
from Petroleum Storage in External Floating Roof Tanks; and (5) EPA 450/2-78-051, Control of Volatile
Organic Emission Leaks from Gasoline Tank Trucks and Vapor Collection Systems. There was no guidance available for
Stage II gasoline vapor recovery from vehicle tanks when this regulation was being developed.

5

 Further interpretations of EPA policy are found in the Blue Book. In general, these guidance documents have been set
forth to ensure that VOC rules are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP.





The EDCAPCD's rules 900-914 provide significant revisions to the existing SIP rules. These revisions include:



1. The addition and expansion of definitions of terms used in the rules.
2. The addition of phase II (stage II) gasoline vapor recovery provisions.
3. Expansion of operation and maintenance, delivery vessel, and transfer requirements.
4. Addition of standards for storage tanks.
5. Addition of test methods for determining compliance.
6. Addition of administrative provisions covering permits, penalties, enforcement, and recordkeeping.



EPA has evaluated EDCAPCD's rules 900-914 for consistency with the CAA, EPA regulations, and EPA policy and
has found that the revisions address and correct many deficiencies previously identified by EPA. These corrected
deficiencies have resulted in clearer, more enforceable rules. Furthermore, the addition of more stringent limits
and Stage II vapor controls in the revised rules should lead to more emission reductions. 
Although the EDCAPCD's rules 900-914 will strengthen the SIP, the rules still contain deficiencies that must
be corrected pursuant to the requirements of sections 182(a)(2)(A) and part D of the CAA. In summary, the deficiencies
relate to the lack of a specific definition of the facilities to which the rules apply, improper definition of test
methods, Control Officer discretion to require unspecified control equipment, and a higher throughput exemption
than allowed by section 182(b)(3) of the CAA. 
A detailed description of specific deficiencies can be
found in the Technical Support Document for the regulation dated 4/29/93, which is available from the EPA, Region
9 office. Because of these deficiencies, the regulation is not approvable pursuant to either section 182(a)(2)(A)
of the CAA because it is not consistent with the interpretation of section 172 of the 1977 CAA as found in the Blue Book
or CAA section 182(b)(3). These deficiencies may lead to rule enforceability problems.
Because of the above deficiencies, EPA cannot grant full approval of these rules under section 110(k)(3) and part
D. Also, because the submitted regulation is not composed of separable parts which meet all the applicable requirements
of the CAA, EPA cannot grant partial approval of the regulation under section 110(k)(3). However, EPA may grant a limited
approval of the submitted regulation under section 110(k)(3) in light of EPA's authority pursuant to section 301(a)
to adopt regulations necessary to further air quality by strengthening the SIP. The approval is limited because EPA's
action also contains a simultaneous limited disapproval

6

. In order to strengthen the SIP, EPA is proposing a limited approval of EDCAPCD's submitted rules 900-914 under
sections 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of the CAA.





At the same time, EPA is also proposing a limited disapproval of these rules because they contain deficiencies that
have not been corrected as required by section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, and, as such, the rules do not fully meet the
requirements of part D of the Act. In addition, the rules do not meet the requirements of section 182(b)(3) of the CAA.
Under section 179(a)(2), if the Administrator disapproves a submission under section 110(k) for an area designated
nonattainment, based on the submission's failure to meet one or more of the elements required by the Act, the Administrator
must apply one of the sanctions set forth in section 179(b) unless the deficiency has been corrected within 18 months
of such disapproval. Section 179(b) provides two sanctions available to the Administrator: highway funding and
offsets. The 18-month period referred to in section 179(a) will begin at the time EPA publishes final notice of this
disapproval. Moreover, the final disapproval will trigger the Federal implementation plan (FIP) requirement under
section 110(c). It should be noted that the rules covered by this NPR have been adopted by the EDCAPCD and are currently
in effect in the District. EPA's limited disapproval action in this NPR does not prevent the District or EPA from fully
enforcing these rules.
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for 
revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 


Regulatory Process


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
Limited approvals under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements,
but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval
does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA
to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

U.S. E.P.A.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410 (a) (2).
EPA's limited disapproval of the State request under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA does not
affect any existing requirements applicable to small entities. Federal disapproval of the state submittal does
not affect its state enforceability. Moreover, EPA's limited disapproval of the submittal does not impose any new
Federal requirements. Therefore, EPA certifies that this limited disapproval action does not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing requirements nor does it impose
any new Federal requirements.
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from
the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request.
This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September
30, 1993.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plan; New Jersey Emission Statement Program




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision
submitted by the State of New Jersey on February 19, 1993 for the purpose of implementing an Emission Statement Program
for stationary sources in New Jersey. The SIP was submitted by New Jersey to satisfy the Clean Air Act requirements
for stationary sources to report annually to the State on their emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and
oxides of nitrogen (NO

x

) and for the State to make this data available to EPA and the public. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



Background



The air quality planning and SIP requirements for ozone nonattainment and transport areas are established in subparts
I and II of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (the Act). EPA has published a ``General Preamble''
and ``Appendices to the General Preamble'' (see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992), and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)) describing
how EPA intends to review SIPs submitted under title I of the Act.

EPA has also issued a draft guidance document entitled, ``Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement
Program'' (July 1992), describing the requirements for the Emission Statement Program discussed in this rulemaking.
The EPA is also conducting a rulemaking process to modify 40 CFR part 52 to reflect the requirements of the Emission
Statement Program.

Section 182(a) establishes requirements for stationary sources to prepare and submit to the state each year emission
statements showing actual emissions of VOCs and NO

x

. Further, states with ozone nonattainment areas are required to submit a revision to their SIPs by November 15, 1992
establishing this Emission Statement Program.

Facilities are required to submit their first emission statement to a state within three years of promulgation of
the Act and annually thereafter. 
 
If either VOC or NO

x

 is emitted at or above the minimum reporting level that is established in a state Emission Statement Program, the other
pollutant (NO

x

 or VOC) from the same facility should be included in the emission statement, even if the pollutant is emitted at levels
below the minimum reporting level.

Section 182(a)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act allows states to waive, with EPA approval, the requirement for an emission statement
for classes or categories of sources with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide NO

x

 and VOC emissions in nonattainment areas if the class or category is included in the base year and periodic inventories
and emissions are calculated using emission factors established by EPA (such as those found in EPA publication AP-42)
or other methods acceptable to EPA. 



New Jersey's Submittal


On November 15, 1992, New Jersey submitted a SIP revision for ozone which included a proposed Emission Statement Regulation.
On February 19, 1993, New Jersey submitted a SIP revision containing the adopted regulation, Subchapter 21, ``Emission
Statements'' of Chapter 27, Title 7 of the New Jersey Administrative Code, effective April 20, 1993. Subsequent to
the February 19 submittal, a problem was identified with New Jersey's enabling legislation. The enabling legislation,
which did not support the proposed regulation regarding confidentiality provisions, was modified to conform to
EPA's policy which does not allow confidentiality of emissions data submitted as part of the Emission Statement Program.
This modified legislation was signed on August 13, 1993 by the Governor of New Jersey. EPA has determined that New Jersey
now has the necessary authority to promulgate an Emission Statement Regulation. 

On May 24, 1993, New Jersey submitted a letter justifying the exemption of gasoline dispensing facilities from the
Emission Statement Program, since none of the sources in this category exceeded the applicable threshold. New Jersey
has included emissions from these exempted sources in the base year inventory and will continue to report them in subsequent
inventories. Further, on February 3, 1994, New Jersey submitted a letter requesting a waiver from the Emission Statement
Program of all sources emitting below the applicable threshold. 



EPA's Findings


EPA has determined that an acceptable Emission Statement Program must have several components. Specifically, a
state must submit it as a revision to its SIP, and the Emission Statement Program must meet the minimum requirements
for reporting as outlined in EPA's, ``Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program'' (July 1992).
The program must include, at a minimum, provisions for source applicability, definitions, compliance, and specific
source reporting requirements. 

EPA has concluded that the New Jersey program meets these requirements. EPA's detailed review of New Jersey's Emission
Statement Program is contained in a technical support document available from the source for further information
identified at the beginning of this document.



Applicability


In ozone nonattainment areas, facilities which emit VOC or NO

x

 in amounts of 25 tons per year or more must submit an emission statement. The entire State of New Jersey is designated
nonattainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone. New Jersey's regulation appropriately requires
facilities anywhere in the State actually emitting or having the potential to emit ten tons per year or more of VOC or
25 tons per year or more of NO

x

 to submit an annual emission statement. 

In accordance with the provision to waive reporting requirements, New Jersey has requested a waiver from the Emission
Statement Program for sources emitting less than ten tons per year of plant-wide VOC and less than 25 tons per year of
plant-wide NO

x

. New Jersey has included these sources of emissions (calculated using emission factors established or approved
by EPA) in the base year inventory and will continue to do so in the periodic inventories. EPA has determined that New
Jersey has complied with the emission statement waiver provisions outlined in EPA guidance. New Jersey has addressed
the emission statement applicability provisions in a manner that is acceptable to EPA.



Definitions 


The key definitions that New Jersey included in its Emission Statement Regulation are consistent with the EPA guidance.




Compliance


All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA. The EPA criteria addressing the
enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J.
Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation (see 57 FR 13541). SIP provisions must also contain a
program that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C)).


The State of New Jersey has a program in its SIP that will ensure that the requirements of section 182(a)(3)(B) are adequately
enforced. New Jersey will continue to provide EPA with status reports which outline the degree of compliance of sources
and which indicate the sources that have and have not met the provisions of the Emission Statement Program. In addition,
New Jersey has established penalty amounts to be assessed for each reporting violation. 

In letters dated June 24 and October 8, 1993, New Jersey provided EPA with quarterly Emission Statement Status Reports.
These reports showed the total number of facilities from which emission data was requested, the number of facilities
that met, and that failed to meet the provisions. Also in these reports, New Jersey provided a listing of the facilities
that did not comply with the emission statement reporting requirements. New Jersey has included, as part of its February
19, 1993 submittal, compliance schedules with appropriate penalties for sources failing to comply. EPA has determined
that New Jersey has an adequate enforcement program in place to satisfy the compliance requirements of an Emission
Statement Program.



Reporting Requirements


In accordance with EPA requirements, New Jersey has required the necessary source-supplied data elements from facilities.
The survey forms that New Jersey has provided to facilities for use in reporting emission statement data are not EPA
forms but require the necessary data. 

New Jersey submitted a letter on May 24, 1993 committing to meet EPA's requirements on reporting by verifying facility-supplied
data and by submitting required data to EPA. New Jersey will submit facility and state-supplied data to the Aerometric
Information Retrieval System (AIRS) on an annual basis. 


Summary


EPA is proposing to approve this portion of the SIP submittal as meeting the specific requirements for an Emission
Statement Program. 

Nothing in this proposed rule should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future
request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific
technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.

number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities. Moreover, due to the nature
of the Federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute
Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning
SIPs on such grounds.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California State Implementation Plan Revision, Yolo-Solano
Air Pollution Control District, Ventura Country Air Pollution Control District, and Placer County Air Pollution
Control District



<AGENCY>

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) adopted by the following
air pollution control districts: The Yolo-Solano Air Pollution Control District (Yolo-Solano APCD) on November
14, 1990; the Placer County Air Pollution Control District (Placer County APCD) on September 25, 1990; and the Ventura
County Air Pollution Control District (Ventura County APCD) on December 10, 1991. The California Air Resources Board
(CARB) submitted these revisions to EPA on the following dates: May 13, 1991, April 5, 1991 and 
June 19, 1992, respectively. The revisions concern Yolo-Solano APCD's Rule 2.24-Solvent Cleaning Operations,
Ventura County APCD's Rule 74.6-Surface Cleaning and Degreasing, and Placer 
County APCD's Rule 216-Degreasing Operations. These rules control emissions of volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) from surface cleaning and degreasing operations. The intended effect of proposing approval of these rules
is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or
the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) will incorporate these rules into the federally
approved SIP. EPA has evaluated each of these rules and is proposing to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding
EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements
for nonattainment areas.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Background


On March 3, 1978 EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended
in 1977 (1977 CAA or pre-amended Act), that included the Yolo-Solano County Area and the Ventura County Area. 43 FR
8964, 40 CFR 81.305. On September 12, 1979 EPA promulgated a similar list that included the Placer County Area. 44 FR
53801; 40 CFR 81.305. Because these areas were unable to meet the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1982, California
requested under section 172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. 40
CFR 52.238. On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended
Act, that the above districts' portions of the California SIP were inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard
and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call)

1

. On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399,
codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. In amended section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted
the requirement that nonattainment areas fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules
for ozone and established a deadline of May 15, 1991 for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies. 





Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified
as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended
section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment guidance.

2

 EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. The Yolo
County Area is classified serious; the portion of Solano County in the Sacramento Metropolitan Area is classified
as serious; the portion of Solano County in the San Francisco-Bay Area is classified as moderate; the Ventura County
Area is classified as severe; and the portion of Placer County in the Sacramento Metropolitan Area is classified as
serious;

3

 therefore these areas were subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline. 






The State of California submitted many revised RACT rules for incorporation into its SIP on April 5 and May 13, 1991
and June 19, 1992, including the rules being acted on in this document. This document addresses EPA's proposed action
for Yolo-Solano APCD's Rule 2.24-Solvent Cleaning Operations, Ventura County APCD's Rule 74.6-Surface
Cleaning and Degreasing and Placer County APCD's Rule 216-Degreasing Operations. These submitted rules were
found to be complete on the following dates: Rule 2.24, July 10, 1991; Rule 74.6, August 27, 1992; and Rule 216, May 21,
1991. These rules were found to be complete pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part
51, appendix V

4

 and are being proposed for approval into the SIP.





These submitted rules control VOC emissions from solvent degreasing operations. VOCs contribute to the production
of ground level ozone and smog. The rules were adopted as part of each district's efforts to achieve the National Ambient
Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement.
The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these rules.


EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action


In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of
the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and Part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation,
Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA's interpretation of these requirements, which forms
the basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 2. Among those
provisions is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary
sources of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act.
For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique
Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive
norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents,
as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). The
CTG applicable to all of the rules in this document is EPA-450/2-77-022, ``Control of Volatile Organic
emissions from Solvent Metal Cleaning.'' Further interpretations of EPA policy are found in the Blue Book, referred
to in footnote 2. In general, these guidance documents have been set forth to ensure that VOC rules are fully enforceable
and strengthen or maintain the SIP.
Yolo-Solano County APCD's Rule 2.24, Solvent Cleaning Operations, includes the following significant changes
from the current SIP:



1. Revised and expanded the ``definitions'' section.
2. Revised the ``exemptions'' section.
3. Deleted Air Pollution Control Officer discretion for selection of test methods. 
4. Added recordkeeping requirements and test methods.
5. With regard to cold solvent cleaning, changed all reference points from vapor pressure to initial boiling point
of the solvent which is more easily measured (as determined by ASTM D-1078-78).



Ventura County APCD's Rule 74.6, Surface Cleaning and Degreasing, includes the following significant changes from
the current SIP:



1. Added an applicability section. 
2. Expanded the ``Definitions'' section.
3. Added recordkeeping requirements, i.e. records for solvent makeup, solvent disposal, and total solvent used
by type. 
4. Added specific test methods approved by the EPA.
5. Expanded operating requirements for the different degreasing operations through the incorporation of Ventura
County APCD Rules 74.6.1, 74.6.2, and 74.6.3. 
6. Incorporated the initial boiling point of solvents (as measured by ASTM 1078-78) for determining applicability
in place of vapor pressure. 
7. Included more stringent vapor control and emission collection provisions for open top vapor degreasers.



Placer County APCD's Rule 216, Degreasing Operations includes the following significant changes from the current
SIP:



1. Expanded and refined the definitions section.
2. Added recordkeeping and compliance schedule requirements. 
3. Added a requirement for immediate repair of leaks or system shutdown. 
4. Removed the exemption for small vapor and conveyorized degreasers. 
5. Added an exemption for small cold cleaners.
6. Deleted APCO discretion in determining equivalency of equipment or procedures. 
7. Replaced vapor pressure with initial boiling point of solvent (as defined by ASTM 1078-78) for determining
applicability. 



EPA has evaluated the submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations, and
EPA policy. Therefore, Yolo-Solano APCD's Rule 2.24-Solvent Cleaning Operations, Ventura County APCD's
Rule 74.6-Surface Cleaning and Degreasing, and Placer County APCD's Rule 216-Degreasing Operations,
are being proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3) of the CAA as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and
part D. 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements. 


Regulatory Process


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small 
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a
substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose
any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature
of the 
Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal
inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs
on such grounds.

U.S. E.P.A.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225) as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. 
Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public
of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions
(54 FR 222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for
a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules
on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order
12291 on September 30, 1993.

Medical Facility Construction and Modernization; Requirements for Provision of Services to Persons Unable To Pay



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Public Health Service, DHHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes revisions to the rules currently governing how certain health care facilities, assisted under
titles VI and XVI of the Public Health Service Act, fulfill the assurance given in their applications for assistance
that they would provide a reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay. Public comment on the current rules
and operational experience with them have indicated the need to revise the current requirements with respect to nursing
homes, many of which are unable under current requirements to meet their obligation to provide such services. The
intended effect of this action is to permit qualified facilities to satisfy their uncompensated services assurance.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Secretary of Health and Human Services proposes an amendment to the rules governing what is popularly known as
the Hill-Burton uncompensated services program. Health care facilities covered by the program received construction
assistance under two titles of the Public Health Service Act, title VI (the ``Hill-Burton Act,'' 42 U.S.C. 291, 

et seq.

) and title XVI (42 U.S.C. 300q, 

et seq.

). Under both titles, facilities receiving such construction assistance have been required, as a condition of receiving
the construction assistance, to provide an assurance that ``there will be available in the facility or portion thereof
to be constructed or modernized a reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay therefor * * *.''
42 U.S.C. 291c(e). See also 42 U.S.C. 300s-1(b)(1)(K)(ii). This assurance is known as the ``uncompensated
services assurance.''



Regulations governing compliance with the uncompensated services assurance were first issued in 1947, and have
been revised several times. On May 18, 1979, comprehensive regulations governing compliance with the assurance
were issued at 44 FR 29372. Among other things, the 1979 regulations: Established a minimum level of uncompensated
services which facilities were required to provide; set an annual compliance level of uncompensated services to
be provided and required facilities to make up any deficit in meeting the annual compliance level through provision
of more uncompensated services in later years; required facilities to allocate their uncompensated services either
under a plan meeting certain requirements or on a first-requested, first-served basis; required facilities to notify
the public of the existence of their uncompensated services programs through public notice and provision of personal
notice to individuals served by the facilities; and required facilities to keep records documenting compliance
and to periodically report concerning compliance. The 1979 regulations also for the first time established national
eligibility criteria, based on income: Individuals whose annual income was at or below the poverty level (known as
``Category A individuals'') were automatically eligible for uncompensated services; individuals whose annual
income was at or below two times the poverty level (known as ``Category B individuals'') were also eligible for uncompensated
services, unless the facility decided to limit its services to Category A individuals only. The 1979 regulations
also provided that amounts to which an individual was entitled under a third-party insurance or governmental program
could not be credited towards a facility's uncompensated services quota.

On December 3, 1987, the Secretary revised the 1979 regulations at 52 FR 46022. As pertinent here, the 1987 regulations
effected a technical revision of the 1979 regulations, making explicit what had formerly been implicit in those regulations;


i.e., 

that coverage of an indigent under a third-party insurance or governmental program precludes eligibility for uncompensated
services. 42 CFR 124.505(a)(1) (1988). This policy simply reflects the long-standing Department view of the uncompensated
services program as a program of last resort, designed to serve persons who have no source of payment, such as Medicaid
or private insurance, for medical care. 

This policy has created major compliance problems for many Hill-Burton-obligated nursing homes. HHS has determined
that, of the 287 nursing homes with outstanding uncompensated services obligations under the general compliance
standards of the regulations, 243 have deficits; the majority of these have received no uncompensated services credit.
These deficits persist despite many attempts by HHS to provide technical assistance to nursing homes to bring them
into compliance. The fundamental problem is that, in most of these nursing homes, the only individuals who meet the
income-eligibility requirements for receipt of uncompensated services are also covered by their State's Medicaid
program; hence, they are by definition ineligible for uncompensated services under  124.505(a)(1). Thus,
in States in which the Medicaid eligibility limits exceed the Hill-Burton eligibility limits and which cover most
or all medical services, nursing homes are in the unenviable position of being chronically unable to fulfill their
uncompensated services obligations.

HHS has been aware of this structural problem for some time, and established a task force to analyze nursing home compliance
issues and develop strategies for dealing with compliance problems. The task force found that facilities in States
which have comprehensive Medicaid coverage for nursing home services have the most difficulty finding eligible
individuals to whom they can provide uncompensated services. Thus, the task force recommended increasing the eligibility
limit for uncompensated services to three times the poverty level to increase the pool of individuals potentially
eligible for uncompensated services.

HHS then surveyed the regional offices of the Health Care Financing Administration, which administers the Medicaid
program, to determine whether such a change in income eligibility would permit more nursing homes to meet their uncompensated
services obligations by setting Hill-Burton income eligibility limits above Medicaid income eligibility limits.
This survey indicated that 31 States and the District of Columbia have medically needy programs under which Medicaid
covers all individuals who have annual incomes that are less than the cost of the nursing home services received and
less than the Medicaid resource eligibility limits (usually, $2,000). Based on an average annual nursing home cost
of $31,000 in 1992, an increase in the Hill-Burton income eligibility limit to three times the poverty level (to about
$20,000) will not significantly increase the opportunity for facilities in these States to meet their uncompensated
services obligations, since patient income is irrelevant unless it exceeds nursing home costs. However, even in
these States, to the extent nursing home patients receive services not covered by Medicaid or are ineligible for Medicaid
because they have resources exceeding the Medicaid limits, raising the Hill-Burton income eligibility limit would
increase the pool of individuals eligible for uncompensated services. Moreover, in 16 of the remaining 19 States,
a raise in the Hill-Burton individual income eligibility limit from the current $13,940 (double the poverty level)
to the proposed $20,910 would result in a Hill-Burton income eligibility limit substantially above the Medicaid
income eligibility limit of $15,192 that applies in these States. An increase in the income eligibility limit to three
times the poverty level for nursing home services would thus greatly increase the pool of Hill-Burton eligibles in
those States, and it seems likely that such a change would accordingly increase the opportunity to fulfill the Hill-Burton
obligation for all 69 nursing homes in those States. While the remaining three States have Medicaid income eligibility
limits that are below the current upper Hill-Burton individual income eligibility limit of $13,940, such a change
would obviously increase the pool of Hill-Burton eligible individuals in those States as well. Thus, to the extent
the compliance problems of nursing homes in those States are a function of a lack of eligible patients, an increase
in the income eligibility limit to three times the poverty level for nursing home services would similarly assist
them.

The rules proposed below accordingly would establish a third income eligibility level (Category C) for nursing home
services only. See, proposed  124.505(a)(2)(iii). Category C individuals would be those individuals whose
annual incomes are greater than two times, but do not exceed three times, the poverty level. The regulations already
define which facilities are ``nursing homes'' within the scope of the regulation. See,  124.502(h).

HHS has considered, but rejected, even higher income eligibility limits. The higher that income eligibility limits
are raised, the farther the program gets from targeting services to persons unable to pay. On the other hand, given
the usual cost of nursing home care, it is apparent that individuals in need of such care are still unable to pay for the
cost of that care, even if they have annual incomes of three times the poverty level. Thus, HHS believes that the proposed
regulation represents a reasonable approach to reducing compliance problems for nursing homes and retaining the
program's traditional focus on persons unable to pay.

While HHS recognizes that this proposal on its face does not resolve all nursing home compliance problems, it also
does not expect the proposed change to operate in a vacuum. Rather, HHS currently has under consideration another
compliance alternative, published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 4, 1993, as a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, designed in part to help alleviate the compliance problems
of certain private, nonprofit nursing homes. The proposed compliance alternative would exempt qualifying facilities
from the procedural requirements of the general regulations. Qualifying facilities are those private, nonprofit
facilities that either receive substantial philanthropic support and provide free or reduced cost services, or
do not collect monies directly from persons unable to pay. The combination of these two proposed rules should allow
all of the 287 Hill-Burton obligated nursing homes to satisfy their uncompensated services obligations and reduce
their uncompensated services deficits more easily. In light of this, it appears prudent to minimize the change in
the underlying program until it is seen what effect the two program alterations currently under consideration have
in resolving the compliance problems of nursing homes.

The rules proposed below also set out technical and conforming amendments to other sections. The only one of note is
proposed  124.506(a)(1)(v). That section would provide that if a nursing home provides services on a reduced
charge basis to both Category B and Category C individuals, it may not employ a discount method that gives Category
C individuals greater discounts than those given to Category B individuals. This policy is simply a logical extension
of a similar policy that already exists with respect to Category A and Category B individuals.

The Secretary solicits comments on the viability and advisability of the above proposal. If there are suggestions
for alternative approaches to addressing the problems of nursing home compliance, the Secretary is interested in
receiving those as well. 



Economic Impact



Executive Order 12866 requires that all regulations reflect consideration of alternatives, of costs, of benefits,
of incentives, of equity, and of available information. Regulations must meet certain standards, such as avoiding
unnecessary burden. Regulations which are ``significant'' because of cost, adverse effects on the economy, inconsistency
with other agency actions, effects on the budget, or novel legal or policy issues, require special analysis. The Regulatory
Flexibility Act requires that we analyze regulatory proposals to determine whether they create a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities (for purposes of the Act, all nursing home are categorized by HHS as small
entities).

The Department believes that the proposed rule change in this regulation is beneficial. This regulation does not
have an impact that exceeds $100 million for nursing homes. While it will allow nursing homes to qualify more individuals
for uncompensated services and thus reduce facility deficits, it will not alter existing procedural and reporting
requirements for obligated facilities. For these reasons, we do not believe this rule necessitates an economic analysis.
Therefore, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Secretary certifies that this regulation
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

Pursuant to Executive Order 12866, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has reviewed this rule. The Department
requests comments on whether there are any aspects of this proposed rule which can be improved to make nursing home
compliance more effective, more equitable, or less costly.



Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980



This proposed rule contains no information collection or reporting requirements which are subject to review by OMB
under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Although this rule discusses the requirement for developing and submitting
affirmative action plans, the requirement is not new and has been previously approved under OMB control number 0915-0077.

ACTION: 

Advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Federal Procurement Policy, Cost Accounting Standards Board (CASB), proposes to revise its Disclosure
Statement Form (CASB DS-1). Section 26(g)(1) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act requires that
the Board, prior to the promulgation of any new or revised Cost Accounting Standard, publish a report and an ANPRM.
This ANPRM addresses the Board's efforts to update and revise the CASB Disclosure Statement.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Regulatory Process



The Cost Accounting Standards Board's rules and regulations are codified at 48 CFR chapter 99. Section 26(g)(1) of
the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, 41 U.S.C. 422(g)(1), requires that the Board, prior to the establishment
of any new or revised Cost Accounting Standard, complete a prescribed rulemaking process. This process consists
of the following four steps:

1. Consult with interested persons concerning the advantages, disadvantages and improvements anticipated in the
pricing and administration of government contracts as a result of a proposed Standard.

2. Promulgate an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.

3. Promulgate a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.

4. Promulgate a Final Rule.

This proposal is step two in the four step process.



B. Summary of Proposed Rule



The Board initiated a case to consider issues related to the revision of the Disclosure Statement (CASB DS-1),
which was originally developed and promulgated in the early 1970s. Only minor revisions to the Statement have been
made prior to the initiation of the current project. On April 2, 1993, the CASB distributed a Staff Discussion Paper
incorporating a revised Disclosure Statement to certain interested parties who generally possessed actual field
experience in submitting and auditing these documents. The Board is continuing the revision process to improve the
quality of information presented in the Disclosure Statement form.

The purpose of this ANPRM is to seek broad public comment concerning the format and data to be collected on the proposed
form. In particular, the Board is interested in soliciting comments concerning the relevance and adequacy of the
required disclosures to the quality of the government contract cost measurement process.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Withdrawal of Proposed Rule To Designate Critical Habitat for the
Little Mariana Fruit Bat, Mariana Fruit Bat, Guam Broadbill, Mariana Crow, Guam Micronesian Kingfisher, and Guam
Bridled White-Eye

ACTION:

 Final decision; withdrawal of proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) withdraws the proposal to designate critical habitat for six endangered
forest species on Guam: The little Mariana fruit bat (

Pteropus tokudae

), Mariana fruit bat (

Pteropus mariannus mariannus

), Guam broadbill (

Myiagra freycineti

), Mariana crow (

Corvus kubaryi

), Guam Micronesian kingfisher (

Halcyon cinnamomina cinnamomina

), and Guam bridled white-eye (

Zosterops conspicillatus conspicillatus

). Most of the lands proposed for critical habitat have now been protected by the inclusion of these lands in the Guam
National Wildlife Refuge. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent under the Endangered
species Act (Act).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background



In the final rule listing a number of Guam species, published August 27, 1984, in the 

Federal Register

 (49 FR 33881), the Service determined endangered status for seven birds and two mammals: Guam broadbill (Myiagra
freycineti), Mariana crow (Corvus kubaryi), Mariana gallinule (moorhen) (Gallinula chloropus guami), Micronesian
kingfisher (Halcyon cinnamomina cinnamomina), Guam rail (Rallus owstoni), Vanikoro swiftlet (Aerodramus vanikorensis
bartschi), Guam bridled white-eye (Zosterops conspicillatus conspicillatus), little Mariana fruit bat (Pteropus
tokudae), and the Guam population of Mariana fruit bat (Pteropus mariannus mariannus). These species are found in
the Mariana Islands in the western Pacific in the Territory of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands,
both under the jurisdiction of the United States.

The six species, along with three other species, were listed as endangered on August 27, 1984. In a proposed rule published
in the 

Federal Register

 on June 14, 1991 (56 FR 115), critical habitat was proposed for six of these endangered forest species on Guam: the little
Mariana fruit bat, Mariana fruit bat, Guam broadbill, Mariana crow, Guam Micronesian kingfisher, and Guam bridled
white-eye. Comments related to the proposed critical habitat designation were solicited during four public comment
periods held: June 14, 1991, through August 13, 1991; October 15, 1991, through October 31, 1991; June 12, 1992, through
July 15, 1992; and March 1, 1993, through March 31, 1993. A public hearing on the critical habitat proposal was held
in Guam on July 31, 1991.

The six species were once distributed in the forests throughout Guam, but by the time they were listed in 1984, their
ranges had been severely reduced. The species continue to decline in the wild. The main cause of the decline at the time
of listing was not known with certainty, but probable causes included predation by introduced animals (most notably
the brown tree snake), habitat loss, and, for the two species of fruit bats, hunting. It has become increasingly clear
that predation by the introduced brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) is the primary cause of decline for the endangered
birds (Savidge 1987). For fruit bats, poaching is a serious threat along with predation by the brown tree snake (DAWR
1993).

The Mariana crow is currently extant in the wild on Guam and the neighboring island of Rota, 44 miles to the north of Guam.
The population on Rota has been relatively stable and, based on a 1982 survey, was believed to number about 1,300 individuals
(Engbring et al. 1986). Additional surveys will be conducted on Rota, starting in 1994, to acquire more current information.
On Guam, the population has declined and is now believed to number approximately 50 individuals (DAWR 1993), with
little or no successful reproduction since 1986. Compared to other forest birds native to Guam, the Mariana crow requires
relatively large tracts of forest that do not have high levels of human activity.

The Mariana fruit bat is found on all the major islands in the Marianas. Only the Guam population is listed as endangered,
although populations on Saipan, Tinian, and Aguijan are considered category 1 candidate species, and the populations
on Rota and the islands north of Saipan are considered category 2 candidate species (56 FR 225). Category 1 includes
taxa for which information in the Service's possession is sufficient to support a proposal to list. Category 2 includes
species for which information in the Service's possession indicates that listing is possibly appropriate, but is
insufficient to support a proposal to list as endangered or threatened at this time. On Guam, the Mariana fruit bat
was historically found throughout native forests. By the 1980's, population numbers on Guam had dropped, and the
species was restricted to forests on the northern tip of the island (USFWS 1990b), although there are occasional reports
of bats from southern Guam around Fena Reservoir. Various species of Pacific fruit bats generally use a variety of
forest types, including agricultural forest in close proximity to residential areas. Adequate protection from
poaching has not been possible on Guam and bats have been extirpated from residential areas on the island. This activity
continues despite the fact that it has been illegal to hunt fruit bat species on Guam since 1966.

The Micronesian kingfisher, a subspecies endemic to Guam, was at one time found throughout most of Guam's forests
(Jenkins 1983). Up to 3,000 might have survived in the wild when the species was listed in 1984, but the kingfisher declined
rapidly and is extirpated from the wild today. A captive population has been established and is maintained at several
mainland zoos including the Bronx, Philadelphia, and National Zoos. Once the brown tree snake is brought under control,
it is hoped that the Guam Micronesian kingfisher can be reintroduced in the wild using the progeny produced by these
captive flocks.

Three of the six forest species, all endemic to Guam, have not been observed in the wild for several years and are believed
to be extinct: the little Mariana fruit bat, Guam broadbill, and the Guam bridled white-eye. No records of the little
Mariana fruit bat exist after 1968. In 1983, the Guam broadbill was restricted to a small area at the north end of the
island and the population was estimated to be under 100 individuals. Two sightings of individuals were made in 1984:
One in March in Northwest Field, and one in August adjacent to the Navy golf course in Barrigada (USFWS 1990a). A single
broadbill was possibly heard in the Naval Communications area in 1988 (U.S. Navy 1989). Since then, the broadbill
has virtually disappeared from the island. Fewer than 50 bridled white-eyes were thought to survive in 1983. The last
individual was observed in June of that year (Beck 1984).

The areas for which the Service proposed critical habitat designation are those identified as ``high priority essential
habitat'' and ``essential habitat'' in the two recovery plans for these species (USFWS 1990a and USFWS 1990b). The
total acreage of the proposed areas is approximately 16,893 acres (6,837 hectares (ha)) in northern Guam and 7,669
acres (3,104 ha) in southern Guam, for a total of 24,562 acres (9,944 ha) island wide. About 83 percent of the land within
the proposed critical habitat of the six forest species on Guam is in Federal ownership and is predominantly under
the jurisdiction of either the U.S. Navy or the U.S. Air Force. Approximately 14.5 percent is owned by the Government
of Guam, while the remaining 3.5 percent is in private ownership. 

Certain forest areas on Guam must be given special management if the remaining forest species are to survive. They
consist of relatively contiguous tracts of forest types, including mature limestone forests, mixed woodlands,
second growth stands, coastal strand forests, coconut forests, and ravine forests. All are habitat types favored
by Guam forest species. When isolated from excessive human disturbance, such forest types fulfill the habitat requirements
of the Mariana crow and Mariana fruit bat in providing relatively large, contiguous tracts of forest with a minimum
of human disturbance. The Service believes that the Guam Micronesian kingfisher could be reintroduced to these protected
areas as well.

Protection of these areas would allow for the continued survival of the species that are either currently restricted
to a small fraction of their former historical range or extirpated from the wild in Guam. A key management consideration
common to all of Guam's native terrestrial species is control of the introduced brown tree snake, which was a major
factor in the population declines of these species. Conservation of these species will be substantially enhanced
through protection and management of key portions of their historic range.

The endangered species problems on Guam are complex, and the Service believes that a cooperative, proactive approach
to species and habitat management will yield the best chances for survival and recovery of these species in the wild.
The Government of Guam and the Federal government share common goals for the recovery of endangered and threatened
species, protection of native flora and fauna, conservation of unique ecosystems, and maintenance of native biological
diversity. The Government of Guam and the Federal government must continue cooperative efforts to develop and implement
programs for the recovery of endangered and threatened species, and to protect key habitats in perpetuity with the
common goal of reversing the wildlife extinction crisis facing Guam.

To meet these shared goals and to more effectively manage the essential habitat needed for the recovery of all of Guam's
endangered species, the Service established the Guam National Wildlife Refuge on certain lands and waters of Guam
to be managed in a coordinated manner by the Service, Government of Guam, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air Force. The purposes
for establishing this refuge are: (1) To protect and restore essential habitats and provide for recovery actions
for Guam's endangered and threatened species; (2) to conserve migratory species and their habitats; (3) to protect
and manage other native wildlife and their habitats; (4) to control predation of native species, particularly by
the brown tree snake; (5) to complement ongoing Government of Guam and Department of Defense (DOD) programs in natural
resource management, conservation, law enforcement, research, and education; (6) to provide opportunities for
public education, enjoyment of wildlife, cultural use of resources, and scientific research; and (7) to maintain
the scenic values of the protected areas. The Guam National Wildlife Refuge is established as an overlay refuge on
22,477 acres, through a memorandum of understanding and managed through cooperative agreements among the U.S. Navy,
U.S. Air Force, and Service. The Service owns an additional 371 acres in fee title. Of these lands, 21,204 acres were
proposed as critical habitat in the 1991 proposal.

In the June 14, 1991, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit
factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final rule to designate critical habitat
on Guam. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other
interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. 
A public hearing on the proposed rule was announced in the 

Federal Register

 on July 12, 1991, and was held on July 31, 1991 (56 FR 27485). The initial comment period for the proposed rule ended August
13, 1991. A request was received on August 8, 1991, by the Guam Urunao Resort Corporation, to reopen the comment period.
The Service reopened the comment period from October 15, 1991, until October 31, 1991, to obtain additional information
on the economic impacts of the proposed designation of critical habitat. This comment period was announced in the


Federal Register

 (56 FR 51668) and in the Pacific Daily News. 
The comment period was reopened again from June 12, 1992, until July 15, 1992, due to the availability of an Environmental
Assessment pertaining to the establishment of an overlay refuge on Guam and a request to reopen the comment period
by the National Wildlife Federation. This comment period was announced in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 25007) and advertised in the Pacific Daily News. 
The Service reopened the comment period from March 1, 1993, until March 31, 1993, based on the availability of a revised
Environmental Assessment pertaining to the establishment of an overlay refuge. This comment period was announced
in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 11821) and also advertised in the Pacific Daily News. 


Summary of Comments 


The public comment period for the designation of critical habitat for endangered species on Guam was open a total of
140 days. During this time, a total of 85 comments were received from 75 commenters. Of the 85 comments, 59 (70 percent)
supported the designation of critical habitat as proposed, 18 (21 percent) opposed the designation of critical habitat,
and 8 (9 percent) had various opinions that neither expressly supported nor opposed the designation of critical habitat.
Also, of the 85 comments, 13 (15 percent) supported the establishment of an overlay refuge, while 3 (4 percent) stated
that an overlay refuge alone would not be sufficient to protect endangered species on Guam. 


Issue 1:

 Several respondents maintained that opposition to critical habitat revolves around a few local families and their
economic interests in their property, that Guam's forests are worth more than additional development, and that most
of Guam's people support protection of Guam's forests over commercial development. 


Service Response:

 The endangered species problems on Guam are complex, and the Service believes that a cooperative, proactive approach
to both species and habitat management will yield the best chances for the long-term survival and recovery of these
species in the wild. To meet these shared goals and to more effectively manage the essential habitat needed for the
recovery of all of Guam's endangered species, the Service established a National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge) on most
of the Federal lands proposed as critical habitat and certain waters of Guam to be managed by the Service, the Government
of Guam, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air Force. The Service believes that the establishment of the Refuge adequately protects
Guam's forests and the species that depend on them. 


Issue 2:

 Some respondents expressed the need for both the designation of critical habitat and an overlay refuge to adequately
protect endangered species and their habitats on Guam. The overlay refuge alone, they maintained, will not provide
the controls necessary to protect endangered species, and, at a minimum, critical habitat needs to be designated.



Service Response:

 The designation of critical habitat would have provided some extra assurances that actions funded, authorized,
or carried out by the Federal government would not destroy or adversely modify habitat needed by Guam forest species.
Unless there is such Federal involvement, the designation of critical habitat does not affect actions of private
landowners or local government activities. The establishment of a National Wildlife Refuge, on the other hand, allows
for the protection and active management of Refuge lands. Therefore, the Service has determined that the designation
of critical habitat would yield no net benefits above those provided by the Refuge and the designation of critical
habitat in conjunction with the establishment of the Refuge is not required for the protection of Guam's endangered
species. 


Issue 3:

 Support was expressed for critical habitat as a deterrent to development. Comments maintained that development
has improved Guam's economy and destroyed much of its ecology, that there is a huge need to curtail development and
military expansion on Guam and that critical habitat designation will help indigenous people to protect their natural
heritage and honor the memory of their ancestors.

Service Response:

 The Service expects that the establishment of the Refuge will be adequate to protect Guam's endangered forest species
and the habitats on which they depend. However, the establishment of the Refuge will not affect the extent of development
or the possibility of military expansion outside of the areas designated for protection. 


Issue 5:

 Opposition was expressed to the exclusion of private lands from critical habitat designation. 


Service Response:

 No lands on Guam are currently being considered for critical habitat designation. Private lands were not included
in the Refuge because of prohibitive costs associated with land acquisition. The Service believes that the Guam National
Wildlife Refuge provides for increased protection, management, and program funding for the bulk of essential forest
habitat on Guam, and that the protection of endangered forest species' habitat on private lands would best be accomplished
through existing environmental compliance processes. 


Issue 6:

 Opposition to critical habitat designation was expressed on the grounds that it would place serious economic and
operational constraints on potential military and private development activities. The economic analysis pertaining
to the proposed rule was criticized as not adequately addressing real economic impacts. 


Service Response:

 The purpose of the economic analysis on the designation of critical habitat is to gather the best available data on
economic or other impacts of the proposed critical habitat designation to assist in determining whether adjustments
should be made before the critical habitat designation is made final. The economic analysis addressed the possible
impacts of the critical habitat designation on Federal, Territory of Guam, and local landowners and the regional
and national economies. The analysis was conducted by examining the possible ways the designation of critical habitat
might restrict the use of Federal funds or permits for activities affecting or affected by the designation. Use of
private, Territory of Guam, or local funds for activities that do not require a Federal permit is not restricted by
a critical habitat designation and was beyond the scope of the economic analysis. The economic analysis was conducted
using the best information available, and it addressed the economic impacts to the greatest extent possible. 
The effects of establishing the Refuge on the economic environment were also evaluated in the Environmental Assessment
for the Guam National Wildlife Refuge. Because the Service is only including Federal lands within the Refuge, and
given the restrictions of the Act upon Federal lands, the potential development of important native forest lands
in Federal ownership, even without the establishment of a Refuge, is not likely. 


Issue 7:

 The opinion was expressed that critical habitat designation alone does not adequately address endangered species
concerns on Guam. Development pressure and additional military uses were predicted to take over, and concern was
indicated that, unless adequate, high quality, habitat is protected now, it will not be available for reintroductions.



Service Response:

 The Service strongly agrees with these concerns and, therefore, has established the Guam National Wildlife Refuge.
The purposes for establishing the Refuge are: (1) To protect and restore essential habitats and provide for recovery
actions for Guam's endangered and threatened species (which include reintroductions); (2) to conserve migratory
species and their habitats; (3) to protect and manage migratory species and other native wildlife and their habitats;
(4) to control predation upon native species, particularly by the brown tree snake; (5) to complement ongoing Government
of Guam and Department of Defense (DOD) programs in natural resource management, conservation, law enforcement,
research, and education; (6) to provide opportunities for public education, enjoyment of wildlife, cultural use
of resources, and scientific research; and, (7) to maintain the scenic values of the protected areas. The Refuge has
been established through a memorandum of understanding and managed through cooperative agreements among the U.S.
Navy, U.S. Air Force, and Service. The Service has determined that the establishment of the Refuge adequately addresses
the threats to the endangered forest species on Guam and provides for the protection of their habitat. 


Issue 8:

 Critical habitat designation was opposed for including too much land. 


Service Response:

 No habitat is currently being considered for designation as critical habitat on Guam and only Federal lands are included
in the Refuge. To determine which lands the Service should include within the boundaries of the Refuge, habitat was
evaluated on the basis of its biological importance to endangered and threatened species, migratory birds, other
native wildlife, and the conservation of biological diversity. Federal lands that were identified as ``essential
habitat'' in published recovery plans for endangered forest birds, waterbirds, and fruit bats were considered priority
areas for protection. Other areas with outstanding conservation values that were considered for inclusion in the
Refuge included wetlands, migratory bird foraging and loafing areas, and sea turtle nesting beaches. 


Issue 9:

 An overlay refuge was supported as the best method for the protection and recovery of endangered species on Guam. 


Service Response:

 The Service agrees with this statement and has established the Guam National Wildlife Refuge. 


Issue 10:

 Critical habitat designation was opposed as a Federal condemnation of land and plot to steal lands from Guam's people.



Service Response:

 Designation of critical habitat is a regulatory exercise; it is not a Federal condemnation of land. Designation of
critical habitat does not result in additional legal restrictions on private lands unless such lands are subject
to actions that are authorized, funded, or carried out by Federal agencies. Non-Federal, as well as Federal lands,
with or without designated critical habitat, are still subject to prohibitions against take of listed species on
their land, pursuant to section 9 of the Act. Designation of critical habitat is a requirement of the Endangered Species
Act for threatened and endangered species whenever such designation is prudent and determinable. 


Finding and Withdrawal 


The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent. The constituent elements of the habitat will
be protected on an area sufficient to provide for the conservation of listed species through refuge designation.
A designation of critical habitat would have provided some extra assurances that actions funded, authorized, or
carried out by the Federal government would not destroy or adversely modify habitat needed by Guam forest species.
Unless such Federal involvement exists, the designation of critical habitat does not affect actions of private landowners
or local government activities. The establishment of the Guam National Wildlife Refuge allows for the protection
and active management of refuge lands. Additionally, many more of Guam's native species will directly benefit from
management provided by the Guam National Wildlife Refuge. By establishing a refuge on Guam, most of the lands identified
in the proposed rule for critical habitat will benefit from active protection and wildlife management programs as
well as 
increased cooperation among the Service, Government of Guam, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air Force. A total of 21,204 acres
originally proposed as critical habitat are now in the refuge, including all of the acreage actually occupied by the
extant forest species. The Service will maintain a resident staff on Guam to coordinate and conduct wildlife management,
research, and educational and public use programs in cooperation and coordination with the Government of Guam and
the Service's military refuge partners. Biological monitoring, wildlife and habitat enhancement and recovery
programs, and brown tree snake control programs have and will continue to be developed, coordinated, and implemented
by the cooperating agencies within the framework of the refuge cooperative agreements. Refuge establishment enables
the Service to implement research and endangered species recovery programs that could not be implemented by designating
critical habitat. Law enforcement will continue and will be conducted in conjunction
