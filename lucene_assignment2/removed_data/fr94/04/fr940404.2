Rocky Mountain Region Crested Butte Ski Area Expansion, Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forest, Gunnison
County, CO



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to upgrade and expand the Crested
Butte Ski Area. The proposal includes constructing new North Face and Third Bowl lifts and runs, constructing a restaurant
at the top of the Silver Queen lift, and the development of Crested Butte North on Snodgrass Mountain. All proposed
developments on National Forest System lands have been allocated to ski area use in the Forest Plan. That decision
will not be reconsidered in the EIS, unless an effect on some significant resource which cannot be mitigated is discovered
through this analysis. The ski area operates under a special-use permit granted to the Crested Butte Ski Area, Inc.
The proposal would increase the Crested Butte Mountain capacity by approximately 20%. The Crested Butte North ski
area expansion may lead to the development of North Village on private land at the Base of Snodgrass Mountain.



The expansion proposal will help maintain Crested Butte's standing as a world class resort by enhancing skier capacity
and the quality of the Crested Butte skiing experience.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The proposal for expansion at Crested Butte will cover improvements planned to take place over the next decade.



The EIS will provide information and analysis to support three different Forest Service decisions on the Crested
Butte expansion proposal. 

1. Part of the proposal includes improvements on the main mountain previously analyzed in an environmental assessment
and approved in 1982. The 1982 decisions are more than five years old and need to be reviewed to ensure all important
environmental factors have been considered and analyzed to the latest standards before major construction begins.


2. Other proposals are new developments located on the main mountain within the area currently served by lifts and
will be reviewed to minimize or avoid environmental effects. 

3. The most significant part of Crested Butte Ski Corporation's proposal is the development of Crested Butte North,
which is off the main mountain outside the area currently served by lifts, but within the existing permitted ski area
boundary. The Crested Butte North proposals have been previously examined and approved in a 1982 environmental assessment,
but never built. The decision to be made regarding Crested Butte North is whether, based on updated environmental
analysis, any significant resource concerns not considered in previous studies would alter previous authorizations,
and under what specific conditions proposed development might be authorized.

All of the ski area development proposals are within the existing ski area boundary. Both the Forest Plan and the Regional
Guide allocate this area to ski area use and development. Decisions to manage the area within the ski area boundary
for ski area use and development will be revisited, unless the analysis discovers a very significant resource effect
that cannot be mitigated. At this point we do not anticipate any effects such as this.

Other agencies will use the EIS to aid in making their decisions. A U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ``404 Permit'' to dredge
and fill waters and/or wetlands may be required, depending upon which alternative is selected for Implementation.
The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service will use information developed through this analysis process to formulate their
findings on potential effects to Threatened or Endangered plant and animal species. Local county and city officials
will use information developed to aid in their planning and decision making on adjoining private lands.

The Forest Service will ask the U.S. Army Corps and U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service to cooperate in the environmental
analysis, and may request cooperation from other Local, State, or Federal agencies.

The Forest Service invites comments and suggestions on the scope of the analysis to be included in the draft environmental
impact statement (DESI). Preliminary internal scoping helped determine the need for an EIS. Issues, or areas of concern,
identified so far include:

(1) Water quality,

(2) Water quantity for snow-making and consumption,

(3) Vegetation,

(4) Wetlands,

(5) Air quality,

(6) Wildlife,

(7) Cultural resources,

(8) Geologic hazard,

(9) Avalanche hazard,

(10) Recreational opportunities (downhill skiing and dispersed winter recreation),

(11) Transportation (highways, air),

(12) Growth impacts on local infrastructure, and

(13) Other social and economic impacts.

Alternatives to be considered will address different possible locations for facilities including lifts, runs,
restaurants, roads and trails. The no action alternative, as required by NEPA, will be considered for each element
of the proposal.

The comment period on the draft environmental impact statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency publishes the notice of availability in the 

Federal Register

.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v. 

NRDC

, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also environmental objections that could have been raised at the draft environmental impact
statement stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be
waived or dismissed by the courts. 

City of Angoon 

v. 

Hodel

, 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Circuit, 1986), and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. 

v. 

Harris

, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45 day draft environmental impact statement comment period
so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully
consider them and respond to them in the final environmental impact statement.

To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points. Please note that comments on the draft environmental
impact statement will be regarded as public information.

The Deciding Official will be Robert L. Storch, Forest Supervisor, Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and Gunnison National
Forest, 2250 Highway 50, Delta, Colorado 81416.

Introduction



The Little Paint Creek Watershed is a federally assisted action authorized for planning under Public Law 83-566,
the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act. An environmental assessment was undertaken by the Soil Conservation
Service (SCS) in conjunction with the development of the watershed plan. This assessment was conducted in consultation
with local, State and other Federal agencies as well as with interested organizations and individuals. Data developed
during the assessment are available for public review at the following location: Soil Conservation Service, Federal
Building, 210 Walnut St., ste. 693, Des Moines, Iowa 50309-2180.





Recommended Action



Proposed is the installation of 880 acres of land treatment measure to be applied on farms for reduction of sheet, rill,
and steambank erosion; storage and management of animal waste at 2 locations, 12 single purpose floodwater detention
structures and one spring protection.



Effects of Recommended Action



The proposed plan will stabilize 800 acres of excessively eroding cropland, grassland and forestland, reduce flooding
on a 160 acre floodplain, and protect one coldwater trout stream. Animal waste management facilities and application
practices will prevent livestock wastes from two locations from entering the stream.

The recommended actions will protect the watershed hydrologically by improving the soil cover condition and reducing
overland flow velocities. Streamflow will be stabilized to the extent that peak flood flow rates will be greatly reduced.

The proposed actions will have no effect on wetlands.

An initial management summary of cultural resources as they relate to the planned components has been developed.
The survey concludes that no significant adverse impacts will occur to cultural resources in the watershed should
the plan be implemented. The SCS has consulted with the State Historic Preservation Office on the effects that planned
measures will have on significant cultural resources. However, construction of manure storage units, floodwater
detention structures and land treatment measures do have the potential for seriously disrupting individual sites.
Therefore, caution shall be exercised in planning and installing such measures to avoid serious disruption of areas
having potential as individual cultural sites.

Significant cultural resources identified during implementation will be avoided or otherwise preserved in place
to the fullest practical extent. If significant cultural resources cannot be avoided or preserved, pertinent information
will be recovered before construction. If there is a significant cultural resources discovery during construction
appropriate notice will be made by SCS to the State Historic Preservation Officer and the National Park Service. Consultation
and coordination have been, and will continue to be, used to ensure the provisions of section 106 of Public Law 89-665
have been met and to include provisions of Public Law 89-523, as amended by Public Law 93-291. The SCS will
take action as prescribed in SCS General Manual, section 420, part 401, to protect or recover any significant cultural
resources discovered during construction.
No threatened or endangered species in the watershed will be affected by the project.
One of the primary objectives of the project is to improve water quality. Sediment input to Little Paint Creek will
be decreased by 16,070 tons or 72 percent. Land treatment practices will reduce loss of soil attached nutrients to
the stream system, thereby reducing stream enrichment and conserving nutrients for plant production.
Fish and wildlife habitats may be temporarily disturbed in some part of the 880 acres of cropland, grassland, and forestland
during installation of land treatment practices, but they will be restored to at least their previous value within
one growing season. The Little Paint Creek stream system will be more suitable for species sensitive to sediment concentrations.
More suitable cover will be provided for upland wildlife by land treatment measures, such as pasture planting, tree
planting, terraces, conservation tillage and timber stand improvement. The value of woodland habitat will increase
with installation of project measures.
No wilderness areas are in the watershed.
Scenic values will be complemented with the diversity added to the dairy farm landscape by conservation land treatment
measures. During installation of the proposed measures, scenic values will be temporarily decreased at specific
locations in the watershed.
No significant adverse environmental impacts will result from installations except for minor inconveniences to
local residents during construction.


Alternatives


The planned action is the most practical means of improving water quality for the stream, protecting the watershed,
stabilizing the eroding lands, and controlling animal waste. Because no significant adverse environmental impacts
will result from installation of the measures, no other alternatives, other than the no project one, were considered.


Consultation_Public Participation


Formal agency consultation began with the initiation of the notification of the State Single Point of Contact for
Federal Assistance in February 1989. The Governor and Iowa Division of Soil Conservation were also notified of the
application for Federal assistance. Agencies were again notified when planning was authorized in August, 1990.
Scoping meetings were held in January 1989, March 1992, and March 1993, and interdisciplinary consultations were
used in all cases. Three Federal agencies (SCS, Forest Service, and Fish & Wildlife Service) two State agencies
(Department of Natural Resources and Division of soil Conservation), two county agencies, and several local groups
were involved in part or all of the scoping and plannning processes.
Specific consultation was conducted with the State Historic Preservation Officer concerning cultural resources
in the watershed. Comments from the State Historic Preservation Officer were used in the development of this plan.
The environmental assessment was transmitted to all participating and interested agencies, groups, and individuals
for review and comment in December 1993. Public meetings were held throughout the planning process to keep all interested
parties informed of the study progress and to obtain public input to the plan and environmental evaluation.
Agency consultation and public participation to date have shown no unresolved conflicts with the implementation
of the selected plan.


Conclusion


The Environmental Assessment summarized above indicates that this Federal action will not cause significant local,
regional, or national impacts on the environment. Therefore, based on the above findings, I have determined that
an environmental impact statement for the Little Paint Creek Watershed Plan is not required.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of termination of countervailing duty 
administrative review.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 
The Department of Commerce (the Department) has terminated the countervailing duty administrative review of leather
from Argentina, initiated on November 27, 1992.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
On October 30, 1992, Camara de la Industria Curtidora Argentina (CICA), and its individually named companies, Curtiembres
Fonseca, Federico Meiners and CIDEC, requested that the Department conduct an administrative review of the countervailing
duty order on leather from Argentina (55 FR 40212; October 2, 1990) for the period January 1, 1991 through December
31, 1991. The requesting member companies of CICA exported leather to the United States during the period of review
and are, therefore, interested parties pursuant to  355.2(i) of the Department's regulations. No other interested
party requested the review. 


On November 27, 1992, the Department initiated the administrative review for that period (55 FR 56318). On February
11, 1993, CICA and its requesting member companies withdrew their request for an administrative review. Since the
request for withdrawal was timely in accordance with 19 CFR 355.22(a)(3), and because we have no reason to deny the
request, the Department is terminating this review. 
This notice is published in accordance with 19 CFR 355.22(a)(3).

Shrimp Fishery Off the Southern Atlantic States 



<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of control date for entry into the rock shrimp component of the shrimp fishery off the southern Atlantic states.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces a control date of April 4, 1994, for the commercial fishery for rock shrimp in the exclusive economic
zone (EEZ) off Florida from Duval through St. Lucie counties. Anyone entering the fishery after April 4, 1994, may
not be assured of future participation in the fishery if a management regime is developed and implemented that limits
the number of participants in the fishery. This notice is intended to discourage new entries into the fishery based
on economic speculation while the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) considers whether and how
participation or effort in the rock shrimp fishery off the Florida counties should be controlled.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Council prepared a Fishery Management Plan for the Shrimp Fishery off the South Atlantic Region (FMP), which is
implemented through regulations at 50 CFR part 659 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management
Act (Magnuson Act). The FMP contains management measures applying to brown, pink, and white shrimp which are caught
in the shrimp fishery off the southern Atlantic states. The shrimp fishery also includes royal red and rock shrimp.
There currently are no regulations for rock shrimp and the Council is considering management measures for this component
of the shrimp fishery. If the Council determines that management is necessary, an amendment to the FMP will be developed
pursuant to the requirements of the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. 




The rock shrimp fishery is prosecuted mainly in the EEZ off Florida from Duval through St. Lucie counties. Florida
produces over 85 percent of U.S. landings of rock shrimp. Rock shrimp landings have varied from 1.8 to 5.4 million pounds
(816.5 to 2,449.4 metric tons) in the past decade. The introduction of peeling machines resulted in the capture of
much smaller shrimp and greatly increased landings in 1989 and 1990. However, in 1991, landings decreased about two-thirds
from the level experienced in 1989 and 1990 even though fishing effort remained at a high level. The rapid decrease
in landings raised concern by industry that overfishing may be occurring. There is also concern about the small size
of shrimp that have been taken. 


In February 1994, the Council held a scoping meeting to solicit input from the industry and public on the management
of rock shrimp. Based on the results of that meeting, the Council began development of options for management of the
rock shrimp fishery. The Council will consider a range of options including area restrictions, seasons, mesh sizes,
count limits, and limited entry. 

In establishing a control date, the Council intends to discourage speculative entry into the rock shrimp fishery
while it discusses possible management regimes. As the Council considers a limited entry or access-controlled management
regime, among other options, some fishermen who do not currently harvest rock shrimp, and never have done so, may decide
to enter the fishery for the sole purpose of establishing a record of making commercial landings of rock shrimp. In
the absence of a control date, such a record generally may be considered indicative of economic dependence on the fishery.
On this basis, the fishermen may successfully lay claim to access to a fishery that is otherwise limited to traditional
participants. When management authorities begin to consider use of a limited access management regime, this speculative
entry often is responsible for a rapid increase in fishing effort in fisheries that are already fully or over-developed.
The original problems become exacerbated by those who seek possible windfall gain from the solutions being discussed.



Establishment of a control date does not commit the Council or NMFS to any particular management regime or criterion
for entry into the rock shrimp fishery. Fishermen are not guaranteed future participation in the rock shrimp fishery
regardless of their date of entry or intensity of participation in the fishery before or after the control date. The
Council may subsequently choose a different control date, or it may choose a management regime that does not make use
of such a date. The Council may choose to give variably weighted consideration to fishermen in the fishery before and
after the control date. Other qualifying criteria, such as documentation of commercial landings and sales, may be
applied for entry. The Council may choose also to take no further action to control entry or access to the fishery.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This patent concerns a device for stemming explosives in a borehole to obtain improved coupling of the energy of the
explosives into the soil or rock adjacent to the borehole. The device includes a cylindrical member having a flexible
sleeve-like liner that conforms to the interior of the cylinder. One end of the liner is turned around an end of the cylindrical
member so that the inner flexible sleeve will evert and empty, thus dropping the granular material that is prepackaged
in the tube around the detonating line and on top of the explosive charge. The stemming device can be lifted to the surface
or can remain in the shothole.




The system has potential use in placing explosive or priming charges for subsurface seismic investigation or quarrying.
The device is considered to be useful in that it improves coupling and can be pre-packaged with selected stemming materials.
The unit should reduce the probability of having the stemming material bridge the borehole and produce a cavity above
the explosive charge.

Under the authority of section 11(a)(2) of the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-502) and section
207 of Title 35, U.S. Code, the Department of the Army as represented by the U.S. Army Engineer Waterways Experiment
Station wishes to license the above-mentioned technology in an exclusive, partially exclusive or non-exclusive
manner to any parties interested in manufacturing and selling devices covered by the above-mentioned patent.

Each interested party is requested to submit a proposal for an exclusive, partially exclusive or non-exclusive license.
The proposals for manufacturing and selling the device covered by the above-mentioned patent will be evaluated using
the following criteria: demonstrated knowledge and capability to manufacture materials used in blasting operations,
evaluation of the applicant's plan to construct the explosive stemming device employing the patent technology,
time required to bring device to market and production rate, royalty offered, technical capability of applicant's
staff in mechanical and explosives engineering as judged by resumes of full time staff, and small business.

Proposals will be accepted for a period of 90 calendar days from the date of notice in the 

Federal Register

<DOCTITLE>Record of Decision for Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (FPEIS) for Dredged Material Disposal
in San Diego Bay, San Diego, CA</DOCTITLE>



Pursuant to section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 and the Council on Environmental
Quality Regulations Implementing NEPA Procedures (40 CFR 1500-1508), the Department of the Navy announces
its decision to implement the final programmatic environmental impact statement (FPEIS) for dredged material disposal
in San Diego Bay, San Diego, California. This decision establishes the framework to guide the Navy in the San Diego
Bay region in making future decisions regarding project-specific dredged material disposal actions. The Navy has
acknowledged that additional project-specific tiered environmental documentation will be undertaken in the future.
Complete details of mitigation applicable for a particular dredged material disposal alternative must await completion
of those future documents.

Examination of disposal alternatives began with a review of locations where historical disposal of dredged material
has taken place in the San Diego Bay region. All reasonable alternatives practicable. They are: beach nourishment,
ocean disposal, upland disposal (existing landfills), habitat enhancement, and fastland creation. The most practicable
candidate disposal site within each alternative (except for upland disposal which has two siting options) were used
as the basis for impact description. Although evaluated, the no action alternative (no dredged material disposal)
and an alternative of limited disposal have been eliminated as prohibitively detrimental to continued Navy mission
in San Diego Bay.

In addition to evaluating the existing environments and the consequences of disposing dredged material for each
of the alternatives, the key issues of limiting criteria, schedule, capacity, and unit cost factors were examined.
These issues will influence the choice of which alternative to select for disposing dredged material from a particular
future project.

The Draft PEIS was prepared by the Navy and distributed to agencies and officials of federal, state and local governments,
citizen groups and associates, public libraries, and other interested parties for review and comment. Over 100 copies
were distributed and a public hearing was held in San Diego on February 18, 1993. No public oral statements were made
and no written comments were received at the public hearing.

Copies of all comments received were included in the Final PEIS. Copies of all comments received were included in the
Final PEIS. All submissions except two were complimentary of the Navy being willing to undertake the significant
effort required to prepare the PEIS. Some comments encouraged Navy to use dredged material for specific purposes
including beach nourishment and habitat enhancement to gain positive benefits associated with such disposal.

The vast majority of comments addressed specific details. Some questioned cited data and others asked for clarification
of interpretations. All errors or omissions pointed out were corrected by revisions or clarifications presented
in the FPEIS.

The most often stated concern addressed the Fastland Creation disposal alternative. This alternative would construct
an aquatic contained disposal facility for contaminated sediment along the San Diego Bay waterfront and would cause
loss of existing bay-bottom habitat. Some commenters suggested the Navy should investigate the potential for disposing
of contaminated sediment in a capped facility somewhere within the Bay, but none identified locations or suggested
where such a facility might be placed.

The key issues still to be resolved are identification of specific dredged material handling methodology and selection
of the final disposal sites for contaminated sediment. While disposal alternatives for contaminated sediment have
been identified in principle, there are many details left unaddressed. For example, disposal at landfill is feasible,
but such disposal requires dewatering and specialized transportation. No mechanisms for such handling are addressed
in the FPEIS, nor can they be addressed until specific disposal needs become known. The Navy will continue to explore
these issues through tiered project-specific environmental documentation.

Questions regarding the Draft and Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement prepared for this action may
be directed to: U.S. Department of the Navy, Southwest Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, 1220 Pacific
Highway, rm 231, San Diego, California 92132-5178 (ATTN: Mr. Lowell Martin, Code 232.LM), telephone (619)

<DOCTITLE>Consumers Power Co., Availability of Final Multiple Project Environmental Assessment</DOCTITLE>


March 29, 1994.


In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the two applications for major license for the existing Hodenpyl and Tippy Hydroelectric Projects, located on the
Manistee River in Manistee and Wexford Counties, in west-central Michigan, and has prepared a final Multiple Project
Environmental Assessment (MPEA) for the projects in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest
Service, Huron-Manistee National Forests.

On November 24, 1993, a draft MPEA was issued and distributed to all parties, and comments were requested on the draft
MPEA to be filed within 45 days. All comments that were filed have been considered in the final MPEA.

In the final MPEA, the Commission and Forest Service staffs analyzed the site-specific and cumulative environmental
effects of the existing projects, as proposed in a Settlement Agreement reached between Consumers Power Company
and the state and Federal resource agencies. The Commission staff has concluded that approval of the applications
for new license, with appropriate enhancement measures, would not constitute a major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment.

Copies of the final MPEA are available in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941
North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426.

Decision and Order 


In the matter of: New Harmony [Case No. CW-001]. 


Background 


The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act, Public Law 94-163, 89 Stat. 917, amended by the National Energy Conservation
Policy Act, Public Law 95-619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987, Public
Law 100-12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988, Public Law 100-357, and the
Energy Policy Act of 1992, Public Law 102-486, 106 Stat. 2776, which requires DOE to prescribe standardized
test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer products, including clothes washers. The
intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption that will assist consumers
in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, subpart B. 
DOE amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 on September 26, 1980, creating the waiver process
(45 FR 64108). Thereafter, DOE further amended the appliance test procedure waiver process to allow the Assistant
Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver from test
procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a Waiver of such prescribed test procedures
(51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986). 
The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to temporarily waive the test procedures for a particular basic
model when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing
according to the prescribed test procedures or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in
a manner so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data.
Waivers generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem
that is the subject of the waiver. 
The Interim Waiver provisions, added by the 1986 amendment, allow the Assistant Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver
when it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver
is denied, if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines
that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition
for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the
Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary. 
Pursuant to  430.27(g), the Assistant Secretary shall publish in the 

Federal Register

 notice of each waiver granted, and any limiting conditions of each waiver. 
In accordance with  430.27 of 10 CFR part 430, on February 2, 1993, New Harmony filed a ``Petition for Waiver''
and an ``Application for Interim Waiver'' regarding its series 1 and 2 clothes washers with the following design features
that differ from those covered by the existing clothes washer test procedure: An internal water heating source; a
various temperature selection capability; and an alternate electrical power supply. On June 15, 1993, the Department
published in the 

Federal Register

 the New Harmony petition and solicited comments, data, and information respecting the petition and granted the requested
Interim Waiver with minor revisions as discussed in the Interim Waiver (58 FR 33089). 
Comments were received from the Whirlpool Corporation (Whirlpool). All comments received were sent to New Harmony
for its rebuttal. The Department consulted with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning the New Harmony petition.
The FTC did not have any objections to the issuance of a Waiver to New Harmony. 


Assertions and Determinations 


New Harmony's petition seeks a Waiver from the DOE test procedure that is based on an external water heating source.
Instead, New Harmony requests the allowance to test its series 1 and 2 clothes washers using an internal heater which
heats the cold inlet water supplied for washing. Since the nature of a water-heating clothes washer is significantly
different than a non-water-heating clothes washer, several issues have developed and have been commented on.
 
The existing test procedure for non-water-heating clothes washers uses inlet water at ``100 
 F

#

10 
 F'' and requires a temperature rise calculation based on water volume which assumes a hot wash temperature of
140 
 F (60 
 C). Thus, the calculation for the warm wash temperature is presumed to be set at 100 
 F (37.8 
 C) which is obtained from assumed equal amounts of hot and cold water being mixed in the clothes washer. For clothes
washers equipped with thermostatically controlled inlet water valves the hot water inlet temperature is set to ``140

 F

#

5 
 F'' and the cold water inlet temperature is set to ``60 
 F

#

5 
 F''. 
New Harmony originally proposed testing their machines utilizing the existing test procedure Temperature Use Factors
(TUFs) for a three temperature selection machine with a slight revision. New Harmony proposed changing the TUF for
the ``hot'' setting from ``30%'' to ``25%'' and adding ``5%'' for the hottest setting on their machines. The Department
did not concur with this proposal because New Harmony did not present any basis for the ``5%'' value. The Department
issued an Interim Waiver with test requirements which were more representative of the existing test procedure. The
Interim Waiver required testing at three temperature settings (hot_140 
 F (60 
 C), warm_100 
 F (38 
 C) and cold_60 
 F (16 
 C)) for maximum and minimum fill conditions. The results of the temperature setting tests were prorated using
the existing test procedure TUFs for a three-temperature selection machine. The combined results for maximum and
minimum fill were prorated using the existing test procedure values.

Whirlpool raised concern about the New Harmony's machines having the capability of heating water higher than 140

 F (60 
 C). The concern is that some consumers will choose a temperature that is higher than 140 
 F (60 
 C) and therefore use more energy than the test would predict. The Department agrees with this concern. However,
the Department also realizes that with New Harmony's variable temperature capability that some consumers may choose
to utilize a ``hot'' temperature setting that is lower than 140 
 F (60 
 C). Furthermore, Proctor and Gamble market survey data for 1975 and 1988/89 reveals that consumer's preference
has changed over the 13 years to use cold washes more frequently. Therefore, the Department has decided that the test
for water-heating clothes washers will be based on the following to reflect the comment received and to be as consistent
as possible with the current test procedure. 




The Department realizes that the ``5%'' use factor at the hottest setting was suggested by New Harmony without any
firm basis, other than anticipated consumer habits. However, the Department believes that New Harmony's assessment
of the anticipated usage factor is the best means of resolving this issue. Additionally, the Department, by deciding
to test the water-heating clothes washers at their respective hottest and coldest settings, will enable the test
procedure to be generic for various clothes washers. For example, if a particular clothes washer's coldest setting
actually demands heat above the specified inlet water temperature, then the energy for this will be considered. Whereas,
if a particular clothes washer's coldest setting prevented any water heating, then there would not be any energy used
to heat the wash water. 
A second issue related to New Harmony's internal heater capability is the method to be used to measure the temperatures
of the water used during the test. Whirlpool suggested that the wash water temperature should reach an equilibrium
temperature prior to the start of the 10 minute wash time required in  2.10. The Department does not concur with
this suggestion because the existing test procedure energy consumption calculations are based on a temperature
rise of the clothes washer inlet water. The Department does not consider a ``traditional'' clothes washer's heat
dissipation of the heated water into the internal clothes washer components. The Department requires the temperature
in the New Harmony's clothes washer be verified to ensure that it at least meets the specified temperature for warm
and hot during the wash cycle; it does not require the clothes washer to maintain the wash temperature. This is a performance
issue for New Harmony and regardless of the operating heating cycle the energy consumption will be reflected in the
energy reporting. Therefore, the Department has deleted the requirement for measuring the temperature at the drain
pipe. 
A third issue related to New Harmony's internal heater capability is the tolerance requirement for temperatures.
Whirlpool contended that the existing test procedure is based on calculations for temperature rises and recorded
volumes, whereas the New Harmony's machines are actually supplying the energy to heat the water. Whirlpool further
contended that a larger temperature tolerance will provide a significant difference in energy requirements. The
Department concurs with the intent of Whirlpool's comment and has tightened the temperature tolerances to reduce
variability in energy reporting. The Department has changed the tolerance for the various temperatures from 

#

5 
 F (

#

2.8 
 C) to a maximum and minimum temperature value with only a 5 
 F (2.8 
 C) range. For example, the inlet water temperature requirement for water-heating clothes washers has been
changed to a maximum of 60 
 F (15.6 
 C) and a minimum of 55 
 F (12.8 
 C). This reduction in the tolerance range will reduce energy reporting variability while maintaining testing
flexibility. This type of tolerance will also ensure that a minimum temperature rise is tested. 
The Interim Waiver had a revised requirement for the ``electrical energy supply'' to allow for the testing of New Harmony's
clothes washers which utilize a higher voltage. In addition to the higher voltage change, the tolerance was changed
from the existing test procedure requirement of ``

#

2 volts'' to ``1 percent'' of the voltage. The Department believes that this increase in tolerance may be too burdensome,
therefore the Department has changed the tolerance to ``1.7 percent'' of the voltage. The 1.7 percent value is equal
to the existing procedure tolerance.

Whirlpool indicated a concern about the definition of ``a water heating clothes washer''. Their concern was that
the proposed definition only considered a machine that provides all of the energy for heating the wash water by the
internal electric heater. Whirlpool believes that the definition should consider the introduction of externally
heated wash water. The Department understands Whirlpool's concern about clothes washers that may have the option
of using externally heated water along with an internal heater. However, New Harmony's machines do not have this capability.
Therefore, this Waiver for New Harmony does not require a definition change nor a test procedure change. The Department
will address this issue in a future general test procedure revision. 
Whirlpool indicated a concern that the Waiver should address the capability of testing a warm rinse. Since New harmony's
machines do not have a warm rinse option, the Department does not agree that this Waiver should have the capability
of testing a warm rinse option. The Department does concur that this issue may be applicable in the future and will address
this issue in a general test procedure revision. 


Conclusion 


It is therefore ordered that: 
(1) The ``Petition for Waiver'' filed by New Harmony [Case No CW-001] is hereby granted as set forth in paragraph
(2) below, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (3), (4), and (5). 
(2) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of section 430.22 or Appendix J of 10 CFR part 430, subpart B, New Harmony
shall be permitted to test its series 1 and 2 clothes washers with the modification set forth below: 
(i) Add new  1.19 and 1.20 in Appendix J to read as follows: 
1.19 

Water-heating clothes washer 

means a clothes washer that has an internal electrical heater which provides all the energy needed to heat water for
washing. 
1.20 

Non-water-heating clothes washer

 means a clothes washer that does not have an internal electrical heater which provides the energy needed to heat water
for washing. 
(ii) Sections 2.2 and 2.3 in Appendix J shall be deleted and replaced with the following: 
2.2 

Electrical energy supply. 

Maintain the electrical supply to the clothes washer terminal block within 1.7 percent of 120/208Y or 120/240 volts

Wisconsin Public Service Corp.; Environmental Impact Statement Scoping 



March 29, 1994. 



The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) has received an application for a new license for the Wausau
Project No. 1999 on the Wisconsin River in Marathon County, Wisconsin. 
The Commission has determined that due to the Wausau Project's proximity to nine other Wisconsin River hydroelectric
projects, and the similar filing time of their license applications, Wausau will be incorporated in the Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) currently being prepared for those nine projects. This multiproject EIS was noticed in the


Federal Register

 on May 6, 1993, and includes; Wisconsin Valley Project No. 2113, Rothschild Project No. 2212, Kings Dam Project No.
2239, Centralia Project No. 2255, Wisconsin Rapids Project No. 2256, Port Edwards Project No. 2291, Nekoosa Project
No. 2292, Jersey Project No. 2476, and Wisconsin River Division Project No. 2590. 

The Commission is conducting scoping for the Wausau Project to identify any significant issues related to the continued
operation of this project. You are invited to send your written scoping comments on the Wausau Project to the Commission
(see below). Staff will review all issues raised in the scoping process. Comments for the Wausau Project will be integrated
with those received for the ongoing Wisconsin River Basin EIS. A public scoping meeting will not be held for the Wausau
project, and a separate scoping document (beyond this notice) will not be prepared for Wausau. 

The Commission previously conducted 3 public scoping meetings (the week of July 12, 1993) and issued scoping documents
(Scoping Document 1 in June 1993, Scoping Document 2 in September 1993, and Supplement to Scoping Document 2 in October
1993) for the ongoing Wisconsin River Basin nine-project EIS. 



Proposed Action 



The Applicant proposes no new construction or increases in hydroelectric capacity for the Wausau Project. The Applicant
proposes only a minor change in project operations. A 25 cubic feet per second (cfs) minimum flow through a kayak channel
is proposed to enhance recreation and aesthetics. The project would continue to be operated in a run-of-river mode
and maintain headpond levels on a daily basis within +/^ 0.3 feet of normal headpond elevation. The Applicant would
continue a 0.5 feet drawdown during the winter to prevent water from splashing over the Taintor gates and forming ice
on the braces. The Applicant would provide a new barrier-free fishing area for the public. 



Project Alternatives 



The Commission Staff (Staff) will consider alternatives, including enhancement measures not proposed by the Applicant.
The Staff will review and consider alternative recommendations for additional resource protection, or enhancement
measures that may be appropriate to include in a new license. Modifications could include recommendations by the
agencies, the general public, and the Staff. 

In addition to these alternatives, Staff will evaluate the no-action alternative, which maintains the existing
environment or status quo at the projects. Under this alternative the projects would continue to operate as required
by the original license on an annual license basis, and no enhancement measures would be provided. We use this alternative
to set baseline environmental conditions for comparison with other alternatives. 



Scope of the Environmental Impact Statement 



The geographic scope of analysis defines the physical limits or boundaries of the proposed actions' effects on the
resources. Since the proposed actions affect each resource differently, the geographic scope for each resource
varies. For fishery resources, flow analysis, water quality, flood control, and power, the geographic scope of analysis
will encompass the main stem Wisconsin River. 

The temporal scope includes a discussion of the past, present, and future actions and their effects on the resources.
Based on the license term, the temporal scope will look 30 to 50 years into the future, concentrating on the effect on
the resource from reasonably foreseeable future actions (e.g., the effect on water quality from potential future
water withdrawals within the basin). The historical discussion will, by necessity, be limited to the amount of available
information for each resource. 



Environmental Issues 



A preliminary list of environmental issues identified by the Staff for coverage in the EIS is presented in this section.
The list is not intended to be exhaustive or final, but is an initial listing of issues that have been raised and appear
to be important. The staff will review all issues raised during the scoping process and make decisions as to the level
of analysis needed. If preliminary analysis indicates that any issues presented in this scoping document have little
potential for causing significant impacts, the issue or issues will be identified and the reasons for not providing
a more detailed analysis will be given. 

The following issues apply to the Wausau Project: 

 Reservoir water level fluctuation and drawdown limitations and their effect on fish habitat, riparian wetlands,
wildlife, cultural resources, recreation, and shoreline development. 

 Minimum flow needs for protection or enhancement of recreation, water quality, and the riverine fishery.


 Fish passage needs at the dam. Fishery protection and enhancement measures related to turbine entrainment
and fish mortality. 

 Effects of project operation on vegetation and wildlife resources. 

 Impacts of project structures on visual resources and potential for enhancements. 

 Opportunities for recreational facility improvements and public access enhancements. 

The EIS will assess the project-specific impacts on the above resources and whether these impacts contribute to significant
adverse impacts. Both project-specific impacts and cumulative effects will weigh in selecting an action to recommend
for the licensing decision on the projects. 



EIS Preparation Schedule 



The preliminary schedule for preparing the EIS for the Wausau Hydroelectric Projects is: 






Request for Comments 



The Commission's scoping objectives are to: 

 Identify significant environmental issues,

 Determine the depth of analysis appropriate to each issue, 

 Identify the resource issues not requiring detailed analysis, and 


 Identify reasonable project alternatives. 

Federal, state, and local resource agencies, licensees and developers, Indian tribes, other interested groups,
and the general public are invited to forward to the Commission any information that they believe will assist the Commission
Staff in conducting an accurate and thorough analysis of the site-specific and cumulative environmental effects
of the proposed licensing activities on the Wisconsin River. The types of information sought include: 

 Information, quantified data, or professional opinion that may contribute to defining the geographical
and temporal scope of the analysis and identifying significant environmental issues. 

 Identification of and information from any other environmental assessment, environmental impact statement,
or similar document or study (previous, on-going, or planned) relevant to the proposed licensing activities in the
Wisconsin River Basin. 

 Existing information and any data that would aid in describing the past and present actions and effects of the
projects and other developmental activities on the physical/chemical, biological, and socioeconomic environments.
For example, fish stocking/management histories, historic water quality data and the reasons for improvement or
degradation of the quality, any wetland habitat losses or proposals to develop land and water resources within the
basin. 

 Identification of any federal, state, or local resource plans and future project proposals that encompass
the Wisconsin River Basin with information on when they'll be implemented, if known. For example, proposals to construct
or operate water treatment facilities, recreation areas, water diversions, or implement fishery management programs.


 Documentation that would support a conclusion that the actions or a project(s) does or does not contribute
to cumulative adverse or beneficial effects on resources and therefore should be excluded from further study or excluded
from further consideration of cumulative effects within the Wisconsin River Basin. Documentation should include,
but is not limited to: how the projects interact with other projects within the river basin and other developmental
activities; results from studies; resource management policies; and reports from federal, state, and local agencies.


To be useful in preparing the multi-project EIS, the requested information must be received by the Commission no later
than 30 days past the date of this notice. Address all communications to: Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
825 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426. 

All correspondence must clearly show at the top of the first page ``Wausau Project, FERC No. 1999''. 

When filing scoping comments, you should submit an original and 8 copies; this will assure that staff receives your
information quickly. Parties to the proceedings (as identified on the official Service List for the Wausau Project)
must also send copies of their filings, and all attachments, to the other parties listed on the official service list.
The official service list is available from the Commission Secretary at the same address above. 

The Commission is simultaneously issuing a notice (REA Notice) indicating that staff is ready to conduct the environmental
analysis for the Wausau Project. Your comments in response to either notice will become part of the record for these
proceedings. You do not need to comment in response to both the REA Notice and this scoping notice. Except, comments
made pursuant to Section 10(j) or Section 18 of the Federal Power Act must be clearly identified and must be received
within the timeframe provided for in the REA notice and 18 CFR 4.34(b)(2). Likewise, the applicant's response to any
comments made under Section 10(j), must be clearly identified and filed within prescribed timeframes as set forth
in the REA Notice and 18 CFR 4.34(b). 

Any questions concerning the scoping process should be directed to Sabina Joe, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
Office of Hydropower Licensing, 825 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, D.C., 20426 (Telephone 202-219-1648).

<DOCTITLE>Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. and Florida Gas Transmission Co.; Abandonment</DOCTITLE>





March 29, 1994.





Take notice that on March 22, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), P.O. Box 2511, Houston, Texas 77252
and Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT), P.O. Box 1188, Houston, Texas 77251, filed a joint application in Docket
No. CP94-300-000 pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon
the exchange of natural gas, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open
to public inspection.



Tennessee and FGT propose to abandon the exchange of natural gas pursuant to a December 10, 1962 Gas Exchange Agreement
included in Tennessee's FERC Gas Tariff as Rate Schedule X-17 and in FGT's FERC Gas Tariff as Rate Schedule E-2.
Tennessee and FGT state that these rate schedules provide for the exchange of natural gas between the parties at the
point where FGT's 24-inch main line crosses Tennessee's 30-inch Delta-Portland Line in Stone County, Mississippi.
Tennessee and FGT state that since both parties have open access transportation certificates and have restructured
their services under Order No. 636, there is no longer a need for the exchange service as certificated by the Commission.




Tennessee states that it notified FGT of its intent to terminate the exchange agreement on April 30, 1993. FGT states
that it agreed to this termination on January 18, 1994.


Tennessee and FGT do not propose to abandon any facilities as a result of the authorization requested.




Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before April 19,
1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.



Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity.
If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing
is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.





Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Tennessee and FGT to
appear or to be represented at the hearing.

On March 9, 1994, the Commission issued an Order Rejecting Amended Tariff Sheet and Rejecting Compliance Filing (Order).
This Order rejects the following two filings made by Transwestern. On January 14, 1994, Transwestern filed a tariff
sheet in order to comply with a Commission order issued December 30, 1993 in Docket No. RP94-60-000, which
accepted and suspended, subject to refund and conditions, Transwestern's November 30, 1993 take-or-pay filing.
On February 7, 1994, Transwestern filed a revised tariff sheet to correct the total amortization amount contained
in the November 30, 1993 filing in compliance with the Commission's Order. Transwestern is clarifying certain aspects
of the above-mentioned filings and is also submitting corrected tariff sheets. 

Transwestern is also filing tariff sheets to adhere to the Commission's Order which rejected the tariff language
on Sheet 90A that described the exit point methodology. Revised Sheet 90A describes the computation of the surcharge
as it is actually calculated. 

Transwestern states that copies of the filing were served on its gas utility customers, interested state commissions,
and all parties to this proceeding. 

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before April 5, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission

77002, filed in Docket No. CP94-307-000 a request pursuant to  157.205 of the Commission's Regulations
under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) for authorization to install and operate a tap and metering facilities at
a new point of delivery for the transportation of natural gas volumes to Amoco Production Company's (Amoco) Empire
Abo Plant located in Eddy County, New Mexico under Transwestern's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-534-000
pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection.

Transwestern states that Amoco would build approximately thirty feet of 2-inch pipeline from the suction side of
its plant to interconnect with Transwestern's proposed metering facilities to be located on Transwestern's existing
LEC 10-inch lateral. Transwestern further states that it would transport natural gas pursuant to its blanket transportation
certificate authority to accommodate gas deliveries to Amoco. Transwestern says that the gas volumes delivered
by it would be used for engine fuel at Amoco's plant.

Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention
and pursuant to  157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to
section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

Background 


The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act, Public Law 94-163, 89 Stat. 917, amended by the National Energy Conservation
Policy Act, Public Law 95-619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987, Public
Law 100-12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988, Public Law 100-357, and the
Energy Policy Act of 1992, Public Law 102-486, 106 Stat. 2776, which requires DOE to prescribe standardized
test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer products, including clothes washers. The
intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption that will assist consumers
in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, subpart B. 

DOE amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 on September 26, 1980, creating the waiver process
(45 FR 64108). Thereafter, DOE further amended the appliance test procedure waiver process to allow the Assistant
Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver from test
procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures
(51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986). 

The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to temporarily waive the test procedures for a particular basic
model when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing
according to the prescribed test procedures or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in
a manner so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data.
Waivers generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem
that is the subject of the waiver. 

The Interim Waiver provisions, added by the 1986 amendment, allow the Assistant Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver
when it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver
is denied, if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines
that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition
for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the
Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary. 

Pursuant to  430.27(g), the Assistant Secretary shall publish in the 

Federal Register

 notice of each waiver granted, and any limiting conditions of each waiver.

In accordance with  430.27 of 10 CFR part 430, on April 8, 1993, Asko filed a Petition for Waiver regarding its
clothes washer models 10504, 12004, and 20004, with the following design features that differ from those covered
by the existing clothes washer test procedure: An internal electrical heater for heating wash water; a continuously
variable wash water temperature control; 208/240 volt electrical power supply; and machine-controlled water fill
capability. On April 26, 1993, Asko filed an Application for Interim Waiver and on May 11, 1993, Asko subsequently
submitted an amendment to the Application for Interim Waiver upon DOE's request for additional information to allow
the Department to make its determination of the economic hardship and/or competitive disadvantage likely to result
if DOE fails to grant the Application for Interim Waiver. On September 7, 1993, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 the Asko petition and solicited comments, data, and information respecting the petition and granted the requested
Interim Waiver in its entirety (58 FR 47130). 

Comments were received from the Whirlpool Corporation (Whirlpool) and Speed Queen Company (Speed Queen). All comments
received were sent to Asko for its rebuttal. The Department consulted with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning
the Asko petition. The FTC did not have any objections to the issuance of a waiver to Asko. 



Assertions and Determinations 



Asko's petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test procedure that is based on an external water heating source. Instead,
Asko requests the allowance to test its clothes washer models 10504, 12004, and 20004 using an internal heater which
heats the cold inlet water supplied for washing. Since the nature of a water-heating clothes washer is significantly
different from a nonwater-heating clothes washer, several issues have developed and have been commented on. 

The existing test procedure for non-water-heating clothes washers uses inlet water at ``100
 F

#

10
 F'' and requires a temperature rise calculation based on water volume which assumes a hot wash temperature of
140
 F (60
 C). Thus, the calculation for the warm wash temperature is presumed to be set at 100
 F (37.8
 C) which is obtained from assumed equal amounts of hot and cold water being mixed in the clothes washer. For clothes
washers equipped with thermostatically controlled inlet water valves the hot water inlet temperature is set to ``140
 F

#

5
 F'' and the cold water inlet temperature is set to ``60
 F

#

5
 F''. 

Asko originally proposed testing its clothes washers utilizing four equally weighted tests. Asko proposed that
two of the tests be conducted at 140
 F (60
 C) (one for maximum fill and one for minimum fill) and the remaining two tests be conducted at 68
 F (20
 C) (one for maximum fill and one for minimum fill). The Department did not concur with this proposal and issued
an Interim Waiver with test requirements which were more representative of the existing test procedure. The Interim
Waiver required testing at three temperature settings (hot_140
 F (60
 C), warm_100
 F (38
 C and cold_60
 F (16
 C)) for maximum and minimum fill conditions. The results of the temperature setting tests were prorated using
the existing test procedure Temperature Use Factors for a three temperature selection machine. The combined results
for maximum and minimum fill were prorated using the existing test procedure values. Whirlpool and Speed Queen raised
concern about the Asko's machines having the capability of heating water higher than 140
 F (60
 C). The concern is that some consumers will choose a temperature that is higher than 140
 F (60
 C) and therefore use more energy than the test would predict. The Department agrees with this concern. However,
the Department also realizes that with Asko's variable temperature capability that some consumers may choose to
utilize a ``hot'' temperature setting that is lower than 140
 F (60
 C). Furthermore, Proctor and Gamble market survey data for 1975 and 1988/89 reveal that consumers' preferences
have changed over the 13 years to use cold washes more frequently. Therefore, the Department has decided that the test
for water-heating clothes washers will be based on the following to reflect the comments received and to be as consistent
as possible with the current test procedure. 



 


Additionally, the Department, by deciding to test the water-heating clothes washers at their respective, hottest
and coldest, settings, will enable the test procedure to be generic for various clothes washers. For example, if a
particular clothes washer's coldest setting actually demands heat above the specified inlet water temperature,
then the energy for this will be considered. Whereas, if a particular clothes washer's coldest setting prevents any
water heating, then there would not be any energy used to heat the wash water.

A second issue related to Asko's internal heater capability is the method to be used to measure the temperatures of
the water used during the test. Whirlpool suggested that the wash water temperature should reach an equilibrium temperature
prior to the start of the 10 minute wash time required in section 2.10. The Department does not concur with this suggestion
because the existing test procedure energy consumption calculations are based on a temperature rise of the clothes
washer inlet water. The Department does not consider a ``traditional'' clothes washer's heat dissipation of the
heated water into the internal clothes washer components. The Department requires the temperature in the Asko's
clothes washer be verified to ensure that it at least meets the specified temperature for warm and hot during the wash
cycle; it does not require the clothes to maintain the wash temperature. This is a performance issue for Asko and regardless
of the operating heating cycle the energy consumption will be reflected in the energy reporting. 

A third issue related to Asko's internal heater capability is the tolerance requirement for temperatures. Whirlpool
contended that the existing test procedure is based on calculations for temperature rises and recorded volumes,
whereas the Asko's machines are actually supplying the energy to heat the water. Whirlpool further contended that
a larger temperature tolerance will provide a significant difference in energy requirements. The Department concurs
with the intent of Whirlpool's comment and has tightened the temperature tolerances to reduce variability in energy
reporting. The Department has changed the tolerance for the various temperatures from 

#

5
 F (

#

2.8
 C) to a maximum and minimum temperature value with only a 5
 F (2.8
 C) range. For example, the inlet water temperature requirement for water-heating clothes washers has been
changed to a maximum of 60
 F (15.6
 C) and a minimum of 55
 F (12.8
 C). This reduction in the tolerance range will reduce energy reporting variability while maintaining testing
flexibility. This type of tolerance will also ensure that a minimum temperature rise is tested. 


Speed Queen commented on the requirement for the inlet water temperature. Speed Queen proposed that the inlet water
temperature be set to 50
 F (10
 C) in lieu of 60
 F (16
 C). Speed Queen's concern was based on the fact that the existing test procedure uses a 90
 F temperature rise in the calculations. The Department does not concur with the Speed Queen suggestion. As indicated
above, the Department is changing the amended test procedure to include a test at the hottest temperature setting
which will be conducted on a temperature range which is greater than 90
 F. In addition, the Department believes that a 50
 F (10
 C) inlet water requirement may be too burdensome. In many cases the inlet water would have to be cooled to obtain
the 50
 F (10
 C) temperature. 

Asko's petition also addressed its design feature which will automatically control the water level in the clothes
washer based on the clothes load. Whirlpool and Speed Queen both had concerns about the use of variable test loads to
activate a maximum or minimum fill for testing. The concern was that the absorption of the test cloth will introduce
an additional variable. Both Whirlpool and Speed Queen suggested using the existing test procedure's test loads
(3 lbs. at minimum fill and 7 lbs. at maximum fill). The Department concurs with the Whirlpool and Speed Queen suggestion,
however, the testing conducted will be representative of consumer minimum and maximum test loads and not the minimum
and maximum test load capability of the Asko machines. The Department also realizes that this will cause the calculations
for Asko's clothes washer total energy consumption at minimum fill to go up and total energy consumption at maximum
fill to go down. The Department may revise the test load requirements for all clothes washers in the future to reflect
consumer habits if usage data becomes available regarding automatic fill controls. 

Whirlpool also recommended that the Department change the requirement for the test load test cloth. Whirlpool recommended
that a test cloth more representative of actual consumer habits be utilized verses the energy test cloth specified
in section 2.6. The Department does not agree with Whirlpool's suggestion for Asko's petition because it is not unique
to Asko's Petition. The test procedure requires the same test cloth for all front load machines. The Department recommends
that this type of comment be presented during a ruling to revise the entire test procedure. 

The Interim Waiver had a revised requirement for the ``electrical energy supply'' to allow for the testing of Asko's
clothes washers which use a higher voltage. In addition to the higher voltage change, the tolerance was changed from
the existing test procedure requirement of ``

#

2 volts'' to ``1 percent'' of the voltage. The Department believes that this increase in tolerance may be too burdensome,
therefore the Department has changed the tolerance to ``1.7 percent'' of the voltage. The 1.7 percent value is equal
to the existing procedure tolerance.

<DOCTITLE>Appliance and Equipment Energy Efficiency Standards: Public Meetings To Discuss Evaluation Criteria for the Voluntary
Programs to Provide Energy Efficiency Information for Luminaires and Commercial Office Equipment </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Department of Energy.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of public meetings.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires the Department of Energy (DOE or Department) to support voluntary national
testing and information programs for those types of luminaires and commercial office equipment that are widely used,
and show potential for significant energy savings. Not later than October 24, 1995, DOE must determine whether the
voluntary programs thus created by members of those industries are consistent with the objectives set forth in the
legislation. 



In order to determine what specific criteria will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the voluntary programs,
the Department will hold two public meetings and invite interested parties for each program to offer suggestions
concerning methods of evaluation. All persons are hereby given notice of the opportunity to submit written comments
and to attend the public meetings. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

1. Authority 



The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT; Pub. L. 102-486) identified several new categories of products and equipment
for inclusion in a range of required and voluntary testing and information programs to promote energy efficiency.
Under sections 125 and 126 of EPACT, the Secretary of Energy, after consulting with industry associations and other
interested organizations, is to provide technical and financial assistance to support voluntary national testing
and information programs for those types of commercial office equipment and luminaires that are widely used, and
for which there is a potential for significant energy savings as a result of such programs. These test procedures will
provide information that when conveyed to consumers, will enable purchasers of such equipment to assess the energy
consumption and potential cost savings of alternative products.

2. Background 



The voluntary programs for commercial office equipment and luminaires will be developed by separate organizations
composed of interested parties associated with each industry, and the efforts to develop these programs will be monitored
and evaluated by the Secretary of Energy. Not later than three years after the date of enactment of EPACT (October 24,
1995), the Secretary shall make a determination as to whether the voluntary programs are positioned to achieve the
objectives established for the sale and purchase of commercial office equipment and luminaires. If the Secretary
determines that either of the voluntary programs is not consistent with the objectives of the legislation, the Secretary
shall, after consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, develop test procedures for
that set of products. One year later, the Federal Trade Commission will prescribe labeling rules. 

The Department recognizes that the clarification of evaluation criteria is an important guiding element as the testing
and information programs take shape. As part of the monitoring and evaluation process, DOE would like to solicit comments
on how the evaluation criteria should be determined within the context of the emerging programs. After oral and written
comments have been submitted, DOE will analyze the suggestions, determine the specific evaluation criteria, and
publish its findings in the 

Federal Register

. 



3. Discussion 



The purpose of the public meeting is twofold: (1) To provide an opportunity to inform DOE on the progress of the voluntary
programs; and (2) to request suggestions from all interested parties on the best means of evaluating the potential
effectiveness of the programs. 

Some specific areas for comment are identified below; however, these areas are not intended to limit the content of
submissions. 

 The type, use, and standardization of test procedures. 

 The extent of market penetration represented by the products selected as ``widely used'' and the extent of
participation across the respective industries. 

 The dissemination of information to potential consumers. 

 The amount of energy saved. 

 Provisions to update the program in future years and incorporate new products. 

 Provisions for DOE to monitor the progress of the program. 



4. Public Meeting Procedure 




DOE will make a presentation at the outset of each meeting to provide background and explain the goals for the meeting.
DOE will then accept oral comments limited to a time which will be set in light of the number of persons who request to
speak. The official conducting the meeting will accept comments and questions from those attending to afford the
DOE staff and interested parties an opportunity to discuss and explore issues surrounding the proposed evaluation
criteria.

<USBUREAU>Office of Hearings and Appeals</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Issuance of Decisions and Orders; Week of January 3 Through January 7, 1994</DOCTITLE>



During the week of January 3 through January 7, 1994, the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with respect
to applications for exception or other relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy.
The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.




Request for Exception 





Fletcher & Associates, Ltd, 1/7/94, LEE-0051

 


Fletcher & Associates, Ltd. (Fletcher) filed an Application for Exception from the provision of filing Form
EIA-782B, entitled ``Reseller/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' In considering the
request, the DOE found that the firm was not adversely affected by the reporting burden in a way that is significantly
different from the burden borne by similar reporting firms. Thus, Fletcher did not demonstrate that it is experiencing
serious hardship or gross inequity. Moreover, since the firm is a ``certainty firm,'' it could not be granted relief
from filing. Accordingly, exception relief was denied. 



Refund Applications 



Atlantic Richfield Company/Land O'Lakes, Inc., 1/3/94, RF304-8934, RF304-15436

 


The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for refund filed by Land O'Lakes, Inc. (Land O'Lakes) in
the Atlantic Richfield Company Subpart V special refund proceeding. In order to qualify for a refund based upon the
ARCO products sold to its member-patrons, cooperatives such as Land O'Lakes need only document their purchases from
ARCO and certify that any refunds will be passed along to its member-patrons. However, in 1987, Land O'Lakes transferred
all of its petroleum supply business to Farmers Union Central Exchange, Inc. (CENEX). As Land O'Lakes no longer serves
its former petroleum patrons, the DOE determined that CENEX'S existing patronage system is the best available mechanism
to distribute refund monies to former Land O'Lakes patrons. CENEX has certified that it will notify its Board of Directors
of any refunds that are obtained by CENEX in the ARCO proceeding as a result of the Application filed by Land O'Lakes.
CENEX has also certified that it will then distribute those refunds to its patrons in accordance with its established
patronage dividends systems. The DOE determined that Land O'Lakes and CENEX had met the requirements applicable
to a cooperative for a full volumetric refund and granted CENEX a refund of $40,156. 

In addition, the DOE granted Land O'Lakes a reseller refund of $3,826 based on its purchases of 7,505,261 gallons of
ARCO products it sold to non-members.

Stanley Furniture Company, 1/5/94, RF272-57523

 


The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund filed on behalf of Stanley Furniture Company
in the crude oil special refund proceeding being disbursed by the DOE under 10 CFR part 205, Subpart V. The DOE determined
that the refund claim was meritorious and granted a refund of $2,948. In granting the Application, the DOE determined
that ``finishing material'' was not a covered product and, therefore, not eligible for a refund because it was not
purchased from a refinery. Stanley's claim was reduced by the amount of gallons claimed for ``finishing material.''

 


Texaco Inc./Bryan Texaco Station, 1/7/94, RF321-20013

 


The DOE issued a Supplemental Order concerning an Application for Refund filed by Petroleum Funds, Inc. (PFI) on behalf
of Bryan Texaco Station and Herman Hudson. Bryan Texaco Station was granted a refund in Texaco Inc./Harley's Texaco,
Case No. RF321-340. (October 9, 1991). The DOE received another Application on behalf of Bryan Texaco Station
filed by Bill Wilfong. Mr. Wilfong claimed and documented ownership dates that overlapped with those claimed by Mr.
Hudson. In response to a request for documentation of Mr. Hudson's ownership dates, PFI informed the DOE that Mr. Hudson
did not own Bryan Texaco Station during the period he claimed in his Application. Accordingly, the Supplemental Order
rescinds Mr. Hudson's refund and makes PFI and Mr. Hudson jointly liable for repayment of the refund.

 


Texaco Inc./Hicone Texaco, 1/7/94, RR321-137

 


The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a Motion for Reconsideration filed by Robert Robinson in the Texaco Inc.
Subpart V special refund proceeding on behalf of Hicone Texaco (Hicone). The DOE had previously denied Hicone's Application
for Refund on the basis that Hicone was not a purchaser or consignee of Texaco refined petroleum products but rather
a consignee for Lee Oil Company (Lee) and, therefore, not eligible to receive a refund in the Texaco proceeding. However,
in the Motion for Reconsideration, Hicone presented evidence that the business arrangement between Hicone and its
supplier, Lee, was such that Hicone was more similar to an indirect purchaser of Texaco products than a consignee for
Lee. The DOE, as a discretionary matter, reviewed the Motion and determined that it should be granted. Accordingly,
Mr. Robinson was granted a refund of $314 ($228 principal plus $86 interest) as an indirect purchaser of Texaco products.

 


Texaco Inc./Tabbaa Oil Et Al., 1/7/94, RF321-14309 Et Al.

 


The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning 14 Applications for Refund filed in the Texaco Inc. Subpart V special
refund proceeding by indirect purchasers which purchased Texaco products from Cook & Cooley (C&C), a Texaco
jobber located in Long Beach, California. On October 22, 1993, the DOE issued a Decision and Order in the Texaco proceeding
which determined that C&C had been injured in its purchases of Texaco products. Texaco Inc./Cook & Cooley,
23 DOE 
 85,158 (1993). Based on a detailed showing of C&C's costs and prices during the refund period, the DOE concluded
that (i) C&C had absorbed the full amount of any overcharges it had incurred in its purchases from Texaco of premium
and unleaded gasoline and (ii) C&C absorbed 58 percent of the overcharges for its purchases of regular gasoline.
Consequently, the DOE concluded that the indirect purchasers supplied by C&C incurred 42 percent of the impact
of Texaco's alleged overcharges in sales of regular gasoline. For their purchases of premium and unleaded gasoline,
indirect purchasers supplied by C&C would not have been injured because the overcharges were absorbed by C&C.
Regular gasoline constituted 48.3 percent of C&C's purchases from Texaco. In the absence of more accurate data
regarding the applicant's purchases, the DOE assumed that regular gasoline also constituted 48.3 percent of the
purchases made by C&C's customers. Consequently, the applicants in this decision were granted refunds based
on 20.3 percent of their purchases (.42 x .483).

<DOCTITLE>Issuance of Decisions and Orders; Week of February 14 Through February 18, 1994</DOCTITLE>



During the week of February 14 through February 18, 1994, the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with
respect to applications for exception or other relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department
of Energy. The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings
and Appeals. 



Request for Exception 



C. Parker Oil Co., Inc., 2/18/94, LEE-0042 



C. Parker Oil Co., Inc., (Parker) filed an Application for Exception from the provision of filing Form EIA-782B,
entitled ``Reseller/Retailer's Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' The exception request, if granted,
would permit Parker to be exempted from filing Form EIA-782B. The Department issued a Decision and Order which
determined that the exception request be denied since the firm had not shown that it was experiencing a serious hardship,
gross inequity, or unfair distribution of burdens. 



Refund Applications 




Stepan Company, 2/18/94, RF272-16338, RD272-16338 



The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund filed on behalf of Stepan Company in the crude
oil special refund proceeding being administered by the DOE under 10 CFR part 205, Subpart V. The DOE determined that
the refund claim was meritorious and granted a refund of $57,222. The DOE also denied a Motion for Discovery filed by
a consortium of States and two Territories and rejected their challenge to the claim. The DOE denied the States' Objections,
finding that the industry-wide econometric data submitted by the States did not rebut the presumption that the Applicant
was injured by the crude oil overcharges. In granting the Application, the DOE determined that mixed xylene and ortho-xylene
were essentially xylene, a product eligible for a refund in the crude oil proceeding. 




Westinghouse Electric Corporation-Technology & Quality Center, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, 2/18/94,
RF272-16739, RD272-16739, RD272-93803 



The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning two Applications for Refund filed on behalf of Westinghouse Electric
Corporation-Technology & Quality Center and Westinghouse Electric Corporation in the crude oil special refund
proceeding being administered by the DOE under 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart V. The DOE determined that the refund claim
was meritorious and granted a refund of $31,990. The DOE also denied a Motion for Discovery filed by a consortium of
States and two Territories and rejected their challenge to the claim. The DOE denied the States' Objections, finding
that the industry-wide econometric data submitted by the States did not rebut the presumption that the Applicant
was injured by the crude oil overcharges.

<DOCTITLE>Issuance of Decisions and Orders; Week of February 21 Through February 25, 1994 </DOCTITLE>



During the week of February 21 through February 25, 1994, the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with
respect to appeals and applications for other relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department
of Energy. The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings
and Appeals. 



Appeal 



Ed Bricker, 2/22/94, LFA-0349

 


Ed Bricker filed an Appeal from a partial denial by the Office of Inspector General (IG) of a request for information
submitted under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Eight of the documents responsive to Bricker's requests were
withheld in their entirety pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C), and certain material in 18 other responsive documents
was withheld pursuant to the same two exemptions. Subsequent to the filing of Bricker's Appeal, the IG informed the
Office of Hearings and Appeals that it had adopted new policies regarding its withholding of information under the
two exemptions. The IG stated that because these policies were not in place at the time of its initial determination,
an additional review of the documents at issue would result in more information being released to the appellant. In
light of these changes, the matter was remanded to the IG to conduct a further review of the documents so that additional
information could be released. In all other respects, the Appeal was denied.

Title: 

1994 Industrial Laundries Questionnaire (EPA No. 1685.01).



Abstract: 

This is a new information collection sponsored by the Office of Water in support of the development of technology-based
effluent limitations guidelines pursuant to the Clean Water Act. The development of effluent limitations for the
industrial laundries industry is required by court order to be proposed by 12/31/96. The questionnaire will be mandatory
pursuant to section 308 of the Clean Water Act.

The survey respondents will be randomly selected using the information gathered from the industrial laundries screener
survey (OMB Control No. 2040-0163). Respondents will be asked to complete a two-part questionnaire, providing
information that includes:

(1) Quality and type of items accepted by industrial laundries,

(2) Water use and waste characteristics,

(3) Current waste/wastewater treatment operations and waste minimization practices,

(4) Cost of industrial laundry operations and treatment capacity,

(5) Market characteristics for industrial laundry services,

(6) Financial information,

(7) The extent of facility operations unrelated to industrial laundering and the liquidation value of their industrial
laundering operations, and

(8) The number of facility employees. As a follow-up to the questionnaire, a subset of respondents will be requested
to provide last year's wastewater monitoring data.

EPA will use the information to develop effluent limitations guidelines and standards that reflect the best available
technology within economically achievable limitations and the best practicable control technology.



Burden Statement: 

Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 85 hours per response for the two-part
questionnaire and an additional 2 hours per response for the subset of respondents providing monitoring data. This
includes time for reviewing instructions, gathering and compiling the data needed, and completing and reviewing
the questionnaires.



Respondents: 

Facilities engaged in industrial laundering in the United States such as hotels, hospitals, and prisons that accept
laundry from off-site.



Estimated Number of Respondents: 

250 industrial laundry facilities and 50 hotels, hospitals, or prisons.



Estimated Number of Responses Per Respondent: 

1.



Frequency of Collection: 

One time.



Estimated Total Annual Burden On Respondents:

<USDEPT>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Responsible Accounting Officers: Accounting for Work Force Reduction Programs



Recently, it has come to our attention that there is a lack of uniformity among the carriers in accounting for work force
reduction programs under part 32. Several carriers have announced work force reduction programs in 1993 and have
indicated that they plan to record the entire effects on their 1993 SEC Form 10-K filing in conformance with GAAP.
Some of these carriers propose to follow this same accounting under part 32 while others propose to account for these
programs under part 32 as the programs are implemented. The reason for this letter, therefore, is to establish uniformity
in accounting for these work force reduction programs and to remind carriers of the Commission's policy with respect
to the application of GAAP under part 32. The accounting reflected herein should be reported in the ARMIS filings that
are due at the Commission on or before April 1, 1994.

The Commission's policy on GAAP is set forth in  32.12(a) of its rules. This Section states that ``The company's
financial records shall be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to the extent permitted
by this system of accounts.'' Thus, it is our belief that if a carrier is recording and event for financial reporting
purposes pursuant to GAAP, then the carrier should also record this event for part 32 federal accounting purposes
unless part 32 prohibits the action or we have specifically advised the carrier to do otherwise.

The Commission's policy on new GAAP standards is set forth in  32.16(a) of its rules. This Section states that
``[The company's records and accounts shall be adjusted to apply new accounting standards prescribed by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board or successor authoritative accounting standard-setting groups, in a manner consistent
with generally accepted accounting principles. Commission approval of a change in accounting standard will automatically
take effect 90 days after the company informs this Commission of its intention to follow the new standard, unless the
Commission notifies the company to the contrary * * *].''

The Commission's policy with respect to uniformity of accounting standards for the industry is contained in the GAAP
Order.
 The GAAP Order included the following statements demonstrating our intention to maintain uniformity of accounting
standards for telephone companies: 





To promote the needed consistency and uniformity industry wide to properly carry out our regulatory responsibilities,
we are applying the same accounting standards to all carriers.
 Furthermore, in order to maintain control over the USOA so that uniformity is maintained for all carriers, the Commission
will select the accounting method carriers are to use under GAAP when GAAP permits several accounting options. The
carriers will use the accounting method selected by the Commission unless we grant them a waiver to do otherwise.







Based on the above guidelines, we see no basis for carriers to give accounting recognition to work force reductions
for Form 10-K purposes but not for part 32 purposes. Since part 32 does not specifically address work force reductions,
the proper accounting should be determined by applying the criteria established under GAAP to the circumstances
of the work force reduction. We see no way that the same GAAP criteria applied to the same facts can result in accounting
recognition under GAAP in one instance and not another. Accordingly, carriers that are showing liabilities, and
one time charges for work force reductions in their 10-K reports for 1993 should reflect the work force reduction
in their 1993 ARMIS filings.

At the same time, we recognize that part 32 accounting and reporting may require modification to accommodate the Commission's
regulatory needs. We believe that the accounting for work force reductions is such a case. Carriers recording liabilities
for work force reductions shall record such amounts in Accounts 4120, Other Accrued Liabilities, and 4360, Other
Deferred Credits, for the current and noncurrent portions, respectively, and shall charge Account 7360, Other Nonoperating
Income. When the restructuring expenses are actually paid Nonoperating Income. When the restructuring expenses
are actually paid or otherwise require part 32 recognition (for example, adjustment of the transition benefit obligation
for the reductions under SFAS 106), they will be charged to the appropriate part 32 expense accounts with a credit to
cash or other appropriate account. At the same time, the liability established in Accounts 4120 and 4360 will be debited
and Account 7360 will be credited. This accounting will recognize the liability consistent with GAAP, will show the
effect of the restructuring on net income, and will allow delayed recognition in the regulatory operating accounts
until the detailed amounts are known and amounts have actually been paid. The balance in Account 4360 related to these
entries should not be deducted from the ratebase because it arose from charges to a below the line account.

This letter is issued pursuant to authority delegated under  0.291 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR  0.291.
Applications for review under  1.115 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR  1.115, must be filed within 30
days of the date of this letter. See 47 CFR  1.4(b)(2).

<DOCTITLE>The Daiwa Bank, Limited; Application To Engage in Certain Nonbanking Activities</DOCTITLE>


The Daiwa Bank, Limited, Osaka, Japan (Applicant), has applied pursuant to  4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act
(12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and  225.23 of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23), to engage 

de novo

 through Cosmo Securities (America) Inc., New York, New York (Company), in the following nonbanking activities:

1. Providing discount and full service securities brokerage services pursuant to  225.25(b)(15)(i) and (ii) of Regulation
Y; and

2. Purchasing and selling all types of securities as a riskless principal on the order of customers where Company may
retain a position in the securities for up to seven days.

Applicant seeks approval to conduct the proposed activities throughout the United States and the world. 

Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects.

A particular activity may be found to meet the closely related to banking test if it is demonstrated that banks have
generally provided the proposed activity; that banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally
similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity; or that banks
generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provision
in a specialized form. National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors, 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition,
the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationship
to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806 (1984).

The Board previously has determined by regulation that full service brokerage activities, when conducted within
the limitations established by the Board in its regulations and in related interpretations and orders, are closely
related to banking for purposes of section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. See 12 CFR 225.25(b)(15). In addition, the Board
previously has determined by order that riskless principal activities, when conducted within the limitations established
by the Board in its previous orders, are closely related to banking. See, e.g., J.P. Morgan & Company Inc., 76 Federal
Reserve Bulletin 26 (1990); Bankers Trust New York Corporation, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 829 (1989). In addition,
the Board has modified certain conditions contained in these orders for foreign banking organizations to address
certain issues raised by an organization's foreign status and to avoid extending U.S. bank supervisory standards
to foreign banks. See, e.g., The Royal Bank of Canada, 77 Federal Reserve Bulletin 272 (1991); Canadian Imperial Bank
of Commerce, et al., 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 158 (1990).

Applicant maintains that Company will conduct the proposed activities in conformity with the conditions and limitations
established by the Board by regulation or in prior cases, except that Company, in conducting its riskless principal
activities, proposes to retain a position in securities for a period of up to seven days in the event that Company is
unable to execute a customer's order in full in a single transaction. Riskless principal refers to a transaction in
which a broker-dealer, after receiving an order to buy (or sell) a security from a customer, purchases (or sells) the
security for its own account to offset a contemporaneous sale to (or purchase from) the customer. See 75 Federal Reserve
Bulletin at 831. Applicant does not believe that the offsetting transactions need to occur on the same day in order
to be contemporaneous. Rather, Applicant believes that a purchase or sale should be regarded as contemporaneous
if it occurs promptly following the time it reasonably takes to complete the offsetting transaction. Furthermore,
Applicant believes that the absence of market risk (as opposed to customer credit risk) is the key element in riskless
principal transactions. Applicant states that Company will have a binding contractual commitment by its customer
to buy or sell a given security before Company effects the offsetting transaction as a principal. Applicant does not
believe that a time lapse between the two sides of the transaction creates a market risk for Company.

In order to satisfy the proper incident to banking test, section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act requires the Board to find that
the performance of the activities by Company can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as
greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency that outweigh possible adverse effects, such
as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking
practices. Applicant believes that the proposed activities will benefit the public by promoting competition. Applicant
also believes that approval of this application will allow Company to provide a wider range of services and added convenience
to its customers. Applicant believes that the proposed activities will not result in any unsound banking practices
or other adverse effects.

In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice
of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application
and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the
BHC Act.

Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than April 29, 1994. Any request for
a hearing on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be
accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying
specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing,
and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.

This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed Consent Order from El Portal Luggage, Inc.

The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for receipt of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed Order contained in the agreement.

This matter concerns the misrepresentation of the country-of-origin of certain luggage products of foreign manufacture
that the proposed respondent offers for sale. The Commission's proposed Complaint alleges that some of the goods
that El Portal Luggage, Inc. offers for sale are foreign-made, and that when El Portal Luggage, Inc. receives these
goods they have labels attached that indicate the country-of-origin. The proposed complaint further alleges that
El Portal Luggage, Inc. deliberately removed the country-of-origin labels during a period when El Portal's window
and in-store signage emphasized that many of the products it offered for sale were of domestic manufacture. Finally,
the proposed Complaint alleges that these activities represented, directly or by implication, that the goods without
foreign-origin labels were manufactured in the United States. The representation is alleged to violate section
5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45, because the goods with the labels removed were not manufactured
in the United States.

The proposed Consent Order prohibits the proposed respondent from misrepresenting, directly or by implication,
the identity of the country-of-origin of any product. It also prohibits the proposed respondent from removing, altering,
obliterating, or concealing any country-of-origin designation that is attached to any product the proposed respondent
receives and offers for sale.

Finally, the proposed Consent Order contains provisions requiring record retention demonstrating compliance
with the Order; distribution of the Order to employees; notification to the Commission of any changes in the structure
of the corporation; and reports to the Commission demonstrating compliance with the terms of the Order.

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment of the proposed Order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.

of the divestiture of the Assets To Be Divested is to ensure the continuation of the Assets To Be Divested as ongoing
viable pharmacies engaged in the same businesses in which the Assets To Be Divested are presently employed and to remedy
the lessening of competition resulting from the acquisition as alleged in the Commission's complaint.

(6) months of such repossession.

It is further ordered that:

To Be Divested within one (1) year of the date this Order becomes final, Respondents shall consent to the appointment
by the Commission of a trustee to divest the Assets To Be Divested. Provided, however, that if the Commission has not
approved or disapproved a proposed divestiture within 120 days of the date the application for such divestiture has
been put on the public record, the running of the divestiture period shall be tolled until the Commission approves
or disapproves the divestiture. In the event the Commission or the Attorney General brings an action pursuant to section
5(l) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. section 45(l), or any other statute enforced by the Commission,
Respondents shall consent to the appointment of a trustee in such action. Neither the appointment of a trustee nor
a decision not to appoint a trustee under this Paragraph shall preclude the Commission or the Attorney General from
seeking civil penalties or any other relief available to it for any failure by Respondents to comply with this Order.



B. If a trustee is appointed by the Commission or a court pursuant to Paragraph III.A. of this Order, Respondents shall
consent to the following terms and conditions regarding the trustee's powers, duties, authorities, and responsibilities:



1. The Commission shall select the trustee, subject to the consent of Respondents, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The trustee shall be a person with experience and expertise in acquisitions and divestitures. If Respondents
have not opposed, in writing, the selection of any proposed trustee within ten (10) days after notice by the staff of
the Commission to Respondents of the identity of any proposed trustee, Respondents shall be deemed to have consented
to the selection of the proposed trustee.



2. The trustee shall, subject to the prior approval of the Commission, have the exclusive power and authority to divest
the Assets To Be Divested.



3. The trustee shall have twelve (12) months from the date the Commission approves the trust agreement described in
Paragraph III.B.8. of this Order to accomplish the divestiture. If, however, at the end of the twelve-month period
the trustee has submitted a plan of divestiture or believes that divestiture can be accomplished within a reasonable
time, the twelve-month divestiture period may be extended by the Commission, or in the case of a court appointed trustee
by the court; provided, however, the Commission may extend the twelve (12) month divestiture period only two (2) times.



4. The trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities related to the
Assets To Be Divested, or to any other relevant information, as the trustee may reasonably request. Respondents shall
develop such financial or other information as such trustee may reasonably request and shall cooperate with the trustee.
Respondents shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture. Any
delays in divestiture caused by Respondents shall extend the time for divestiture under Paragraph III.B.3. in an
amount equal to the delay, as determined by the Commission or for a court-appointed trustee, by the court.



5. Subject to Respondents' absolute and unconditional obligation to divest at no minimum price and the purpose of
the divestiture as stated in Paragraph II.B., the trustee shall use his or her best efforts to negotiate the most favorable
price and terms available in each contract that is submitted to the Commission. The divestiture shall be made in the
manner set out in Paragraph II of this Order. Provided, however, if the trustee receives bona fide offers from more
than one acquirer, and if the Commission determines to approve more than one such acquirer, the trustee shall divest
to the acquirer selected by Respondents from among those approved by the Commission.



6. The trustee shall serve, without bond or other security, at the cost and expense of Respondents, on such reasonable
and customary terms and conditions as the Commission or a court may set. The trustee shall have authority to employ,
at the cost and expense of Respondents, such consultants, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, business
brokers, appraisers, and other representatives and assistants as are reasonably necessary to carry out the trustee's
duties and responsibilities. The trustee shall account for all monies derived from the divestiture and all expenses
incurred. After approval by the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court, of the account
of the trustee, including fees for his or her services, all remaining monies shall be paid at the direction of Respondents
and the trustee's power shall be terminated. The trustee's compensation shall be based at least in significant part
on a commission arrrangement contingent on the trustee's divesting the Assets To Be Divested.

7. Respondents shall indemnify the trustee and hold the trustee harmless against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
or expenses arising out of, or in connection with, the performance of the trustee's duties including all reasonable
fees of counsel and other expenses incurred in connection with the preparations for, or defense of any claim whether
or not resulting in any liability, except to the extent that such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, or expenses
result from misfeasance, gross negligence, willful or wanton acts, or bad faith by the trustee.
8. Within ten (10) days after appointment of the trustee, and subject to the prior approval of the Commission and, in
the case of a court-appointed trustee, of the court, Respondents shall execute a trust agreement that transfers to
the trustee all rights and powers necessary to permit the trustee to effect the divestiture required by this Order.
9. If the trustee ceases to act or fails to act diligently, a substitute trustee shall be appointed in the same manner
as provided in Paragraph III.A. of this Order.
10. The Commission or, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, the court, may on its own initiative or at the request
of the trustee issue such additional orders or directions as may be necessary or appropriate to accomplish the divestiture
required by this Order.
11. The trustee shall have no obligation or authority to operate or maintain the Assets To Be Divested.
12. The trustee shall report in writing to Respondents and to the Commission every sixty (60) days concerning the trustee's
efforts to accomplish divestiture.

It is further ordered that, within sixty (60) days after the date this Order becomes final and every sixty (60) days
thereafter until Respondents have fully complied with the provisions of Paragraphs II. and III. of this Order, Respondents
shall submit to the Commission a verified written report setting forth in detail the manner and form in which they intend
to comply, are complying, and have complied with those provisions. Respondents shall include in their compliance
reports, among other things that are required from time to time, a full description of the efforts being made to comply
with Paragraph II and III of the Order, including a description of all substantive contacts or negotiations for the
divestiture and the identity of all parties contacted. Respondents also shall include in their compliance reports
copies of all written communications to and from such parties, all internal memoranda, and all reports and recommendations
concerning divestiture.



V



It is further ordered that, for a ten (10) year period commencing on the date this Order becomes final, Respondents
shall not, without the prior approval of the Commission, directly or indirectly, through subsidiaries, partnerships,
or otherwise:


(A) Acquire any stock, share capital, equity, leasehold or other interest in any concern, corporate or non-corporate,
engaged in the business of selling prescription drugs at retail stores located in any of the cities or towns listed
in Paragraph I.L. of this Order or previously engaged in the business of selling prescription drugs at retail stores
located in any of the cities or towns listed in Paragraph I.L. of this Order within the six-month period prior to such
acquisition; or 


(B) Acquire any assets used for, or previously used for (and still suitable for use for), the business of selling prescription

that these prohibitions shall not relate to the construction of new facilities or the acquisition or lease of facilities
that have not operated as pharmacies within six months of the date of the offer to acquire or lease. Provided further,
that the requirement of prior Commission approval set out in this Paragraph shall not apply to a Respondent contemplating
an acquisition otherwise subject to prior Commission approval if, at the time of such acquisition, that Respondent
does not own, directly or indirectly, any interest in the whole or any part of the stock or share capital of, any company
that is engaged in the business of selling prescription drugs at retail stores located in any of the cities or towns
listed in Paragraph I.L. of this Order or any asset used or previously used within the previous six-months in (and still
suitable for use in) the business of selling prescription drugs at retail stores located in any of the cities or towns
listed in Paragraph I.L. of this Order. Provided, however, that for any such acquisition exempted from the requirements
of this Paragraph, each acquiring Respondent shall provide written notice to the Commission of such acquisition
at least ten (10) days prior to such acquisition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Respondent GEI may acquire, for
investment purposes only, an interest of not more than five (5) percent of the stock or share capital of any concern.
One year from the date this Order becomes final, annually thereafter for the next nine (9) years on the anniversary

the Commission a verified written report setting forth in detail the manner and form in which they have complied and
are complying with Paragraph V. of this Order.



VI



It is further ordered that, for the purpose of determining or securing compliance with this Order, and subject to any
legally recognized privilege, upon written request and on reasonable notice to Respondents, Respondents shall
permit any duly authorized representatives of the Commission:


A. Access, during office hours and in the presence of counsel, to inspect and copy all books, ledgers, accounts, correspondence,
memoranda and other records and documents in the possession or under the control of Respondents relating to any matters
contained in this consent order; and


B. Upon five (5) days notice to Respondents, and without restraint or interference from Respondents, to interview
officers or employees of Respondents, who may have counsel present, regarding such matters.



VII




It is further ordered that either Respondent shall notify the Commission at least thirty (30) days prior to any change
in the structure of Respondent TCH such as dissolution, assignment or sale resulting in the emergence of a successor,
the creation or dissolution of subsidiaries or any other change that may affect compliance obligations arising out
of the Order.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted provisionally an agreement containing a proposed Consent
Order from TCH Corporation (``TCH'' or ``Thrifty'') and Green Equity Investors, L.P. (``GEI''), under which TCH
and GEI would divest pharmacy assets in five (5) geographic locations where they face limited competition. TCH operates
the Thrifty Drug Store Chain and the BiMart chain of discount stores.

The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed Order.

On December 1, 1993, TCH and Kmart Corporation (``Kmart'') entered into an agreement whereby GEI, through TCH, would
acquire all the stock of PayLess Drug Stores Northwest, Inc. (``PayLess''), a wholly owned subsidiary of Kmart. The
proposed complaint alleges that the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would constitute a violation of section
7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, and section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45, in the market for
the sale of prescription drugs in retail stores in the following towns: Bishop, California; Mt. Shasta, California;
Taft, California; Florence, Oregon; and Ellensburg, Washington (hereinafter ``relevant geographic areas'').
The proposed Consent Order would remedy the alleged violation by maintaining the current number of competitors in
the relevant geographic areas where Thrifty and PayLess are direct competitors and where they face limited competition.

The proposed Consent Order provides that within one (1) year of the Order becoming final, TCH and GEI shall divest all
assets related to the retail sale of prescription drugs in PayLess or Thrifty retail stores in the relevant geographic
areas. The divestiture of the PayLess or Thrifty pharmacy business in the relevant geographic areas shall be made
only to an acquirer or acquirers that receive prior approval of the Commission and only in a manner that receives the
prior approval of the Commission. The assets shall be divested to an eligible acquirer or acquirers that will operate
a pharmacy business in the relevant geographic areas. Eligible acquirers in each relevant geographic area include,
but are not limited to: Owners of retail stores that currently do not operate a pharmacy in that relevant geographic
area; persons previously employed by Thrifty or PayLess; persons who will operate a pharmacy within an existing Thrifty
or PayLess retail store; or persons who will open a new retail store. In the event that TCH and GEI have not divested the
Thrifty or PayLess pharmacy assets in the relevant areas in one (1) year, the proposed Consent Order provides that
TCH and GEI shall consent to the appointment by the Commission of a trustee to divest the pharmacy assets.

Under the provisions of the Consent Order, TCH and GEI are also required to provide to the Commission a report of their
compliance with the divestiture provisions of the Order within sixty (60) days following the date this Order becomes
final, and every sixty (60) days thereafter until TCH and GEI have completely divested their interest in assets related
to the retail sale of prescription drugs in the relevant geographic areas. The proposed Order will also prohibit TCH
and GEI, for a period of ten (10) years, from acquiring, without Federal Trade Commission approval, any stock in any
concern engaged in the business of selling prescription drugs at retail in the relevant geographic areas. However,
if GEI sells Thrifty/PayLess and no longer owns any pharmacy businesses, it will not need to seek the Commission's
prior approval of the acquisition of any businesses that have pharmacies in the relevant geographic areas. In addition,
GEI may, without prior Commission approval, acquire up to five (5) percent of any companies' stock for investment
purposes even if such a company may own pharmacies in the relevant geographic areas. 
 
One year from the date the Order becomes final and annually thereafter for nine (9) years, TCH and GEI will be required
to provide to the Commission a report of their compliance with the Consent Order. The Consent Order also requires TCH
or GEI to notify the Commission at least thirty (30) days prior to any change in the structure of TCH resulting in the
emergence of a successor. 
 
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.

Statement of Commissioner Deborah K. Owen in the Matter of TCH Corporation


I find reason to believe that the proposed acquisition of certain assets of Kmart Corporation by TCH Corporation and
Green Equity Investors may violate section 5 of the FTC Act by substantially lessening competition with respect to
acute care prescription drugs sold to cash customers in the Bishop and Mt. Shasta, California markets.
 In the absence of further investigation, I cannot find reason to believe that the Act has been violated with respect
to the remaining allegations in the Commission's complaint.
 I therefore dissent with respect to those allegations, and with respect to any provisions in the order that are unnecessary
to remedy the alleged anticompetitive effects in the product and geographic markets that I have supported.

<DOCTITLE>Final Methodology for Implementation of the Statutory General Funding Preference for Selected Grant Programs Under
Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act for Fiscal Year 1994 </DOCTITLE>



<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992 and the Nurse Education and Practice Improvement
Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-408, dated October 13, 1992) authorize a general funding preference (sections
791(a) and 860(e)(1)) for selected grant programs in titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. For
the purpose of making grant and cooperative agreement awards, funding preference is defined as the funding of a specific
category or group of approved applications ahead of other categories or groups of approved applications in a discretionary
program, or favorable adjustment of the formula which determines the grant award in a formula grant program. 



This statutory general preference was implemented in Fiscal Year (FY) 1993 following publication of a proposed 

Federal Register

 notice (57 FR 60212, dated December 18, 1992) which announced the implementation methodology for FY 1993. Following
public comment, modifications were made in the proposed methodology and a final notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 9570, dated February 22, 1993). In addition, input was elicited from constituency groups affected by this preference
provision. The proposed methodology for FY 1994 implementation of the general funding preference was published
in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 40659, dated July 29, 1993). This notice will describe the public comments received and will include the final
methodology for implementation of this statutory funding preference for FY 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Sections 791(a) and 860(e)(1) of the PHS Act include a general funding preference for selected grant programs under
titles VII and VIII. Grant programs which are subject to this funding preference are:




Departments of Family Medicine (section 747(b)), 

Grants for Predoctoral Training in Family Medicine (section 747(a)), 

Grants for Graduate Training in Family Medicine (section 747(a)), 

Grants for Faculty Development in Family Medicine (section 747(a)), 

Grants for Predoctoral Training in General Internal Medicine and/or General Pediatrics (section 748),






Grants for Residency Training in General Internal Medicine and/or General Pediatrics (section 748), 

Grants for Faculty Development in General Internal Medicine and/or General Pediatrics (section 748), 

Residency Training and Advanced Education in the General Practice of Dentistry (section 749),1

Grants for Physician Assistant Training Program (section 750), 

Grants for Physician Assistant Faculty Development (section 750),

Statutory General Funding Preference Provision 



Under sections 791(a) and 860(e)(1) of the Act, with respect to the above listed grant programs, preference will be
given to any qualified applicant that_

(A) has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically
underserved communities; or 

(B) during the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, has achieved a significant
increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings.




When program applications are peer reviewed, preference will be given only for applications ranked above the 20th
percentile of applications that have been recommended for approval by the appropriate peer review group. In several
formula grant programs affected by this preference, the applications are not required to be submitted to a peer review
group. 



Statutory Definition of ``Graduate'' 



Under sections 791(c) and 860(e)(3), ``graduate'' is defined as an individual who has successfully completed all
training (and residency requirements) necessary for full certification in the health profession selected by the
individual. 



Methodology for Implementation 



In the proposed notice, the public was invited to comment on the proposed changes in the definitions of ``high rate,''
``significant increase in the rate,'' and ``medically underserved communities'' and on the implementation specifics
for new programs and small programs. HRSA received 2 comments prior to the end of the comment period. Comments regarding
each of the proposed areas will be discussed. Comments on implementation aspects that were not specifically proposed
for public comment are not addressed in this notice. 



Proposed Definitions of ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' 



The proposed definition of ``high rate'' is a minimum percent of graduates in academic year 1991-92 or academic
year 1992-93, whichever is greater, who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice in the
specified settings. The minimum percent for ``high rate'' for each program was to be identified in the 

Federal Register

 announcement for that program and in the program materials. The following statements are proposed amplifications
of the basic ``high rate'' definition. For undergraduate medical education programs academic years 1988-89
and 1989-90 were proposed. Preventive medicine, public health, dental public health, and public health nurse
graduates were proposed to be counted if they identify a primary work affiliation at one of the qualified work sites.
Graduates who are providing care in a medically underserved community as a part of a fellowship or other educational
experience were to be counted. 

The proposed definition of ``significant increase in the rate'' is that, between academic years 1991-92 and
1992-93, the rate of placing graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum percent and that
not less than 15 percent of graduates from the most recent year are working in these settings. The minimum percent for
``significant increase in the rate'' for each program was to be identified in the 

Federal Register

 announcement for that program and in the program materials. 

One comment received from a professional association suggested that the percentage rates published for grant programs
which benefitted their constituency should be lower. We believe that the percentage rates are appropriate. The rates
for FY 1994 are similar to the rates used in FY 1993. In FY 1993, only 40% of grant applicants for programs affected by
this preference did not apply for the preference. Of those applicants who did apply, 90% met the criteria and did receive
preference in funding. 



Proposed Implementation Specifics for New Programs 



To allow new programs to compete equitably in FY 1994, criteria for the general funding preference were proposed which
applied only to new programs. It was proposed that a new program be defined as any program which has graduated less than
three classes. After a program has graduated three classes, that program will be able to provide the information necessary
for the general funding preference as defined in the law and will no longer be considered a new program. 

It was proposed that a new program would qualify for the general funding preference if four or more of the following
criteria were met: 

1. The mission statement of the program identifies a specific purpose of preparing health professionals to serve
underserved populations. 

2. The curriculum includes content which will help to prepare practitioners to serve underserved populations. 

3. Substantial clinical training experience is required in medically underserved communities. 

4. A minimum of 20 percent of the faculty spend at least 50 percent of their time providing/supervising care in medically
underserved communities. 

5. The entire program or a substantial portion of the program is physically located in a medically underserved community.


6. Student assistance, which is linked to service in medically underserved communities following graduation, is
available to the students in the program. 

7. The program provides a placement mechanism for deploying graduates to medically underserved communities. 

One respondent suggested that (1) ``substantial clinical training experience'' in criteria 

#

3 should be defined; (2) the word ``faculty'' in criteria 

#

4 is unclear; (3) criteria 

#

5 should be deleted because ``the physical location of a program does not determine the practice type;'' and (4) criteria


#

6 should be deleted because student assistance does not apply to grants for residency programs. Since this preference
applies to a wide variety of programs, a single definition of ``substantial clinical training experience'' or ``faculty''
could not be applied generally. Individual grant programs may develop specific definitions if this becomes necessary.
Such definitions would be included in program application materials. We believe that programs located in medically
underserved communities will provide an opportunity for students to develop skills needed to provide care to underserved
populations. We do not plan to delete criterion 

#

5. Since student assistance is relevant to many of the programs which are subject to the general preference, we do not
plan to delete criterion 

#

6. New residency programs can qualify for the preference based on any combination of four other criteria. 

In addition, it was proposed that new programs could also qualify for the general funding preference by providing
assurance that a minimum percent of their prospective graduates have signed commitments to practice in medically
underserved communities after graduation contingent upon receiving some type of student assistance. This minimum
percent was to be equal to the minimum percentage for ``high rate.''

<TEXT>
 

One respondent suggested that ``a non-binding agreement is a poor indicator of the actual outcome regarding practice
in a medically underserved community.'' In FY 1993 no programs qualified for the general preference based on signed
commitments. This option was included to provide every fair opportunity for new programs to qualify for the preference.
However, if we find that no programs qualify for the general preference based on signed commitments in FY 1994, we will
consider deleting this mechanism to qualify for the preference for FY 1995. 


Proposed Implementation Specifics for Small Programs 


For FY 1994, it was proposed that the program materials for grant programs whose applicants typically have less than
10 graduates per year would request data for the preceding three years which will be aggregated to determine whether
or not the ``high rate'' has been achieved. There were no comments which specifically disagreed with this implementation
strategy. 


Statutory Definition of ``Medically Underserved Community'' 


Section 799(6) of the PHS Act defines ``medically underserved community'' as an urban or rural area or population
that_
(A) is eligible for designation under section 332 as a health professional shortage area; 
(B) is eligible to be served by a migrant health center under section 329, a community health center under section 330,
a grantee under section 340 (relating to homeless individuals), or a grantee under section 340A (relating to residents
of public housing); or 
(C) has a shortage of personal health services, as determined under criteria issued by the Secretary under section
1861(aa)(2) of the Social Security Act (relating to rural health clinics). 
For implementation of the general funding preference in FY 1994, it was proposed that service in a ``medically underserved
community'' would include service in the following work settings:

 

Community Health Centers (section 330) 
Migrant Health Centers (section 329) 
Health Care for the Homeless Grantees (section 340) 


Public Housing Primary Care Grantees (section 340A) 


Rural Health Clinics, federally designated (section 1861(aa)(2) of the Social Security Act) 

National Health Service Corps sites, freestanding (section 333) 
Indian Health Service Sites (Public Law 93-638 for tribally operated sites and Public Law 94-437 for IHS
operated sites) 
Federally Qualified Health Centers (section 1905(a) and (l) of the Social Security Act) 
Primary Medical Care Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) (facilities and geographic) (designated under
section 332) For primary care physicians and other health personnel except dentists and nurses 
Dental HPSAs (facilities and geographic) (designated under section 332) For dentists only 
Nurse Shortage Areas (old section 836, currently section 846) For nurses only 
State or Local Health Departments (Regardless of sponsor_for example, local health departments who are funded by
the State would qualify.) 
Ambulatory practice sites designated by State Governors as serving medically underserved communities

 

Several concerns were included in the comments related to the definition of ``medically underserved community.''
Many of the issues identified related to the need for a more comprehensive list of practice settings. For example,
it was suggested that the list should include (1) practices and/or facilities in which 50 percent or more of the patients
served are Medicaid recipients and (2) practice settings located adjacent to medically underserved communities
but serving the underserved population. These practice settings are outside the scope of the current statutory definition
of medically underserved community.

One respondent objected to favoring applicants whose graduates are practicing in Federally-subsidized settings
while discriminating against those applicants whose graduates are serving where special designations have not
been sought or Federal assistance utilized. Because the statutory definition of medically underserved community
is based on Federal designations, this bias may be unavoidable. However, an attempt has been made to make the list as
comprehensive as possible, within the confines of the law. 

There was one suggestion to ``provide an opportunity for preference to be claimed and secured based on affirmation
or documentation that graduates' practice settings are located in communities or serve populations which meet specified
eligibility criteria for HPSA or MUA/MUP designation.'' There were also several questions related to practice settings
included on the list. For example, one letter stated ``many state and local government health department work settings
clearly do not have service to underserved communities as the principal focus.'' 

While most of the suggestions made by the respondents are options that have been considered previously, these suggestions
will all be reevaluated for consideration in the FY 1995 implementation of this preference. We recognize that there
are difficulties associated with the implementation of this preference and we appreciate the comments received
regarding our proposed notice. 



Final Methodology for Implementation of the Statutory General Funding Preference 



Definition of ``High Rate'' 



``High rate'' is defined as a minimum percent of graduates in academic year 1991-92 or academic year 1992-93,
whichever is greater, who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice in the specified settings.
For undergraduate medical education programs academic years 1988-89 and 1989-90 will be used. Preventive
medicine, public health, dental public health, and public health nurse graduates can be counted if they identify
a primary work affiliation at one of the qualified work sites. Graduates who are providing care in a medically underserved
community as a part of a fellowship or other educational experience can be counted. 



Definition of ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' 



``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1991-92 and 1992-93, the rate
of placing graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum percent and that not less than 15 percent
of graduates from the most recent year are working in these settings. 



New Programs 



A new program is defined as any program which has graduated less than three classes. After a program has graduated three
classes, that program will be able to provide the information necessary for the general funding preference as defined
in the law and will no longer be considered a new program. 

A new program will qualify for the general funding preference if four or more of the following criteria are met: 

1. The mission statement of the program identifies a specific purpose of preparing health professionals to serve
underserved populations. 

2. The curriculum includes content which will help to prepare practitioners to serve underserved populations. 

3. Substantial clinical training experience is required in medically underserved communities. 

4. A minimum of 20 percent of the faculty spend at least 50 percent of their time providing/supervising care in medically
underserved communities. 

5. The entire program or a substantial portion of the program is physically located in a medically underserved community.


6. Student assistance, which is linked to service in medically underserved communities following graduation, is
available to the students in the program. 

7. The program provides a placement mechanism for deploying graduates to medically underserved communities. 

In FY 1994, new programs can qualify for the general preference by providing assurance that a minimum percent of their
prospective graduates have signed commitments to practice in medically underserved communities after graduation
contingent to receiving some type of student assistance. This minimum percent will be equal to the minimum percentage
for ``high rate.'' 



Small Programs 



For FY 1994, the program materials for grant programs whose applicants typically have less than 10 graduates per year
will request data for the preceding three years which will be aggregated to determine whether or not the ``high rate''
has been achieved. 



Service in ``Medically Underserved Community Work Settings'' 



For implementation of this general funding preference in FY 1994, it is proposed that service in a ``medically underserved
community'' will include service in the following work settings:

 


Community Health Centers (section 330) 

Migrant Health Centers (section 329) 

Health Care for the Homeless Grantees (section 340) 

Public Housing Primary Care Grantees (section 340A) 

Rural Health Clinics, federally designated (section 1861(aa)(2) of the Social Security Act) 

National Health Service Corps sites, freestanding (section 333) 

Indian Health Service Sites (Public Law 93-638 for tribally operated sites and Public Law 94-437 for IHS
operated sites)

Federally Qualified Health Centers (section 1905 (a) and (l) of the Social Security Act) 

Primary Medical Care Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) (facilities and geographic) (designated under
section 332) For primary care physicians and other health personnel except dentists and nurses 

Dental HPSAs (facilities and geographic) (designated under section 332) For dentists only 

Nurse Shortage Areas (old section 836, currently section 846) For nurses only 

State or Local Health Departments (Regardless of sponsor_for example, local health departments who are funded by
the State would qualify.) 

Ambulatory practice sites designated by State Governors as serving medically underserved communities

 The Department of Health and Human Services notifies Federal agencies of the laboratories currently certified to
meet standards of Subpart C of Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (53 FR 11979, 11986).
A similar notice listing all currently certified laboratories will be published during the first week of each month,
and updated to include laboratories which subsequently apply for and complete the certification process. If any
listed laboratory's certification is totally suspended or revoked, the laboratory will be omitted from updated
lists until such time as it is restored to full certification under the Guidelines. 



If any laboratory has withdrawn from the National Laboratory Certification Program during the past month, it will
be identified as such at the end of the current list of certified laboratories, and will be omitted from the monthly
listing thereafter.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing were developed in accordance with Executive Order 12564
and section 503 of Public Law 100-71. Subpart C of the Guidelines, ``Certification of Laboratories Engaged
in Urine Drug Testing for Federal Agencies,'' sets strict standards which laboratories must meet in order to conduct
urine drug testing for Federal agencies. To become certified an applicant laboratory must undergo three rounds of
performance testing plus an on-site inspection. To maintain that certification a laboratory must participate in
an every-other-month performance testing program plus periodic, on-site inspections. 



Laboratories which claim to be in the applicant stage of certification are not to be considered as meeting the minimum
requirements expressed in the HHS Guidelines. A laboratory must have its letter of certification from SAMHSA, HHS
(formerly: HHS/NIDA) which attests that it has met minimum standards. 

In accordance with Subpart C of the Guidelines, the following laboratories meet the minimum standards set forth in
the Guidelines:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of proposed records schedules; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) publishes notice at least once monthly of certain Federal
agency requests for records disposition authority (records schedules). Records schedules identify records of
sufficient value to warrant preservation in the National Archives of the United States. Schedules also authorize
agencies after a specified period to dispose of records lacking administrative, legal, research, or other value.
Notice is published for records schedules that (1) propose the destruction of records not previously authorized
for disposal, or (2) reduce the retention period for records already authorized for disposal. NARA invites public
comments on such schedules, as required by 44 USC 3303a(a).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Each year U.S. Government agencies create billions of records on paper, film, magnetic tape, and other media. In order
to control this accumulation, agency records managers prepare records schedules specifying when the agency no longer
needs the records and what happens to the records after this period. Some schedules are comprehensive and cover all
the records of an agency or one of its major subdivisions. These comprehensive schedules provide for the eventual
transfer to the National Archives of historically valuable records and authorize the disposal of all other records.
Most schedules, however, cover records of only one office or program or a few series of records, and many are updates
of previously approved schedules. Such schedules also may include records that are designated for permanent retention.



Destruction of records requires the approval of the Archivist of the United States. This approval is granted after
a thorough study of the records that takes into account their administrative use by the agency of origin, the rights
of the Government and of private persons directly affected by the Government's activities, and historical or other
value. 

This public notice identifies the Federal agencies and their subdivisions requesting disposition authority, includes
the control number assigned to each schedule, and briefly describes the records proposed for disposal. The records
schedule contains additional information about the records and their disposition. Further information about the
disposition process will be furnished to each requester.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>





IES Utilities Inc.; Partial Denial of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity for Hearing


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has partially denied a request by IES Utilities Inc. (licensee),
for an amendment to Facility Operating License No. DRP-49 issued to the licensee for operation of the Duane Arnold
Energy Center, located in Palo, Iowa. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of this amendment was published in the 

Federal Register 

on September 15, 1993 (58 FR 48384).
The purpose of the licensee's amendment request was to revise the Technical Specifications (TS) by changing the reporting
frequency of the Radioactive Material Release Report and the 10 CFR 50.59 reporting of facility changes, tests and
experiments. This is to reflect the new requirements of 10 CFR part 50. The Offsite Dose Assessment Manual (ODAM) will
remain part of the Radioactive Material Release Report and will be submitted annually.
In lieu of the current annual reporting requirement, the licensee's request would extend the reporting to six months
after a refueling outage. In contrast, the Improved Standard Technical Specifications (NUREG 1433) places the safety
and relief valve challenge information in the Monthly Operating Report.
The NRC staff has concluded that the licensee's request concerning the reporting of safety and relief valve challenges
cannot be granted. The licensee was notified of the Commission's denial of the proposed change by a letter dated March
22, 1994.
By May 4, 1994, the licensee may demand a hearing with respect to the denial described above. Any person whose interest
may be affected by this proceeding may file a written petition for leave to intervene.
A request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the
Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 by the above date.
A copy of any petitions should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Jack Newman, Esquire, Kathleen H. Shea, Esquire, Newman and Holtzinger, 1615 L Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20036, attorney for the licensee.

For further details with respect to this action, see: (1) The application for amendment dated July 28, 1993, and (2)
the Commission's letter to the licensee dated March 22, 1994.
These documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,
2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located in the Cedar Rapids Library,
500 First Street, SE., Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52401. A copy of item (2) may be obtained upon request addressed to the U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Document Control Desk.

<DOCTITLE>Virginia Electric and Power Co.; Withdrawal of Application for Amendment to Facility Operating License</DOCTITLE>




The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has granted the request of Virginia Electric and
Power Company (the licensee) to withdraw its July 2, 1993, application for proposed amendments to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF-4 and NPF-7 for the North Anna Power Station, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, located in Louisa County,
Virginia.


The proposed amendments would have revised the Technical Specifications pertaining to the steam generator inspection
reduction after steam generator replacement.


The Commission had previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 4, 1993 (58 FR 41518). However, by letter dated March 1, 1994, the licensee withdrew the proposed change.


For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated July 2, 1993, and the licensee's
letter dated March 1, 1994, which withdrew the application for license amendment. The above documents are available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, and the Alderman

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule
Change to Article II, Sections 10 and 11 of the Code of Procedure Relating to the Procedures of the National Business
Conduct Committee


March 29, 1994.


On February 14, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change
 pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and rule 19b-4 thereunder.
 The rule change amends Article II, sections 10 and 11 of the Code of Procedure (``Code'') to allow the National Business
Conduct Committee (``NBCC'') to designate a Subcommittee to approve or reject Acceptance, Waiver, and Consents
(``AWCs''), Minor Rule Violations Letters, and Offers of Settlement.






Notice of the proposed rule change together with its terms of substance was provided by issuance of a Commission release
and by publication in the 

Federal Register

.
 No comments were received in response to the Commission release. This order approves the proposed rule change.




I. Introduction


The NBCC is composed of participating members of the first year class of the NASD Board of Governors (``Board'') plus
an elected Chair and Vice-Chair from the Board's second year class. The NASD's Code applies to proceedings relating
to disciplinary actions, eligibility requirements, limiting or denying access to services, and to any other proceeding
the NASD deems appropriate.
 Articles II through IV set forth the procedures concerning disciplinary actions. Sections 10 and 11 of Articles II
are entitled ``Acceptance, Waiver and Consent, Minor Rule Violations, and Summary Complaint Procedures'' and ``Settlement
Procedure'' respectively.




The members of the NBCC are sent a weekly package for review on proposed AWCs, Minor Rule Violations Letters, and Offers
of Settlement. The NBCC also reviews, on a weekly basis, all disciplinary decisions of the District Business Conduct
Committees and the Market Surveillance Committee. All matters are first reviewed by the Chair and Vice-Chair of the
NBCC and then reviewed by the other members of the NBCC along with the recommendations of the Chair and Vice-Chair.


II. Description of the Rule Change


The NASD has determined that the weekly package to the NBCC requires a substantial commitment of time of NBCC members
and that the review by all NBCC members of all the foregoing matters is unnecessary and unduly burdensome. In order
to reduce the amount of materials which must be read by NBCC members, the NASD is proposing to allow the NBCC to designate
a Subcommittee composed of members of the NBCC to review AWCs, Minor Rule Violations Letters, and Offers of Settlement
in all instances other than matters that are outside the NASD Sanction Guidelines
 or where the designated Subcommittee, in its discretion, otherwise believes full NBCC review is appropriate.




The NASD is also proposing to amend Article II, section 11(e) of the Code to allow acceptances and rejections of Offers
of Settlement to be made by a Subcommittee designated by the NBCC as an alternative to full NBCC review. The NASD is also
proposing to delete the phrase ``by a majority vote'' from Article II, section 11(e) of the Code. The NASD considers
the phrase ``by a majority vote'' to be confusing since a majority vote is always required by an NASD review body acting
pursuant to the Code.
Section 10 sets forth the circumstances under which a District Business Conduct Committee, Market Surveillance
Committee or an Extended Hearing Committee (collectively referred to as the ``Committee'') may impose disciplinary
penalties prior to issuance of a complaint.





The procedures under subsection 10(a) provide that an NASD member may submit to the Committee a letter accepting a
finding of a violation, waiving all rights of appeal, and consenting to the imposition of sanctions. If the committee
finds the letter acceptable, it submits it to the NBCC. As currently drafted, this subsection provides that the terms
of the letter shall become final and constitute the complaint, answer, and decision in the matter ``[i]f the letter
is accepted by the NBCC.''
The rule change provides that the NBCC can designate a Subcommittee to perform the function of reviewing and either
accepting or rejecting the terms of the letter. Although not expressly provided for in the NASD's proposal, the NASD
has represented that it intends that, initially, the Subcommittee designated by the NBCC will consist of the NBCC
Committee Chair and Vice-Chair, but that the NBCC may modify the composition of the Subcommittee in the future.
Similarly, the NASD's rule change provides that the NBCC can establish a Subcommittee for the purposes of reviewing
and either accepting or rejecting letters submitted by members concerning minor rule violations or settlements
of complaints.


III. Discussion


The Commission finds that the rule change is consistent with the requirements of sections 15A(b) (2), (7) and (8) of
the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD and, therefore, has determined to approve
it. Section 15A(b)(2) requires the NASD to be organized and have the capacity to enforce compliance by its members
of the requirements under the Act, rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to the Act, and the rules of the NASD.
Sections 15A(b) (7) and (8) require that the NASD's rules provide for appropriate disciplining and for fair disciplinary
procedures.
The rule change enhances the NASD's disciplinary procedures with respect to AWCs, Minor Rule Violations Letters,
and Offers of Settlement. The rule change will facilitate the review of these matters by providing the NBCC with more
efficient procedures. No longer will each NBCC be required to review every letter submitted to the NBCC. Thus, the
NBCC will be able to expedite review of these letters.





IV. Conclusion


In conclusion, for the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with
the requirements of the Act.


It is therefore ordered

, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change, SR-NASD-93-76 be, and hereby
is, approved.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating
to Its Listing Requirements </DOCTITLE>



March 28, 1994.




Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on February 25, 1994, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II
and III below, which items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The BSE proposes to amend its listing requirements to impose more stringent criteria for initial listing of securities
on the Exchange.





II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend the listing requirements of the Exchange to establish minimum quantitative
and qualitative requirements where practicable, to modernize and clarify the language of the rule, and to begin to
respond to the Commission's concerns regarding certain issuers and promoters seeking listing solely as a means to
avoid the requirements of SEC Rule 15c2-6.

The statutory basis for the proposed rule change is Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to perfect the mechanism
of a free and open market and a national market system, and in general, to protect investors and the public interest.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



The Exchange has neither solicited nor received comments on the proposed rule change, except from the Stock List Committee.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:
(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the BSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-BSE-94-4
and should be submitted by April 25, 1994.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``SEC'' or ``Commission'').


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for exemptions under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``1940 Act'').





APPLICANTS: 

AUSA Life Insurance Company, Inc. (``AUSA''), Diversified Investors Variable Funds (the ``Account''), and Diversified
Investors Securities Corp. (``DISC'').



RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under section 6(c) for exemptions from sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act.


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order to permit them to deduct a mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Account,
which funds group variable annuity contracts (the ``Contracts'').


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application; the complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.


Applicants' Representations


1. AUSA is a stock life insurance company that was incorporated under New York law, and it is an indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiary of AEGON USA, Inc. On November 30, 1993, AUSA established the Account as a separate account under New York
insurance law. Although AUSA is the legal holder of the Account's assets, such assets will be segregated from AUSA's
other assets, and will not be chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business that AUSA may conduct.
AUSA will at all times maintain assets in the Account with a total market value that is at least equal to the reserve and
other Contract liabilities of the Account. The Account's assets may include accumulations of the charges that AUSA
assesses against the Contracts participating in the Account. The Account consists of ten subaccounts, each of which
invests in a series of one of the following open-end, diversified management investment companies: Diversified
Investors Portfolios, the Calvert Socially Responsible Series of Acacia Capital Corporation, and the Managed International
Portfolio of Scudder Variable Life Investment Fund.
2. DISC will be the principal underwriter and distributor of the Contracts. DISC is registered as a broker-dealer
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
3. The Contracts may be purchased as a funding vehicle for retirement plans maintained by state educational organizations
and certain tax-exempt organizations, IRA programs for employees of taxed and tax-exempt organizations and members
of associations, Internal Revenue Code section 401(a) and 401(k) plans, and corporate non-qualified deferred compensation
plans. During the period prior to the annuity purchase date, the Contractholder may allocate purchase payments among
the Account's ten subaccounts. The Contractholder also may surrender all or part of the Contract at any time prior
to the annuity purchase date subject, however, to restrictions that may be imposed by the applicable retirement plan.
No surrender charge is imposed under the Contract. On the annuity purchase date, subject to certain limitations,
the Contractholder may apply the accumulation value to one of several payment options, including a fixed annuity.
4. On each Contract anniversary prior to the annuity purchase date, AUSA may deduct a contract charge from the Contractholder's
accumulation account to reimburse AUSA for administrative expenses relating to the maintenance of the Contracts.
Initially, this charge will not be imposed, but any such charge that AUSA does assess would not exceed $50. AUSA does
not anticipate that it would receive any profit from this charge. Deductions may be made from purchase payments for
premium or similar taxes.

<TEXT>
 

5. Applicants seek to impose a charge to compensate AUSA for bearing certain mortality and expense risks under the
Contracts. The charge is equal to a maximum effective annual rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets in the Account.
Of that amount, approximately 0.80% is attributable to mortality risks and approximately 0.45% is attributable
to expense risks. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover actual costs and assumed risks,
the loss will be borne by AUSA. Conversely, if the charge is more than sufficient to cover costs, any excess will be profit
to AUSA. AUSA does not anticipate making a profit from this charge. The mortality risk borne by AUSA arises from its
obligation to make monthly annuity payments regardless of how long all annuitants may live. The expense risk borne
by AUSA is that the annual contract charge AUSA may impose under the Contracts may be insufficient to cover the actual
administrative costs incurred by AUSA. The cost of distributing the Contracts will be paid from AUSA's general account
funds, which may include amounts derived from the mortality and expense risk charge. 


Applicants' Legal Analysis 


1. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) of the 1940 Act granting exemptions from sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2)
of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge. Sections 26(a)(2)
and 27(c)(2) prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or underwriter thereof from selling periodic
payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited with a trustee or custodian having the
qualifications prescribed by section 26(a)(1) of the 1940 Act and are held under an agreement that provides that no
payment to the depositor or principal underwriter shall be allowed except as a fee, not exceeding such reasonable
amount as the Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services. Applicants' proposed
mortality and expense risk charge would not be considered a bookkeeping and administrative expense. 
2. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge is a reasonable and proper insurance charge to
compensate AUSA for assuming the risk that annuitants under the Contracts will live longer as a group than has been
anticipated in setting the annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts and for the risk that the administrative expense
will be greater than amounts that may be derived from any annual Contract charge imposed. 
3. AUSA represents that the charge of 1.25% for mortality and expense risks is within the range of industry practice
with respect to comparable annuity products. This representation is based upon AUSA's analysis of publicly available
information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels,
the existence of charge level guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates. AUSA will maintain at its administrative
offices, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of,
and the methodology and results of, its comparative survey. 
4. Applicants acknowledge that if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion
of such profit may be viewed as being offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by a sales charge. AUSA has concluded
that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit the Account
and the Contract-holders. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by AUSA
at its administrative offices and will be available to the Commission. 
5. AUSA also represents that the Account will only invest in management investment companies which undertake, in
the event such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance distribution expenses, to have a board of directors
or trustees, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company, formulate and approve any such plan under
Rule 12b-1. 


Applicants' Conclusion 


Applicants submit that, for all of the reasons stated herein, the requested exemptions from sections 26(a)(2) and
27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act meet the standards set out in section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants assert that the requested
exemptions are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and
the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

March 28, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for an order under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``1940 Act'').






APPLICANTS: 

Providentmutual Life and Annuity Company of America (``PLACA''), Providentmutual Variable Annuity Separate Account
A (the ``PLACA Account''), Provident Mutual Life Insurance Company of Philadelphia (``PMLIC''), Provident Mutual
Variable Annuity Separate Account A (the ``PMLIC Account''), and PML Securities Company (``PML Securities''),
collectively, the ``Applicants.''



RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under section 6(c) of the 1940 Act for exemptions for sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) thereof.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order permitting the assessment of a mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of: The PLACA
Account, which serves as a funding medium for certain variable annuity contracts issued by PLACA; the PMLIC Account,
which serves as a funding medium for certain variable annuity contracts issued by PMLIC; and other separate accounts
established in the future by PLACA or PMLIC, which will serve as funding media for variable annuity contracts substantially
identical to those funded through the PLACA and PMLIC Accounts. (All such variable annuity contracts issued by PLACA
and by PMLIC shall be referred to collectively as the ``Contracts.'')



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations




1. PMLIC is a mutual life insurance company chartered under Pennsylvania law and authorized to transact life and annuity
business in all states and the District of Columbia. PLACA, a stock life insurance company chartered under Delaware
law and authorized to transact life insurance and annuity business in the District of Columbia and all states other
than New York and Maine, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PMLIC.


2. PML Securities, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of PMLIC, is registered with the Commission under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer, and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. PML
Securities will serve as the distributor and principal underwriter for the Contracts.


3. The PLACA Account was established by PLACA as a separate investment account under Delaware insurance law on January
6, 1994, as a funding medium for variable annuity contracts. The PMLIC Account was established by PMLIC as a separate
investment account under Pennsylvania insurance law on January 4, 1994, as a funding vehicle for variable annuity
contracts. Initially, the PLACA and PMLIC Accounts each will consist of five subaccounts: Equity, Small Cap, Managed,
Bond, and Money Market (collectively, the ``Subaccounts,'' individually, the ``Subaccount''). The PLACA Account
and the PMLIC Account each will be registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust.

4. Each Subaccount will invest exclusively in the shares of a designated investment portfolio of the Quest for Value
Accumulation Trust (the ``Fund''). In the future, PMLIC and PLACA may establish other subaccounts which will invest
in specified portfolios of the Fund or other investment funds.


5. The Contracts may be purchased on a non-tax qualified basis (``Nonqualified Contracts'') or they may be purchased
and used in connection with qualified retirement plans or as individual retirement annuities that quality for favorable
federal income tax treatment (``Qualified Contracts''). The Contracts require a minimum initial premium payment
of at least $2,000. Subsequent premium payments must be a least $100 for Nonqualified Contracts, and $50 for Qualified
Contracts. The Contract owner may allocate premium payments to one or more Subaccounts, each of which will invest
in a corresponding portfolio of the Fund. Premium payments will be credited with the investment experience of the
appropriate Subaccount(s). The Contract owner also may allocate premium payments to the PLACA guaranteed account
or the PMLIC guaranteed account, depending upon which company issues the Contract, and such payments will be credited
with interest as provided for in the Contracts. (The guaranteed accounts of PLACA and PMLIC are part of those companies'
respective general accounts.)



6. Prior to the earlier of the maturity date or the death of the annuitant, a Contract owner may transfer Contract account
values between the Subaccounts. The Contract owner also may surrender all or withdraw a portion of the Contract account
value before the earlier of the maturity date or the death of the annuitant.

7. Each of the Contracts provides for a series of annuity payments beginning on the maturity date. The Contract owner
may select from three fixed annuity payment options.
8. In the event that the Contract owner or_if the Contract owner is not the annuitant_the annuitant dies prior to the
maturity date, a guaranteed death benefit is payable upon receipt of due proof of death as well as proof that the Contract
owner or the annuitant (as appropriate) died prior to the maturity date. On the date the Contract is issued, the guaranteed
death benefit will equal the amount of the initial premium. After the date of issue through the first Contract anniversary,
the death benefit will equal the greater of:
(1) The Contract account value on the date of receipt of due proof of death; or
(2) The sum of all the premiums paid through the date of death, less withdrawals (including applicable surrender charges).
During each Contract year after the first Contract anniversary, through (and including) the Contract anniversary
immediately following the Contract owner's or_if the Contract owner is not the annuitant_the annuitant's 80th birthday,
the death benefit will equal the greater of:
(1) The Contract account value on the date of receipt of due proof of death; or
(2) The product of 1.05 and the sum of (A) the guaranteed death benefit as of the previous Contract anniversary and (B)
any premiums paid during the previous Contract year, less any withdrawals (including any surrender charges applicable
through the sixth Contract anniversary).
After the Contract anniversary immediately following the Contract owner's or_if the Contract owner is not the annuitant_the
annuitant's 80th birthday, the death benefit will equal the greater of:
(1) The Contract account value on the date of receipt of due proof of death; or
(2) The sum of (A) the guaranteed death benefit as of the Contract anniversary immediately preceeding the Contract
owner's or annuitant's (as applicable) 80th birthday and (B) the premiums paid during the previous Contract year,
less any withdrawals.
9. Contracts funded through separate accounts established in the future by PLACA and PMLIC may have the following
guaranteed death benefit: In the event that an annuitant dies prior to the end of the sixth Contract year, a death benefit
is payable upon receipt of due proof of death as well as proof that the annuitant died prior to the maturity date. The
death benefit is equal to the greater of: 
(1) The Contract account value on the date of receipt of due proof of death; or
(2) The premiums paid, less withdrawals (including applicable surrender charges).
In the event that the annuitant dies after the end of the sixth Contract year, but before the maturity date, the death
benefit is the greatest of:
(a) The Contract account value as of the end of the sixth Contract year, less any subsequent withdrawals;
(b) The Contract account value on the date of receipt of due proof of death; or
(c) The premiums paid, less withdrawals (including any applicable surrender charges).
10. For Contracts issued by PMLIC to residents of New York state, premium taxes may be deducted from any death benefit.
11. PLACA and PMLIC each will deduct an annual contract maintenance fee of $30 from the Contract account value on each
Contract anniversary prior to and including the maturity date (and upon a full surrender or on the maturity date, if
other than a Contract anniversary) to compensate them for administrative services provided to Contract owners.
This fee is guaranteed not to increase for the duration of the Contract, and is applicable only prior to and on the maturity
date.
12. PLACA and PMLIC each will assess a daily charge equal to an effective annual rate of 0.15% of the value of the net assets
in the PLACA Account and the PMLIC Account, respectively. This charge is designed to compensate each company for certain
administrative services provided to Contract owners, is guaranteed not to increase for the duration of the Contract,
and is applicable only prior to the maturity date.
13. Applicants represent that these administrative charges will be deducted in reliance on Rule 26a-1 under
the Act, and will represent reimbursement only for administration costs expected to be incurred over the life of the
Contract. PLACA and PMLIC neither anticipate nor intend to make any profit from these administrative charges.

<TEXT>
 

14. In the future, PLACA and PMLIC each may assess a transfer charge under the Contracts. For instance, prior to the
maturity date, a $25 charge under the Contracts may be assessed for the thirteenth and each subsequent transfer request
made by the Contract owner during a single Contract year. Applicants represent that the transfer charge, if assessed,
will be deducted in reliance upon Rule 26a-1 of the 1940 Act, and that such charge represents reimbursement for
administrative costs expected to be incurred over the life of the Contract.

15. A contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') of up to 6% of the amount withdrawn is assessed on certain full surrenders
or partial withdrawals of Contract account value during the first six Contract years. The CDSC is designed to cover
expenses relating to the sales of the Contracts, including commissions to registered representatives and other
promotional expenses. The aggregate CDSCs are guaranteed never to exceed 8.5% of the premium payments. During the
first Contract year, any amounts surrendered or withdrawn are subject to the CDSC. After the first Contract year,
the portion of the first and second withdrawals in a Contract year equal to 10% or less of the Contract account value
as of the beginning of the Contract year is not subject to the sales charge. 

16. Neither PLACA nor PMLIC anticipates that the CDSCs will generate sufficient revenues to pay the cost of distributing
the Contracts. If these charges are insufficient to cover PLACA's or PMLIC's expenses, the deficiency will be met
from each company's general account assets, which may include amounts derived from the charge for mortality and expense
risks discussed below.

17. PLACA will deduct the aggregate premium taxes paid on behalf of a particular Contract either:

(i) From premiums as they are received; or

(ii) From the Contract proceeds upon (A) a withdrawal from or full surrender of a Contract, or (B) application of the
proceeds to a payment option. Premium taxes currently range up to 3.5%. For Contracts issued by PMLIC to Maine residents,
an aggregate premium tax of 2% of premiums paid will be deducted from Contract proceeds upon (i) a withdrawal from or
full surrender of a Contract, or

(ii) Application of the proceeds to a payment option. For Contracts issued by PMLIC to New York residents, any premium
tax assessed will be 2% of any amounts surrendered, withdrawn, paid as a death benefit, or applied to a payment option.

18. PLACA and PMLIC each assess a daily charge to compensate it for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection
with the Contracts. This charge is equal to an effective annual rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets in the Account,
and applies only prior to and on the maturity date. Of that amount, approximately 0.70% is attributable to mortality
risk, and approximately 0.55% is attributable to expense risk. PLACA and PMLIC each guarantee that the mortality
and expense risk charge will never exceed 1.25%. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover
PLACA's or PMLIC's actual costs and assumed risks, the loss will fall on PLACA and PMLIC. Conversely, if the charge
is more than sufficient to cover costs, any excess will be profit to either PLACA or PMLIC. PLACA and PMLIC each currently
anticipate a profit from the mortality and expense risk charge.

19. The mortality risks borne by PLACA and PMLIC arise from their respective contractual obligations to make annuity
payments (determined in accordance with the annuity tables and other provisions contained in the Contract), regardless
of how long all annuitants or any individual annuitant may live. This undertaking assures that neither an annuitant's
own longevity, nor an improvement in general life expectancy, will adversely affect the monthly annuity payments
that the payee will receive under the Contract. PLACA and PMLIC each assume the risk that its actual administrative
costs will exceed the amount recovered through the Contract administrative charges. 

20. PLACA and PMLIC each also incur a risk in connection with the death benefit guarantee. There is no extra charge for
this guarantee.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Applicants request that the Commission, pursuant to section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, grant exemptions from sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) thereof to the extent necessary to permit the assessment of a daily charge for mortality
and expense risks under the Contracts. 

2. Applicants represent that the terms of the class relief requested with respect to any future Contracts funded by
the PLACA Account, by the PMLIC Account, or other separate accounts established by PLACA or PMLIC are consistent with
the standards enumerated in section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Without the requested relief, PLACA and PMLIC each would
have to request and obtain exemptive relief for each new separate account it establishes to fund any future Contracts.
Such additional requests for exemptive relief would present no issues under the 1940 Act that have not already been
addressed in this application.

3. The Applicants represent that the requested class relief is appropriate in the public interest because it would
promote competitiveness in the variable annuity market by eliminating the need for PLACA and PMLIC to file redundant
exemptive applications, thereby reducing their administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of their
resources. The delay and expense involved in having to seek exemptive relief repeatedly would impair each company's
ability to effectively take advantage of business opportunities that arise.

4. The Applicants represent that, for the same reasons, the requested relief is consistent with the purposes of the
1940 Act and the protection of investors. If PLACA and PMLIC each were required to seek exemptive relief repeatedly
with respect to the same issues addressed in this application, investors would not receive any benefit or additional
protection thereby. Indeed, they might be disadvantaged as a result of each company's increased overhead expenses.

5. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2), as herein pertinent, prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor
thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments
(other than sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which
prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amounts
as the SEC may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services.

6. Applicants submit that both PLACA and PMLIC are entitled to reasonable compensation for their respective assumption
of mortality and expense risks. Applicants represent that the 1.25% mortality and expense risk charge assessed under
the Contracts is consistent with the protection of investors because it is a reasonable and proper insurance charge.
Applicants further submit that the mortality and expense risk charge is a reasonable charge to compensate PLACA and
PMLIC for the risk that annuitants under the Contracts will live longer than has been anticipated in setting the annuity
rates guaranteed in the Contracts, for the risk that the Contract account value will be less than the death benefit,
and for the risk that administrative expenses will be greater than amounts derived from the Contract administrative
charges.

7. PLACA and PMLIC each represent that the charge of 1.25% for mortality and expense risks assumed by PLACA and PMLIC
is within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable variable annuity products. This representation
is based upon PLACA's and PMLIC's analysis of publicly available information about similar industry products, taking
into consideration such factors as current charge levels, the existence of charge level guarantees, and guaranteed
annuity rates. PLACA and PMLIC each will maintain at its administrative offices, and have available to the Commission,
a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, its
comparative survey.

8. Applicants acknowledge that the proceeds of CDSCs may be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution
of the Contracts. Applicants also acknowledge that if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge,
all or a portion of such profit may be viewed by the Commission as being offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed
by the sales charge. PLACA and PMLIC each have concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution
financing arrangements will benefit the PLACA and PMLIC Accounts and the Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion
is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by PLACA and PMLIC at their respective administrative offices
and will be available to the Commission.

9. PLACA and PMLIC each represent that the PLACA and PMLIC Accounts will invest only in management investment companies
which undertake, in the event such companies adopt plans to finance distribution expenses under Rule 12b-1
under the 1940 Act, to have a board of directors or trustees, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company,
formulate and approve any such plan under Rule 12b-1.



Conclusion



Applicants assert that, for the reasons set forth above, the requested exemptions from section 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2)
of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts
meet the standards in section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants assert that the requested exemptions are necessary
and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

Penn Fuel Gas, Inc., et al. (70-8068) 
 


Penn Fuel Gas, Inc., (``PFG''), 55 South Third Street, Oxford, Pennsylvania, 19363, a Pennsylvania holding company
exempt from registration under section 3(a)(1) of the Act pursuant to rule 2, and Carol Ware Gates, Oxford, Pennsylvania,
Marilyn Ware Lewis, Strasburg, Pennsylvania, John H. Ware, IV, Oxford, Pennsylvania, and Paul W. Ware, Strasburg,
Pennsylvania (collectively, ``Ware siblings'') have filed an application under sections 9(a)(2) and 10 of the Act
in connection with acquisitions of common shares of PFG and related transactions, pursuant to certain trust and voting
agreements. Applicants also request an order under section 3(a)(1) exempting PFG from all provisions of the Act,
except section 9(a)(2). 
 
PFG, through eight wholly owned Pennsylvania gas utility subsidiary companies, provides gas utility service to
approximately 65,725 customers, 99.7% of which are located in Pennsylvania.
 PFG has outstanding 717,583 shares of its common stock, par value $1.00 per share (``PFG Common Stock''), of which
John H. Ware, III and his wife Marian S. Ware own 572,847.25 shares.
 
 





John and Marian Ware have established sixteen 

inter vivos 

trusts (``Trusts'') for the benefit of their four children and their issue. The Trusts are grouped into four interest
groups (``Trust Groups''). Each Trust Group contains four Trusts, each of which benefits one of the four Ware siblings
and his or her issue. Each Trust has its situs in Pennsylvania and has two trustees: CoreStates Bank, N.A. (``CoreStates''),
a national banking association, as corporate trustee, and the Ware sibling for whose principal benefit the trust
has been established, as individual trustee. 
 
Upon the granting of the requested order, applicants state that John and Marian Ware, or their respective estates,
will make gifts of PFG Common Stock to at least one of the Trusts in each Trust Group in amounts which will result, initially,
in each individual trustee having (in conjunction with CoreStates as corporate trustee) power to vote more than 5%,
but less than 10%, of the PFG Common Stock.
 Applicants anticipate that John and Marian Ware will ultimately transfer, by 

inter vivos 

or testamentary disposition, a sufficient number of shares to each Trust Group so that each individual trustee will
have (in conjunction with CoreStates as corporate trustee) power to vote more than 10% of the PFG Common Stock.

<DOCNO> FR940404-2-00130 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940404-2-00085 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The applicants and CoreStates intend to enter into a shareholders' voting agreement (''Voting Agreement'') which
provides, among other things, that the power to vote all PFG Common Stock then held and thereafter acquired by the Trusts,
the individual trustees and corporate trustee, and the Ware siblings in their individual capacities will be delegated
to Marilyn Ware Lewis, effective upon the granting of the requested order.
 Applicants state that the delegation of voting power will facilitate a smooth transition of voting control to Ms.
Lewis, whose general business experience is expected to promote the efficient and economic operation of the PFG system.






Applicants request authorization under sections 9(a)(2) and 10 for each of the four Trust Groups and each individual
trustee, as a co-trustee with CoreStates, to acquire an initial amount of 5% or more of the PFG Common Stock.
 Applicants further request any authorization that may be necessary for Ms. Lewis, in her individual capacity, to
obtain the delegated power to vote the PFG Common Stock pursuant to the Voting Agreement.







Applicants also request an order under section 3(a)(1) exempting PFG from all provisions of the Act, except section
9(a)(2). Applicants state that PFG and all of its public-utility subsidiary companies are incorporated in Pennsylvania,
and that the utility business of PFG and each of its public-utility subsidiary companies is predominantly intrastate
in character and carried on substantially in Pennsylvania.


Applicants state that none of the trustees, Trusts or Trust Groups will be a holding company within the meaning of the
Act as a result of the proposed transactions. CoreStates, as a bank-fiduciary, will rely on rule 3(a) to exempt it from
any obligation, duty, or liability imposed upon it as a holding company.

<USBUREAU>Applications, Hearings, Determinations, et al.; AMT Capital, Ltd.</USBUREAU>


Notice is hereby given that AMT Capital, Ltd. (AMT), 8204 Elmbrook, suite 103, Dallas, TX 75427, a Federal licensee
under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended (the Act), has financed a small concern in violation of
section 312 of the Act and  107.903 of the SBA Rules and Regulations (the Regulations) governing Small Business
Investment Companies (13 CFR 107.903 (1993)). An exemption may not be granted by SBA until Notices of this transaction
have been published. AMT provided financing to Advanced Chemical Systems International, Inc. (ACSI), 510 Alder
Drive, Milpitas, CA 95035.

The financing is brought within the purview of  107.903(b)(1) of the Regulations because AMT Venture Partners

ACTION:

 Notice of conferences on the implementation of alcohol and drug testing regulations.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 DOT is sponsoring four 2-day conferences on the implementation of rules requiring alcohol and drug testing in transportation

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On February 15, 1994, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) published regulations requiring drug and alcohol
testing of over 7 million safety-sensitive employees in transportation industries. These regulations were mandated
by Public Law 102-143, the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act. Rules were issued by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Federal
Transit Administration (FTA), and the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) requiring employers
in the regulated aviation, commercial motor vehicle, railroad, transit, and pipeline industries to implement anti-drug
and alcohol misuse prevention programs. 



The rules generally require implementation starting January 1, 1995, for large companies 
(with generally 50 or more safety-sensitive employees) and January 1, 1996, for small companies. 

The conferences' agendas will include: drug and alcohol testing procedures, reporting and recordkeeping requirements,
compliance and enforcement issues, random testing rates, prohibited conduct and consequences, return-to-duty
requirements, employee confidentiality, and education and training requirements. 

The first day of the conferences will focus on the requirements of the alcohol misuse prevention programs. The second
day agenda will focus on anti-drug program requirements. 

Representatives from the FAA, FHWA, FRA, FTA, and RSPA will conduct specific sessions providing the requirements
for the employers they regulate. Although RSPA is unable to conduct a 
modal-specific session at the Washington, DC 
conference, gas and liquid pipeline operators may wish to attend the general sessions.

 


Issued in Washington, DC on March 24, 1994.
