Availability of Environmental Assessments and Findings of No Significant Impact 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are advising the public that five environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared
by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service relative to the issuance of permits to allow the field testing of
genetically engineered organisms. The environmental assessments provide a basis for our conclusion that the field
testing of these genetically engineered organisms will not present a risk of introducing or disseminating a plant
pest and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on its findings of no significant
impact, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that environmental impact statements need
not be prepared.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340 (referred to below as the regulations) regulate the introduction (importation,
interstate movement, and release into the environment) of genetically engineered organisms and products that are
plant pests or that there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles). A permit must be obtained before
a regulated article may be introduced into the United States. The regulations set forth the procedures for obtaining
a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the
release into the environment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has stated
that it would prepare an environmental assessment and, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before
issuing a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906). 



In the course of reviewing each permit application, APHIS assessed the impact on the environment that releasing the
organisms under the conditions described in the permit application would have. APHIS has issued permits for the field
testing of the organisms listed below after concluding that the organisms will not present a risk of plant pest introduction
or dissemination and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. The environmental
assessments and findings of no significant impact, which are based on data submitted by the applicants and on a review
of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental
impacts associated with conducting the field tests. 

Environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared by APHIS relative to the issuance
of permits to allow the field testing of the following genetically engineered organisms: 






The environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared in accordance with: (1) The
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40
CFR parts 1500-1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing
NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274, August 31, 1979).

<DOCTITLE>Beaver-Woods Vegetation Management Project; Bitterroot National Forest, Ravalli County, MT</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The USDA, Forest Service, will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to disclose the environmental effects
of prescribed fire, timber harvest, reforestation, and road construction in the southern tributary drainages of
the West Fork of the Bitterroot River. A proposal to determine the effects on and response of three sensitive plant
species to prescribed fire is also proposed and will be analyzed. The area is located approximately 50 miles southwest
of Hamilton, Montana, Bitterroot National Forest, West Fork Ranger District, Ravalli County, Montana. 



The proposal's actions to use prescribed fire, harvest timber, construct roads, perform reforestation, and monitor
the effects of fire on listed sensitive plant species are being considered together because they represent either
connected or cumulative actions as defined by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR 1508.25). The purposes
of the project are (1) to maintain or restore ecosystem diversity, function, and health, (2) to provide raw materials
for timber products for the citizens of the United States, and (3) to monitor the effects of fire on plants that are currently
listed as ``sensitive'' by the Regional Forester. This project-level EIS will tier to the Bitterroot National Forest
Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) and Final EIS (September, 1987), which provides overall guidance
of all land management activities on the Bitterroot National Forest.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Prescribed burning and timber harvest are proposed on approximately 3600 acres and 1600 acres, respectively. Timber
harvest is proposed on lands which have been designated as suitable for timber management by the Bitterroot Forest
Plan, with some isolated exceptions designed to maintain ponderosa pine on some sites. This aspect of the proposed
action would require a site specific amendment to the Forest Plan to change the standard for harvest on unsuitable
lands. The timber harvest operations and general administration of National Forest lands would require construction
of approximately three miles of new road and less than one mile of temporary road. The study to determine effects caused
by fire on three species of sensitive plants will delineate plant populations to be exposed to prescribed fire and
delineate plant populations of the same species which would be protected from fire and which would act as controls.





An analysis of the Beaver Woods area shows a marked change in how the forest vegetation currently looks and functions
compared to the past. Natural patterns and stand structures have changed, largely due to effective fire suppression.
Forested areas once diverse in age classes and species are trending toward larger, denser, and more uniform blocks
of climax species. The primary purpose of prescribed fire and timber harvest in the Beaver Woods area is to respond
to the need to maintain or restore ecosystem diversity, function, and health. Another purpose of timber harvest is
to provide raw materials to the timber industry and help satisfy the American public's need for timber products. The
purpose of road construction is to facilitate access to some of the timber stands to be harvested. The purpose of treating
some sensitive plant populations with prescribed fire is to learn more about these species. They are believed to have
developed adaptations to periodic fire.

The project area encompasses approximately 37,000 acres of National Forest land located in T3S, R23W, Sec. 15, 20-29,
and 33-36; T3S, R22W, Sec. 3, 9-11, 14-17, and 19-36, T4S, R23W, Sec. 1-3, 11 and 12, and
T4S, R22W, Sec. 1-12, 14-22, 28, and 29, P.M. MT. Proposed activities are scattered throughout the project
area.

The decision to be made in what, if anything, should be done in the Beaver Woods area to:

(a) Maintain and restore a level of vegetation diversity in the project area that more closely approximates the historic
condition,

(b) Amend the Forest Plan on a site specific basis to allow improvement cutting on the unsuitable lands, thereby reducing
tree density and providing for the establishment of ponderosa pine,

(c) Develop and manage the road system to facilitate removal of timber and manage Forest lands, and (d) learn more about
how some plants respond to fire.

The Bitterroot Forest Plan provides guidance for management activities within the potentially affected area through
its goals, objectives, standards and guidelines, and management area direction. The area of proposed timber harvest
would occur within Management Areas 1, 2, and 3A. Timber harvest would occur primarily on suitable timber land, with
some isolated exceptions which are proposed in order to help provide for the establishment of ponderosa pine. Prescribed
burning is proposed on lands within Forest Plan Management Areas 1, 2, 3a, 3b and 5. Road construction would occur in
Management Area 1. A brief description of the applicable management direction follows:




Management Area 1_These are areas where timber management, livestock and big game forage production, and roaded
dispersed recreation activities are emphasized.
Management Area 2_These are areas where elk winter range habitat is emphasized, timber management is allowed, and
roaded dispersed recreation opportunities are provided.

Management Area 3a_These are areas where visual quality is emphasized, timber management is allowed, and roaded
dispersed recreation opportunities are provided.

Management Area 3b_These are areas where riparian habitats, water quality, and water-related recreation are emphasized.

Management Area 5_These are areas where semi-primitive recreation and elk security are emphasized.







The Forest Service will consider a range of alternatives. One of these will be the ``no action'' alternative, in which
none of the proposed activities would be implemented. Additional alternatives will examine varying levels and locations
for the proposed activities to achieve the proposal's purposes, as well as to respond to the issues and other resource
values.

The EIS will analyze the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of the alternatives. Past, present,
and scheduled activities on both private and National Forest lands will be considered. The EIS will disclose the analysis
of site-specific mitigation measures and their effectiveness.

Public participation is an important part of the analysis, commencing with the initial scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7),
which will occur during March and April, 1994. In addition, the public is encouraged to visit with Forest Service officials
at any time during the analysis and prior to the decision. The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments,
and assistance from Federal, State, and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested
in or affected by the proposed action. No additional public meetings are scheduled at this time.


Comments from the public and other agencies will be used in preparation of the Draft EIS. The scoping process will be
used to:




1. Identify potential issues.

2. Identify major issues to be analyzed in depth.

3. Eliminate minor issues or those which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental analysis, such at
the Bitterroot Forest Plan EIS.

4. Identify alternatives to the proposed action.

5. Identify potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives (i.e., direct, indirect, and
cumulative effects).


6. Determine potential cooperating agencies and task assignments.





Some public comments have already been received in conjunction with an analysis and associated public involvement
to determine existing and desired conditions for the Beaver Woods area. The following preliminary issues have been
identified:




1. How would the proposed timber harvest change the undeveloped character of ``defacto'' roadless lands adjacent
to the Allen Mountain Roadless Area (No. 01946)?

2. How would the proposed activities affect Forest Service Region 1 listed sensitive species known to inhabit the
area, such as bull trout?

3. How would the proposed activities affect the movement through the area and potential for habitation by species
that no longer inhabit the area, such as grizzly bears?

4. Can the vegetation diversity and ecological purposes of the project be met without any further timber harvesting
or road building?

5. To what degree would the proposed activities contribute to the spread of noxious weeds in the area?





Other issues commonly associated with prescribed fire, timber harvesting, and road construction include: effects
on cultural resources, water quality, soils, old growth, and scenery values. This list may be verified, expanded,
or modified based on public scoping for this proposal.


The Draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and available for public review
in August of 1994. At that time, the EPA will publish a Notice of Availability of the Draft EIS in the 

Federal Register

. The comment period on the Draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA's notice of availability appears in the 

Federal Register

. It is very important that those interested in management of the Beaver Woods area participate at that time. To be most
helpful, comments on the Draft EIS should be as site-specific as possible. The Final EIS is scheduled to be completed
in February, 1995.


The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.

v. 

NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). 

Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement stage but that are
not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed by the courts.


City of Angoon

 v. 

Hodel,

 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages

 v. 

Harris, 

490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day scoping comment period so that substantive comments
and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond
to them in developing issues and alternatives.


To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues on the proposed action, comments should be as specific
as possible. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the
procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.


I am the responsible official for this environmental impact statement. My address is Bitterroot National Forest,
1801 N. 1st., Hamilton, MT 59840.

ACTION:

 Notice of intent to revoke countervailing duty order.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Commerce is notifying the public of its intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on certain
fresh cut flowers from Peru. Domestic interested parties who object to this revocation must submit their comments
in writing not later than 30 days from the publication date of this notice.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


On April 23, 1987, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published a countervailing duty order on certain fresh
cut flowers from Peru (52 FR 13491). The Department has not received a request to conduct an administrative review
of this countervailing duty order for at least four consecutive annual anniversary months. 
In accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer of
interest to interested parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation or
no interested party requests an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month. Accordingly,
as required by  355.25(d)(4) of the Department's regulations, we are notifying the public of our intent to revoke
this order. 


Opportunity To Object 


Not later than 30 days after the publication date of this notice, domestic interested parties, as defined in  355.2(i)(3),
(i)(4), (i)(5), and (i)(6) of the Department's regulations, may object to the Department's intent to revoke this
countervailing duty order. 
Seven copies of any such objections should be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, International
Trade Administration, room B-099, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230. 
If no interested parties request an administrative review (pursuant to the Department's notice of opportunity to
request administrative review), or if no domestic interested parties object to the Department's intent to revoke
pursuant to this notice, we shall conclude that the order is no longer of interest to interested parties and shall proceed
with the revocation. 
This notice is in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(i).

<DOCTITLE>Cold-Rolled Stainless Steel Sheet From Germany; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review</DOCTITLE>

agency: 

International Trade Administration/Import Administration, Department of Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Final results of antidumping duty administrative review.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

On May 21, 1992, the Department of Commerce issued the final results of its administrative review of the antidumping
duty order on cold-rolled stainless steel sheet from the Federal Republic of Germany. We conducted this antidumping
duty administrative review pursuant to a remand order from the U.S. Court of International Trade in 

Krupp Stahl, A.G., et al. 

v. 

United States 

(Slip Op. 91-31, April 19, 1991). 



In that decision, the court ruled that the Department had illegally applied its automatic assessment regulation
to Krupp's December 1982 through June 1983 entries because the original less-than-fair-value-investigation was
initiated prior to the October 30, 1984, amendment to the Tariff Act of 1930 and prior to the October 22, 1986, amendment
to the effective date provision of the 1984 Act. Because the 1984 and 1986 amendments are not retroactive, the court
held that Krupp was entitled to an automatic review of its entries. 

The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of subject merchandise, Krupp Stahl, A.G., and the period December
17, 1982 through June 23, 1983. The final margin is 27 percent. The final results of this review were affirmed by the
Court on May 26, 1993, in 

Krupp Stahl, A.G., et al. 

v. 

United States, 

822 F. Supp. 789 (CIT 1993). The Court's opinion was not appealed; therefore, we are publishing the final results of
the administrative review. Attached is the notice of

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On November 7, 1991, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its administrative review of
the antidumping duty order on cold-rolled stainless steel sheet from the Federal Republic of Germany (56 FR 56976).
We have conducted this antidumping duty administrative review pursuant to a remand order from the U.S. Court of International
Trade in 

Krupp Stahl, A.G., et al. 

v. 

United States 

(Slip Op. 91-31, April 19, 1991). The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of subject merchandise, Krupp
Stahl, A.G., and the period December 17, 1982 through June 23, 1983. Based on our analysis of the comments received,
we have not changed the preliminary results. The final margin is listed below in the section ``Final Results of Review.''


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


On November 7, 1991, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 56976) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain cold-rolled
stainless steel sheet from Germany (48 FR 28680, June 23, 1983). In the notice of preliminary results of review, we
noted that Krupp Stahl, A.G. (Krupp), failed to respond to our questionnaire issued in July 1991. On September 12,
1991, Krupp advised us that in 1989 it had destroyed the records for the December 1982-June 1983 review period,
because German law does not require that business records be retained beyond a minimum period of time. In addition,
we noted that after searching our files we were only able to locate the public version of the narrative portion of Krupp's
responses to the Department's original and supplemental questionnaires issued in 1983 and 1984. Because that information
was insufficient for purposes of conducting an administrative review and because Krupp did not respond to our questionnaire
because it had destroyed all supporting documentation, we used the best information available (BIA) for the preliminary
results of review.

Subsequent to publication of the notice of preliminary results, we discovered a few boxes labeled with the administrative
proceeding number relevant to this case in an annex to the Department's Central Records storeroom. We notified the
parties to the proceeding of our discovery and suspended the briefing and hearing schedule until the Department could
thoroughly review all the documents contained in those boxes to determine which, if any, might be relevant to the instant
period of review.

The documents represented submissions from the original less than fair value (LTFV) investigation, and from the
first and second administrative reviews. They contained information from other German producers as well as from
Krupp. There were three computer tapes in the boxes. We were able to read two of the tapes which contained data relevant
to the LTFV investigation. The third tape could not be formatted based on any of the formatting instructions provided
in either the LTFV or first review questionnaire and supplemental responses, indicating that the tape did not pertain
to the information contained in those responses.

Based upon its review of all of the documents found in the Central Records annex, the Department determined that the
information either pertained to a different company, covered an irrelevant time period, or was not in a useable computer
format for purposes of conducting a dumping analysis. On March 2, 1991, the Department contacted counsel for Krupp
and counsel for the Petitioner to inform them of the results of our examination of the information. At that time a revised
schedule was outlined to allow adequate time for comments and rebuttal comments. At the request of the respondent,
we held a public hearing on April 14, 1992. The Department has now completed this administrative review in accordance
with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act).



Scope of the Review



Imports covered by the review are shipments of cold-rolled stainless steel sheet whether or not corrugated or crimped
and whether or not pickled; not cut, not pressed and not stamped to non-rectangular shape; not coated or plated with
metal, and under 0.1875 inch in thickness and over 12 inch in width. Until January 1, 1989, this merchandise was classifiable
under item number 607.9020 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA). Since that date, this merchandise
is classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item numbers 7219.32.00, 7219.33.00, 7219.34.00,
7219.35.00, 7219.90.00, 7220.20.10, and 7220.90.00. Like the TSUSA numbers, the HTS numbers are provided for convenience

Analysis of Comments Received



We invited interested parties to comment on the preliminary results. The Department received comments and rebuttal
comments from both parties.



Comment 1:

 The petitioner notes that Krupp admitted that in 1989 it destroyed all records relevant to the period of review and,
therefore, was unable to respond to the Department's questionnaire issued in July 1991. Because of Krupp's actions,
the petitioner contends that Krupp has significantly impeded the Department's conduct of this review in that the
Department now is unable to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information submitted in Krupp's 1983 and
1984 responses to the Department's earlier questionnaires. Petitioner asserts that destruction of relevant records
during an ongoing judicial proceeding where Krupp was aware that the Court might remand the case to the Department
for administrative review does not, contrary to Krupp's claim, ``demonstrate [ ] a willingness'' to cooperate.
Given the circumstances, petitioner argues that the Department is obligated to use BIA based on an adverse inference.



Department's Response:

 On September 12, 1991, Krupp informed the Department that in 1989 it destroyed all data relevant to the period under
review, because German law does not require that records be maintained for more than five years. Because of its actions,
Krupp stated that it was unable to respond to our July 1991 questionnaire. In addition, Krupp's destruction of its
records prevented the Department from conducting a verification of what few written submissions of factual information
remain in the Department's files from Krupp's 1983 and 1984 submissions. In reviews such as this one, involving old
data, the Department may conduct a verification. See Television Receivers, Monochrome and Color from Japan; Final
Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 54 FR 13917 (Apr. 6, 1989). In 1988 we verified information covering
the period April 1983 through August 1983 submitted by two companies subject to the Japanese television finding.


See, also

, Memorandum For the File from Laurie Lucksinger and Jim Arnold, dated May 28, 1987, regarding Large Power Transformers
from Italy_Analysis for Preliminary Results of Review for Ansaldo, where we verified data in 1987 covering sales
in 1982.

While German law may prescribe a minimum required period for the retention of business records, it is irrelevant to
the current judicial proceeding. Respondents have a responsibility to maintain documents relevant to ongoing litigation.
See 

Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd.

 v. 

United States

, Slip Op. 92-72 (CIT May 15, 1992) at 19. As a consequence of its actions, Krupp explicitly acknowledges in its
September 12, 1991 letter ``that the Department will be unable to complete the administrative review in the manner
contemplated by the Court of International Trade'' in its remand opinion and recognizes that the Department ``will
thus be forced to use the best information available'' (BIA) for this administrative review. Therefore, pursuant
to 776(c) of the Tariff Act we have continued to use BIA for these final results.

Comment 2: 

Krupp alleges that the Department suggested, and later confirmed, through a memorandum to the file that the Department
had destroyed Krupp's proprietary questionnaire responses submitted in 1983 and 1984.



Department's Position: 

The Department did not destroy documents relevant to this period of review. Prior to publication of the preliminary
results of this administrative review, we were unable to locate documents other than written public versions of Krupp's
1983 and 1984 responses to requests for information. Subsequent to publication of the preliminary results of review,
we discovered a few boxes of documents bearing the administrative proceeding number relevant to this case in an annex
to the Central Records storeroom. A thorough review of the information contained in those documents revealed that
it ``pertained either to a different company, an irrelevant period of review, or was in an unusable computerized format
for purposes of a dumping analysis.'' See Memorandum to the File from Jackie Johnson, Case Analyst, dated March 2,
1991. Other than indicating what the Department was ultimately able to locate in its files, the memorandum contains
no statement that any of Krupp's files were destroyed, nor does the memorandum contain any implication that this was
done. Accordingly, contrary to Krupp's allegations, the memorandum does not support the contention that the Department
destroyed any documents whatsoever.



Comment 3: 

Krupp argues that the statutory language and legislative history of sections 776(b) and (c) of the Tariff Act explicitly
prohibit the Department from using information submitted in support of a petition as BIA in an administrative review.
Krupp contends that petition information may only be used for purposes of a final BIA determination in an investigation.

The petitioner supports the Department's use of an adverse BIA rate based on information from the petition arguing
that the Department's regulations not only allow the Department the discretion to determine, on a case-by-case basis,
what is the best information available, but explicitly allow for the use of information submitted in support of a petition
as BIA. See 19 CFR 353.37.



Department's Position: 

We do not agree with Krupp's interpretation that either the statute or its legislative history prohibits the Department
from using the information submitted in support of a petition as BIA for the margin in an administrative review. While
section 776(b) of the Tariff Act indicates that the Department ``may'' use information from the petition as a basis
for a final determination in an investigation, this section contains no prohibition, explicit or otherwise, against
using such information as a basis for the final results of an administrative review. Indeed, section 776(c) of the
Tariff Act explicitly states that, in making its ``determinations under this [sub]title,'' the Department ``shall,
whenever a party * * * refuses or is unable to produce information requested in a timely manner and in
the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation, use the best information otherwise available.''

This section, which governs the use of BIA for 

all

 determinations made under Subtitle IV of the Tariff Act, places no limitations on the use of information from the petition
for purposes of making a final BIA determination in an administrative review.

Moreover, the legislative history of the 1984 amendments to section 776 of the Tariff Act places no limitations on
the Department's use of petition information for the purposes of making BIA determinations. The House Report confirms
that ``[a]s under present law, the administering authority will use the best information available to it for its action
if it is unable to verify the accuracy of the information submitted.'' H.R. Rep. No. 98-725, 98th Cong., 2d Sess.
43 (1984). The Conference Report is even more clear that the permissive nature of the statutory language does not prohibit
the use of petition information for BIA purposes in administrative review:




The express reference in the statute to the use of information submitted in support of the petition as the best information
available for purposes of final determinations in investigations should not be interpreted as precluding the administering
authority from using the best information available for purposes of administrative reviews.




Conf. Rep. No. 98-1156, 98th Cong., 2d. Sess. 177 (1984). As is evident from the legislative history as well,
in giving the Department permissive use to employ petition information for BIA purposes in a final determination
in an investigation, Congress was careful not to place any prohibitions on the use of BIA information for purposes
of administrative reviews, including the use of information submitted in support of a petition.

Under Krupp's forced interpretation of the statutory language, the Department could not even use petition information
as a basis for a preliminary BIA determination in an investigation. Such interpretation would render the Department
powerless to secure the cooperation required to conduct investigations and administrative reviews. However, the
Court, in 

Krupp Stahl A.G.

 v. 

United States

, 553 F. Supp. 394 (CIT 1982) (

Krupp I

), has already shown such an interpretation to be invalid as it denied Krupp's motion for a preliminary injunction
to enjoin the Department from using petition information to make a preliminary BIA determination in the underlying
investigation of this case.

In addition, the Court, in 

Rhone Poulenc, Inc.

 v. 

United States

, 899 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1990), stated that the Department's BIA presumption ``implements the basic purpose of the
statute'' and ``effectively induces [respondents] to comply with agency questionnaires; an important practical
consideration since the ITA has no subpoena power.'' 

Id

. at 1191. As such, the BIA rule can be viewed as ```an investigative tool, which [the] agency may weld as an informal
club over recalcitrant parties * * * whose failure to cooperate may work against their best interest.'''


Id

., citing 

Atlantic Sugar, Ltd. 

v.

 United States

, 744 F.2d 1556, 1560 (Fed. Cir. 1984).

Accordingly, based on the plain language of the statute, a clear reading of the legislative history, and mindful of
relevant Court opinions on the application of the BIA provision of the statute, the Department must reject Krupp's
interpretation as contrary to all three. We conclude, therefore, that there is no legal basis which would prevent
the Department from using petition information for purposes of the final results of the administrative review in
question.


Comment 4: 

Krupp also claims that the Department's use of information submitted in support of the petition as BIA for this administrative
review is an unprecedented departure from Department practice. Krupp contends that the Department has clearly and
repeatedly stated that its policy is to use as BIA the higher of the highest rate for any firm: in the current review;
a previous review; or the final LTFV determination.
Krupp notes that in Replacement Parts for Self-Propelled Bituminous Paving Equipment From Canada; Final Results
of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 56 FR 47451 (September 19, 1991) (Canadian Paving Equipment), the Department
discussed that in the preliminary results of review that it had the authority to consider petition information as
BIA. However, the Department rejected the petition information for purposes of BIA in the final results of review,
despite the respondent's repeated failure to respond to the Department's requests for information. Citing industrial
Belts and Components and Parts Thereof, Whether Cured or Uncured, From the Federal Republic of Germany; Preliminary
Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 56 FR 2500 (January 23, 1991) (German Belts), Krupp contends
that the Department's statement that it preliminarily used a rate from the petition as BIA is misleading, because
the rate used is actually the margin from the final determination of the fair value investigation.


Department's Position

: As we stated in Canadian Paving Parts, ``because each investigation and administrative review present the Department
with a unique set of facts and circumstances, the Department often must select an appropriate unique BIA rate to achieve
the purpose'' of the statute. 

Id

. at 47453. See also Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review; Steel Jacks from Canada, 52 FR 32957
(Sept. 1, 1987) (``Selection of the best information is made on a case-by-case basis.'').
In Canadian Paving Parts we selected a less adverse BIA for the final results of review rather than a higher rate based
on information submitted in support of the petition because the respondent had made several attempts to cooperate
with our requests. However, the only reason the Department decided not to use the petition-based rate for the final
results of the review was because the respondent made some attempt to cooperate, not because the Department determined
it was legally precluded from doing so.
Contrary to Krupp's assertions, the Department has used petition-based rates as BIA in numerous administrative
reviews. For example, in the administrative review of Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings)
and Parts Thereof from Germany, 56 FR 31692 (July 11, 1991) (

AFBs

), we applied the most adverse BIA to companies who refused to respond to the Department's questionnaire or otherwise
significantly impeded the conduct of the administrative review. While the notice of final results indicated that
the rate used as BIA was the highest rate from the final determination of sales at LTFV, the final LTFV determination
notice clearly stated that the information used as BIA for that determination had been submitted in support of the
petition. Also, in Cellular Mobile Telephones and Subassemblies from Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative
Review, 54 FR 48011 (Nov. 20, 1989) (

CMTs

), and in Industrial Belts and Components and Parts Thereof, Whether Cured or Uncured, From the Federal Republic of
Germany; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 56 FR 9673 (Mar. 7, 1991) (German Belts), we used,
as BIA, margins from the final LTFV determinations, which were based on information submitted in support of the original
petitions. See CMTs final LTFV determination, 50 FR 45447 (Oct. 31, 1985), and German Belts final LTFV determination,
54 FR 15505 (Apr. 18, 1989), respectively.


Comment 5: 

Citing Rhone Poulenc, where the Court found that it is an acceptable interpretation of the best information statute
that the Department can presume that the highest prior margin is the most probative of current margins in BIA situations,
Krupp asserts that the Department may only consider prior margins for purposes of BIA. Krupp argues that, because
the petition-based BIA preliminary determination rate was superseded by a final calculated determination rate
in the LTVF investigation, the preliminary LTFV rate ``is not a prior margin'' and thus may not be used as BIA for the
final results of this administrative review.

In addition, Krupp argues that the Department itself declared the rates established in this preliminary determination
``no longer in effect,'' in the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Certain Stainless Steel Sheet
and Strip Products from the Federal Republic of Germany, 48 FR 20459 (May 6, 1983). Krupp goes on to argue that the Court
in Krupp I would have found Krupp's challenge to the Department's petition-based preliminary BIA margin to be ripe
for review if the Court thought that the preliminary determination ``could determine the final liquidation rate
for Krupp's entries, notwithstanding a final determination.''

The Petitioner states that application of the 27 percent rate in this case represents a reasonable exercise of the
Department's discretion to determine, on a case-by-case basis, what is the best information available. The Petitioner
argues that 19 CFR 353.37(b) provides for the use of petition information as BIA. The Petitioner further contends
that, as discussed in Rhone Poulenc, the statute provides for the Department to presume that the highest prior margin
is the most probative when a company is non-responsive to the Department's requests for information, otherwise,
the respondent would have provided current information demonstrating that the current margin is less. The Petitioner
argues that such a presumption must exist here since the respondent failed to comply with the Department's request
for information and in fact destroyed all the records pertaining to the instant period of review.



Department's Position: 

We disagree with Krupp's contentions that, in an LTFV investigation, a preliminary determination rate based upon
the best information available_in this instance from information submitted in support of the petition_is not a legitimate
margin and, thus, cannot be a ``prior margin'' which may serve as the basis for a final rate in an administrative review.
To the contrary, an affirmative preliminary BIA rate, even if based on information submitted in support of the petition,
results in the suspension of liquidation and the collection of cash deposits or bond. See section 733(d)(2) of the
Tariff Act. In addition, in 

Daewoo Electronics Co., 

v. 

United States, 

712 F. Supp. 931 (CIT 1989), the Court upheld the Department's determination that an LTFV preliminary margin serves
as a provisional measures rate cap, with respect to merchandise entered between the dates of the preliminary and final
determinations. See section 737(a) of the Tariff Act. In fact, because of the importance of the preliminary margin,
the Department has promulgated regulations providing for the correction of clerical errors in preliminary determinations
of sales at LTFV. See 57 FR 1131 (Jan. 10, 1992).

Thus, a preliminary margin, whether it is a calculated rate or is a petition-based BIA rate, has legal force and effect.
As such, it serves as a ``prior margin'' to the same extent as a final margin. In this respect, Krupp's reliance on 

Rhone Poulenc

 is misplaced. While the Federal Circuit did state that ``it reflects a common sense inference that the highest prior
margin is the most probative evidence of the current margins,'' 899 F.2. at 1190, it placed absolutely no qualifications
on what constituted the ``highest prior margin.'' The Court went on the explain that if this common sense inference
were not so, ``the [respondent], knowing of the rule, would have produced 

current

 information showing the margin to be less.'' 

Id

 (emphasis in original).

Notwithstanding its interpretation of the statutory language and legislative history, even Krupp admits that information
submitted in support of the petition can be used as a BIA rate for an administrative review. See Public Hearing Transcript
(Apr. 14, 1992) (Transcript) at 42-43. Krupp, however, attempts to qualify the use of such information by arguing
that the petition-based BIA rate must also be the final determination rate of the LTFV investigation. In other words,
if the preliminary determination is a BIA rate based on information from the petition but is ``carried forward'' to
the final determination, then it becomes a ``prior margin.'' Transcript at 43. Once this has occurred, then according
to Krupp, the petition-based BIA rate may serve as the basis for a BIA rate in an administrative review. 

Id. 

Such reasoning, however, is based on the faulty premise that a preliminary margin is not a ``real'' margin, and thus
cannot be a ``prior margin.'' However, as explained above, a preliminary margin is an actual margin to which legal
consequences attach and, thus, is as much a ``prior margin'' as the rate for the final determination. Thus, Krupp's
``carried forward'' theory must be rejected as being without legal foundation.

Further, contrary to Krupp's contentions, the final LTFV determination margin is no more representative of the period
under review than is the preliminary margin. Both of these margins are based upon information which relates to a period
prior to the period of review. Indeed, in this instance because Krupp failed to respond to the Department's information
request, it has not demonstrated that the final determination rate is any more probative of the period under review
than the preliminary rate. 

See Rhone Poulenc

, 899 F. Supp. at 1190. As such, there is no record evidence to show that one is more or less probative than the other as
to what the actual dumping margins would be for the period of review. This then is the reason for undertaking an administrative
review, i.e., to analyze information concerning the actual entries for the review period so that any duties that might
be assessed on those entries would have been based on the actual data relating to those entries.

However, when the administrative review process is thwarted, as it has been in this case by Krupp's failure to provide
information about the entries subject to review, then the Department is forced to rely upon the best information available.
Under these circumstances the court has clearly ruled that ``Commerce may exercise discretion in determining what
is the best information available when a [respondent] has failed to supply requested information.'' 

Tai Yang Metal Industrial Co., 

v. 

United States

, 712 F. Supp. 973, 977 (CIT 1989), 

citing Chemical Products Corp., 

v. 

United States

, 645 F. Supp. 289, 295 (CIT 1986). Further, when the respondent fails to provide the requested information, the use
of BIA ``can be detrimental to [respondent's] interests.'' 

Daewoo

, 712, F. Supp. at 944. Thus, because of Krupp's failure to comply with the Department's information request, it should
not find itself in a better position as a result of noncompliance than it would had it provided the Department with complete,
accurate, and timely data. 

See Canadian Paving Parts

, 56 FR at 47453. ``Otherwise, alleged unfair traders would be able to control the amount of antidumping duties by selectively
providing the ITA with information.'' 

 Olympic Adhesives, Inc., 

v. 

United States

, 899 F. 2d 1565, 1572 (CIT 1990). 

Accord, Pistachio Group of Ass'n of Food Industries 

v. 

United States

, 671 F. Supp. 31, 40 (CIT 1987).

Krupp's speculations as to what the Court might have done in 

Krupp I 

had it been able to divine the particular circumstance of this review are also misplaced. In fact, there is nothing
in the Court's opinion even to suggest that it would have considered Krupp's challenge to the preliminary determination
ripe for review if it had known that margin would be used as a BIA margin in the first administrative review because of
Krupp's failure to comply with the Department's information request. To the contrary, after reviewing the facts
surrounding the preliminary determination, the Court found that ``the deposit of estimated duties will not cause
a hardship of the type which justifies judicial intrusion into an ongoing administrative investigation.''

 

Krupp I

, 553 F. Supp. at 396. Indeed, the Court saw the deposit of estimated duties as being ``the normal consequences of involvement
in these investigations.'' 

Id

.

The reason the Court found no hardship to Krupp is that the preliminary margin is simply an estimate of the potential
duties owed_it does not represent an assessment rate for purposes of liquidation. Under the statutory scheme, all
of Krupp's entries subsequent to the date of the preliminary LTFV determination would only be liquidated at a rate
determined on the basis of an administrative review of those entries. If that assessment rate were determined to be
higher than the preliminary LTFV rate, Krupp would not be required to pay the difference. 

Id

. Thus, any so-called ``hardship'' that purportedly has befallen Krupp is of its own making by virtue of its failure
to comply with the Department's information request, thereby resulting in the assigning of an adverse BIA rate for
the entries subject to review.



Comment 6: 

The Petitioner recites the history of this litigation highlighting that, in its Motion for Summary Judgment, Krupp
asked the Court, among other alternative prayers for relief, to enjoin liquidation of the December 1982 through May
1983 entries while directing the Department to conduct an administrative review of those entries.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940405-2-00018 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940405-2-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Because the Court did not grant Krupp's request for a 7.76 percent liquidation rate, but rather instructed the Department
to conduct an administrative review, the Petitioner asserts that Krupp's actions have simply been an attempt to manipulate
the outcome of the administrative review process. The Petitioner concludes that if the Department were to apply the
7.76 percent rate as BIA in these final results, the respondent would in effect be rewarded for its lack of cooperation.



Department's Position:

 Because Krupp failed to respond to our most recent questionnaire and destroyed its business documents, thus precluding
conduct of an administrative review and verification of the written information already on the record, we agree with
the Petitioner that use of a less adverse rate as BIA in the instant review would be inappropriate. In 

Anhydrous Sodium Metasilicate From France; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review

, 53 FR 4195 (February 12, 1988), we stated that to use the information that the respondent suggests as BIA ``would,
in effect, reward the respondent for this failure to provide an adequate response'' in the review.



Final Results of Review



Based on the Department's analysis of the comments received, the final results of our review are unchanged from the
preliminary results. We determined that a 27 percent margin exists for Krupp.

The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all entries of this merchandise
made by Krupp during the period December 17, 1982 through June 23, 1983. The Department will issue appraisement instructions
directly to the Customs Service.

On August 11, 1986, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (51 FR 28739) a notice of revocation of the antidumping duty order, effective March 1, 1986. This administrative review
covering the period December 17, 1982 through June 23, 1983, does not affect the revocation of the antidumping duty
order. Therefore, we will instruct the Customs Service to continue to liquidate all entries of this merchandise exported
on or after March 1, 1986, without regard to antidumping duties.

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

AGENCY: 

Minority Business Development Agency, Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with Executive Order 11625, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting competitive
applications under its Minority Business Development Center (MBDC) program. The total cost of performance for the
first budget period (12 months) from August 1, 1994 to July 31, 1995 is estimated at $169,125. The application must
include a minimum cost-share of 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. Cost-sharing contributions
may be in the form of cash contributions, client fees, in-kind contributions or combinations thereof. The MBDC will
operate in the Beaumont-Port Arthur, Texas geographic service area.



The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.

The MBDC program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and
maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and
private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; offer a full range of management and technical
assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority
business.

Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses,
individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development
services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included
in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). An application
must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to any one evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically
acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated
by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the demonstrated responsibility
of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit
findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application
not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily receive the award.


MBDCs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project costs through non-Federal contributions.
To assist in this effort, the MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, the MBDC will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross
sales of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000.

Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.

_All non-profit and for-profit applicants are subject to a name check review process. Name checks are intended to
reveal if any key individuals associated with the applicant have been convicted of or are presently facing criminal
charges such as fraud, theft, perjury or other matters which significantly reflect on the applicant's management
honesty or financial integrity.



Award Termination

_The Departmental Grants Office may terminate any grant/cooperative agreement in whole or in part at any time before
the date of completion whenever it is determined that the award recipient has failed to comply with the conditions
of the grant/cooperative agreement. Examples of some of the conditions which can cause termination are failure to
meet cost-sharing requirements; unsatisfactory performance of the MBDC work requirements; and reporting inaccurate
or inflated claims of client assistance. Such inaccurate or inflated claims may be deemed illegal and punishable
by law.



False Statements

_A false statement on an application for Federal financial assistance is grounds for denial or termination of funds,
and grounds for possible punishment by a fine or imprisonment as provided in 18 U.S.C. 1001.

Announcement of an Opportunity To Join a Cooperative Research and Development Consortium for Air Speed Measurement
Assurance



<AGENCY>

ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) invites interested parties to participate in a cooperative
research consortium to assess the performance of air speed calibration facilities and establish realistic traceability
for the participants. Parties interested in participating in the consortium should be prepared to invest adequate
resources in the collaboration and be firmly committed to the goal of quantifying the performance of anemometer test
facilities.



The program will be within the scope and confines of The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-502,
15 U.S.C. 3710a), which provides federal laboratories including NIST, with the authority to enter into cooperative
research agreements with qualified parties. Under this law, NIST may contribute personnel, equipment and facilities_but
no funds_to the cooperative research program. Members will be expected to make a contribution to the consortium's
efforts in the form of materials, equipment, personnel, and/or funds. The program is expected to last one year. This
is not a grant program.

supplementary information: 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) invites interested parties to participate in a cooperative
research consortium to assess the performance of air speed calibration facilities and establish realistic traceability
for the participants. The calibration of anemometers is critical to ventilation measurements in the HVAC and related
industries. Presently, anemometers are calibrated by both instrument manufacturers and users alike in a wide variety
of facilities employing different methods. In most cases, both manufacturers and users establish traceability
to a central laboratory such as NIST. However, there are indications that there may be variations as large as plus or
minus 15% among the calibration measurements being made due to a lack of standard calibration technique. Measurements
are considered traceable to designated standards if scientifically rigorous evidence is produced to show that the
measurement process is producing measurement results for which the total measurement uncertainty relative to the
designated standards is quantified. Realistic traceability to national standards for flow measurement can be obtained
using a round-robin testing program, which produces reasonable estimates of systematic errors for a measurement
process. 



The purpose of the consortium is to devise an appropriate test and set the conditions so that test results quantify
the performance of anemometer calibration facilities, operated by both instrument manufacturers and users, using
a round-robin testing program. The participating members will choose instruments and test conditions so that they
are compatible with typical situations used in their facilities. 

This program is being undertaken within the scope and confines of The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (Public
Law 99-502, 15 U.S.C. 3710a), which provides federal laboratories including NIST, with the authority to enter
into cooperative research agreements with qualified parties. Under this law, NIST may contribute personnel, equipment
and facilities, but not direct funding.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Technology Reinvestment Project (TRP) is a six-agency effort that includes the Departments of Defense, Commerce,
Energy and Transportation, the National Science Foundation, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
It was formed to execute eight statutory programs enacted by Congress in the Defense Technology Conversion, Reinvestment,
and Transition Act of 1992. These eight programs have common requirements, including participation by ``partnerships,''
cost sharing between those partnerships and the Federal Government, and a focus on assisting small businesses and
defense-dependent businesses. It is the continuing mission of the TRP to stimulate the transition to a growing, integrated,
national industrial capability which provides the most advanced, affordable, military systems and the most competitive
commercial products. TRP programs are structured to expand opportunities in commercial and dual-use United States
industries and demonstrably enhance U.S. competitiveness.



This announces two planned solicitations in FY 1994 under the TRP. The first solicitation will be for a focused competition
seeking proposals in a specific set of tightly defined technology areas.

This solicitation will be announced in the Commerce Business Daily on or about 4 April 1994. The second solicitation
will cover a broader range of technology areas. The second solicitation will be announced in the Commerce Business

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of a new computer matching program between the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense
(DoD) for public comment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Subsection (e)(12) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a) requires agencies to publish advance notice
of any proposed or revised computer matching program by the matching agency for public comment. The DoD, as the matching
agency under the Privacy Act is hereby giving constructive notice in lieu of direct notice to the record subjects of
a computer matching program between VA and DoD that their records are being matched by computer. The record subjects
are VA delinquent debtors who may be current or former Federal employees receiving Federal salary or benefit payments
and who are delinquent in their repayment of debts owed to the United States Government under programs administered
by VA so as to permit VA to pursue and collect the debt by voluntary repayment or by administrative or salary offset procedures
under the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to subsection (o) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a), the DoD and VA have concluded an agreement
to conduct a computer matching program between the agencies. The purpose of the match is to exchange personal data
between the agencies for debt collection. The match will yield the identity and location of the debtors within the
Federal government so that VA can pursue recoupment of the debt by voluntary payment or by administrative or salary
offset procedures. Computer matching appeared to be the most efficient and effective manner to accomplish this task
with the least amount of intrusion of personal privacy of the individuals concerned. It was therefore concluded and
agreed upon that computer matching would be the best and least obtrusive manner and choice for accomplishing this
requirement.


A copy of the computer matching agreement between VA and DoD is available upon request to the public. Requests should
be submitted to the address caption above or to the Department of Veterans Affairs, Debt Management Center, Bishop
Henry Whipple Federal Building, 1 Federal Drive, Ft. Snelling, MN 55111-1930. Telephone (612) 725-3321.
Set forth below is the notice of the establishment of a computer matching program required by paragraph 6.c. of the
Office of Management and Budget Guidelines on computer matching published in the 

Federal Register

 at 54 FR 25818 on June 19, 1989.
The matching agreement, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(r) of the Privacy Act, and an advance copy of this notice was submitted
on March 14, 1994, to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental
Affairs of the Senate, and the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management
and Budget pursuant to paragraph 4d of Appendix I to OMB Circular No. A-130, `Federal Agency Responsibilities
for Maintaining Records about Individuals,' dated June 25, 1993 (58 FR 36075, July 2, 1993). The matching program
is subject to review by OMB and Congress and shall not become effective until that review period has elapsed.



Dated: March 22, 1994.

Notice of a Computer Matching Program Between the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense for
Debt Collection 





A. 

Participating agencies: 

Participants in this computer matching program are the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Defense Manpower
Data Center (DMDC) of the Department of Defense (DoD). The VA is the source agency, i.e., the activity disclosing the
records for the purpose of the match. The DMDC is the specific recipient activity or matching agency, i.e., the agency
that actually performs the computer matching.




B. 

Purpose of the match: 

Upon the execution of this agreement, VA will provide and disclose debtor records to DMDC to identify and locate any
Federal personnel, employed or retired, who may owe delinquent debts to the Federal Government under certain programs
administered by VA. VA will use this information to initiate independent collection of those debts under the provisions
of the Debt Collection Act when voluntary payment is not forthcoming. These collection efforts will include requests
by VA of the employing agency to apply administrative and/or salary offset procedures until such time as the obligation
is paid in full. 




C. 

Authority for conducting the match: 

The legal authority for conducting the matching program is contained in the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365),
31 U.S.C. Chapter 37, Subchapter I (General) and Subchapter II (Claims of the United States Government), 31 U.S.C.
3711 Collection and Compromise, 31 U.S.C. 3716 Administrative Offset, 5 U.S.C. 5514 Installment Deduction for Indebtedness
(Salary Offset); 10 U.S.C. 136, Assistant Secretaries of Defense, Appointment Powers and Duties; section 206 of
Executive Order 11222; 4 CFR Ch. II, Federal Claims Collection Standards (General Accounting Office - Department
of Justice); 5 CFR 550.1101 - 550.1108, Collection by Offset from Indebted Government Employees (OPM); 38 U.S.C.
3006; 38 CFR 1.980 - 1.994 (VA).





D. 

Records to be matched: 

The systems of records maintained by the respective agencies under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a,
from which records will be disclosed for the purpose of this computer match are as follows:

Privacy Act system of records identified as 58 VA 21/22, `Compensation, Pension, Education and Rehabilitation Records-VA,'
appearing at page 967 of the publication entitled Privacy Act Issuances, 1991 Comp., Volume II, and as amended at 57
FR 12374, April 9, 1992; and 57 FR 44007, September 23, 1992. The exchange of data under this agreement is consistent
with routine uses 9 and 12 of 58 VA 21/22.

Privacy Act system of records identified as 55 VA 26, `Loan Guaranty Home, Condominium and Manufactured Home Loan
Applicant Records, Specially Adapted Housing Applicant Records and Vendee Loan Applicant Records-VA,' appearing
at page 962 of the publication entitled Privacy Act Issuances, 1991 Comp., Volume II. The exchange of data under this
agreement is consistent with routine use 19 of 55 VA 26.

DoD will use the record system identified as S322.11 DMDC, entitled `Federal Creditor Agency Debt Collection Data
Base' last published in the 

Federal Register

 at 58 FR 10875 on February 22, 1993. 

Sections 5 and 10 of the Debt Collection Act authorize agencies to disclose information about debtors in order to effect
salary or administrative offsets. Agencies must publish routine uses pursuant to subsection (b)(3) of the Privacy
Act for those systems of records from which they intend to disclose this information. Sections 5 and 10 of the Debt Collection
Act will comprise the necessary authority to meet the Privacy Act's `compatibility' condition. The systems of records
described above contain an appropriate routine use disclosure between the agencies of the information proposed
in the match. The routine use provisions are compatible with the purpose for which the information was collected.





E. 

Description of Computer Matching Program: 

VA, as the source agency, will provide DMDC with a magnetic tape which contains the names of delinquent debtors in programs
VA administers. Upon receipt of the computer tape file of debtor accounts, DMDC will perform a computer match using
all nine digits of the SSN of the VA file against a DMDC computer database. The DMDC database, established under an interagency
agreement between DoD, OPM, OMB and the Department of the Treasury, consists of employment records of Federal employees
and military members, active and retired. Matching records (`hits'), based on the SSN, will produce the member's
name, service or agency, category of employee, and current work or home address. The hits or matches will be furnished
to VA. VA is responsible for verifying and determining that the data on the DMDC reply tape file are consistent with
VA's source file and for resolving any discrepancies or inconsistencies on an individual basis. VA will also be responsible
for making final determinations as to positive identification, amount of indebtedness and recovery efforts as a
result of the match. 

The magnetic computer tape provided by VA will contain data elements of the debtor's name, SSN, internal account numbers
and the total amount owed by approximately 450,000 delinquent debtors. 

The DMDC computer database file contains approximately 10 million records of active duty and retired military members,
including the Reserve and Guard, and the OPM government-wide Federal civilian records of current and retired Federal
employees. 

DMDC will match the SSNs on the VA tape by computer against the DMDC database. Matching records, hits based on SSN's,
will produce data elements of the individual's name, SSN, service or agency, and current work or home address. 





F. 

Inclusive dates of the Matching Program: 

This computer matching program is subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget and Congress. If no objections
are raised by either, and the mandatory 30 day public notice period for comment has expired for this 

Federal Register

 notice with no significant adverse public comments in receipt resulting in a contrary determination, then this computer
matching program becomes effective and the respective agencies may begin the exchange of data 30 days after the date
of this published notice at a mutually agreeable time and will be repeated annually. Under no circumstances shall
the matching program be implemented before the 30 day public notice period for comment has elapsed as this time period
cannot be waived. By agreement between VA and DoD, the matching program will be in effect and continue for 18 months
with an option to renew for 12 additional months unless one of the parties to the agreement advises the other by written
request to terminate or modify the agreement.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

DOE announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), it intends to issue on a noncompetitive basis a renewal to Dawnbreaker,
Rochester, New York, to continue providing training, through individual instruction, to recipients of Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Program Phase II awards. The period of performance for the renewal will be one year. The
estimated cost is $199,792.




PROCUREMENT REQUEST NO.: 

05-94ER80688.001.




PROJECT SCOPE: 

This grant was awarded September 15, 1989, in response to DOE Program Solicitation No. DE-PSO5-89ER80688,
and was renewed on March 15, 1991, and December 15, 1992, for a second and third year, respectively. The grantee will
continue to provide assistance to recipients of SBIR Phase II awards in preparing business plans and business opportunity
presentations, and in presenting these materials to potential sponsors in a Commercialization Opportunity Forum.
Each company will also be provided with several contacts of prospective value. A secondary objective is to have these
same companies well enough prepared so that they can pursue cooperative and other financial agreements with parties
outside the Forum. In accordance with 10 CFR 600.7, it has been determined that the activity to be funded is necessary
for the satisfactory completion of an activity that will enhance the public benefit derived and for which competition
would have a significant adverse effect on completion of the activity. Dawnbreaker has developed an exclusive capability
to perform the requisite training, both through its prior experience and through the training methods and tools developed
under the initial grant. Also, the rights to intellectual property developed under this project pass to Dawnbreaker
under the regulations which apply to small business. Eligibility for renewal of this award is, therefore, restricted
to Dawnbreaker.

SCSU is a Historically Black University and falls within the meaning and intent of Executive Orders 12320, 12677,
and 12876 pertaining to Federal assistance to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU). The participation
of HBCUs in federally supported research is relatively limited. In order to overcome some of these limitations, Executive
Orders directed Federal agencies to increase the participation of HBCUs in federally-funded programs and to strengthen
their capabilities to provide quality education. This award represents an effort to strengthen the HBCU community.


DOE has determined that this award to SCSU on a noncompetitive basis is appropriate.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy (DOE), Chicago Operations Office, through the Chicago Support Office, announces that,
pursuant to DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.14, it intends to award a grant to the University of Cincinnati/American
Institute for Pollution Prevention (AIPP). The award represents the first year of an anticipated five year relationship
between DOE and AIPP, which will permit DOE, through the Office of Industrial Technology, to participate substantively
in the direction of the Institute. The proposed grant meets the criterion for acceptance of an unsolicited application
specified in 10 CFR 600.14(e) in that the Institute's application has been found meritorious and the proposed project
represents a unique approach which is not eligible for assistance under any current or planned solicitation.



The project period for this agreement is April 15, 1994 through March 31, 1999. An award of $75,000 will be made for the
budget period April 15, 1994 through March 31, 1995.

Scoping Process:

 In gathering background information for preparation of the Environmental Assessment for the issuance of a Federal
hydropower license, staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, is using a scoping process to identify significant
environmental issues related to the construction and operation or the continued operation of hydropower projects.
The staff will review all issues raised during the scoping process and identify issues deserving of study and also
deemphasize insignificant issues, narrowing the scope of the environmental assessment as well. If preliminary
analysis indicates that any issues presented in the scoping process would have little potential for causing significant
impacts, the issue or issues will be identified and the reasons for not providing a more detailed analysis will be given.
q. 

Request for Scoping Comments:

 Federal, state, and local resource agencies; licensees, applicants and developers; Indian tribes; other interested
groups and individuals, are requested to forward to the Commission, any information that they believe will assist
the Commission staff in conducting an accurate and thorough analysis of the site-specific and cumulative environmental
effects of the proposed licensing activities of the project(s). Therefore you are requested to provide information
related to the following items:
 Information, data, maps or professional opinion that may contribute to defining the geographical and temporal
scope of the analysis and identifying significant environmental issues.
 Identification of and information from any other EIS or similar study (previous, on-going, or planned) relevant
to the proposed licensing activities in the subject river basin.
 Existing information and any data that would aid in describing the past and present effects of the project(s)
and other developmental activities on the physical/chemical, biological, and socioeconomic environments. For
example, fish stocking/management histories in the subject river, historic water quality data and the reasons for
improvement or degradation of the quality, any wetland habitat loss or proposals to develop land and water resources

<DOCTITLE>Mobile Bay Pipeline Co.; Petition To Amend</DOCTITLE>


March 30, 1994.


Take notice that on March 24, 1994, Mobile Bay Pipeline Company (Mobile Bay), 600 Travis Street, P.O. Box 1478, Houston,
Texas 77251-1478, filed in Docket No. CP89-471-008 a petition to amend the orders issued June 25,
1991 and July 23, 1991, as amended,
 pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act a request to increase the operating pressure of Mobile Bay's pipeline
facilities located in the vicinity of Mobile Bay, Alabama, all as more fully set forth in the petition to amend which
is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.




Mobile Bay requests authority to increase the operating pressure of its system from 800 to 892 psig. Mobile Bay states
that this increase in operating pressure will not result in an increase of the pipeline's design capacity. Mobile
Bay states that its maximum operating pressure (MOP) was originally based on the assumption that the maximum pressure
delivered into Koch Gateway Pipeline Company's (Koch Gateway) system would be 700 psig. Mobile Bay states that, at
this time, the MOP of Koch Gateway's transmission line at the Mobile Bay interconnect is 780 psig and that it is necessary
for Koch Gateway to operate at 780 psig in order to move the Mobile Bay volumes out of the area. Mobile Bay states that
utilizing this pressure as the downstream pressure on Mobile Bay, pressure drop calculations result in 892 psig as
the MOP necessary to move Mobile Bay's design capacity of 600 Mmcf of natural gas per day.
Mobile Bay states that it is incapable of creating additional pressure above that provided by its sources, that it
has no compression facilities on its system and that this filing does not propose to add any facilities. Mobile Bay
states that the pressure on the system is dependent upon the discharge pressures of the three processing plants and
other connected supply facilities and that it can only restrict, by use of regulation, operating pressure to something
less than that provided by its sources.
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said petition to amend should on or before April
20, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.

<DOCTITLE>State of Oklahoma; NGPA Notice of Determination by Jurisdictional Agency Designating Tight Formation </DOCTITLE>


March 30, 1994.


Take notice that on March 25, 1994, the Corporation Commission of the State of Oklahoma (Oklahoma) submitted the above-referenced
noise of determination pursuant to  271.703(c)(3) of the Commission's regulations, that the Sycamore formation,
underlying the S/2 and S/2 NE/4 and SW/4 NW/4 of Section 7, Township 4 North, Range 3 West, Garvin County, Oklahoma,
qualifies as a tight formation under section 107(b) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. 
The notice of determination contains Oklahoma's findings that the referenced formation meets the requirements
of the Commission's regulations set forth in 18 CFR part 271.
The application for determination is available for inspection, except for material which is confidential under
18 CFR 275.206, at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.
Persons objecting to the determination may file a protest, in accordance with 18 CFR   275.203 and 275.204,
within 20 days after the date this notice is issued by the Commission.

<DOCTITLE>Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.; Compliant</DOCTITLE>


March 30, 1994.


Take notice that on March 23, 1994, JMC Power Projects
 filed with the Commission a complaint against Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee).




JMC Power Projects request that the Commission find it to be unjust and unreasonable for Tennessee to continue to collect
from JMC Power Projects the volumetric surcharge component of Tennessee's Order Nos. 500 and 528 take-or-pay recovery
mechanism.
JMC Power Projects states that as a result of Order No. 636-A, JMC Power Projects do not receive the benefits of
service granted to them in Tennessee's so-called ``Cosmic Settlement'' Orders
 or to system customers served under part 284 of the Commission's Regulations. JMC Power Projects assert that absent
Commission action in this proceeding, they will be forced to continue paying, without concomitant benefit, volumetric
take-or-pay surcharges imposed upon them by the Cosmic Settlement Orders.




JMC Power Projects request the Commission to find that, as section 7(c) shippers receiving no benefits of service
under part 284 of the Commission's Regulations, and in light of the precedent established in KN Energy,
 JMC Power Projects should be exempt from contributing to Tennessee's part 284 volumertic take-or-pay surcharge.




Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said complaint should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 214
and 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure 18 CFR 385.214, 385.211. All such motions or protests should
be filed on or before April 29, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate
action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a
party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public
inspection. Answers to this complaint shall be due on or before April 29, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Texas Utilities Fuel Co.; Petition for Declaratory Order</DOCTITLE>


March 30, 1994.


Take notice that on March 22, 1994, Texas Utilities Fuel Company (TUFCO), 400 North Olive Street, Dallas, Texas 75201,
filed in Docket No. CP94-306-000 a petition for declaratory order requesting that the Commission declare
that TUFCO's transportation and delivery of natural gas to a Hinshaw pipeline that engages in transactions under
an Order No. 63 certificate would not render TUFCO, its facilities, any gas flowing through its facilities or any facilities
or natural gas in the facilities with which TUFCO is interconnected, subject to the Commission's Natural Gas Act (NGA)
jurisdiction, all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.
TUFCO states that it is an intrastate natural gas pipeline operating solely within the State of Texas. TUFCO further
states that it is presently exempt from NGA jurisdiction by reason of section 1(b) of the NGA (15 U.S.C. 717(b) (1993))
and is an intrastate pipeline under section 2(16) of the NGPA (15 U.S.C. 3301(16) (1982)). TUFCO says that it is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Texas Utilities Company, an investor-owned holding company for an electric utility system. TUFCO's
primary function is to provide a reliable and secure supply of gas to its affiliate, Texas Utilities Electric Company
(TU Electric), an operating electric public utility company, which is regulated by the Public Utility Commission
of Texas.
TUFCO indicates that it purchases gas directly from Texas producers, intrastate pipelines and other marketers of
natural gas in the State of Texas. Gas purchased by TUFCO is delivered into its intrastate pipeline system and is redelivered
to the electric generation stations of TU Electric, it is stated. TUFCO also provides intrastate transportation
services to shippers at times when capacity is available in its system in excess of that required to serve TU Electric.
TUFCO says it does not provide interstate transportation service under NGPA section 311.
TUFCO states that it has been requested by potential shippers to transport gas through its system for delivery to Seagas
Pipeline Company (Seagas). It is further stated that these shippers would then arrange for transportation by Seagas
to markets located within Texas, either directly or through additional interconnecting pipelines. TUFCO submits
that all of the gas transported by TUFCO would be contractually committed to consumers in Texas.
TUFCO says it also desires to exchange gas with Seagas. As proposed, TUFCO would deliver gas to Seagas at various points
on Seagas' system in exchange for a like quantity of gas at other points. However, TUFCO states it would not receive
any interstate gas from Seagas. Each point of redelivery to TUFCO would be from gathering or production facilities
in Texas to ensure that all of the gas received by TUFCO would be intrastate gas, not commingled with the interstate
gas in the Seagas system.
TUFCO states that Seagas is a Hinshaw pipeline in Texas, exempt from Commission jurisdiction under NGA section 1(c).
Phillips Natural Gas Company, 43 FERC  62,049(1988). TUFCO further states that Seagas also holds an Order No.
63 certificate that allows it to transport gas that will be delivered out of the state of Texas, without losing its NGA
section 1(c) exempt status. 

Id.
TUFCO says that none of the gas received by TUFCO from Seagas will have been transported in, or commingled with gas transported
in interstate commerce. However, TUFCO states that because the gas delivered by TUFCO to Seagas in each of the above
transactions may be commingled with gas in Seagas's line that will be delivered out-of-state under an Order No. 63
certificate, TUFCO seeks a declaration from the Commission that its transportation of that gas before delivery to
Seagas, or other Hinshaw pipelines under similar circumstances, would not subject TUFCO, its facilities, any gas
transported by TUFCO, or the facilities of others, to NGA jurisdiction.
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said petition should on or before April 20, 1994,
file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance
with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211). All protests
filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve
to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate
as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the State of Mississippi is revising its approved State Public Water Supply Supervision
Primacy Program. Mississippi has adopted drinking water regulations for the Phase V (Volatile Organic Chemicals
(VOC), Synthetic Organic Chemicals (SOC), and Inorganic Chemicals (IOC)) Rule. EPA has determined that this set
of State program revisions is no less stringent than the corresponding federal regulations. Therefore, EPA has tentatively
decided to approve this State program revision. 


All interested parties may request a public hearing. A request for a public hearing must be submitted no later than
thirty (30) days after this publication to the Regional Administrator at the address shown below. Frivolous or insubstantial
requests for a hearing may be denied by the Regional Administrator. However, if a substantial request for a public

<DOCTITLE>FCC Cable Forms</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document summarizes the revised regulations that will govern cable service rate regulations by local and federal
officials. As a result of these Commission actions, several FCC forms were developed in order for the Commission to
assess whether rates for regulated basic cable services and rates for regulated cable programming services are reasonable.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a synopsis of the rate regulation forms developed in response to actions taken in MM Docket No. 92-266,
MM Docket 92-262 and MM Docket No. 93-215, adopted February 22, 1994.






1. The Commission adopted a Second Order on Reconsideration, Fourth Report and Order, and Fifth Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking in MM Docket No. 92-266. The Second Order on Reconsideration describes revised regulations that
will govern cable service rate regulation by local and federal officials. These regulations will be used by cable
operators to assess whether rates for regulated basic cable services and rates for regulated cable programming services
are reasonable. Generally, the Commission refined and improved its statistical and economic analysis of the cable
industry, and adopted a new benchmark formula which will replace the old benchmark formula after May 15, 1994. The
benchmark formula is based on the competitive differential between rates charged by cable systems subject to effective
competition and those charged by systems not subject to effective competition, and establishes maximum permitted
levels for regulated cable service rates. The Commission has established a price cap mechanism to govern regulated
cable service rates on a going-forward basis. The revised regulations also include rules governing permitted rate
adjustments for changes in inflation, and permitted rate adjustments for changes in external costs, for instance,
programming costs associated with new and existing programming, retransmission consent fees, and taxes imposed
on the provision of cable service. The Fourth Report and Order describes revised regulations to govern permitted
rate adjustments when operators seek to add or delete channels on regulated service tiers.

2. The Commission also adopted a Third Order on Reconsideration in MM Docket Nos. 92-266 and 92-262 in which
it, 

inter alia, 

refined the calculations necessary to determine permitted equipment and installation costs. The 1992 Cable Act
requires equipment and installation rates be based on actual cost. Pursuant to this Order, cable operators must generally
calculate and provide their equipment and installation charges on several occasions: (1) When establishing maximum
initial permitted rates for regulated cable services because Commission rules require operators to separate out
equipment and installation rates in the determination of initial regulated rates for basic cable service, and (2)
to update equipment and installation charges on an annual basis. 

3. Finally, the Commission also adopted a Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making in MM Docket No.
93-215 regarding cost-based cable regulation. In that document, the Commission adopted rules and procedures
for cost of service rate showings. Under these regulations, a cable operator may request relief from the required
reduction in rates by showing that its costs of service are unusually high. This approach balances the interests of
the cable operators and their customers, permitting operators to recover from customers only the reasonable costs
of providing regulated services, including operating expenses and a reasonable rate of return. The Commission provided
for reduced showings by small cable systems seeking to justify rates based on costs. Small systems can use a form that
calls for significantly less information in cost showings than other operators. This reduces the regulatory burden
on those businesses.

4. To implement the rules adopted in MM Docket No. 92-266, the Commission has developed the following forms.

5. FCC Form 1200, Setting Maximum Initial Permitted Rates for Regulated Cable Services and Equipment Pursuant to
Rules Adopted February 22, 1994 (the ``First Time Filers Form''). This form is designed to collect information sufficient
to permit an operator regulated by a local franchise authority or the FCC to calculate figures relating to regulated
revenues per subscriber as of March 31, 1994, figures relating to the benchmark as of that date, and figures relating
to the Full Reduction Rate, which reflects application of the full 17 percent competitive differential. This form
then compares these sets of figures to derive the maximum permitted rates for regulated cable services as of May 15,
1994. The form will be filed with local franchising authorities (or the FCC in limited circumstances) in response
to basic service rate regulation, and with the FCC in response to cable programming service rate complaints. OMB Control
Number: 3060-0571, estimated annual burden: 11,200 responses; 20 hours per response; 224,000 hours total
annual burden.

6. FCC Form 1201, Facsimile Request. This form permits cable operators to request assistance from the Commission
in completing FCC Form 1200. The operator may request assistance in determining the census income figure, the revised
benchmark calculation and the channel adjustments. OMB Control Number: 3060-0597, estimated annual burden:
14,000 responses; 1 hour per response; 14,000 hours total annual burden.
7. FCC Form 1205, Determining Costs of Regulated Cable Equipment and Installation. This form collects information
sufficient to allow a cable operator to determine the costs associated with regulated equipment and installation
for the basic service tier and the maximum permitted charges for such equipment. This form will be filed in conjunction
with FCC Form 1200, to update equipment and installation charges on an annual basis. The form will be filed with local
franchising authorities (or the FCC in limited circumstances) in response to basic service rate regulation, and
with the FCC in response to cable programming service rate complaints. OMB Control Number: 3060-0592, estimated
annual burden: 16,600 responses; 20 hours per response; 332,000 hours total annual burden.
8. FCC Form 1210, Updating Maximum Permitted Rates for Regulated Services and Equipment. This form collects information
sufficient to allow the operator to calculate changes in external costs, addition and deletion of channels, and inflation
that have taken place since March 31, 1994. The form may be filed up to four times per year, once in each calendar year
quarter, by operators wishing to claim adjustments to maximum permitted rates to reflect increased costs. This form
must also be filed if there is a decrease in costs and to reflect channel deletions. The form will be filed with local
franchising authorities (or the FCC in limited circumstances) in response to basic service rate regulation, and
with the FCC in response to cable programming service rate complaints. OMB Control Number: 3060-0595, estimated
annual burden: 33,600 responses; 10 hours per response; 336,000 hours total annual burden.
9. FCC Form 1215, A La Carte Channel Offerings. This form is designed to collect and compare information about channels
offered on an individual (a la carte) basis and packages of these channels offered on April 1, 1993. This form must be
filed by the cable operator in conjunction with each FCC Form 1200 and FCC Form 1210. The form will be filed with local
franchising authorities (or the FCC in limited circumstances) in connection with basis service rate regulation,
and with the FCC in response to cable programming service rate complaints. OMB Control Number: 3060-0593, estimated
annual burden: 44,800 responses; 1 hour per response; 44,800 hours total annual burden.
10. To implement the rules adopted in the Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making in MM Docket No.
93-215, the Commission has developed the following forms.
11. FCC Form 1220, Cost of Service Schedule. This form is designed to be used by cable operators wishing to justify rates
above levels determined under the benchmark approach. The form will be filed with local franchising authorities
(or the FCC in limited circumstances) in response to basic service rate regulation, and with the FCC in response to
cable programming service rate complaints. OMB Control Number: 3060-0594, estimated annual burden: 2,100
responses; 80 hours per response; 168,000 hours total annual burden.
12. FCC Form 1225, Cost of Service Schedule For Small Systems. This form can be used by independent small systems and
by small systems owned by a multiple system operator that services 250,000 subscribers or less, has no system with
more than 10,000 subscribers, and has an average system size of 1,000 subscribers or less. The form will be filed with
local franchising authorities (or the FCC in limited circumstances) in response to basic service rate regulation,
and with the FCC in response to cable programming service rate complaints. OMB Control Number: 3060-0596, estimated
annual burden: 700 responses; 60 hours per response; 42,000 hours total annual burden.
13. Note: The information collections associated with this notice have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget for ninety days under the emergency processing procedures contained in 5 CFR 1320.18 and assigned the OMB
numbers listed above. The Commission will resubmit these collections during this ninety day period for routine clearance.

<DOCTITLE>Expansion of the U.S. Plaza at Rainbow Bridge, Niagara Falls, NY; Environmental Impact Statement</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

General Services Administration (GSA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The GSA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an EIS will be prepared for the expansion of the U.S. plaza at
the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls, New York.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The GSA will serve as lead agency in the preparation of an EIS for the expansion of the U.S. plaza at the Rainbow Bridge
in Niagara Falls, New York. The project is sponsored by the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission (NFBC), and includes the
demolition of existing plaza facilities and the construction of new, expanded facilities at the site. The GSA will
lease space at the newly expanded facility for use by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and the
U.S. Customs Service. The international border functions of the INS and Customs are severely hindered at the Rainbow
Bridge due to increasing traffic volumes at the plaza and the limited size and functional obsolescence of the existing
facilities. Therefore, the proposed project is being undertaken to accommodate the existing and projected growth
in traffic and the resultant expansion requirements of INS and Customs. The proposed plaza facilities accommodate
existing and future demand by providing approximately 48,000 square feet (SF) of interior and exterior space which
will be leased to GSA for the essential functions of INS and Customs.


The EIS will evaluate U.S. Rainbow Bridge plaza alternatives, including the non-action alternative. It will also
evaluate impacts on the affected environment, including the following resource areas; subsurface and geological
conditions, including water quality; landforms; vegetation and wildfire; natural hazards; air quality; noise;
population and economic conditions; land use and zoning; archaeological, historic, architectural elements, and
visual impacts; utilities; traffic and transportation; and hazardous wastes. The Rainbow Bridge plaza is located
within the boundaries of the Niagara Reservation National Historic Landmark and issues related to Section 6(f) of
the U.S. Land and Water Conservation Fund Act and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act will be prominent
in the EIS.


Public Scoping Meeting


To ensure that all issues relating to the proposed project are identified and all potentially significant issues
are addressed and satisfied in the EIS, public comments and suggestions are being solicited. To facilitate the receipt
of comments, public scoping meetings will be held on Tuesday, May 3, 1994 from 3 P.M. to 5 P.M. and from 7 P.M. to 9 P.M.
at the Niagara Falls Public Library, Earl W. Brydges Library Building, 1425 Main Street, Niagara Fall, New York.
Written comments may be mailed to the informational contact person no later than June 3, 1994.



Issued in New York, NY, on May 25, 1994.

Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 



Introduction 


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
cooperative agreements to: (1) Continue monitoring the prevalence of major behavioral risks associated with the
leading causes of premature death through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS); and (2) Improve
the State capacity to analyze program data collected through the BRFSS and ensure the use of analyzed data in program
planning, monitoring, evaluation, determining program priorities, policy development, assessing trends, and
targeting relevant population groups. Survey data collection will continue to be encouraged and supported, but
the emphasis of this announcement is the analysis and routine use of collected data and information to actively direct
successful program development. 

This announcement addresses two distinct levels of support. The first is a Core Capacity Program, which consists
of using BRFSS data for planning, developing, integrating, coordinating and evaluating chronic disease(s) prevention
and control programs, and monitoring the prevalence of major behavioral risks associated with leading causes of
premature death. The second is an Enhanced Program, which is intended to increase State capacity to analyze BRFSS
data and institutionalize routine use of BRFSS data to develop meaningful interventions and direct program development.
Applicants may apply for a Core Capacity Program or for both a Core Capacity Program and an Enhanced Program. Enhanced
Program awards will only be considered for those applicants which successfully compete and are funded for Core Capacity
Program awards. 


The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to the priority area, Surveillance Data Systems. 
(For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section Where to 
Obtain Additional Information.) 



Authority 


This program is authorized under section 317(k)(3) (42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(3)) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended.




Smoke-Free Workplace 



The Public Health Service strongly encourages all cooperative agreement recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace
and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the
physical and mental health of the American people. 



Eligible Applicants 


Assistance will be provided only to the official health departments of States or their bona fide agents or instrumentalities.
This includes the District of Columbia, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the
Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the
Republic of Palau. 


Funding priority consideration for the Core Capacity Program will be given to States currently funded for BRFSS.


Eligible applicants have been restricted to official health departments of States or their bona fide agents or instrumentalities
because: 

1. The conduct of statewide health promotion, health education and risk reduction programs directed towards reducing
the prevalence of these behavioral risks in the population lie solely with State health departments.

<TEXT>
 

2. The methodology for the conduct of this program has been structured to support the national goals/objectives put
forth in ``Healthy People 2000.'' In many instances, State health departments have already embraced or established
their own goals/objectives which match or are synonymous with those outlined in ``Healthy People 2000.'' 

The information gathered under the BRFSS is expected to be of use to State health departments to support risk reduction
and disease prevention activities. Because comparable methods are used from State to State and from year to year,
States can compare risk factor prevalence with other States and monitor the effects of interventions over time. Also,
the use of consistent methods in a large group of States permits the assessment of geographic patterns of risk factor
prevalence. These telephone survey techniques can also be applied at the community level to guide local efforts in
reducing risk factor prevalence. Combined, the behavioral risk factor survey and surveillance data provide a new
resource to guide State and local disease prevention efforts. 



Availability of Funds 


Approximately $2,250,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund approximately 50 awards in the following two categories:




A. Core Capacity Program 


Approximately $2,000,000 is available to fund approximately 50 awards. It is expected that the average award will
be $39,000 ranging from $24,000 to $54,000. 




B. Enhanced Program 



Approximately $250,000 is available to fund approximately 10 awards. It is expected that the average award will be
$25,000 ranging from $10,000 to $40,000. Enhanced Program awards will only be considered for those applicants which
successfully compete and are funded for Core Capacity Program awards. 

It is expected that the awards will begin on or about 
September 1, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 5 years. Funding estimates
may vary and are subject to change. 


Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability
of funds. 



Purpose 



The purpose of this program is to provide financial and programmatic assistance to State health departments to maintain
and expand State specific BRFSS activities and permanently establish the analysis and routine use of BRFSS data and
information in directing program planning, evaluating programs, determining program priorities, developing
policy, assessing trends, and targeting relevant population groups. 

Potential enhancement options envisioned by CDC would include the following: 

1. Expansion of State data analytic capacity and capabilities to produce information necessary to support chronic
disease prevention and control activities at the State and local level through collaboration with State health department
programs, universities, CDC supported Prevention Centers, and other relevant organizations. 

2. Expansion of present interviewing capacity to provide pilot or validity testing of surveillance questions or
questionnaires. 

3. Expansion of data collection and sampling frames to include point-in-time surveys or over sampling of minority
or other targeted high-risk populations. 

4. Expansion of data management, collection, and analysis activities by acquisition of hardware and software compatible
with CDC systems. 

5. Participation in testing of newly designed sampling procedures to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and strengthen
statistical power.

Introduction 



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
new competing cooperative agreements to initiate capacity building for the core components of comprehensive breast
and cervical cancer control programs. 

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Cancer. (To order a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see
the section Where to Obtain Additional Information.) 



Authority 



This program is authorized under section 301(a) (42 U.S.C. 241(a)), section 317(k)(3) (42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(3)), and
section 1501 (42 U.S.C. 300k) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended. 



Smoke-Free Workplace 



The Public Health Service strongly encourages all cooperative agreement recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace
and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the
physical and mental health of the American people. 



Eligible Applicants 



Eligible applicants are the official public health agencies of the five States of Idaho, Kentucky, Nevada, South
Carolina and Tennessee or their bona fide agents or instrumentalities and the District of Columbia, American Samoa,
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, the Northern Mariana
Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau. All other States were previously funded
under Program Announcement Numbers 121, 122, 221, and 321 entitled ``Early Detection and Control of Breast and Cervical
Cancer,'' in FY 1991, 1992, and 1993, and are not eligible to compete for funding under this program announcement.

Availability of Funds 



Approximately $1,200,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund approximately 7 awards. It is expected that the average award
will be $170,000, ranging from $150,000 to $200,000. It is expected that the awards will begin on or about June 30, 1994,
and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 3 years. Funding estimates may vary and
are subject to change. 

Continuation awards within the project period are made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability of
funds. 

Funding preference will be given to applications from State health departments who are in the initial planning phase
for statewide breast and cervical cancer screening. 

At the request of the applicant, Federal personnel may be assigned to a project in lieu of a portion of the financial
assistance. 



Purpose 



The purpose of these cooperative agreements is to support State health departments in their efforts to develop their
capacity to carry out a program for early detection and control of breast and cervical cancer. The intent is to initially
enable States to build the necessary infrastructure towards providing a comprehensive breast and cervical cancer
early detection program. Resources available under this program announcement may not be used to support screening
and follow up services for breast and cervical cancer. 



Program Requirements 



In conducting activities to achieve the purpose of this program, the recipient shall be responsible for the activities
under A., below, and CDC shall be responsible for conducting activities under B., below: 



A. Recipient Activities 



The following six elements are essential and integral components in the development of a State-based comprehensive
breast and cervical cancer control program. Planning for conducting the core components must occur during the first
and second year, with implementation begun by completion of the project period. 



1. Breast and Cervical Cancer Control Plan and Coalition 



In developing a comprehensive breast and cervical cancer control program, the applicant should include the following:


a. A State level breast and cervical cancer control coalition including representation from key private, professional,
voluntary and public (e.g., American Cancer Society) cancer organizations, legislators, and consumers. 

b. A proposed breast and cervical cancer control plan that describes: 

(1) Goals and objectives to address breast and cervical cancer control. 

(2) Proposed strategies to meet those objectives. 

(3) An assessment of existing and needed resources to develop the comprehensive breast and cervical cancer control
program. 



2. Public Education 



A plan for a comprehensive public education program based on an assessment of the target populations educational
needs. Successful public education programs are those that influence knowledge, attitudes, and practices related
to breast and cervical cancer screening adherence in target populations by utilizing all available resources which
may include, but are not limited to, the American Cancer Society, State medical societies, and universities.

3. Professional Education 


A plan for conducting an assessment of the health care providers to determine important practice information useful
in developing an education program. This could include: (1) Screening behaviors in their practices; (2) Knowledge
of screening guidelines; (3) Use of screening reminder systems; (4) Laboratories used for reading Pap smears; and
(5) Sites of mammography referrals. 
After the health care provider assessment has been conducted, States should collaborate with appropriate professional
groups and organizations to develop a provider education program. The development of a health provider education
program would transmit information on the efficacy and appropriate use of screening procedures and reminder systems
for providers. 
Participate in the CDC sponsored training workshops and meetings by ensuring that appropriate representatives
attend using travel funds provided through this cooperative agreement. 



4. Quality Assurance 


In preparation for developing a statewide quality assurance component: (1) Conduct a statewide assessment to determine
the current status and identify areas of need in mammography and cervical cytology quality assurance; and (2) Develop
the components of a comprehensive quality assurance program based on guidelines developed by CDC. 


a. Mammography 


The achievement of mammography's full potential contribution to the process of early breast cancer detection requires
that quality assurance procedures be systematically applied in routine practice. Mammography quality assurance
encompasses the importance of the design, function, and operation of equipment, patient and provider communication,
image quality, interpretation of the mammogram, communication of the radiologist's interpretation, and record
keeping. 
The minimal quality level for mammography shall include the following criteria: 
(1) Properly trained and experienced personnel. 
(2) Proper use of appropriate, well-maintained, dedicated equipment. 
(3) Periodic performance evaluation tests of the imaging system following guidelines recommended by the American
College of Radiology. 


b. Cervical Cytology 


The minimal quality level for cervical cytology shall include the following criteria: 
(l) Properly trained, accredited, and certified personnel. 
(2) Licensed laboratories that maintain an ongoing quality assurance program, to include provisions for alternative
cervical cancer screening techniques if such systems are used by the participating laboratories. 
(3) Appropriate reporting and communication of results. 


5. Surveillance 


States should assess current capabilities and develop a plan to ensure that changes in disease burden and screening
behavior can be adequately monitored. To do this, a surveillance system should:

a. Collect population-based information on race, incidence, staging at diagnosis, and mortality from breast and
cervical cancers. 
b. Identify population segments at higher risk for disease and for failure to be screened. 
c. Identify factors that contribute to disease burden and limited or inequitable access to early detection and treatment
services. 
d. Monitor the number and characteristics of women screened and outcomes of screening. 
e. Monitor screening resources, including the number of mammography facilities, cytology laboratories, and providers
of cytology screening. 
f. Design and conduct case studies and other epidemiologic investigations to determine factors associated with
avoidable morbidity and mortality. 
g. Publish a yearly report summarizing the population status with respect to these conditions. 


6. Evaluation 


Attention should be given to the development, establishment, and design of individual components to ensure that
there can be meaningful evaluation. The evaluation plan should assess the performance and effectiveness of intervention
components, including: 
a. Coalition development. 
b. Cancer plan development. 
c. Public education. 
d. Professional education. 
e. Quality assurance. 
f. Surveillance. 
At a minimum, the evaluation plan should assess the existing State breast and cervical cancer control program and
should include the following: 
a. A description of the evaluation plan and how evaluation results will be used. 
b. A description of methods used to assess the development of program activities in all program components. 


B. CDC Activities 


1. Convene meetings for representatives of States receiving awards for workshops and sharing information. 
2. Convene meetings for representatives of States receiving awards for training purposes. 
3. Disseminate to State health departments relevant state-of-the-art research findings and public health recommendations
that relate to early detection, diagnosis, and treatment for breast and cervical cancer.
4. Collaborate with recipients in planning, operating, and evaluating program activities and coordinating projects'
participation in all components of the cancer program. 
5. Collaborate with recipients in developing surveillance and data systems and in the States' analysis and evaluation
of data. 
6. Provide technical assistance in the development of public and professional education components. 
7. Collaborate with recipients in disseminating outcome indicators and their integration into program operation.

8. Provide guidance in the development and establishment of specific morbidity reduction objectives. 
9. Provide technical information and guidelines in the development of quality assurance procedures for mammography
and cervical cytology. 
10. Provide technical assistance and direction in the development of evaluation efforts.

When an exclusion is imposed, no program payment is made to anyone for any items or services (other than an emergency
item or service not provided in a hospital emergency room) furnished, ordered or prescribed by an excluded party under
the Medicare, Medicaid, Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant and Block Grants to States for Social Services
programs. In addition, no program payment is made to any business or facility, e.g., a hospital, that submits bills
for payment for items or services provided by an excluded party. Program beneficiaries remain free to decide for themselves
whether they will continue to use the services of an excluded party even though no program payments will be made for
items and services provided by that excluded party. The exclusions have national effect and also apply to all other
Federal non-procurement programs.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of amendment to HUD notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice provides notification of an amendment to a Notice to HUD Field Offices (Notice H-93-71) from
the Office of Housing, which announces expanded eligibility and provides procedures for advertising for, receipt
of, and processing requests for section 8 funds for service coordinators for qualifying projects. Additional funds
are available for service coordinators in Fiscal Year 1994 for qualifying projects, which now include projects assisted
under section 8, section 221(d)(3) BMIR, and section 236, as well as section 202 projects. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice provides notification to interested parties that the Office of Housing has amended HUD Notice H-93-71,
which provides procedures to HUD field offices of advertising for, receipt of, and processing requests for section
8 funds for service coordinators. Additional funds are available for service coordinators in Fiscal Year 1994 for
qualifying projects. 



The amendment to HUD Notice H-93-71 (entitled ``Processing of Requests for section 8 Funds for Service
Coordinators in section 8, 202, 202/8, 221 and 236 Projects and Monitoring of Approved Requests_Fiscal Year (FY)
1994'') extends funding for service coordinators to section 8 projects (including FMHA section 515/8) with project-based
subsidy and section 221(d) BMIR and section 236 projects without project-based subsidy. Available funding is $22
million for section 202 and 202/8, $15 million for section 8, and $10 for section 221(d) BMIR and section 236 projects
without subsidy. All requests must be for projects which are housing for the elderly and disabled. Eligible projects
include any building within a mixed-use project that was designated for occupancy by elderly persons, or persons
with disabilities at its inception, or although not so designated, for which the eligible owner gives preferences
in tenant selection (with HUD approval) for all units in the eligible project to eligible elderly persons or persons
with disabilities. There are three new dollar allocation plans and a new request submission and review schedule.



A service coordinator is a social service staff person hired by the project owner/management company. The coordinator
is responsible for assuring that the elderly, especially those who are frail, and disabled residents of the project
are linked to the supportive services they need to continue living independently in that project.

Regulatory Waiver Requests Granted



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Secretary, HUD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Public notice of the granting of regulatory waivers.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under section 106 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (Reform Act), the Department
is required to make public all approval actions taken on waivers of regulations. This Notice provides notification
of waivers granted during the period from March 1 to September 30, 1993.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 106 of the Reform Act amended section 7 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(q)(3))
to provide:




1. Any waiver of a regulation must be in writing and must specify the grounds for approving the waiver;

2. Authority to approve a waiver of a regulation may be delegated by the Secretary only to an individual of Assistant
Secretary rank or equivalent rank, and the person to whom authority to waive is delegated must also have authority
to issue the particular regulation to be waived;

3. Not less than quarterly, the Secretary must notify the public of all waivers of regulations that the Department
has approved, by publishing a notice in the 

Federal Register.

 These Notices (each covering the period since the most recent previous notification) shall:

a. Identify the project, activity, or undertaking involved;

b. Describe the nature of the provision waived, and the designation of the provision;

c. Indicate the name and title of the person who granted the waiver request;

d. Describe briefly the grounds for approval of the request;

e. State how additional information about a particular waiver grant action may be obtained.

Today's document notifies the public of HUD's waiver-grant activity from March 1 to September 30, 1993. The next Notice,
which will be published in the near future, will cover the period from October 1 through December 31, 1993.

For ease of reference, waiver requests granted by departmental officials authorized to grant waivers are listed
in a sequence keyed to the section number of the HUD regulation involved in the waiver action. For example, a waiver-grant
action involving exercise of authority under 24 CFR 24.200 (involving the waiver of a provision in part 24) would come
early in the sequence, while waivers in the section 8 and section 202 programs (24 CFR chapter VIII) would be among the
last matters listed. Where more than one regulatory provision is involved in the grant of a particular waiver request,
the action is listed under the section number of the first regulatory requirement in title 24 that is being waived as
part of the waiver-grant action. (For example, a waiver of both  811.105(b) and  811.107(a) would appear
sequentially in the listing under  811.105(b).) Waiver-grant actions involving the same initial regulatory
citation are in time sequence beginning with the earliest-dated waiver-grant action.

Should the Department receive additional reports of waiver actions taken during the period covered by this report
before the next report is published, the next updated report will include these earlier actions.

Accordingly, information about approved waiver requests pertaining to regulations of the Department is provided
in the Appendix to this Notice.

Development March 1, 1993 Through September 30, 1993




Note to reader: 

The person to be contacted for additional information about the waiver-grant items in this listing is: Oliver Walker,
Chief, Directives, Reports and Forms Branch, Office of Housing, Management Division, Department of Housing and
Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410, Telephone: (202) 708-1694.



1. 

Regulation: 

24 CFR 248.233(f)_Prepayment of Low Income Housing Mortgages.


Project/Activity: 

Multiple projects under the control of Carabetta. Enterprises, Inc., Managing General Partner.


Nature of Requirement: 

The Regulation prohibits Approvals of Plans of Action when audit findings remain open.


Granted By: 

Nicolas P. Retsinas, Assistant Secretary For Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner.


Date Granted: 

September 23, 1993.


Background: 

This is in response to William Hernandez's memorandum, dated July 7, 1993, requesting a blanket waiver of the subject
regulation with respect to 26 Plans of Action for which Carabetta Enterprises, Inc. (CEI) or Joseph Carabetta is the
managing general partner. The request for the waiver is required because an audit report issued by the Regional Inspector
General for Audit on March 5, 1993, cited CEI for the improper diversion of funds from project accounts and/or the nonpayment
of section 236 Excess Income totalling approximately $7.5 million from 40 properties, including the 26 for which
the Plans of Action have been filed. The subject regulation prohibits approval of any Plan of Action so long as audit
findings are outstanding.


Reason Waived: 

The mortgagors propose to resolve the audit findings by repaying the diverted funds out of equity proceeds distributed
as incentives pursuant to Plans of Action approved under the Emergency Low-Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987
(ELIHPA). Your office has also proposed a penalty in the amount of $3 million in lieu of pursuing civil money penalties
or affirmative litigation for double damages. Further, your office proposes to collect the full amount of the diverted
funds and the penalty from the proceeds of the approved Plans of Action 

in toto 

before the mortgagors may distribute any proceeds to the partnerships.
This office approves the waiver request on the following conditions.


Mortgagor Requirements


All diversions and unpaid section 236 Excess Income, plus interest accruing at the Treasury Bill rate from the date
of the audit report, will be paid back to the project accounts or to the Department as appropriate from equity distributed
pursuant to approved Plans of Action. All diversions must be restored and all unpaid Excess income must be repaid prior
to the mortgagor retaining any of the equity for distribution to any of the partnerships.
CEI will agree to pay $4,010,000, which represents $5,000 per audit violation for 802 violations. The full amount
of the payment must be remitted to the Department prior to the mortgagor retaining any equity distribution from approved
Plans of Action to any of the partnerships.
All diversions repaid to the project account may be used to meet accounts payable to unaffiliated vendors. After all
such obligations have been discharged, the balance of the funds will be deposited into the Reserve for Replacement
escrow account with the mortgagee. The funds may not be used to pay obligations due affiliated or identity-of-interest
vendors, capital advances made by any partnership or partner, deposited into the Residual Receipts escrow account
or to pay accrued, unpaid distributions to any partnership.
The mortgagors will agree to apply for section 241(f) equity loans within five (5) working days of final approval of
ELIHPA Plans of Action.
The mortgagors will agree to maintain the properties in good physical condition for the term of the use agreement executed
as a condition for receiving incentives pursuant to an approved ELIHPA Plan of Action.
The mortgagors will agree to submit all required reports timely. Such reports will include monthly and quarterly
reports of project operations, accounts payable and accounts receivable as directed by your office.
The mortgagors will agree that all books, records, files and related documents will be available for review, inspection
and audit by the Department or its designee for the term of the ELIHPA use agreement.
The mortgagors will agree to offer a right of first refusal of sale on each property to the Department's designee upon
payment in full of the mortgage note at the expiration of the mortgage.
The mortgagors will agree to extend the affordability restrictions for a period of not less than 30 years beyond the
term of the original mortgage for each project for which an ELIHPA Plan of Action is approved.

CEI and Joseph Carabetta will voluntarily agree to be suspended from participation in any program/projects operated
by the Department for a period of two (2) years, reviewable annually by your office upon request of CEI or Joseph Carabetta.


Field Office Requirements


Your office will prepare a schedule of payables due the projects and the Department, including all diversions, unpaid
section 236 excess income, accrued interest and civil money penalties. Upon approval of each ELIHPA Plan of Action,
the funding request to the Office of Preservation and Property Disposition will include an updated copy of this schedule
showing: interest accrued since the last funding request, proceeds of the equity loan and application of the proceeds
to project accounts, unpaid Excess Income and penalties as appropriate. This report will be required until the entire
amount of funds owed is repaid. Funds will be applied first to diversions and interest, second to delinquent excess
income and interest, and third to penalties, until all are paid.
Upon approval of an ELIHPA Plan of Action, your office will report a waiver of 24 CFR 248.233(f) for the project.
The first 80% of the penalty is to be remitted to be deposited in the Special Risk Insurance Fund. The balance (20%) of
the penalty should have separate checks issued, on a unit proportionate basis, to tenant associations or their legal
representatives, of each of the 40 projects for use as those associations see fit.
If you have any questions about the terms and conditions of this waiver, please call Kevin East at (202) 708-2300.





2. 

Regulation: 

24 CFR 811.105(b), 811.107(a)(2), 811.108(a)(1), 811.108(a)(3), 811.114(b)(3), 811.114(d), 811.115(b).


Project/Activity: 

Laurel Woods Housing Finance Corporation refunding of bonds which financed a section 8 assisted project, Laurel
Woods Apartments, FHA No. 073-35444, South Bend, Indiana.


Nature of Requirement: 

The Regulations set conditions under which HUD may grant a section 11(b) letter of exemption of multifamily housing
revenue bonds from Federal income taxation and authorize call of debentures prior to maturity.


Granted By: 

Nicolas P. Retsinas, Assistant Secretary for Housing-FHA Commissioner.


Date Granted: 

September 29, 1993.


Reasons Waived: 

The part 811 regulations cited above were intended for original bond financing transactions and do not fit the terms
of refunding transactions. To credit enhance refundings bonds not fully secured by the FHA mortgage amount, HUD also
agrees not to exercise its option under 24 CFR 207.259(e) to call debentures prior to maturity. This refunding proposal
was approved by HUD on September 2, 1993. Refunding bonds have been priced to an average yield of 6.10%. The tax-exempt
refunding bond issue of $2,775,000 at current low-interest rates will save Section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also gains
long-term tax revenue benefits through replacement of outstanding tax-exempt bonds at an 11.75% interest rate at
the call date in 1993 with tax-exempt bonds yielding 6.10%. The refunding will also substantially reduce the FHA mortgage
interest rate at expiration of the HAP contract, from 11.75% to 7.0%, thus reducing FHA mortgage insurance risk. The
refunding serves the important public purposes of reducing HUD's Section 8 program costs, improving Treasury tax
revenues, (helping reduce the budget deficit), and increasing the likelihood that projects will continue to provide
housing for lower-income families after subsidies expire, a priority HUD objective.

outstanding tax-exempt coupons of 11% at the call date in 1993 with tax-exempt bonds yielding 6.07%. The refunding
will also substantially reduce the FHA mortgage interest rates at expiration of the HAP contract, from 11.5% to approximately
the bond rate, thus reducing FHA mortgage insurance risk. The refunding serves the important public purposes of reducing
HUD's section 8 program costs, improving Treasury tax revenues (helping reduce the budget deficit), and increasing
the likelihood that projects will continue to provide housing for lower-income families after subsidies expire,
a priority HUD objective.

 Washoe, Nevada HFC refunding of bonds which financed a section 8 assisted project, Washoe Mills Apartments (FHA No.
125-35088).


Nature of Requirement:

 The Regulations set conditions under which HUD may grant a section 11(b) letter of exemption of multifamily housing
revenue bonds from Federal income taxation and authorize call of debentures prior to maturity.


Granted By:

 James E. Schoenberger, Associate General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing.


Date Granted:

 April 29, 1993.


Reasons Waived:

 The part 811 regulations cited above were intended for original bond financing transactions and do not fit the terms
of refunding transactions. To credit enhance refundings bonds not fully secured by the FHA mortgage amount, HUD also
agrees not to exercise its option under 24 CFR 207.259(e) to call debentures prior to maturity. This refunding proposal
was approved by HUD on March 25, 1993. Refunding bonds have been priced to an average yield of 6.09%. The tax-exempt
refunding bond issue of $3,440,000 at current low-interest rates will save Section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also gains
long-term tax revenue benefits through replacement of outstanding tax-exempt coupons of 10.2% at the call date in
1993 with tax-exempt bonds yielding 6.8%. The refunding will also substantially reduce the FHA mortgage interest
rate at expiration of the HAP contract, from 10% to 6.8%, thus reducing FHA mortgage insurance risk. The refunding
serves the important public purposes of reducing HUD's Section 8 program costs, improving Treasury tax revenues,
(helping reduce the budget deficit), and increasing the likelihood that projects will continue to provide housing
for lower-income families after subsidies expire, a priority HUD objective.

Project/Activity: 

Russellville, Alabama HA refunding of bonds which financed a section 8 assisted project, Village Square Apartments.


Nature of Requirement: 

The Regulations set conditions under which HUD may grant a section 11(b) letter of exemption of multifamily housing
revenue bonds from Federal income taxation.


Granted by: 

Nicolas P. Retsinas, Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner.


Date Granted: 

June 30, 1993.


Reasons Waived: 

The part 811 regulations cited above were intended for original bond financing transactions and do not fit the terms
of refunding transactions. This refunding proposal was approved by HUD on June 2, 1993. Refunding bonds have been
priced to an average yield of 6.10%. The tax-exempt refunding bond issue of $1,500,000 at current low-interest rates
will save section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also gains long-term tax revenue benefits through replacement of outstanding
tax-exempt coupons of 11.5% at the call date in 1993 with tax-exempt bonds yielding 6.10%. The refunding will also
substantially reduce the FHA mortgage interest rate at expiration of the HAP contract, from 12% to 5.55%, thus reducing
FHA mortgage insurance risk. The refunding serves the important public purposes of reducing HUD's section 8 program
costs, improving Treasury tax revenues, (helping reduce the budget, deficit), and increasing the likelihood that
projects will continue to provide housing for lower-income families after subsidies expire, a priority HUD objective.

date in 1993 with tax-exempt bonds yielding 5.90%. The refunding will also substantially reduce the FHA mortgage
interest rates at expiration of the HAP contract, from 12.00% to 6.80%, thus reducing FHA mortgage insurance risk.
Several liens placed on the project will be substantially forgiven and through the HUD required TPA this will become
a stand-alone project to which no other liens can be attached. The refunding serves the important public purposes

Regulation: 

24 CFR 882.103(b) and 887.201(b)(3). 



Project/Activity: 

Deny Owner Participation in the section 8 Rental Assistance Programs if the Owner's Property Taxes are Delinquent,
Detroit Housing Department (DHD). 



Nature of Requirement: 

24 CFR 882.103(b) and 887.201(b)(3) prohibit a public housing agency (HA) from directly or indirectly reducing,
either in the provision of assistance to any family in finding a unit or by any other action, any family's opportunity
to choose among the available units in the housing market. 



Granted By: 

Michael B. Janis, General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. 



Date Granted: 

April 21, 1993. 



Reason Waived: 

The Department is aware of an HA's need to weigh the unsuitability of certain landlords against the family's ability
to take advantage of a wide range of housing choices. The supporting documentation submitted by DHD reported that
from October 1990 through May 1992, there were only two cases where units selected by families had owners with unpaid
property taxes, and that in both cases the owners agreed to make payment arrangements and the units were processed
for the program. The waiver was determined to be in the public interest of the city of Detroit, and does not appear to
result in any significant reduction to the housing choices available to families.

 August 20, 1993.


Reason Waived:

 To allow additional subsidy for units approved for non-dwelling use to promote economic self-sufficiency services
and anti-drug programs pending publication of a final rule implementing this change to the regulation.



91. 

Regulation:

 24 CFR 990.104.


Project/Activity:

 Savannah Housing Authority, GA. In determining the operating subsidy eligibility, a request was made for funding
for five units approved for non-dwelling use to promote an anti-drug program.


Nature of Requirement:

 The operating subsidy calculation excludes funding for units removed from the dwelling rental inventory.


Granted By:

 Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary.


Date Granted:

 September 8, 1993.


Reason Waived:

 To allow additional subsidy for units approved for non-dwelling use to promote economic self-sufficiency services
and anti-drug programs pending publication of a final rule implementing this change to the regulation.



92. 

Regulation:

 24 CFR 990.104.


Project/Activity:

 Tennessee Valley Regional Housing Authority, MS. In determining the operating subsidy eligibility, a request was
made for funding for ten units approved for non-dwelling use to promote an economic self-sufficiency program (youth
sports, training, adult education, etc.).


Nature of Requirement:

 The operating subsidy calculation excludes funding for units removed from the dwelling rental inventory.


Granted By:

 Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary.


Date Granted:

 September 9, 1993.


Reason Waived:

 To allow additional subsidy for units approved for non-dwelling use to promote economic self-sufficiency services
and anti-drug programs pending publication of a final rule implementing this change to the regulation.



93. 

Regulation:

 24 CFR 990.104.


Project/Activity:

 Phenix City Housing Authority, AL. In determining the operating subsidy eligibility, a request was made for funding
for one unit approved for non-dwelling use to promote an economic self-sufficiency and anti-drug program.


Nature of Requirement:

 The operating subsidy calculation excludes funding for units removed from the dwelling rental inventory.


Granted By:

 Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary.


Date Granted:

 September 9, 1993.


Reason Waived:

 To allow additional subsidy for units approved for non-dwelling use to promote economic self-sufficiency services
and anti-drug programs pending publication of a final rule implementing this change to the regulation.



94. 

Regulation:

 24 CFR 990.110(c)


Project/Activity:

 Chicago Housing Authority, IL. In determining the operating subsidy eligibility a request was made to permit the
Housing Agency (HA) to retain 50% of savings realized through the wellhead purchase of natural gas for the period October
1, 1990, through December 31, 1991.


Nature of Requirement:

 Section 114(c) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 extends, from one year to six years, the period
during which a HA can retain a portion of the savings resulting from the HA's action to secure a reduction in utility
rates.


Granted By:

 Michael B. Janis, General Deputy Assistant Secretary.


Date Granted:

 February 4, 1993.


Reason Waived:

 This waiver was granted in order to comply with Congressional intent pending publication of a final rule implementing
this change. Based on the provisions of the Act, the authorization was granted to permit the HA to retain 50% of annual
savings realized from the wellhead purchase of natural gas for the full time allowed by the Act.

95. 

Regulation: 

24 CFR 990.109(b)(3)(iv).


Project/Activity: 

In determining the operating subsidy eligibility for the Gilbert, MN Housing and Redevelopment Authority, a request
was made for an extension of a previous waiver to permit the Housing Agency (HA) to use its actual occupancy rate of 88%
as its projected occupancy percentage.


Nature of Requirement: 

The regulation requires a Low Occupancy HA without an approved Comprehensive Occupancy Plan (COP) to use a projected
occupancy percentage of 97%.


Granted By: 

Michael B. Janis, General Deputy Assistant Secretary.


Date Granted: 

April 19, 1993.


Reasons Waived: 

The HA is a small agency with 49 units of elderly housing. It has been hampered in its efforts to reduce vacancies by local
economic dislocations and loss of population. HA was allowed to use a goal of 82% for its fiscal year ending in 1992.
Since the time of the last waiver, the HA has made progress in reducing its vacancies from nine to six units. Further
reductions may be expected if the HA's application for CIAP funds are approved and some of the vacant units are reconfigured
into larger units and/or converted into nondwelling use. Because of the progress made, the HA was permitted to use
88% as its projected occupancy percentage for its fiscal year ending 6/30/93.



96. 

Regulation: 

24 CFR 990.109(b)(3)(iv).


Project/Activity: 

In determining the operating subsidy eligibility for the Atlanta Housing Authority, TX, a request was made to use
94% as the projected occupancy percentage instead of 97%.


Nature of Requirement: 

The regulation requires a Housing Agency (HA) which does not reach an occupancy percentage of 97% at the end of its Comprehensive
Occupancy Plan (COP) to use a projected occupancy percentage of 97%.


Granted By: 

Michael B. Janis, General Deputy Assistant Secretary.


Date Granted: 

April 28, 1993.


Reasons Waived: 

The goal of the COP was to achieve a vacancy level of five or fewer vacant units, which for this 80 unit HA corresponded
to a 94% level. The HA and Ft. Worth Office did not realize until recently that the Department had recognized that the
use of 97% in this type of situation created an inequity. Failure to achieve an acceptable goal of 94% should not result
in the imposition of an even higher occupancy level of 97% on the HA. A waiver was granted to allow the use of 94% as the
projected occupancy percentage in order to correct this inequitable situation.



97. 

Regulation: 

24 CFR 990.109(b)(3)(iv).


Project/Activity: 

A request was made by the Newark, NJ Housing Authority to have the Department approve a 12-year Comprehensive Occupancy
Plan (COP).


Nature of Requirement: 

Current regulations require a Low Occupancy PHA to submit a COP when first eligible in order to use an occupancy percentage
of less than 97% in the determination of operating subsidy eligibility. A Low Occupancy PHA without an approved COP
must use a projected occupancy percentage of 97%.


Granted By: 

Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary.


Date Granted: 

July 22, 1993.


Reasons Waived: 

The Newark Housing Authority (NHA) did not submit an approvable COP when it was first eligible to do so for its fiscal
year beginning 4/1/87. Instead, with the Department's approval, NHA has used a series of Memorandums of Agreement
(MOAs) that included an occupancy goal to be used in determining its operating subsidy eligibility. In March 1993,
the NHA requested approval of a 12-year COP.
Based on experience gained from Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) implementing the vacancy rule, the Department found
that large PHAs designated as ``troubled authorities'', such as NHA, had vacancy problems of such a magnitude and
complexity that long-term planning was very difficult. Plans that were approved for such PHAs quickly became obsolete
and much time and effort were spent justifying changes to occupancy goals.
Since the Department continues to believe that it is very difficult for large troubled PHAs to adhere to a long term
plan with fixed occupancy goals, the request for a waiver that would result in the approval of a 12-year COP was not approved.
Instead, good cause was found to waive the subject regulation and allow the NHA to use an occupancy goal of 72% for its
1993 fiscal year and 78% for its 1994 fiscal year. Conditions were also placed on how the additional operating subsidy
generated as a result of the waiver could be used.

98. 

Regulation: 

24 CFR 990.109(b)(3)(iv).



Project/Activity: 

A request was made by the Clarkson, NE Housing Authority to use its actual occupancy rate of 60% in determining its operating
subsidy eligibility for its fiscal year ending (FYE) 3/31/93 and to use a projected occupancy rate of 60% for its FYE
3/31/94. 




Nature of Requirement: 

A public housing agency (PHA) that has completed a Comprehensive Occupancy Plan (COP) without achieving a 97% occupancy
percentage or having an average of five or fewer vacant units must use a projected occupancy rate of 97%.



Granted By: 

Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary. 



Date Granted: 

August 5, 1993. 



Reason Waived: 

The Clarkson Housing Authority is a small PHA of 30 units, primarily elderly. There has been a significant decline
in the town's population according to census data, as well as loss of businesses and medical staff during the past two
years. Because the documented lack of demand was basically beyond the control of the Authority, the PHA was allowed
to use 60% for both the requested years. 






99. 

Regulation: 

24 CFR 990.109(b)(3)(iv).



Project/Activity: 

A request was made by the Jetmore, KS Housing Authority to have a three-year Comprehensive Occupancy Plan (COP) approved
for its fiscal year (FYs) 1993-1995. The Authority had completed a COP in its 1992 FY without achieving the goal
of having five or fewer vacant units. 




Nature of Requirement: 

A public housing agency (PHA) that has completed a Comprehensive Occupancy Plan (COP) without achieving a 97% occupancy
percentage or having an average of five or fewer vacant units must use a projected occupancy rate of 97%.



Granted By: 

Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary. 



Date Granted: 

August 5, 1993. 



Reason Waived: 

The Jetmore Housing Authority is a small PHA of 20 units, primarily elderly. The Authority had undertaken several
steps to increase demand for its units but met with only limited success. Because the documented lack of demand was
basically beyond the control of the Authority, the PHA was allowed to use 75% for both its 1993 and 1994 FYs. The request
for a new COP was not approved. 





100. 

Regulation: 

24 CFR 990.109(b)(3)(iv).



Project/Activity: 

A request was made by the Red Cloud, NE Housing Authority to use its actual occupancy rate of 69% in determining its operating
subsidy eligibility for its fiscal year ending (FYE) 6/30/93 and to use a projected occupancy rate of 69% for its FYE
3/31/94. 




Nature of Requirement: 

A public housing agency (PHA) that has completed a Comprehensive Occupancy Plan (COP) without achieving a 97% occupancy
percentage or having an average of five or fewer vacant units must use a projected occupancy rate of 97%.



Granted By: 

Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary. 



Date Granted: 

August 5, 1993. 



Reason Waived: 

The Red Cloud Housing Authority is a small PHA of 55 units, primarily elderly. In spite of outreach activities to inform
the community about the availability of housing assistance and the granting of a waiver to admit income-eligible,
non-elderly, the waiting list is non-existent. Because the documented lack of demand was basically beyond the control
of the Authority, the PHA was allowed to use 69% for both the requested years. 





101. 

Regulation: 

24 CFR 990.109(b)(3)(iv).




Project/Activity: 

A request was made by the Olney, TX Housing Authority to use its actual occupancy rate of 68% in determining its operating
subsidy eligibility for its fiscal year ending 
9/30/94.




Nature of Requirement: 

A public housing agency (PHA) that has completed a Comprehensive Occupancy Plan (COP) without achieving a 97% occupancy
percentage or having an average of five or fewer vacant units must use a projected occupancy rate of 97%.



Granted By: 

Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary. 



Date Granted: 

August 5, 1993. 



Reason Waived: 

The Olney Housing Authority is a relatively small PHA of 190 units. It is located in a rural town with a declining population
and poor economy. Extensive efforts to increase occupancy through modernization of the units and outreach activities
during the past several years have not met with success. Because the documented lack of demand was basically beyond
the control of the Authority, the PHA was allowed to use 68%.

102. 

Regulation: 

24 CFR 990.109(b) (3) (iv).



Project/Activity: 

A request was made by the Chicago, IL Housing Authority to use an occupancy rate of 85% in determining its operating
subsidy eligibility for both its fiscal year ending (FYE) 12/31/93 and its FYE 12/31/94.



Nature of Requirement: 

A Low Occupancy Public Housing Agency (PHA) without an approved Comprehensive Occupancy Plan (COP) must use a projected
occupancy rate of 97%.



Granted By: 

Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary.



Date Granted: 

September 13, 1993.



Reason Waived: 

The Chicago Housing Authority argued that the magnitude of its safety and security needs is so great, it requires the
Authority to redirect resources from other priority initiatives such as vacancy reduction to fund safety and security
measures. This redirection of resources was expected to continue for at least the two year period of the waiver request.

A five-year Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) has been executed earlier between the Regional Office and the Authority
which contained performance targets in the area of vacancy reduction. In order not to jeopardize the agreements that
had been reached, a waiver was granted for the Authority's 1993 fiscal year (FY). Conditions were also placed on how
the additional operating subsidy generated as a result of the waiver could be used. These included having at least
60% of the additional funds be used specific, identifiable actions to increase occupancy which would leave 40% of
the additional funds available for security measures. A waiver for the Authority's FY 1994 will not be considered
until a review of actual accomplishments in FY 1993 can be made and compared with the actual goals.





103. 

Regulation: 

24 CFR 990.118(h).



Project/Activity: 

A request was made by the Albany, NY Housing Authority to use an occupancy rate of 95% instead of the 97% goal of its Comprehensive
Occupancy Plan (COP) in determining its operating subsidy eligibility for its fiscal year ending (FYE) 6/30/94.



Nature of Requirement: 

A Public Housing Agency (PHA) with an approved COP must use the projected occupancy rates of the COP.



Granted By: 

Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary.



Date Granted: 

September 14, 1993.



Reason Waived: 

The Albany Housing Authority presented material to show that modernization activity at one development was taking
longer than projected in the COP but that the work was considered to be on-schedule by the Buffalo Office. Additional
units at another development were also being considered for possible deprogramming actions that had not been contemplated
in the COP.

The Department agreed with the Authority that there were unanticipated vacancies because of the on-schedule modernization
work and found good cause to adjust the COP occupancy goal to 96%. The request to make an adjustment for additional vacant
units prior to the completion of a feasibility study on deprogramming was not approved.

104. 

Regulation: 

24 CFR parts 12 and 111.



Project/Activity: 

Accountability in Provision of HUD's Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP).



Granted by: 

Henry G. Cisneros, Secretary.



Date Granted: 

June 2, 1993.



Reason Waived: 

A NOFA was not used to announce the availability of funds under FHAP. A waiver was needed on this case because FHAP is
incorrectly listed in section 12.10 as a competitive program, and thus subject to the requirement that a notice of
funding availability must be published in the 

Federal Register

 when funds are available under the program. The Secretary also waived 24 CFR part 111 which requires a NOFA to be published.

105. 

Regulation: 

24 CFR 91.70(a) and 91.82(b).



Project/Activity: 

City of Woonsocket, Rhode Island and City of New Bedford, Massachusetts. Waiver of the submission deadlines of the
FY 1993 Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) and the FY 1992 CHAS Annual Performance Report. City
of East Providence, Rhode Island. Waiver of the FY 1992 CHAS Annual Performance Report deadline.



Nature of Requirement: 

Subpart G. Section 91.70(a) of the CHAS final rule provides that a housing strategy must be submitted annually between
October 1 and December 31, with December 31 being the deadline for submission. Subpart H, Section 91.82(b) of the CHAS
final rule requires that Performance Reports for the fiscal year just ended be submitted to HUD no later than December
31.



Granted By: 

Don I. Patch, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Grant Programs, CG.



Date Granted: 

March 4, 1993.



Reasons Waived: 

Waivers were granted for good cause. Each city requested an extension to the date of submission for their CHAS Annual
Plan and/or Performance Report. Otherwise, they would lose FY 1993 funding for all programs that require an approved
housing strategy as a condition for funding. Undue hardship would result if HUD applied authorized sanctions and
suspended funding of existing programs in these communities. Such action would deprive low and moderate income persons
of the benefits of HUD-funded programs. Woonsocket was granted an 8 day extention for the CHAS and the Performance
Report since the Mayor was unavailable to sign the documents by the deadline. New Bedford was granted an 8 day extension
for the CHAS and a 67 day extension for the Performance Report. East Providence was granted a 64 day extension for the
Performance Report submission. Both cities report the need for the waivers was due to their oversights or incomplete
understanding of the HUD requirements.




106. 

Regulation: 

24 CFR 92.150(a).



Project/Activity: 

City of West Palm Beach, Florida. Waiver of the deadline for submission of a HOME Program Description for FY 1993.



Nature of Requirement: 

Subpart D,  92.150(a) of the HOME Interim Rule requires that each participating jurisdiction submit its Program
Description for a fiscal year to HUD within 45 days of HUD's publication of the HOME formula allocations. For fiscal
year 1993, the due date for Program Descriptions was March 15, 1993.



Granted By: 

Don I. Patch, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Grant Program.



Date Granted: 

March 15, 1993.



Reasons Waived: 

The City was unable to get the application and program description approved by the City Commission prior to the deadline.
The City was advised that, in future years, it should anticipate the deadline and be sure the HOME Program Description
approval is included on the Commission's agenda in a timely manner.

Regulation: 

24 CFR 92.254 (a)(1) and (b)(1).




Project/Activity: 

Alhambra, CA.; 
Costa Mesa, CA.; 
Orange County, CA.; 
San Diego County, CA.; 
Oxnard, CA.; 
Santa Clara County, CA.; 
and San Mateo County Consortium, CA. Waiver of the section 203(b) dollar limits for purchase and rehabilitation of
houses under the HOME Investment Partnership Act program.



Nature of Requirement: 

24 CFR 92.254(a)(1) provides for the setting of area limits on the initial purchase price for single family housing
and 24 CFR 92.254(b)(1) provides for the setting of area limits on the value of property after rehabilitation, not
involving purchase.



Granted By: 

Don I. Patch, Acting Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, March 15, 1993; April 2, 1993 and
April 21, 1993. Mark C. Gordon, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Operations/Chief of Staff, May 26, 1993.




Date Granted: 

Alhambra, CA., March 15, 1993; Costa Mesa, CA., March 15, 1993; 
Orange County, CA., March 15, 1993; 
San Diego County, CA., March 15, 1993; 
Oxnard, CA., April 2; 
Santa Clara County, CA., April 21; 
and San Mateo County Consortium, CA., May 26, 1993.





Reasons Waived: 

Department recognizes that in some high-cost areas, there may be few properties whose purchase price and/or after
rehabilitation value are below the section 203(b) caps. The local jurisdictions indicated that to have a viable homeownership
program, they need to have the limit increased. A HUD review confirmed the validity of the requests, analyzed the data
and, therefore, for good cause, granted waivers establishing the recommended limits as follows: Alhambra, CA.,
$204,000; Costa Mesa, CA., $213,000; Orange County, CA., $237,000; San Diego, CA., $181,000; 
Oxnard, CA., $163,000; Santa Clara County, CA., $266,000; San Mateo County Consortium, CA., $252,000.










108. 

Regulation: 

24 CFR 92.3.


Project/Activity: 

San Francisco, CA.; and Franklin County, OH. Waiver of the Single Room Occupancy (SRO) definition in the HOME Program
which requires food preparation or sanitary facilities in each unit when rehabilitating an existing residential
structure.




Nature of Requirement: 

24 CFR 92.3 as clarified in CPD Notice 92-31 requires either food preparation or sanitary facilities in each
HOME assisted SRO unit.





Granted By: 

Don I. Patch, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Grant Programs.




Date Granted: 

San Francisco, CA., April 12, 1993; Franklin County, Ohio, May 8, 1993.





Reasons Waived: 

The waivers were issued for good cause. The waiver approval to Franklin County noted that in response to many public
comments, the Department would issue an interim rule to modify the definition of SRO found at 24 CFR 92.2 to require
sanitary or food preparation facilities only if the project consists of new construction, conversion of non-residential
space, or reconstruction. For acquisition or rehabilitation of an existing residential structure, neither type
of amenity is required in the unit. However, the Department strongly encourages participating jurisdictions to
provide a higher level of amenities whenever possible, to contribute to the continued marketability of the standard
housing stock in the future. This change is made in response to public comment that installing plumbing when rehabilitating
an existing residential structure may be financially prohibitive. Nonetheless, the Department believes that for
new construction, reconstruction and conversion, a higher level of amenities is appropriate and desirable. The
new SRO definition was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 23, 1993.

109. 

Regulation: 

24 CFR 92.504(b).


Project/Activity: 

State of Alaska. Request for a waiver of the requirement that before a Participating Jurisdiction disburses HOME
funds to any entity it must enter into a detailed written agreement with the entity ensuring that HOME funds are used
in accordance with all program requirements. Alaska believes designation of its housing finance agency to administer
its HOME program should not require a detailed written agreement.


Nature of Requirement: 

The written agreement required by  92.504(b) and described in  92.504(c) contains detailed requirements
concerning the use of HOME funds.


Granted By: 

Don I. Patch, Acting Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development.


Date Granted: 

March 23, 1993.


Reasons Waived: 

Under many State laws, State housing finance agencies (HFAs), are not part of the State government. Under the HOME
statute, if a HFA is not a State agency it cannot be designated as the participating jurisdiction. In such cases where
the State wants the HFA to administer the HOME Program, an agency of the State must be the participating jurisdiction
and the HFA must be designated as a subrecipient.
The Department agrees that the written agreement between a State and an instrumentality of the State that is a subrecipient
need not contain the same detailed information as is required of other entities receiving HOME funds. Further, the
Department amended  92.504(b) by the publication in the 

Federal Register 

on June 23, 1993, of an interim rule which established much simpler requirements for State subrecipients.
Therefore there was good cause to grant the requested waiver of 24 CFR 92.504(b) and to allow the Alaska Housing Finance
Corporation to enter into a written agreement with the State of Alaska using the much simpler requirements for State
subrecipients.



110. 

Regulation: 

24 CFR 570.200(a)(5) and 24 CFR 570.200(h).


Project/Activity: 

County of Macomb, Michigan (City of Fraser) Request for an amendment to a waiver of preagreement costs approved June
26, 1992, for the City of Fraser, Michigan, a subrecipient of the Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG)
of the County of Macomb, Michigan.


Nature of Requirement: 

24 CFR 570.200(h) permits reimbursement of certain eligible costs incurred prior to the date of the grant agreement.
24 CFR 570.200(a)(5) limits pre-agreement costs to those described in subparagraph 570.200(h).


Granted By: 

David M. Cohen, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Grant Programs.


Date Granted: 

May 28, 1993.


Reasons Waived: 

A previous waiver of pre-agreement costs, which was approved June 26, 1992, permitted the City to proceed with the
construction of a senior center and reimburse the costs of constructing the facility with CDBG funds from 1992-1998.
Although the site preparation and foundation work had begun, unforeseen soil conditions had necessitated change
orders that would have resulted in an increase in the cost. The City needed to request an amendment to the period covered
by the waiver. Failure to approve this request may impose a greater hardship on the City since it has already incurred
contractual obligations for construction of the project and would cause undue hardship and adversely affect the
purposes of the Act. For good cause the limitations on pre-agreement costs at 24 CFR 570.200(a)(5) and 570.200(h)
were waived to permit the reimbursement of the costs of constructing this facility with CDBG funds from 1992 through
the year 2000.



111. 

Regulation: 

24 CFR 574.4.


Project/Activity: 

Seattle, Washington. The Seattle Department of Housing and Human Services requested an extension of the deadline
to allow ample time to prepare a proposal that adequately addresses the needs of persons with AIDS.


Nature of Requirement: 

24 CFR 574.4 establishes a deadline for the submission of applications for the entitlement component of the Housing
Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) Program.


Granted By: 

Don I. Patch, Acting Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development.


Date Granted: 

March 8, 1993.


Reason Waived: 

In order to provide time to adequately involve the community organizations serving persons with AIDs in the application,
a waiver of the March 15, 1993 deadline was granted, and the date for submission of the HOPWA application was extended
to April 30, 1993.

Regulation: 

24 CFR 291.400.



Project/Activity: 

Sabine Valley Center, Longview Texas; Mat-Su Mental Health Center, Wasilla, Alaska. Request for a waiver of the disposition
rules for HUD-acquired one- to four-family properties which restrict occupancy by a homeless leasee in transition
to a maximum of 24 months.



Nature of Requirements: 

The purpose of the program described in 24 CFR 291.400 is to assist individuals and families who are homeless by providing
them with transitional housing. Use of HUD-acquired properties by lessees must be with the understanding that the
housing provided under this program is transitional and the occupants are expected to seek and obtain permanent housing
resources within two years.



Granted By: 

Don I. Patch, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Grant Programs.

Gateway Western Railway Company_Construction_St. Clair County, IL, et al.; Construction Exemption



The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) hereby notifies all interested parties in this proceeding that SEA has
prepared and made available a Supplemental Environmental Assessment (Supplemental EA) for the proceedings referenced
above. 

The Gateway Western Railway Company (GWWR) and its subsidiary Gateway Eastern Railway Company (GWER) have petitioned
the Interstate Commerce Commission in separate pleadings for authority to construct and operate connecting tracks,
among other related actions, in East St. Louis, St. Clair County, Illinois. If the proposed segments are constructed,
(1) GWWR would have a direct and efficient route to the CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT) interchange at Cone Yard in
East St. Louis and (2) GWWR, in conjunction with GWER trackage rights, would have direct and efficient access to Consolidated
Rail Corporation's (Conrail) Rose Lake Yard in East St. Louis. The construction and operation of these two new connections
would eliminate GWWR's current circuitous routings to its CSXT and Conrail interchanges. 

The Supplemental EA will be available on April 5, 1994. There will be a 30-day comment period. Comments on the Supplemental
EA are due May 5, 1994. To obtain copies of the Supplemental EA contact Ms. Judith Groves or Ms. Phillis Johnson-Ball,
Interstate Commerce Commission, Section of Environmental Analysis, room 3219 Washington, DC 20423 at (202) 927-6245
or (202) 927-6213.

action: 

Notice of reopening and extension of period for applications.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This document reopens and extends the period for filing applications regarding the National Award for Diversity
and Excellence in American Executive Management. This action is taken to permit additional applications from interested
parties. Interested parties are requested to submit applications postmarked by April 30, 1994. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

In the 

Federal Register

 of November 30, 1993, (58 FR 63186-63187), the Department of Labor published the criteria and application process
for the National Award for Diversity and Excellence in American Management which was established pursuant to Public
Law 102-166, The Glass Ceiling Act of 1991. The glass ceiling is defined as those artificial barriers based on
attitudinal or organizational bias that prevent qualified minorities and women from advancing in their organizations
into management and decisionmaking positions. The award is a Presidential award to recognize a United States business
for excellence in promoting a more diverse skilled work force at the management and decisionmaking levels in business.


Because of continuing interest in this award, the Commission believes that it is desirable to reopen and extend the
application period for all interested parties. Therefore, the application period for the applications is reopened
and extended through April 30, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Owens-Illinois, Inc.; Huntington, WV; Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>



By an application dated March 15, 1994, Local 

#

212 of the Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics and Allied Workers International Union (GMP) requested administrative
reconsideration of the subject petition for trade adjustment assistance (TAA). The denial notice was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on March 4, 1994 (59 FR 10429).

Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances: 

(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;

(2) if it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or 

(3) if in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.

The investigation files show that the workers produced commercial glass containers for drug, chemical, liquor,
beer and wine producers. The plant closed on December 31, 1993.

The union stated that the machinery for producing glass containers is being shipped overseas.

The Department's denial is based on the fact that the ``contributed importantly'' test of the Group Eligibility Requirements
of the Trade Act was not met. This test is generally demonstrated through a survey of the workers' firm's customers.
The Department's survey of the firm's major declining customers showed that none of the respondents increased their
imports while decreasing their purchases from Owens-Illinois. 

Other findings show that most of the production was shipped to other domestic corporate plants. A domestic shift of
production would not form a basis for a worker group certification. 

Further, machinery used in the production of glass containers is not like or directly competitive with glass containers.
In order for a worker group to become certified it must meet all three of the Group Eligibility Requirements of the Trade
Act_(1) a significant decrease in employment (2) an absolute decrease in sales or production and (3) increased imports
of articles which are like or directly competitive with those produced at the petitioning workers' firm and which
``contributed importantly'' to declines in sales or production and employment. 



Conclusion



After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

<DOCTITLE>Olympic Plating Industries, Inc., Canton, OH; Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
</DOCTITLE>


By an application dated March 16, 1994, Local 

#

50063 of the United Paperworkers Union (UPU) requested administrative reconsideration of the subject petition
for trade adjustment assistance (TAA). The denial notice was signed on February 24, 1994, and published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 10, 1994 (59 FR 11326). 
Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances: 



(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;

(2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or 
(3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.



The union states that the workers should be certified since Olympic had reduced business from kitchen appliance manufacturing
customers who took their production overseas. 
Investigation findings show that Olympic Plating is an independent contractor which performs plating services
on components (stove tops, etc.) for kitchen appliance manufacturing customers. The findings show that Olympic
Plating did not own the components to be plated but only performed plating services on them. Olympic Plating was independent
of its customers and there was no corporate relationship between Olympic Plating and its customers. 
The Department's denial was based on the fact that the workers do not produce an article within the meaning of the Trade
Act, as amended. The Department has consistently determined that the performance of services does not constitute
the production of an article and this determination has been upheld in the U.S. Court of Appeals. Accordingly, the
plating services performed by Olympic Plating cannot be considered the production of an article. 
The worker adjustment assistance program was not intended to provide TAA to workers who are in some way related to import
competition but only for those workers who produce an article and are adversely affected by increased imports of like
or directly competitive articles which contributed importantly to sales or production and employment declines
at the workers' firm. 


Conclusion


After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Confirmatory Order Rescinding Confirmatory Order Dated July 17, 1984


In the Matter of: Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, Michigan.


I


Henry Ford Hospital (Licensee) is the holder of NRC License No. 21-04109-08 issued by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR part 35. The license authorizes the Licensee to possess and use cobalt-60
for medical use as described in 10 CFR 35.600 in an AECL Theratron 780 teletherapy unit, and for irradiation of animals.
The license was issued on August 2, 1957, was most recently amended in its entirety on February 14, 1994, and is due to
expire on November 30, 1988.


II


As a result of a teletherapy misadministration which occurred in early 1984, the NRC issued a Confirmatory Order dated
July 17, 1984, which ordered the Licensee to implement a Teletherapy Treatment Quality Assurance Program as described
in Section II of the Order (EA 84-067). In accordance with 10 CFR 35.32(f)(2) the Licensee submitted a written
quality management program to the NRC on January 23, 1992. In a letter dated April 8, 1993, the Licensee requested the
NRC to rescind the 1984 Order for the following reasons: (1) All subsequent NRC inspections have found the Licensee
to be in compliance with the 1984 Order; (2) No therapeutic misadministrations have occurred at Henry Ford Hospital
since the 1984 Order was issued; and (3) Regulatory changes in 10 CFR part 35 pertaining to the Quality Management Program
encompass all aspects of the 1984 Order.


III


In December 1993 the NRC's Division of Industrial and Medical Nuclear Safety completed a review of the licensee's
1992 Quality Management Program submittal. Subsequently, in a letter dated March 1, 1994, the NRC notified the Licensee
that its Quality Management Program, as set forth in its letter dated January 23, 1992, appears to meet the requirements
of 10 CFR 35.32. In addition, the NRC staff agrees with the Licensee that the actions required by the 1984 Order are superseded
by current regulatory requirements.
I find that the Licensee's Quality Management Program encompasses the requirements of the Teletherapy Treatment
Quality Assurance Program required by the 1984 Order. Therefore, the 1984 Order should be rescinded.


IV


Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and
the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR part 35, it is hereby ordered that the confirmatory order issued
to the licensee on July 17, 1984 (EA 84-067) is rescinded.

Intermarket Trading System; Order Approving Eleventh Amendment to the ITS Relating To Use of a Back-Up System



March 30, 1994.



On December 21, 1993, the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission'') an amendment to the restated ITS Plan pursuant to Section 11A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78k-1, and Rule 11a3a-2 thereunder.
 The ITS participants filed the proposal to make several technical amendments to the ITS Plan including amendments
relating to the use of a back-up system. Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on February 1, 1994.
 The Commission received no comments on the proposal. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving
the proposal. 






The proposal makes several technical amendments to the ITS Plan to: (1) Provide for use of a back-up system in the event
ITS becomes inoperable; (2) recognize the use of the Regional Computer Interface (``RCI'') by the Amex; (3) eliminate
references to line costs and line sharing; (4) require a biennial rather than an annual audit by an independent public
accountant; (5) change all references to the Midwest Stock Exchange, Inc. (``MSE'') to CHX; and (6) correct the addresses
of the CHX, CSE, and PSE. 

The proposal adds Section 15 to the ITS Plan to provide for the use of a back-up system. In the event the ITS system becomes
inoperable, ITS would utilize a designated NYSE operating system (``NYSE System'') on a preemptive and priority
basis. The NYSE System is comprised of computers and peripheral equipment sufficient to operate ITS at a minimum 50%
of the ITS's rated 17 messages per second capacity and 75% of the ITS's disk capacity. The NYSE System would assume the
functions of the ITS within two hours in the event of a limited disaster and on the next day in the event of a full site disaster.


The proposal amends the ITS Plan to provide for the use of the RCI by the Amex through the Amex Display Book Manager (``DBM'').
The Amex DBM is a computerized system that when fully implemented will, to some extent, replace the original ITS stations
on the Amex trading floor. The proposal will permit communications, through the Amex DBM, between the ITS and the Amex
floor.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940405-2-00151 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940405-2-00064 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposal eliminates references in the ITS Plan to line costs and line sharing. Because of technological advances,
references to line costs and line sharing are no longer applicable. The ITS Plan will continue to delineate development
and production costs.
The proposal amends the ITS Plan's audit provision to require a biennial rather than an annual audit of expenses, allocations,
and computations, by an independent public accountant. The proposal requires an internal audit to review all expenses,
allocations, and computations by ITS for those years when an independent audit is not conducted.
The proposal provides other technical amendments to the ITS Plan. The proposal changes all references to the MSE to
CHX; and would correct the addresses of the CHX, CSE, and PSE.
The Commission finds that approval of the amendment is consistent with the Act, in particular, with sections 11A(a)(1)
(C)(ii) and (D) which provide for fair competition among the ITS participants and their members, and the linking of
all markets for qualified securities through communications and data processing facilities which foster efficiency,
enhance competition, increase the information available to brokers, dealers, and investors, facilitate the offsetting
of investors' orders, and contribute to the best execution of such orders. The Commission also finds the amendment
consistent with Rule 11Aa3-2(c)(2) which requires the Commission to determine that the amendment is necessary
and appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets,
to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanisms of, a national market system or otherwise in furtherance of the
purpose of the Act.
The proposal provides for the use of a back-up facility in the event the ITS system becomes inoperable, and enhances
order routing and execution of communications between the Amex and the other ITS participants. This will improve
the efficiency and reliability of ITS, especially during periods of high trading volume.
 The proposal provides additional, technical amendments to the ITS Plan consistent with ITS's purpose: To facilitate
intermarket trading in exchange-listed equity securities.




For the foregoing reasons, the Commission finds that the ITS amendment is consistent with the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to the ITS and, in particular, Sections 11A(a)(1) (C)(ii) and (D) of the Act and
Rule 11Aa3-2(c)(2).


It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to Section 11A(a)(3)(B) of the Act, that the amendment be, and hereby is, approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(29).

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Delta Government Options Corp.; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change Relating
to the Time for Exercises of Options and for the Assignments of Exercise Notices</DOCTITLE>


March 25, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on December 27, 1993, Delta Government Options Corp. (``DGOC'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') and on February 14, 1994, amended the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared, in part, by DGOC. The Commission is publishing this notice
to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change will modify: (1) The time for the exercises of options by DGOC participants maintaining long
positions; (2) the procedure DGOC uses to assign exercise notices to participants maintaining short positions;
and (3) the time by which exercise notices will be assigned.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, DGOC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. DGOC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The proposal will amend Section 1001 (Exercise Procedures) of DGOC's 

Procedures

 to change the time by which a participant must tender to DGOC's clearing bank an option exercise notice. The cutoff
time will be changed from 5:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. or such earlier time as may be announced by the Public Securities Association
as the recommended closing time for trading in the government securities markets on the business day the participant
wishes to exercise an option contract.

The proposal also will amend DGOC's 

Procedures

 Section 1002 (Assignment of Exercise Notices) which describes the manner in which exercise notices are assigned
to participants. Currently when less than all exercisable options in a class of options (

i.e.

, all puts and calls covering the same issue of Treasury Securities) are exercised, exercise notices are assigned
randomly to participants that maintain short positions in that class of options. Under the proposal, exercise notices
will be assigned to each participant maintaining a short position in the same class of options on a pro rata basis. The
pro rata allocation will be determined by a formula whereby the total number of exercise notices received for a class
of options will be multiplied by the ratio of the number of exercisable options in that class subject to exercise that
a participant maintains to all exercisable options in the class.

Finally, the proposal will change the time by which exercise notices will be assigned under DGOC's 

Procedures 

Section 1002. Currently, exercise notices are assigned at or before 8 a.m. on the business day following acceptance
of an exercise notice by DGOC's clearing bank. Under the proposal, assignments will take place at or before 5 p.m on
the same business day that the clearing bank accepts an exercise notice.

The proposal will permit participants with short positions to receive more timely notice of their assignments of
exercises and will allow them to manage more precisely their financial exposure following assignments by permitting
them to engage in other trading on that business day. The proposal also will provide a method whereby DGOC will allocate
exercise notices in a fairer manner. The new cutoff time for submission of exercise notices, the pro rata assignment
of exercise notices, and the earlier notice of assignments are consistent with the policies and practices of the over-the-counter
market.

DGOC states in its filing that upon publication of this notice DGOC will inquire of all its participants that maintain
long positions with DGOC whether they perceive any special burden associated with the one hour reduction in the time
available for exercise. DGOC states that if any participant should wish to maintain the 5 p.m. exercise notice tendering
time on any outstanding option, DGOC will defer implementation of the proposed rule change until one day following
the expiration of all such outstanding options subject to the 5 p.m. time. DGOC further states in the filing that once
the formal inquiry of participants has been completed, participants should expect to receive notice from DGOC that
all options issued by DGOC and expiring after a certain date will be subject to the changes made in this proposal. From
its informal polling of participants, DGOC estimates that implementation of the 4 p.m. cutoff time shall occur during
the first quarter of 1994.

DGOC believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and particularly with section 17A of the Act
in that it will facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.






B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



DGOC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



No written comments were received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within thirty-five days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to ninety days of such date if it finds such longer
period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization
consents, the Commission will:

The purpose of the proposed rule change is to continue to waive through June 30, 1994, (1) trade recording fees for trades

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating
to an Interpretation With Respect to Rule 409 (``Statements of Accounts to Customers'')</DOCTITLE>


March 28, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on February 22, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II
and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On March 2, 1994, the NYSE submitted
to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposal.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The proposed rule change consists of an interpretation with respect to the meaning and administration of existing
Exchange Rule 409 (``Statements of Accounts to Customers'').


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item
IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B) and (C) below,
of the most significant aspect of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


The purpose of the proposed rule change is to set forth an interpretation concerning the meaning and administration
of Exchange Rule 409 with respect to the establishment of standards for Exchange members and member organizations
holding foreign customer accounts. It is intended that this interpretation will be published as an Interpretation
Memorandum for inclusion in the Exchange Interpretation Handbook.
Exchange Rule 409 addresses the requirement of member organizations to send statements of accounts and confirmations
to customers. One of the purposes of Rule 409 is to ensure that member organization's communications to customers
are sent to appropriate and/or authorized persons.
Rule 409(b)(2) provides that customer mail (i.e. 

statements, confirmations and other communications) may not be addressed to any member, member organization or
in care of an employee of any member organization. This, in effect, prohibits the receipt and retention by a member,
member organization, registered representative or other associated person, of customer mail. The rule, however,
does permit the Exchange to waive the rule's requirements, upon written request. The Exchange has received requests
from member organizations to permit them to hold mail for certain foreign customers who have represented in writing
that they do not wish to receive such correspondence. Reasons for such requests have included inefficient local mail
services (resulting in misrouted mail or opened mail) or unstable political climates. In order to review and approve
such requests, the Exchange has established guidelines. The Exchange is proposing this written interpretation
to codify the procedures and standards for reviewing requests from member organizations to hold foreign customer
mail.
The proposed interpretation provides that the Exchange will consider written requests from members and member organizations
for the implementation of procedures for temporarily holding foreign customer mail. Such requests will be required
to provide certain details and representations concerning supervisory procedures that the member or member organization
will have in place with respect to holding mail. Specifically, members and member organizations will be required
to obtain, at least on an annual basis, a written request from the customer to have mail temporarily held at the premises
of the firm and providing appropriate reasons for such request. Additionally, the organization's written procedures
must address, at a minimum that: such accounts will receive frequent supervisory review with special attention given
to discretionary accounts; the communications will be reviewed annually by the compliance/internal audit department
or by person(s) delegated such responsibility pursuant to Exchange Rule 342 (independent of the branch), and such
review will include a test that the communications are held pursuant to written customer instructions; a log of the
communications will be maintained which shows the date of transmittal of the communications to the customer; and
that endeavors will be made to orally communicate the substance of the communications directly to the customer and
that a written record is kept of all meetings and conversations with the customer.
The Exchange believes that this proposed interpretation will give members and member organizations the flexibility
to hold mail upon customer request, while providing appropriate safeguards through enhanced supervisory procedures.


2. Statutory Basis


The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, which requires that the
rules of the Exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, and in general, to protect investors and the public interest, in that it establishes standards
that enable members and member organizations to meet customer requests yet provide customer protection through
appropriate monitoring and supervision.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange believes that the proposal does not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



Comments were neither solicited nor received.

Federal Register

to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Public Reference
Branch of the SEC.


Applicants' Representations and Statements


1. Canada Life, a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of Michigan on April 12, 1988, is principally
engaged in the sale and reinsurance of annuity contracts. Canada Life is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Canada Life
Assurance Company, a Canadian life insurance company.

2. The Canada Life Account was established by Canada Life as a separate account under the laws of Michigan on July 22,
1988, pursuant to a resolution of Canada Life's board of directors. The Canada Life Account is currently registered
as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act (File No. 811-5817).
3. The Canada Life Account will invest in shares of the investment portfolios of the Canada Life of America Series Fund,
Inc., as well as portfolios of other specified registered open-end management investment companies (collectively,
the ``Funds''). The Funds are diversified, open-end management investment companies with a number of series, or
portfolios. The assets of each portfolio are separate from the other portfolios, and each portfolio has separate
investment objectives and policies. As a result, each portfolio operates as a separate investment fund, and the investment
performance of one portfolio has no effect on the investment performance of any other portfolio. The Canada Life Account
has a number of subaccounts, each of which invests solely in a specific corresponding portfolio of one of the Funds.
4. Canada Life of New York, a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of the State of New York on June
7, 1971, is principally engaged in the sale of annuity contracts and life insurance policies in the State of New York.
Canada Life of New York is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Canada Life Assurance Company.
5. The Canada Life of New York Account was established by Canada Life of New York as a separate account under the laws
of the State of New York on September 13, 1989, pursuant to a resolution of Canada Life of New York's board of directors.
The Canada Life of New York Account currently is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act (File No. 811-5961).
6. The Canada Life of New York Account will invest in shares of one or more of the investment portfolios of the Funds.
The Canada Life of New York Account has a number of subaccounts, each of which invests solely in a specific corresponding
portfolio of the Funds.
7. CLAFS is a wholly owned subsidiary of Canada Life, and acts as the distributor and principal underwriter of the Contracts.
CLAFS is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer, and is a member of the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc.
8. The Contracts are individual flexible premium variable deferred annuity contracts. The Contracts may be purchased
on a non-tax-qualified basis, or they may be purchased and used in connection with retirement plans or individual
retirement accounts that qualify for favorable federal income tax treatment. Generally, the Contracts may be purchased
with an initial purchase payment of at least $5,000. However, the initial purchase payment may be reduced to: $100
if the Contract owner has executed a preauthorized check agreement for additional purchase payments to be automatically
withdrawn monthly from the Contract owner's bank account (a ``PAC agreement''); or $2,000 if the Contract is to fund
an Individual Retirement Annuity (``IRA''). (The Companies reserve the right to lower or raise the minimum premium
for IRAs.) Generally, subsequent purchase payments must be at least $1,000. However, such purchase payments may
be reduced to: $100 or more if the purchase payment is made by preauthorized check pursuant to a PAC agreement; or $50
or more per month if an IRA Rider is in effect, and provided that no purchase payment, together with the total of other
purchase payments, would exceed $1,000,000 unless the applicable Company consents to a larger amount.
9. A Contract owner may allocate net purchase payments to one or more subaccounts of the applicable Account, each of
which will invest in a corresponding portfolio of the Funds. (Net purchase payments equal purchase payments less
any premium taxes deducted.) Purchase payments will be credited with the investment experience of the selected subaccount(s).
A Contract owner also may allocate net purchase payments to the applicable Company's general account.
10. Prior to the annuity date, a Contract owner may transfer Contract value among subaccounts of the applicable Account,
or surrender a Contract or withdraw a portion of the cash surrender value. The amount payable upon surrender, the cash
surrender value, is the Contract value less any applicable contingent deferred sales charge.
11. The Contracts provide for a series of annuity payments beginning on the annuity date. A Contract owner may select
from several annuity payment options, all of which are fixed options that provide for payments out of the applicable
Company's general account.

<TEXT>
 

12. If the annuitant dies prior to the annuity date, a death benefit is payable upon receipt of due proof of death as well
as proof that the annuitant died prior to the annuity date. Up to the fifth anniversary of the Contract, the death benefit
will be equal to the greater of: (1) Purchase payments paid, reduced by any partial surrenders (including applicable
surrender charges and any incurred taxes); or (2) the Contract value on the date the applicable Company receives due
proof of death. If a Company receives due proof of death after the fifth anniversary of the Contract, the death benefit
is the greatest of: (1) Purchase payments paid, reduced by any partial surrenders (including applicable surrender
charges and any incurred taxes); (2) the Contract value on the date the applicable Company receives due proof of death;
or (3) the Contract value at the end of the fifth Contract year preceding the date the applicable Company receives due
proof of death, plus purchase payments, less partial surrenders (including applicable surrender charges), and
less any incurred taxes.

13. The Companies deduct an administration charge of $30 per Contract year ($45 if a PAC agreement was in force at any
time during the Contract year) to compensate the applicable Company for the administrative services provided to
Contract owners. This charge will be deducted from the Contract value at the end of each Contract year prior to the annuity
date, and upon a full surrender on any date other than a Contract anniversary. Applicants represent that the administration
charge will be deducted in reliance on Rule 26a-1 and Rule 6c-8 under the 1940 Act, and represents reimbursement
only for the administration costs expected to be incurred over the life of the Contract. This charge is guaranteed
not to increase for the duration of the Contract, and the Companies neither expect nor intend to make a profit from this
charge.

14. The Companies will assess a daily administrative charge under the Contracts to compensate them for the administrative
expenses they will bear in connection with the Contracts and the Accounts. For incurring these administrative expenses
in connection with the Contracts and the Accounts, the Companies will deduct from their respective Contracts a daily
administrative charge at an annual rate of 0.15% of the value of net assets in each subaccount. This rate will be guaranteed
not to increase for the duration of the Contract.

15. A contingent deferred sales charge of 6% of the amount withdrawn is imposed on certain full surrenders or partial
surrenders of Contract Value to cover expenses relating to the sale of the Contracts, including commissions to registered
representatives and other promotional expenses.

16. Purchase payments paid at least five or more Contract years prior to the date of surrender or partial surrender
are not subject to the contingent deferred sales charge. The Companies will also waive the contingent deferred sales
charge for the first partial surrender in any Contract year if equal to or less than 10% of current premiums (premiums
paid within the previous four Contract years, less any prior partial surrenders or systematic withdrawals from current
premiums), and if the Contract owner has not elected the systematic withdrawal privilege for that Contract year.
The Companies will not deduct the contingent deferred sales charge from investment earnings.

17. The Companies will assess a daily charge to compensate them for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in
connection with the Contracts. This charge is equal to an effective annual rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets
in the applicable Account. Of that amount, approximately 0.55% is attributable to mortality risks, and approximately
0.70% is attributable to expense risks. The Companies guarantee that this charge will never increase.


18. The mortality risk borne by the Companies arises from: (1) Their contractual obligations to make annuity payments
(determined in accordance with the annuity tables and other provisions contained in the Contracts) regardless of
how long all annuitants or any individual annuitant may live; and (2) their possible obligation to pay a claim for a
death benefit in excess of a Contract owner's Contract value. The Companies also will assume an expense risk through
their guarantees not to increase the charges for issuing the Contracts and administering the Contracts and the Accounts,
regardless of their actual expenses, including maintaining policy records, communicating with Contract owners,
and processing transactions.

19. If the mortality and expense risk charges under a Contract are insufficient to cover actual costs and assumed risks,
the loss will fall on the applicable Company. Conversely, if the charges are more than sufficient to cover costs, any
excess will be profit to the Company. The Companies currently do not anticipate a profit from these charges.

20. The Companies may deduct any applicable premium tax from gross purchase payments. The Companies reserve the right,
however, to deduct any applicable aggregate premium taxes paid on behalf of a particular Contract from the Contract
value upon full or partial surrender or on the Annuity Date.

21. The Companies assess no charge for the first twelve transfers in each Contract Year, and will assess a $25 charge
for each subsequent transfer request made by the Contract owner during a single Contract Year. The Companies do not
count transfers made in connection with dollar cost averaging in determining whether to impose the $25 transfer charge.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Applicants request an exemption from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary
to permit the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts.

2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, as herein pertinent, prohibit a registered unit investment
trust and any depositor thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless
the proceeds of all payments (other than sales loads) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian and
held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding
such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services.

3. Applicants submit that the Companies are entitled to reasonable compensation for their assumption of mortality
and expense risks. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge of 1.25% assessed under the Contracts
is consistent with the protection of investors because they are reasonable and proper insurance charges. In this
regard, Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge is reasonable to compensate the Companies
for the risks that: (i) annuitants under the Contracts will live longer as a group than has been anticipated in setting
the annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts; (ii) the Contract value will be less than the death benefit; and (iii)
administrative expenses will be greater than amounts derived from the administrative charges.

4. The Companies represent that the charges for mortality and expense risks assumed by them are within the range of
industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. This representation is based upon the Companies'
analysis of publicly available information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors
as current charge levels, the existence of charge level guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates. The Companies
will maintain at their respective administrative offices, available to the Commission, memoranda setting forth
in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, their comparative surveys.

5. Applicants acknowledge that the surrender charges may be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution
of the Contracts. Applicants also acknowledge that if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charges,
all or a portion of such profit may be viewed by the Commission as being offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed
by the sales charge. The Companies have concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution
financing arrangements will benefit the Accounts and the Contract owners. The basis for such conclusions are set
forth in memoranda which will be maintained by the Companies at their respective administrative offices and will
be available to the Commission.

6. The Companies also represent that the Accounts will only invest in management investment companies which undertake,
in the event such an investment company adopts a plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance distribution expenses, to have a board
of directors (or trustees), a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company, formulate and approve any
such plan under Rule 12b-1.



Conclusion



Applicants assert that, for the reasons set forth above, the requested exemptions from sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2)
of the 1940 Act to permit the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts meet the standards
of Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants assert that the requested exemptions are necessary and appropriate in
the public interest, and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the 1940 Act.

Determination That Nonconforming 1971 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB 4 Passenger Cars Are Eligible for Importation


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of determination by NHTSA that nonconforming 1971 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB 4 passenger cars are eligible for
importation.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the determination by NHTSA that 1971 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB 4 passenger cars not originally
manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards are eligible for importation
into the United States because they are substantially similar to a vehicle originally manufactured for importation
into and sale in the United States and certified by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards (the U.S.-certified
version of the 1971 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB 4), and they are capable of being readily modified to conform to the standards.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
must be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.
Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

, of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the 

Federal Register.
J.K. Motors, Inc. of Kingsville, Maryland (Registered Importer No. R-90-006) petitioned NHTSA to determine
whether 1971 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB 4 passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States. NHTSA published
notice of the petition on January 27, 1994 (59 FR 3923) to afford an opportunity for public comment. The reader is referred
to that notice for a thorough description of the petition. No comments were received in response to the notice. Based
on its review of the information submitted by the petitioner, NHTSA has determined to grant the petition.


Vehicle Eligibility Number for Subject Vehicles


The importer of a vehicle admissible under any final determination must indicate on the form HS-7 accompanying
entry the appropriate vehicle eligibility number indicating that the vehicle is eligible for entry. VSP 

#

61 is the vehicle eligibility number assigned to vehicles admissible under this determination.


Final Determination


Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, NHTSA hereby determines that a 1971 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB 4 not originally
manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards is substantially similar to a
1971 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB 4 originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and certified
under section 114 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, and is capable of being readily modified to
conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.





Authority:

 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) and (C)(ii); 49 CFR 593.8; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501.8.

Funding Availability (NOFA) for Fiscal Year 1994 for the HOPE for Elderly Independence Multifamily Project Demonstration
in HUD Region I; and Project Guidelines; Notice

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT </USDEPT>




<USBUREAU>Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing</USBUREAU>





Funding Availability (NOFA) for Fiscal Year 1994 
for the HOPE for Elderly Independence Multifamily Project 
Demonstration in HUD Region I; and Project Guidelines 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 1994; and Notice of Project Guidelines for the HOPE for
Elderly Independence Multifamily Project Demonstration. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the availability of funding in the HUD Boston Region for section 8 project-based certificate
(PBC) assistance for one multifamily housing project and a supportive services grant under the HOPE for Elderly Independence
Multifamily Project Demonstration. The Multifamily Project Demonstration must be administered by a public housing
agency or Indian housing authority (HA), and located in a unit of general local government of under 50,000 population.
Selection of an HA to carry out this Demonstration is limited to eligible HAs in the HUD Boston Region which includes
the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. 



This notice presents the Multifamily Project Demonstration Guidelines and announces the availability of funding
of up to $6,172,250 in section 8 budget authority which will support project-based certificate assistance for an
estimated 75 to 150 units. In addition, up to $1,012,500 in supportive services grant funds will be made available
by HUD to the selected HA to provide program participants who are frail elderly persons with services appropriate
to their needs so they may continue to live independently and avoid premature or unnecessary institutionalization.
The selected HA must match the HUD supportive services funds with at least 50 percent of the total cost of the supportive
services estimated to be necessary by the HA and approved by HUD. 

The purpose of the Multifamily Project Demonstration is to determine the feasibility of using section 8 project-based
certificate assistance to assist frail elderly persons and near-frail elderly persons to live independently in
a single multifamily housing project specifically designed for occupancy by frail and near-frail elderly persons,
and to have frail elderly persons reside in this housing in sufficient proportion to achieve economies of scale in
the provision of supportive services. The Multifamily Project Demonstration is a five-year demonstration; however,
the initial term of the Housing Assistance Payments Contract is renewable for three additional five-year terms at
the option of the HA and subject to the availability of funds. 

The NOFA contains information concerning the deadline for filing applications; eligibility of applicants; available
amounts; selection criteria; and the application and selection process. 

Section 23 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 requires that any HA receiving additional section 8 rental voucher or certificate
program funding must administer a family self-sufficiency (FSS) program. For Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs),
participation in the FSS program is optional. The FSS program regulations were published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 27, 1993 
(56 FR 49592). Any rental voucher or certificate funding reserved in FY 1993 or subsequently, including funding made
available under this NOFA, will establish or increase the minimum size of an HA's FSS program. 

This NOFA is substantially similar to the NOFA published on September 28, 1993 (58 FR 50768), and withdrawn on November
30, 1993 (58 FR 63181). The principal differences between this NOFA published in today's 

Federal Register

 and the September 28, 1993 NOFA, are that this NOFA increases the availability of funding with amounts remaining from
the HOPE for Elderly Independence (Nationwide) Demonstration, and opens up occupancy in the multifamily demonstration
project to near-frail elderly persons, as this term is defined in this NOFA. Although eligible near-frail elderly
persons are permitted to reside in the multifamily project, supportive services grant funds are still restricted
to funding services for only the frail elderly. 

This NOFA provides for a two-tiered competition based on: (1) The proposal for supportive services and the proposal
to construct or rehabilitate the housing, and 

(2) The competitive selection criteria identified in the law. 
This NOFA also increases the fair market rents (FMRs) published April 24, 1991, by two percent per year to adjust for
inflation and corrects the FMRs previously published in Appendix 10 to reflect section 202 FMRs for housing designed
for elderly persons and persons with disabilities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 



The information collection requirements contained in this notice have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. OMB has approved the section 8 information collection
requirements under the assigned control number 2577-0123; OMB has approved the supportive services information
collection requirements under the assigned control number 2577-0154. 



I. Purpose and Substantive Description



(A) Authority 



The HOPE for Elderly Independence Multifamily Project Demonstration is authorized by section 803(h) of the National
Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 8012) (NAHA). Section 8 project-based certificate (PBC) assistance is governed
by section 8(d)(2)(B) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act). The Multifamily Project Demonstration differs from
the HOPE for Elderly Independence (Nationwide) Demonstration, the NOFA for which was published on July 22, 1993 (58
FR 39372), in that the Multifamily Project Demonstration is limited to one multifamily housing project in one HUD
Region and uses 
section 8 PBC assistance instead of tenant-based section 8 rental vouchers or certificates. The Project Guidelines
governing the Multifamily Project Demonstration are consistent with, but not identical to, the Program Guidelines
for the HOPE for Elderly Independence (Nationwide) Demonstration, published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 4, 1991 (56 FR 4506), and amended on May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22816). 



(B) Multifamily Project Demonstration Guidelines 



(1) Purpose and Scope 



These guidelines implement the HOPE for Elderly Independence Multifamily Project Demonstration. The purpose of
the Multifamily Project Demonstration is to test the effectiveness of using section 8 PBC assistance to assist frail
elderly persons and near-frail elderly persons to live independently in a multifamily housing project specifically
designed for occupancy by frail and near-frail elderly persons, and to have frail elderly persons reside in this housing
in sufficient proportion to achieve economies of scale in the provision of needed supportive services. 

This Multifamily Project Demonstration refers to assistance that is attached to units as ``project-based'' assistance
to distinguish this assistance from the ``tenant-based'' assistance provided by the rental voucher program under
the HOPE for Elderly Independence Nationwide Demonstration. 

With tenant-based assistance, the assisted unit is selected by the family. The HA then enters into an assistance contract,
which only covers a single unit and the specific assisted family. If the family moves out of a unit, the assistance contract
terminates. The family may move with continued assistance under the tenant-based rental voucher program, and may
find a new unit that meets program requirements. 

With project-based assistance, the HA enters into an assistance contract for a specific project to make housing assistance
payments for a specified term, provided the unit is occupied by an eligible family and the unit meets program requirements.
To fill vacant project-based units, the HA refers families from its waiting list to the project owner. Because assistance
is tied to the unit, a family that moves from the unit does not have any right to continued assistance. 

Except as otherwise expressly modified or excluded by these Guidelines, the provisions of the section 8 PBC assistance
program regulations (24 CFR part 882, subparts A, B and G apply to the project-based assistance under this Multifamily
Project Demonstration. The following sections in subpart G do not apply to project-based assistance under this demonstration:
 882.702, Additional Definitions;   882.703 and 882.704 pertaining to HA submission and HUD approval
of HA plans to implement a project-based program;  882.714(b), Fair Market Rent limitation;  882.720
(a), (b)(1), and (b)(2), HA unit selection policy; the provisions of  882.721, Rehabilitation: Initial inspection
and determination of unit eligibility, and  882.723, New construction: HA evaluation and technical processing,
relating to the HA selection of a developer/owner since the owner's proposal is part of the HA application being competitively
selected under this NOFA; and  882.740 (b) and (c), Housing Assistance Payments Contract. 



(2) Definitions 



For the purposes of this program: 



Act 

means section 803 of the National Affordable Housing Act 
(42 U.S.C. 8012). 



Activities of Daily Living (ADL) 

mean eating, dressing, bathing, grooming and household management activities as further described below: 




_

Eating: 

May need assistance with cooking, preparing or serving food, but must be able to feed self; 

_

Bathing: 

May need assistance in getting in and out of the shower or tub, but must be able to wash self; 

_

Grooming: 

May need assistance in washing hair, but must be able to take care of personal appearance; 

_

Dressing: 

Must be able to dress self, but may need occasional assistance; 

_

Home Management Activities: 

May need assistance in doing housework, grocery shopping or laundry, or getting to and from one location to another
for activities such as going to the doctor and shopping, but must be mobile.



The mobility requirement does not exclude persons in wheelchairs or those requiring mobility devices.




Each of the Activities of Daily Living noted above includes a requirement that a person must be able to perform at a specified
minimal level (e.g., to satisfy the eating ADL, the person must be able to feed him/herself). The determination of
whether a person meets this minimal level of performance must include consideration of those services that will be
performed by a person's spouse, relatives or other attendants to be provided by the individual. For example, if a person
requires assistance with cooking, preparing or serving food plus assistance in feeding him/herself, the individual
would meet the minimal performance level and thus satisfy the eating ADL, if a spouse, relative or attendant provides
assistance with feeding the person. Should such assistance become unavailable at any time, the Owner is not obligated
at any time to provide individualized services beyond those offered to the resident population in general. The Activities
of Daily Living analysis is relevant only to determine a person's eligibility for initial occupancy in a subsidized
unit and eligibility to receive supportive services paid for under the Multifamily Project Demonstration, and is
not a determination of eligibility for continued occupancy.

(3) Eligible Applicants




An eligible applicant shall consist of a unit of general local government with a population of less than 50,000, together
with an HA that currently administers a section 8 rental certificate, rental voucher or moderate rehabilitation
program within the unit of general local government, and the developer/owner of an eligible housing project located
in the unit of general local government, and which applicant meets the criteria specified in the notice of funding
availability for this demonstration. The HA shall be the lead co-applicant. 



(4) Eligible Projects



(a) 

General

. (i) An eligible project is a single multifamily housing project with at least 101 units that will be reserved for occupancy
by elderly persons. Any single multifamily housing project that meets the criteria set forth in this paragraph (4)(a)
and that is suitable for elderly persons to live independently constitutes an eligible project, including, but not
limited to congregate housing. 


(ii) At least 75 percent of the units in the project are required to be subsidized under PBC after construction or rehabilitation
and suitable for occupancy by frail elderly persons or near-frail elderly persons (either efficiency or 0-bedroom
units or 1-bedroom units). (If rehabilitation is proposed, the building must be vacant or the units to be rehabilitated
and subsidized must be occupied by eligible persons.) The maximum number of units subsidized will be determined based
on the availability of budget authority. 


(b) 

Eligible and ineligible properties: housing types. 

The PBC regulations at 24 CFR 882.709 and 882.711 apply. 


(c) 

Exemption from 15 percent limit. 

Units in the selected project shall not be subject to, and will not count when determining the 15 percent limit on project-based
assistance under an HA's section 8 rental certificate program. 




(5) Housing Assistance Payments Contract (Contract)





(a) 

Term of contract. 

The Contract shall have an initial term of up to five years, which shall commence after inspection and upon acceptance
of the completed construction or rehabilitation work by the HA, and which may not extend beyond the Multifamily Project
Demonstration Annual Contributions Contract expiration date. 


(b) 

Renewal of contract. 

The Contract is renewable for three additional five-year terms at the option of the HA and subject to the availability
of funds. 




(6) Rents 




(a) 

Initial contract rents. 

(i) Fair market rent limitation. The initial gross rent (initial contract rent plus any applicable utility allowance)
approved by HUD for any contract unit under the Multifamily Project Demonstration shall not exceed the fair market
rent limitations published in Attachment 10 of this notice.

<DOCNO> FR940405-2-00180 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940405-2-00081 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


(ii) Rent reasonableness limitation. The initial contract rent must be reasonable in relation to rents currently
being charged for units in the private unassisted market that are comparable to the newly constructed units or to the
units after they are rehabilitated, taking into account the location, size, structure type, quality, amenities,
facilities, and management and maintenance service of the unit. 



The initial contract rent may not exceed rents charged by the Owner for comparable unassisted units and may not exceed
the rents necessary to make the project feasible, as determined by HUD, after taking into account assistance from
other government sources. For an assisted unit that is subject to local rent control, comparable units are rent-controlled
units. However, for an assisted unit that is not subject to local rent control while it is assisted (regardless of whether
the unit would be subject to such control if it were not assisted), comparable units are units that are not subject to
rent-control. 



If a project is financed with a HUD-insured multifamily mortgage, then, in addition to meeting the other requirements
of this paragraph (ii), the 
initial contract rent for each assisted unit shall not exceed an amount determined by HUD to be necessary to amortize
the insured mortgage. 



(b) 

Congregate housing. 

If congregate housing is utilized, the fair market rent for each congregate housing unit shall be the same as for a 
0-bedroom unit, except that if the unit consists of two or more private rooms, the fair market rent shall be the same
as for a 1-bedroom unit. To qualify as congregate housing, there must be a central kitchen and dining facility with
food service provided by persons other than unit occupants. At least one hot meal each day must be provided in the central
facility. Each unit in congregate housing must contain a living room, a bathroom, and a refrigerator of appropriate
size, although food preparation facilities and a kitchen area are not required in the congregate housing unit. In
determining the reasonableness of the rents, consideration must be given to the presence or absence of common rather
than private cooking, dining, and sanitary facilities, and the provision of special amenities or maintenance and/or
management services. 



(c) 

Other services_exclusion from contract rent. 

The contract rent may not include the cost of providing supportive services, housekeeping or laundry services, furniture,
food, or the cost of serving food. 



(d) 

Contract rent adjustments. 

Contract rents shall be adjusted in accordance with the PBC program regulation at 24 CFR 882.715. 




(7) Owner's Submission




The Owner's submission to the HA for inclusion in the application to HUD must contain all of the information required
under the PBC program regulation at 24 CFR 882.720(b)(3). In addition, the Owner's submission must contain a statement
of sources and uses of funds for the development or rehabilitation of the project, and a certification that the assistance,
including adjustments of the contract rent, will not be more than is necessary to make the assisted activity feasible
after taking into account assistance from other government sources. 




(8) Program Participants




(a) 

Eligibility requirements. 

Participation in the Multifamily Project Demonstration is limited to frail elderly persons and near-frail elderly
persons, as these terms are defined in section I(B)(2) of this NOFA, who: 



(i) Qualify as a very low income family (whose income generally does not exceed 50 percent of the median income for the
area); and 



(ii) Are not receiving any form of Federal, State or local housing assistance at the time of expressing an interest
to the HA in participating in the Multifamily Project Demonstration. 



(b) 

Selection. 

(i) General. The HA must establish a Multifamily Project Demonstration selection preference for frail elderly persons
and near-frail elderly persons on the HA's Section 8 waiting list. If there are an insufficient number of eligible
frail elderly persons or near-frail elderly persons on the HA's waiting list who qualify for selection for the Multifamily
Project Demonstration, the HA must advertise for frail elderly or near-frail elderly applicants to be added to the
waiting list. If the HA waiting list is closed, the HA may open its list solely to frail elderly and near-frail elderly
applicants who are willing to reside in the demonstration project, and may also limit the number of applications accepted.
A frail elderly or near-frail elderly applicant who refuses the offer of a unit assisted under this demonstration
may keep his or her place on the waiting list unless the applicant was added to the waiting list in response to a solicitation
for applications from only frail elderly or near-frail elderly applicants willing to reside in the demonstration
project. 



(ii) Supportive services application. Before selecting program participants, the selected HA (with PAC assistance)
shall develop a supportive services application form for frail elderly persons to use in applying for supportive
services under the Multifamily Project Demonstration. The information in the individual's supportive services
application is crucial to the PAC's determination of the need for further physical and/or psychological evaluation
of any individual who wishes to receive the supportive services offered. The application should include: any intake
form, the ADL assessment, and any appropriate comments from both the applicant's physician and the service coordinator.




(iii) Institutionalization during participation in demonstration. If a program participant is unable to reside
in a dwelling unit in the project assisted under the Multifamily Project Demonstration, due to severe illness or accident
requiring institutionalization, the HA and the PAC, in consultation with the program participant, the participant's
family, and any involved doctors, shall determine whether there is a reasonable expectation that the individual
will be able to return home to live in the dwelling unit. If not, the HA may terminate the individual's eligibility for
the supportive services under this demonstration. The HA must adopt a policy for termination of supportive services
and informal hearing procedures. 



(iv) Termination of rental assistance and supportive services. Rental assistance shall be terminated only in accordance
with 24 CFR 882.758. If rental assistance is terminated in accordance with Section 8 requirements, the HUD-funded
portion of the supportive services component also is terminated. The program participant shall be provided an informal
hearing in accordance with the procedures in 24 CFR part 882. 



Supportive services shall be terminated if the participant: 



1. Gains physical and mental health, and is able to function without supportive services, even if only for a short time
(in which case readmission to the supportive services component_based upon reassessment to determine degree of
frailty_is acceptable).

<DOCNO> FR940405-2-00181 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940405-2-00081 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


2. Requires a higher level of care than that which can be provided under the Multifamily Project Demonstration; or,




3. Refuses to pay rent and/or supportive services fees. 



(v) Participation Agreement. Each program participant must sign a participation agreement regarding the use of
supportive services and payment of supportive service fees, as provided in section (B)(9)(e)(vi) of these Guidelines.





(9) Supportive Services




(a) 

General. 

The HA may provide the supportive services directly or subcontract with service providers in the community. The HUD
supportive services grant and the required matching funds may be used only for frail elderly program participants
who occupy the project subsidized under this Multifamily Project Demonstration. However, other supportive services
funding may be used to provide services at the project for elderly persons living at or near the project site. 



(b) 

Supportive services plan. 

(i) General. HAs applying to carry out the Multifamily Project Demonstration must develop a plan to provide or secure
supportive services appropriate to the needs of frail elderly program participants. This plan should be developed
in consultation with the Area Agency on Aging. 



(ii) Letter from area agency on aging. The plan shall include a letter from the Area Agency on Aging through which the
agency certifies that the costs of the supportive services proposed to be provided are reasonable and consistent
with the cost of other supportive service programs in the jurisdiction of the HA. The letter also must describe the
degree to which the Area Agency has been involved with the planning and proposed operations of the Multifamily Project
Demonstration. 



(iii) Estimate of cost of supportive services during demonstration term. The plan must include an estimate of the
total value of services to be provided over the life of the five-year demonstration period. 



(iv) Maintenance of existing supportive services. The plan shall provide for the maintenance of supportive services
already being provided to frail elderly persons selected to participate in the Multifamily Project Demonstration.
These services will be maintained for the time that the frail elderly person remains in the Multifamily Project Demonstration,
unless the PAC or other entity performing the assessment determines that the services are no longer needed. These
services do not qualify as matching funds. 



(c) 

Services minimally necessary to ensure independence. 

The supportive services to be provided to frail elderly program participants under the demonstration are those minimally
necessary to ensure that program participants retain their independence and avoid unnecessary or premature institutionalization.




(d) 

Purchase of additional supportive services. 

Program participants may purchase additional supportive services from the HA, subject to the agreement of the HA,
at the cost at which the HA must obtain these services, and provided that the provision of these additional supportive
services do not put an undue burden on the management and administration of the demonstration. 



(e) 

Matching funds. 

(i) 50 percent match. HUD will provide the selected HA with a supportive service grant that covers 40 percent of the
cost of the necessary supportive services. The frail elderly program participant will cover 10 percent of the cost
of the supportive services (see paragraph (vi) of this paragraph (e)). The selected HA must provide funding from other
sources sufficient to cover the remaining 50 percent of the cost of the supportive services. 


(ii) Certification of committed dollar amounts for first year. The HA must certify that funding for its portion of
the cost of the supportive services has been committed by other sources for the first year of the demonstration with
reasonable assurance that the funding for supportive services will be available during the five-year term of the
contract. The HA will be required to provide such certification annually thereafter for each year of the demonstration,
as part of the annual project/budget review. 



(iii) Sources of funds for matching contribution. In determining potential sources of matching funds for the necessary
supportive services, the HA may include: 



1. Cash (which may include funds from Federal, State and local governments, third party contributions, available
payments authorized under Medicaid for program participants, grants or subgrants of funds originating from an Area
Agency on Aging under the Older Americans Act and funds from local governments originating from either Community
Development Block Grants or Community Services Block Grants). 



2. The dollar value of supportive services provided by other agency or third party, or of staff who will work to provide
services to program participants; these services must be justified in the application to assure that they are the
services necessary to keep the frail elderly program participants independent. 



3. The dollar value of in-kind items (these are limited to 10 percent of the 50 percent matching amount), such as the
current market value of donated furniture, material, supplies, equipment and food used in the provision of supportive
services. The applicant must provide an explanation for the estimated donated value of any item listed and an explanation
of why they are necessary to keep the program participants independent. 



4. The value of volunteers to the project at a rate of $5.00 an hour. The value of PAC volunteer time cannot be counted
for any time period estimate related to initial assessment of individuals before they are accepted into the Multifamily
Project Demonstration.

<PARENT> FR940405-2-00081 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(iv) Annual documentation of matching funds. The HA shall supply such documentation of its matching supportive services
cost contribution with each annual budget review in such form as specified by HUD, and explain how any mismatches between
the services committed and those needed by the participants have been corrected. HUD will review the infusion of matching
funds annually, as part of the project/budget review. 

(v) Insufficient matching funds. If there are insufficient matching funds available to meet HUD requirements at
any point after start-up of the Multifamily Project Demonstration, or at any time during the term of the demonstration,
HUD may decrease its share of the supportive services cost in proportion to the amount by which matching funds drop
below 50 percent of total supportive services cost. This adjustment will be done in the year subsequent to the year
of the shortfall, so that the required ratio of HUD to non-HUD funds is maintained. The adjustment may be reconsidered
and canceled by HUD at such time that the HA provides sufficient matching funds to eliminate any shortfall. 

(vi) Supportive service fee payable by program participant. The HA must ensure that each program participant will
pay at least 10 percent of the cost of the services received, up to a limit of 20 percent of adjusted gross income. This
requirement may be waived by the HA in cases where a program participant does not have any adjusted gross income (income
used to determine family share of rent under the rental certificate regulations). In cases where program participants
are not required to pay a full 10 percent of the supportive service costs, 50 percent of the shortfall will be paid for
from the supportive services grant funds. The balance will be paid for by the HA from other sources. 

(f) 

Supportive services budget.

 The selected HA must submit a supportive services budget for the first year of supportive services delivery, beginning
on the date of initial occupancy of the project, and annually thereafter, on Form SF-424A, Budget Information_Non-Construction
Programs. Except when there is an unused portion of supportive services funds carried over from the previous year,
the selected HA may not budget more than 20 percent of the supportive services grant amount for any year of the five-year
demonstration. The budget for the first year normally will use less than 20 percent of the funds potentially available,
due to start-up. If this occurs in the first year or in any subsequent year, the HA may exceed the 20 percent limit on the
annual supportive services budget for the succeeding year only by that percentage which represents the amount of
unused supportive services budgeted for the preceding year. The supportive services budget submission is in addition
to the budget documents submitted in accordance with Section 8 rental assistance requirements. 



(10) Professional Assessment Committee (PAC)



(a) 

Membership.

 As provided in paragraph (b) of this section (10), a PAC is not required to be established by the HA. If established,
the PAC shall be composed of from three-to-seven members appointed by the HA, at least one of which is a qualified medical
professional (e.g., a physician or registered nurse). The service coordinator must be on the PAC. Other members also
must be professionally qualified to appraise the functional abilities of frail elderly persons or near-frail elderly
persons in relation to the performance of the normal activities of daily living. The HA (e.g., the service coordinator)
may refer to the PAC those elderly applicants, in accordance with the HA's approved program participation selection
process, who are interested in applying for the Multifamily Project Demonstration and have been screened for degree
of frailty or near-frailty. 

(b) 

Alternative to formation of PAC.

 The selected HA may develop an agreement with community agencies to perform frailty and near-frailty assessments
as an alternative to performing its own screening for frailty and near-frailty and setting up its own PAC. Such an agreement
would include a letter of understanding between the HA and the assessment center stating the roles, responsibilities
and relationship of each to each other. The letter must be signed by the executive officer(s) of both organizations.
This letter must be included in the HA's application to HUD. Such local agencies may include, but are not limited to:
Geriatric Assessment Centers, Public Health and Veterans Administration facilities, County Health Departments,
or similar private agencies. 

(c) 

Assessment of frailty and near-frailty.

 The PAC (or a community agency with which the HA has a written agreement to perform assessments) will assess the degree
of frailty and near-frailty of elderly persons applying for the Multifamily Project Demonstration, referred to
the PAC (or community agency) by the HA. 

(d) 

General operating procedures.

 A PAC must establish operating procedures and establish case files for each frail elderly person and near-frail elderly
person. The PAC must operate according to the following guidelines: 

(i) Recommend to the service coordinator eligibility for entrance to, or transition out of, if applicable, the Multifamily
Project Demonstration. 

(ii) Authorize or perform a medical evaluation, if necessary. This evaluation may be performed by a PAC medical professional,
or the applicant to the Multifamily Project Demonstration may be referred to another agency in the community that
will perform the evaluation without charge. 

(iii) Recommend, and update as necessary, a supportive services plan for each frail elderly person. 

(iv) Be furnished with and retain information in files concerning program participants. The files should contain
such information and be maintained in such form that HUD shall require. 

(v) Present written evaluations to the HA. 

(vi) Allow for program participants to appeal decisions related to entrance to, degree of participation needed,
and transition out of the Multifamily Project Demonstration. 

(e) 

Specific operating procedures.

 In addition to the above described general operating procedures, the PAC must:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940405-2-00183 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940405-2-00081 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(i) Perform a formal assessment of each potential program participant's deficiencies in performing the ADLs. This
assessment shall be based upon the screening done by the service coordinator, and shall include a review of the adequacy
of the informal support network (i.e., family and friends available to the potential participant to assist in meeting
the ADL needs of that individual). 

(ii) Clarify that any program participant needs assistance in at least one ADL. 

(iii) Perform a regular reassessment and updating of the supportive services plan of all frail elderly participants.


(iv) Replace any member of the PAC within 30 days after such member resigns. A PAC should not perform formal assessments
if its membership drops below three, or if the qualified medical professional leaves the PAC and has yet to be replaced
by the HA. 

(v) Notify the HA and program participants of any proposed modifications to PAC procedures and provide these parties
with a process and reasonable time period on which to review and comment, prior to adoption. 

(vi) Provide assurance of nondiscrimination in the selection of Multifamily Project Demonstration participants,
with respect to race, religion, color, sex, national origin or type of disability. 

(vii) Provide complete confidentiality of information related to any individual examined, in accordance with the
Privacy Act of 1974. 

(viii) In addition to the foregoing, the PAC procedures should ensure that any frail elderly person has the option
of refusing offered services and requesting other supportive services as part of the case planning process. In the
case of refusal of services, the PAC must determine the person's continued ability to live independently without
the recommended service, with this determination being a consideration for the individual's entering into/remaining
in the Multifamily Project Demonstration. In situations where an individual requests additional service(s), not
initially recommended by the PAC, the PAC must make a determination of whether this request is legitimately a needs-based
service which can be covered under the Multifamily Project Demonstration supportive services grant. 

(f) 

Transition from multifamily project demonstration.

 The HA/PAC must develop procedures for providing for a program participant's transition out of the Multifamily Project
Demonstration to another setting. Such a transition is based upon the degree of supportive services needed by that
individual to continue to live independently. A program participant may be transitioned out of the Multifamily Project
Demonstration under the following circumstances. 

(i) Requires a higher level of care than that which can be provided under the Multifamily Project Demonstration; or,


(ii) Refuses to pay rent and/or supportive services fees. 



(11) Service Coordinator and Case Management



(a) 

General.

 A full-time service coordinator should be able to serve 
about 50-70 program participants. The service coordinator may be hired directly by the HA or contracted through
a case management agency on a fee-for-service basis. If the service coordinator is a contracted-out function, the
service coordinator may not work for the service provider which will provide supportive services to the HA for the
Multifamily Project Demonstration. 

(b) 

Service coordinator contract.

 If the selected HA proposes to contract out to a third-party agency for a service coordinator, the contract must include
provisions containing, at a minimum: Beginning and end dates of the contract; number and responsibilities of staff
hired; rates of pay/costs of services to be provided; location of office(s) and an agreement to provide HUD access
to the files; other documentation pertinent to the Multifamily Project Demonstration; and other items necessary
to conform to 24 CFR 85.36 (procurement requirements for Federal grants). Any contract awarded under this subsection
must conform to the policies and procedures stated at 24 CFR 85.36. 
(c) 

Qualifications of service coordinator.

 A service coordinator's work and educational experiences should meet the following minimum guidelines: 

(i) A Bachelor of Social Work or degree in a related field such as gerontology, psychology or counseling. An HA may propose
justification for hiring a person without a degree. 

(ii) Two to three years of experience in social services delivery with senior citizens or demonstrated working knowledge
of supportive services and other resources for senior citizens in the jurisdiction where the Multifamily Project
Demonstration is to be located. 

(iii) Ability to advocate, problem-solve and provide results for the elderly served. 

(iv) Demonstrated writing and organizational skills. 

(d) 

Functions of the service coordinator.

 The functions of the service coordinator include the following: 

(i) To provide general case management and referral services to all applicants for the Multifamily Project Demonstration.
This involves intake screening upon referral of those income eligible frail elderly persons and near-frail elderly
persons from the HA, and preliminary assessment of frailty and near-frailty, using a commonly accepted assessment
tool. The service coordinator then will refer to the PAC those individuals who appear eligible for the Multifamily
Project Demonstration. 

(ii) To establish linkages and professional relationships with all agencies and service providers in the community;
develops a directory of providers for use by demonstration program staff and program participants. 

(iii) To complete, for the PAC, all paperwork necessary for the assessment, referral, case monitoring and reassessment
processes; 

(iv) To implement the case plan developed by the PAC and agreed to by the program participant.

(v) To maintain necessary case files on each program participant, containing such information and kept in such form
as HUD shall require, and to provide files to PAC members upon request, in connection with PAC duties. 
(vi) To refer program participants to service providers in the community, or those of the HA. 
(vii) To monitor the ongoing provision of services from community agencies and to keep the PAC and the agency providing
the supportive service informed of the progress of the individual. If needed, the service coordinator may request
reassessment of the individual by the PAC at intervals less than that stipulated in PAC operating procedures. 
(viii) To educate program participants on such issues as application procedures, service availability, client
rights. 
(ix) To establish volunteer support programs with service organizations in the community. 
(x) To assist the program participant to build informal support networks with neighbors, friends and family. 
(xi) To educate other HA management staff on issues related to ``aging-in-place'' and services coordination. 


(12) Compliance with Nondiscrimination, Equal Opportunity and Other Federal Requirements 


The selected HA must comply with all applicable nondiscrimination, equal opportunity, affirmative outreach requirements,
and other Federal requirements contained in 24 CFR part 882. 


II. Application Process 


(A) Application Submission Deadline 


Applications must be received in the HUD Field Office on July 5, 1994 by 4:30 p.m. local time. The application deadline
is firm as to date and hour. In the interest of fairness to all competing applicants, HUD will treat as ineligible for
consideration any application that is not received on or before the application deadline. Applicants should take
this practice into account and make early submission of their materials to avoid any risk of loss of eligibility brought
about by unanticipated delays or other delivery-related problems. HUD will not accept applications which are sent
via facsimile (FAX) transmission. 


(B) Threshold Approvable Applications 


Only those applications that meet the threshold criteria set forth in section II(C) of this NOFA will be considered
for rating and ranking under section II(D). Applications that meet the threshold criteria will be reviewed, rated
and ranked by the Field Office using the selection criteria and point assignments set forth in section II(D) of this
NOFA. All scored applications and rating sheets in each Field Office will be sent to the Regional Public Housing Director
for Region I. 
In order to ensure that rating is consistent among the Field Offices, the Office of Public Housing for Region I will
review and may re-rate these applications using the criteria in the NOFA. The highest rated application will be selected
for technical processing by the HUD Field Office (i.e., determination of contract rents; environmental and historic
preservation reviews under 24 CFR part 50; review of previous participation of the principals of the developer/owner;
for projects using low income housing tax credits, subsidy layering review; and for new construction projects, intergovernmental
